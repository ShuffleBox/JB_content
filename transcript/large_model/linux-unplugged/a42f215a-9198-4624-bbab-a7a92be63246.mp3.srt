1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Got an email saying that my Pine phone has shipped.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,080
What about you Cheesy?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,280
Oh yeah, I got that email.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,560
Super excited.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,880
Pine noticed you weren't on the show last week,

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
and they're like, what could we do

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,440
to get Chees back on the air?

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,080
What they said is, we'll just ship the Pine phone.

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,160
That's pretty amazing, man.

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,120
Yeah, I mean, that's a good call.

11
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,800
They got me back here.

12
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
It's the Braveheart edition,

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,080
so this is going to be the rougher one.

14
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,380
But they're shipping out, and I don't know,

15
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,120
I guess maybe I'll have mine in the next week or so.

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,640
We should come up with some fun projects in house with,

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,120
something, you know, play around.

18
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
We gotta put it through its paces.

19
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,960
Right?

20
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
Mm-hmm.

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
We gotta demand the utmost performance.

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
This thing has to be completely production, oh wait.

23
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,800
It's our responsibility to the community.

24
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Actually, we just want to play around.

25
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,240
Yeah, I'm a little jealous.

26
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Hello friends, welcome into Lytics Unplugged.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,240
My name is Chris.

28
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
My name is Wes.

29
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,520
Wes, we have quite the fun episode today,

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,200
because for more than a few weeks,

31
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,080
we've had some really great hardware in house.

32
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,680
We've been kicking it around, benchmarking it,

33
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,160
and just recently put it through some upgrade paces.

34
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,160
So we'll tell you about our thoughts on the new Dell XPS 13.

35
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,480
Well, new-ish.

36
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,880
More on that too.

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
And I'm not alone in saying that we have so much to get to.

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
So to help me say it,

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to let Alex and Chee say it.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
Hey guys, say something great about the show today.

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a big, big, big, big show.

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,240
Yeah, that's what I usually go with.

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
Something great about the show today.

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
Oh, Alex.

45
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Dang it.

46
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
I mean, I thought that was funny.

47
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
Making this.

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm sorry if it wasn't, but I don't care.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,080
Okay, good enough.

50
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
Accepted.

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
You know, I mean, I'll give you a check mark for effort,

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,040
but I'm not giving it much more than that.

53
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,360
And of course, really,

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,920
the thing that we can rely on today is the Mumble Room.

55
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
We have a huge virtual lug.

56
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

57
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
Hello.

58
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Hello.

59
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Good evening.

60
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,920
The deafening cries of the Mumble Room.

61
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,800
That's massive in there.

62
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
I mean, I don't know.

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,520
It doesn't really come across as like super massive,

64
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,960
but there's 14 on air.

65
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,320
21 people total just hanging out in the Mumble streaming.

66
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,240
It's the place to be.

67
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,760
It's, you know, these Tuesdays

68
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,360
are really kind of a lot of fun because we stream live.

69
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
We're doing a double recording.

70
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,840
We won't be live next week.

71
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
And so we get to hang out for a couple of hours,

72
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,000
talk Linux,

73
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,840
or sometimes the conversations go in weird directions.

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,720
I'll admit that's true for the pre-show.

75
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
And that's why you want to show up live.

76
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,120
But as always, we have some community news to get into,

77
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,040
some really interesting stuff,

78
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,520
really kind of important community news this week.

79
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,160
There's two things that I think are worth chewing on this week.

80
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,440
And one of them is when a community gets left out.

81
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,760
It's both good news and bad news in this case.

82
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,240
Fedora Core OS has come out of preview

83
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
and they've announced that it is available for general use.

84
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,120
That's great.

85
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,560
But it also means there's a community of users,

86
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,640
the ones that ran the Core OS Container Linux

87
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
that are left out.

88
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,840
They were told they should migrate

89
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
to the new Fedora Core OS.

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,960
However, documentation is not yet provided

91
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
to actually make that migration possible.

92
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Sometimes these things happen.

93
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,640
And as all great things in open source,

94
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,600
there's a fork and a community has spun up

95
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,880
around flat car Container Linux,

96
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
which is a direct compatible continuation

97
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,960
of Container Linux, a new community forms.

98
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,040
But what are the admins that are running this

99
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
in production left to do?

100
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,080
They have to decide to either go

101
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,520
with a non-compatible conversion to Fedora Core OS.

102
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,600
Right, which will require a bunch of manual interventions.

103
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Or use this community offshoot fork

104
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,040
of a product that's no longer around.

105
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
It's a lot to maintain.

106
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
And these are production grade systems.

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,640
If you'll recall, one of the great advantages

108
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,160
of Container Linux was centralized configuration

109
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,000
across all your different machines using etcd

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,520
and automatic OS updates.

111
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,280
Isn't the irony here that the distribution

112
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,880
that provided seamless automatic OS updates has gone away

113
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,800
and now you are faced with a completely incompatible upgrade?

114
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
Isn't there some rich irony to that?

115
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,720
Oh, yeah.

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,280
And I think the team at Fedora understands that too.

117
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,240
They've got some sections here in the announcements

118
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
like how do I migrate?

119
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
What do I have to do?

120
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
And what are the stability guarantees?

121
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,760
And unfortunately, kind of just due to the way Fedora works,

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
they're not in the same ballpark.

123
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,720
And there's something else that's embedded in this story.

124
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,240
This has all really been pitched as a positive thing

125
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,200
because it's all been really about what's happening

126
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,600
with Core OS when it goes over to Red Hat

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
after the acquisition.

128
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Then the story became what happens with Fedora

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,840
and their atomic version versus Core OS.

130
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
And oh, isn't it funny that now it's Fedora Core again?

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
Like all of this has been talked about a lot

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
and then going from a preview

133
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
to a general availability release

134
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,360
and mastering images for AWS and whatnot

135
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,520
has been all talked about fairly positively.

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
But it sort of whitewashes over the reality

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
of users that are left behind in a transition like this.

138
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,960
And it particularly is stinging

139
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
when it's enterprise grade software.

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,560
Right, you've been paying for it

141
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,600
and you're using container Linux.

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
They get bought and now you have to change how you're,

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
what infrastructure is running your business.

144
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,840
Does this just sort of happen?

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
Is this the way you roll the dice in the tech industry?

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,920
Sometimes you bet on something that goes away

147
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,640
and that's just how it rolls.

148
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,800
Or is there something different we could be doing here?

149
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Well, I don't know about the,

150
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
is there something different we could be doing?

151
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,840
I think we need to put a bunch of smart people

152
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,280
in the same room and solve that one.

153
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,000
But it feels like this is just the reality

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,640
of the tech industry.

155
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,000
Like if you look at open source projects,

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
that's certainly true.

157
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,960
But even if you look at the proprietary stuff

158
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,200
and corporations, you know, they change all the time.

159
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,680
So it's almost like you have to expect

160
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,320
that the landscape is just always unsure.

161
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,440
Are always changing.

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,160
Maybe that's the thing you can count on.

163
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,120
And so I don't know.

164
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,240
I wish I had a better answer, I guess.

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,640
In all the history of software, computers and so forth,

166
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,680
have we ever really had any true stability, really?

167
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I mean, so this is kind of expected

168
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,520
in this industry entirely.

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,200
I mean, I'm not an IT specialist,

170
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,840
but dealing with the different

171
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,440
product lifecycle management databases that I've used

172
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,000
in my time at my employer,

173
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
things just don't stay static.

174
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,080
So there's always gonna be that pain of an upgrade.

175
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,680
There's always gonna be that pain of a change of a vendor.

176
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,440
So this is just par for the course.

177
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,600
This is just the business we live in.

178
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Essentially comes with the territory, in other words.

179
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,520
And I can't really disagree with that.

180
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,320
And you could even make the argument

181
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,680
that the platforms and areas that have remained

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
the most stable in the terms of changes and development

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,560
also come with some of the highest risk profiles.

184
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Like I'm thinking of x86 and Intel's architecture.

185
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,800
It's been very consistent for a long time,

186
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,760
but it's also now strapped with a legacy

187
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,600
of baggage and vulnerabilities, same with Windows.

188
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,760
So there's downsides to it as well to not doing this change.

189
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Yeah, that's true.

190
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,960
And I mean, all these workloads are containerized, right?

191
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,880
So you still have system and infrastructure configurations

192
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
you need to change, but hopefully your applications

193
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
can migrate a little bit easier.

194
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,840
Absolutely, Wes, I totally agree.

195
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,440
And I think if you look at Red Hat's strategy right now,

196
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,920
OpenShift is their primary future kind of direction, right?

197
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,800
And obviously Rel8's very important,

198
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,680
but if you look at it from the enterprise adoption

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,760
perspective of what can we start getting more people

200
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,360
excited in, what can we start selling to people,

201
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
all that kind of stuff that Red Hat unfortunately

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,840
do to pay the bills, you know, selling stuff.

203
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
That's gotta come from somewhere.

204
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,920
And Fedora CoreOS is a key part of that, you know,

205
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
without that kind of upstream route

206
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,760
to feed into the CoreOS that is, you know,

207
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Red Hat CoreOS that ships with OpenShift.

208
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
You know, where are you gonna get

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,720
that kind of upstream feed from?

210
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
So I think it's a necessary evil.

211
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,840
You can't really have progress without change,

212
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,240
as Tiger Wolf says in the IRC.

213
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,840
Thank you, Alex, I appreciate that perspective.

214
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,520
Bybit, and I wanted to give you a chance to jump in on this.

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Yeah, so we have a lot of change in technologies,

216
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,920
and also if you look at Google, they create a technology,

217
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,560
fuse it with others, and some technologies fall away.

218
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,120
And that kind of forces us to innovate and move forward.

219
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,400
So it is a kind of process and progress.

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
Good point, thank you.

221
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,920
All right, I don't really know.

222
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,040
I think I feel better.

223
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,840
It was a good conversation, and I'm sure the people

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
that are running Container Linux from CoreOS,

225
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
which is very, there's a lot of different names now,

226
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm sure they'll find a path forward.

227
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,680
I mean, it's still a good sort of open source moment, right?

228
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,440
Like you're right, this can happen to proprietary software.

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,760
Things always change.

230
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
You don't get free support for your products,

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
but you do get the code, and that means, right?

232
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
We can continue on, lots of stuff can happen,

233
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,280
and you can still keep running yourself.

234
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,920
And there's that whole, the way we communicate about it,

235
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,400
like this whole aspect of the fact

236
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,560
that there's all of these users getting left behind

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
and gets left out of the coverage today

238
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,840
because of the way coverage is engineered

239
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,680
and done in this space.

240
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
And as somebody who's in the space life,

241
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
that's the aspect of the story

242
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
that I find extremely fascinating.

243
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,320
But we move on because there's a thought-provoking post

244
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,680
over on Tobias Bernard's GNOME blog.

245
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,200
And he posts over there semi-frequently

246
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,680
talking about different aspects related to the future

247
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,760
and present of GNOME Shell development.

248
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,320
And he wrote a post titled, Doing Things That Scale.

249
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,840
And it starts with an area

250
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,360
that kind of rings really true to me,

251
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,280
and I wanted to share it with you

252
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,400
and kick it back and forth with Wes.

253
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,600
He starts, there was a point in my life when I ran Arch.

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
I had an elaborate personalized terminal prompt

255
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,680
and my own custom icon theme.

256
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
I stopped doing all of these things at various points

257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,520
for various different reasons,

258
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
but underlying them all is a general feeling

259
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
that it's taken me some time to figure out

260
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,560
how to particularly articulate.

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I no longer want to invest time in things that don't scale.

262
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
We will link to the full blog post

263
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,120
because we're only gonna cut through

264
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,400
some of the highlights here.

265
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,720
But he continues, not only is it highly wasteful

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,520
for me to come up with a custom solution to every problem,

267
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,000
but in most cases, those solutions would be worse

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,840
than the ones developed in collaboration with others.

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,160
It also means nobody will help maintain the solutions

270
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,720
in the long run.

271
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,480
So I'll be stuck with extra work forever.

272
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
Conversely, things that scale.

273
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
A few examples that he cites

274
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,800
is keeping things fairly simple.

275
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
He says, until recently,

276
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,960
I always set a custom monospace font

277
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,400
in my editor and terminal when setting up a new machine.

278
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
At some point though, I realized I wouldn't have to do that

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,960
if the default was just nicer, so I just opened an issue.

280
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,840
A discussion ensued and a better default was agreed upon

281
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,520
and voila, my problem was solved.

282
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,600
So far, this really rings true for me.

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,880
It resonates, it ringzonates for me, Wes.

284
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Does it ringzonate for you?

285
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
Yeah, you know, I certainly agree

286
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,520
that sometimes the defaults are the reason

287
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,680
that you need to go spend some more time and customize.

288
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
Now, I think you can do both in some of this, right?

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,760
Like you can go try to get a better default,

290
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,480
but even if the font is better,

291
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
you might still prefer your own custom font.

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,720
And fonts seem like the least applicable part of this.

293
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Like, yes, we should do that.

294
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,520
But I do think the idea of,

295
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
if you want your tools to be better,

296
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
if you can see how those could be better, that's valuable.

297
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
That's worth contributing

298
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,440
because you can be a developer working on a project

299
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,000
that you might not know what the users think is best for them.

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,720
And to that point, you remember recently,

301
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,040
we did that Plasma live stream

302
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,360
where we went through how I customized the Plasma desktop

303
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,080
and Jonathan Riddle and a few others

304
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,440
from the Plasma team watched it.

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
They're like, you know, we're taking some notes.

306
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
These might just be some defaults we tweaked for you.

307
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
We didn't really think that, you know, that's a good idea.

308
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,240
That is, first of all, rare and incredible,

309
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,360
but it is truly, to your point,

310
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
like they're different use cases.

311
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,480
They have different uses.

312
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
They use it differently.

313
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,840
They can't necessarily articulate in their mind

314
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,400
all the different various ways

315
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,480
that most people might want to use it.

316
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,120
And so seeing different use cases and,

317
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
oh, that does make sense.

318
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
It gives them an opportunity.

319
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Where things kind of go off the rails here with me

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
is the next part of the post here.

321
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,800
Because I think it really, for me, touches on that nerve.

322
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,120
I push back on a few fundamental assumptions

323
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,920
of the rest of the Linux community.

324
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,400
And I feel like I am on an island onto myself

325
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,040
in which I say something

326
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
and people just think I'm a nutter.

327
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,040
And number one is I don't think Linux is for everyone.

328
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,080
Full front, I don't think it's necessarily great

329
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,880
for everyone to use Linux.

330
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,640
Not right now, not yet.

331
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,480
Number two, and quite frankly, is I don't think

332
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,640
what's hurting and holding Linux back is a marketing issue.

333
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,880
It's so much bigger than that.

334
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,560
It's so much bigger than that.

335
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,520
It comes down to corporate structures.

336
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,560
It comes down to agreements.

337
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,640
It comes down to ecosystems.

338
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,280
It comes down to market demand

339
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,320
and consumer willingness to switch.

340
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
It's a massive issue.

341
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
And when you take it all in,

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
when you really think about it,

343
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,960
when you go have yourself a hike and you think about it,

344
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,880
you realize there is a narrow niche.

345
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,360
Thankfully and amazingly, that niche,

346
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,920
and I've witnessed it and you've witnessed it,

347
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,880
has expanded over the last few years.

348
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,560
Incredibly now, just at an even more

349
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,080
accelerated rate than ever.

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,760
But there's a narrow niche of people

351
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,680
that are gonna have a truly successful transition to Linux.

352
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,880
We're joking ourselves if we think Windows 7 users

353
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,120
are all switching to Linux.

354
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Maybe some of them, some in the engineering and science

355
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,840
and some in the engineering and scientific fields, I bet.

356
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,600
So when I see that we should fundamentally limit

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
the technical capabilities of our systems

358
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,120
so that way they're, quote, scalable

359
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,880
and easier for average people to maintain,

360
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,040
I kind of put my hand up and go,

361
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,320
can we talk about this for a moment?

362
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Because some of these make a lot of sense,

363
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
but some of them don't.

364
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,720
Like dropping separate home partitions,

365
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
dropping dot files,

366
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,640
dropping multiple Firefox profiles,

367
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,240
dropping encryption,

368
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,200
dropping email backups.

369
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
These kinds of things I appreciate

370
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,480
are hard for users to manage,

371
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,680
but I think my fundamental argument would be

372
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,320
the niche that Linux is actually really applicable to,

373
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
those are nice features to have.

374
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,200
That user base does care about those things.

375
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,840
Because I picture it to be software developers,

376
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,600
engineers, geeks, hobbyists, creatives,

377
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
people who tend to really care

378
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,880
about the state of their tools,

379
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,080
because that's a tool to do a job.

380
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,560
And I just don't agree with limiting the system

381
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,880
to make it appealing to a fantasy user base

382
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,680
that you can't even articulate.

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,640
It's a nebulous concept.

384
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,840
The new user to Linux is a nebulous concept

385
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,560
that each one of us has a version of in our heads.

386
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
I think you are hitting here.

387
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,960
I mean, there's a lot that's going unspoken.

388
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,720
One, the definition of scale

389
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,440
that we're using for this conversation.

390
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,640
And you're right, I think it's easy to take this

391
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,400
as an intent to limit.

392
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,640
And that's where it gets really tricky

393
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,360
because as existing Linux users,

394
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,680
we love that configuration, right?

395
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,120
We love the ability to automate, to interface,

396
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,240
to customize our solutions, to fit our need,

397
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,960
because it's a tool we're heavily invested in.

398
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, how many times have you heard the mantra,

399
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,600
it's so flexible?

400
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
Right.

401
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
And I think what this article is trying to point out

402
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
is that-

403
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
There's too much of that.

404
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,360
There's too much of that.

405
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,640
And where it's tricky is you try to get both, right?

406
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,240
We've all had tools where you're like,

407
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
I wish that there was an escape hatch in this tool

408
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
because it works 80% of the time,

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,480
but I need to make one little change.

410
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
And the reverse is also true,

411
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,280
where you're like, I could use Handbrake

412
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,880
or I could use FFmpeg.

413
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,080
One, maybe I don't have all the options I want,

414
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
and the other, I have to go cobble together

415
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,880
my whole bespoke custom solution.

416
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
It's hard to figure out what's in the middle of there

417
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
that works for both of those use cases.

418
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,240
I'll tell you what fits in the middle, Wes.

419
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,040
And that's, I know this is a Linux podcast

420
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,080
and I'm almost afraid to say it, but Mac OS.

421
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,240
You know, that fits in the middle for a lot of people.

422
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,720
It has a decent terminal.

423
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,800
It can run the Adobe suite.

424
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
You've heard all these arguments before.

425
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,240
It's nothing-

426
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
It's not Windows.

427
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah, there's nothing revolutionary

428
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,880
in what I'm saying here.

429
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,160
It's just, it just gets the job done.

430
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,000
You're actually kind of making

431
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,560
what my next point was going to be,

432
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,440
is I feel like if we go too far in this direction,

433
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
we're Mac-ifying the Linux desktop

434
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,160
to a degree that just makes us a also brand to Mac OS.

435
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,920
I wouldn't necessarily object to that,

436
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,160
but then I suppose you could argue

437
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,840
that that's what elementary OS is.

438
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,360
Or at least attempting to replicate

439
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,240
some of the successful aspects of what makes the Mac work.

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,240
But I think if you limit some of this,

441
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,760
what you really are left with is idealism,

442
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,600
people who want to use the software for moral reasons,

443
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,040
and people who would be running

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,360
their own custom desktop environments

445
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,640
that don't have anything to do with this whole stack.

446
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,080
But from like a market competitive analysis,

447
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,800
say I'm, I was just watching,

448
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,720
I can't remember his name right now,

449
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,360
maybe somebody in the Mumble or the chat remembers,

450
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,800
but a YouTuber just posted, oh no, surprise,

451
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,800
a very good video where he built a Pop OS workstation

452
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,440
to run DaVinci Resolve.

453
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,920
And he compared it to a Hackintosh and Windows

454
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,680
and the new Mac Pro, because he has one of those as well.

455
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,840
So I actually found it right around, right at my alley,

456
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,320
because this is my head-to-head kind of battle.

457
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,520
And he clearly was new to Linux,

458
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,440
clearly new to the whole system,

459
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,760
but figured out his way after looking at different options

460
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,960
of getting to Pop OS and then getting a way

461
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,720
to convert the RPM to a deb

462
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,280
so he could install DaVinci and get it all working.

463
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,880
He even got the hardware proprietary dongle stuff set up

464
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,800
and had very positive things to say about it.

465
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,640
Just after watching that, I looked at it and thought,

466
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
there's a real market here for somebody

467
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
who wants to build a custom system

468
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,280
with a set amount of hardware that they need,

469
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,600
maybe it's disk, maybe it's GPU,

470
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,680
and they have a budget and it's less than $35,000,

471
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,000
it really worked for him.

472
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440
And he liked some of the power,

473
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,160
like Gnome Shell was really hitting that sweet spot for him

474
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,840
because it wasn't too complicated,

475
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,440
but he could tell it gave him more

476
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
than what he got from the Mac.

477
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,680
Right, that's it.

478
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,080
That's kind of the best case that we could hope for.

479
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,680
And I think that's maybe some of the spirit

480
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
that this article is intending,

481
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
that better defaults,

482
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,280
maybe not focusing on the limiting part,

483
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,200
but better defaults can help new users and existing users.

484
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
So sometimes I just need to test the latest Fedora out

485
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,880
and if Gnome looks great,

486
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
that means I don't have to change anything.

487
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,920
Would you agree that it's probably never actually

488
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,440
going to be possible to target the quote, new users,

489
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,800
unquote, because like, if you think about it,

490
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
everyone kind of has different expectations

491
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,240
coming into something.

492
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,360
So whether that's someone

493
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,160
who is fairly technologically savvy

494
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,800
or, you know, grandma down the street,

495
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,240
I feel like it's really hard to define

496
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,600
what the perfect situation is

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,240
for the quote unquote, new user.

498
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,680
I could see two potential types of new users.

499
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,400
I should probably address this.

500
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
So thank you for asking

501
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
because I don't want to make it sound like I'm saying blah,

502
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,080
don't make Linux for any users

503
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,800
because we have to keep expanding that niche.

504
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
We have to keep marching forward.

505
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
And the only way to get there is by people working on it.

506
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,800
It's just, we don't want to sacrifice

507
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,040
what makes it so great for the thousands

508
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,480
and millions of people's pulling in right now.

509
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
You know, we're about to talk about the XPS 13.

510
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Dell is very intentional in their targeting

511
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,520
of the developer market with the Sputnik.

512
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,560
And I think that's a clear strategy

513
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,600
that's working for them.

514
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,480
And they didn't just go for like new users.

515
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,240
They didn't go for a best buy blitz.

516
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,360
They just focused on developers

517
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,760
with a low key marketing campaign.

518
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,120
And I think that's telling.

519
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
And maybe you could see in 10 years,

520
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,560
they do have something that's on a best buy shelf

521
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,240
because it has, that niche has expanded over time.

522
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,440
So that's one type of user,

523
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
just as the niche expands, it'll pull them in.

524
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
I think the other type is,

525
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,520
and I'm sure a lot of people listening have done this,

526
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,440
family members, friends, associates, whatever,

527
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
where you set them up a Linux system

528
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,600
and you just kind of check in on it for them

529
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,480
from time to time.

530
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
Like my son, famously,

531
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,280
I talk about it all the time on the show.

532
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
My son has been running Linux for like five years now

533
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,840
and it's no big deal at all.

534
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,080
In fact, I very rarely even,

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
he mostly just does the updates and all of that.

536
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,080
And I've done it with family members in the past

537
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
for a few years or more.

538
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,000
And typically I'll just pick something that is reliable

539
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,880
and I just can do updates every three to six months

540
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
when I see them.

541
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,560
Or most districts now just say,

542
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,600
hey, you need to do an update

543
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,240
and I've just told them, go ahead and do them.

544
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,200
And it works.

545
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,040
And it works.

546
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,120
And with a little bit of help,

547
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,360
with a little bit of management,

548
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,120
and of course there's the corporate user

549
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,760
where they are just given a workstation

550
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
and they could be new users to it.

551
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,400
So we still need to make it usable.

552
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm not advocating for not making it usable.

553
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm just advocating for being realistic

554
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,320
about who we're appealing to as just a direct product.

555
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,440
And to be conscious as we change, as we must,

556
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,040
to keep some respect for the culture that we've had.

557
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,880
Yeah, and those that are advocating that

558
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,800
have to also be willing to compromise on those positions

559
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,160
as things change.

560
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,000
Very true.

561
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,120
And I think that's something to keep in mind too.

562
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
It's not a call to arms.

563
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,560
It's a call to further conversation.

564
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,440
How about that?

565
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,680
Jeez, that's just, they should take that.

566
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,840
They should just take that and run with it.

567
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
So I will put a link to that YouTube video

568
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
because while we were talking, I did find it.

569
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,520
And I just think it was super great.

570
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,440
I had been watching this guy for a little bit

571
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,680
because I liked his style.

572
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,440
And then to see that video drop, I was like,

573
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,720
wow, that's awesome.

574
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,600
And it's so cool because he didn't even know

575
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,320
to position it as Linux e-clickbait

576
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
because he's not a Linux guy.

577
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,640
Of course.

578
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
And so I didn't even really know for sure

579
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,200
it was a Linux video.

580
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
And then I'm like, oh man, he could have totally titled

581
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,960
this differently if he knew what he was doing.

582
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Like the clickbait voice that's sometimes

583
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
in the back of my head.

584
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,840
Of course.

585
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,080
I think whenever we were talking about Linux and the user

586
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,880
space and making it easier for entry level users

587
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,760
or maybe that person that's an IT professional who's always

588
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,040
been in a Microsoft Windows environment switching over

589
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,520
to Linux and things like that, I think one of the things

590
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,600
that we really have to consider too

591
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,760
is that Linux is really the kernel.

592
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
And then the user space below that

593
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,200
is ours to do with what we want.

594
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,080
So different distros can target that different ways.

595
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,840
They can make a very user friendly entry level kind

596
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,880
of user.

597
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,280
Like Chrome OS, for example.

598
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,360
Exactly.

599
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,480
Or you can make it as deep as you want.

600
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
You can arch it up.

601
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,840
You can Linux from scratch.

602
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,120
So I don't think there's one particular, like you said,

603
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
I think there's this fantasy user that they're

604
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,600
kind of perceiving is going to move into the Linux space.

605
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,820
And unlike all of these other available operating systems

606
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:08,760
like Mac OS or Windows, it's not like anyone has a stand up

607
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,440
and says, hey, UI, UX developers,

608
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,240
let's target this for Linux.

609
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
You have distributions that do that.

610
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,440
Elementary has done a great job with it.

611
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,000
Fedora has done a fantastic job with it.

612
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,040
But that same conversation is going

613
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,080
to be completely different if that stand up was

614
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,320
with the Arch developers or the Manjaro developers.

615
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,000
They're going to look at that completely

616
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,460
different than the way the normal layman would.

617
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,920
I think your point's well made too that the eventual new user

618
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,600
product will be something that is assembled using Linux

619
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,560
but is not likely just a raw ISO that has been flashed

620
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,120
to a thumb drive and then thrown on an x86 compatible or ARM

621
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
compatible system.

622
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,520
It's going to be your Chromebook.

623
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,700
It's going to be something that's packaged up and ready

624
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,200
to go.

625
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
Or I mean, maybe it'll be, who knows?

626
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,320
I'd love to see this.

627
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,880
I'd love to see just vanilla Linux systems on good hardware,

628
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,560
especially with some of the improvements

629
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,480
we see coming to the Ubuntu desktop.

630
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
The next update makes it look very pro.

631
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,920
We have Ubuntu 2004 installed on the XPS 13.

632
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,940
We wanted to spend the last couple of days

633
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,520
on the latest Ubuntu to see what it's like on this XPS 13.

634
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,720
And one of the things that has come out

635
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,280
of a recent get together by the canonical folk,

636
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,360
like our buddies Wimpy and Popy, is a really nice new theme.

637
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,520
So you remember Yaru, right?

638
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Of course.

639
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
I think it's been the default since 1810.

640
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,760
Right.

641
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,180
And now it's getting a big update in 2004.

642
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,360
And we got it installed on the XPS 13.

643
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,720
And it's very gorgeous.

644
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,560
I think it might be my favorite theme, specifically

645
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,880
the purple touches.

646
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't know.

647
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,680
Dark theme with purple.

648
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,880
It's one of those themes where I've set it.

649
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,200
And I've been using Yaru even on my arch systems

650
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,080
now for a while.

651
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,400
Once I set it, I'm good.

652
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,320
Yeah, it's really nice.

653
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,480
Checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches

654
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,160
all have little hints of purple.

655
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,640
I think actually really it's eggplant.

656
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh my gosh.

657
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,280
Thanks, Wes.

658
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,800
Thanks.

659
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,220
I think you're right.

660
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah.

661
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,920
Oh, it's poppy and wimpy.

662
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,840
So it's probably actually taken from the emoji.

663
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,960
You know these guys and their emojis.

664
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
You know what else is exciting about this, though?

665
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,000
Do you remember like 10 years ago, back in like,

666
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
won't you, 1004?

667
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,340
I don't even remember last week.

668
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,360
With like radiance and ambiance and those things.

669
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,880
So those had light and dark variations of the same theme,

670
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,640
right?

671
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,600
Way back when you could sort of customize it,

672
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
have the dark version, have the light version.

673
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
We don't believe you.

674
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,160
Yeah, right?

675
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Well, that's coming back now, too.

676
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,360
So now you're going to have Yaru dark, light,

677
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
and the regular Yaru.

678
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,280
Oh, if it wasn't clear, we are dark mode on that.

679
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,760
Oh, OK.

680
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,040
I see.

681
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,280
I see.

682
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
You just weren't even considering the other options.

683
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
I mean, I tried it this morning because Wes was playing around

684
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,000
with it yesterday on 2004.

685
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,840
So I grabbed it this morning to play around with on 2004.

686
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,600
And first thing I did was just check

687
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
to see if yet they had baked something into Gnome settings

688
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,260
so I could just go select it there.

689
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,760
Good news.

690
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,400
That's coming.

691
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,960
Ah, it's not there yet.

692
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Yeah.

693
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,280
You still got to use Gnome tweaks.

694
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,000
It was installed, so.

695
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,280
Oh, you know what that means.

696
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,840
It's time for a little housekeeping here

697
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
on the old podcast keys.

698
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,400
I already mentioned it, but I have a note to mention it again.

699
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
No Linux Unplugged Live next week.

700
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,120
We'll have an episode for you.

701
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
So this episode is all about hardware.

702
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
Well, it's about to be.

703
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,440
Next episode is going to be about software.

704
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,660
Really looking forward to it.

705
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,920
So bring your time machine.

706
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,320
Yeah.

707
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,720
And maybe this is a good time to go make sure you're subscribed

708
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
in all the places you want to easily get the podcast.

709
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,640
LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe for those.

710
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,040
You might remember we mentioned we

711
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
were doing a live stream on using

712
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,920
the terminal like your desktop.

713
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,640
A day in the life of cheese.

714
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
And it turned out great.

715
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,360
So it's up on YouTube now, YouTube.com

716
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,120
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

717
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,760
You can go watch it over there.

718
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,360
Cheese and myself just doing our thing on the live stream.

719
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,880
Yeah.

720
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,420
And we got some really solid feedback too in the comments.

721
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,040
And I would suggest to anyone that's listening that ventures

722
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,160
over there to watch the video.

723
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,760
If you have any terminal applications

724
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,160
that you really swear by and use every day,

725
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
drop them in the comments.

726
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,240
Because there's been some really excellent suggestions in there.

727
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,960
I love that.

728
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
That's great.

729
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,720
Did you see that Alex is on the Home Assistant podcast?

730
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,760
Go check out Alex on the Home Assistant podcast.

731
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,380
He did his thing over there representing

732
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,840
the self-hosted program.

733
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,600
One of the reasons, well, the reason

734
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,960
we're not live next week is I'm taking

735
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,080
Lady Joops down for a major project off-grid update

736
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,480
doing the solar, doing the lithium,

737
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000
redoing the entire power system.

738
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,240
Talking a little bit about that on self-hosted.

739
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,040
So check out self-hosted.show if you're not listening to that.

740
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,720
Also rumor has it that I'm going to be going on the show

741
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,000
again in a couple of weeks to do a deep dive into my setup,

742
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,680
even deeper than we do in self-hosted.

743
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,200
So even more Home Assistant.

744
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Watch out for that.

745
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,040
Nice.

746
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,200
Good for you.

747
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
And speaking of great content you can catch,

748
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,040
our man Brent sits down with Mr. Jim Salter of the Techsnap

749
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,240
program in Ars Technica.

750
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,880
He was on our show here recently in the latest episode of Brunch

751
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,640
with Brent over on extras.show.

752
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
I love Brunch.

753
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,720
I want chats with Chris, dinner with Drew,

754
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,480
and we need something for you, Wes.

755
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,880
Something about drinks with Wes?

756
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,040
No, that's not it.

757
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,880
Wine with Wes?

758
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,600
Oh, there we go.

759
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,200
That'll work.

760
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,040
And then a special note.

761
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,000
Special programming note, everybody.

762
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,160
Texas Linux Fest has extended their call for papers

763
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,640
until this Sunday, my birthday, January 26 at 5 PM,

764
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,000
their time, which is central time.

765
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
So you've got a couple more days.

766
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,240
Remember, you don't have to have the perfect, fully done talk.

767
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
You just need a great pitch, a good summary,

768
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,700
and an idea of where you're going to take it.

769
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,360
And then you use now until the Fest to make it just right.

770
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
Yeah.

771
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,520
And as long as you get it finished by the Fest,

772
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
no one will know.

773
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,880
We're going to be there.

774
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Are you going to be there?

775
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,920
I can't remember.

776
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,320
Yeah, of course.

777
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh my gosh, great.

778
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,480
And Alex is going to be there, and Brent's going to be there,

779
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,720
and Cheesy.

780
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,400
Absolutely.

781
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm sure L, of course.

782
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,720
Carl's going to be there, of course.

783
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes, sir.

784
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,760
And it's going to be in Austin again this year, so barbecue.

785
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,080
What?

786
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Yes.

787
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,280
Carl, we've got to make that happen because Hadia

788
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,360
has been giving me two years of crap for not taking it.

789
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,680
The marriage is on the line.

790
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,280
It's important.

791
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,200
Hey, Carl, is it in the venue across the road

792
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,280
from Terry Black's?

793
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,120
Did that happen?

794
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,800
Yes, sir.

795
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,080
We're going to be smelling it from the Fest.

796
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,960
You know that because they pump all that.

797
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh my gosh, you guys.

798
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,280
So there you have it.

799
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,320
Texas Linux Fest call for papers extended until this here Sunday

800
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,720
as we record, so go check that out.

801
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,960
And then Linux Fest, Scale, and Texas Linux Fest,

802
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,680
all coming up scale first, right?

803
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,720
Then Linux Fest, then Texas Linux Fest.

804
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,240
Right now, we're planning to go to all of them if we can,

805
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,440
so we hope to see you there.

806
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,080
Who knows?

807
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,180
Will plans change?

808
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,600
I don't know.

809
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,040
I don't got a magic eight ball.

810
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,400
You lost the magic eight ball?

811
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,920
Come on.

812
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,600
I trusted you.

813
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,480
I let my kids play with it.

814
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,280
They asked all kinds of questions, mostly about farts.

815
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
So Wes, do we have the hardware in here?

816
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,800
Yeah, we do.

817
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
It's actually at your feet.

818
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
Oh, yeah, there it is.

819
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,040
So we're talking about the XPS 13 7390.

820
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,640
This is no longer the absolute latest.

821
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,780
Although, can you order the brand, brand new one

822
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,760
that was announced at CBS?

823
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,400
I don't know if it's shipping.

824
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,680
It's on Dell's website.

825
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm not sure when you'll actually receive it.

826
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,080
We wondered, is there still a point to this laptop,

827
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,680
number one?

828
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,840
And number two, where has the XPS line gotten to?

829
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,040
Because something that is extremely important to me

830
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,040
when I'm investing in a hardware platform

831
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,640
is I really like to have insurance

832
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,240
that that platform will get better over time.

833
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,680
And that, say, after I've used a laptop for three or four

834
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,640
years, I can buy another one of that same generation,

835
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,600
and it's iteratively gotten better.

836
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,640
Right, it's no fun having to jump brands each time

837
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,600
you need a new laptop.

838
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,160
I mean, we saw how upset the Mac users got

839
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,080
when the MacBook suffered there for a few years.

840
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,320
And they've really only gotten one good one.

841
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,840
That's right.

842
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,440
Let's be clear.

843
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,360
There's only one that's got a fixed keyboard, for heck's sake.

844
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
Anyways, I really think you can say

845
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,000
that is true for the XPS 13 line.

846
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah, we've both been using them over the years,

847
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,360
and there hasn't been a huge regression.

848
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,440
You and I both have been and are XPS owners.

849
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,520
Not our daily drivers, but still really great.

850
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,000
My wife uses an XPS 13 as her main computer.

851
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
She loves the portability of it.

852
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,840
Great screen.

853
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
That's always been true.

854
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,480
So where are they at now, and where is it at performance-wise?

855
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Well, like we mentioned, we recently launched this.

856
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,720
We came with, I believe, 1804, and we messed around

857
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,000
with a couple of different distributions.

858
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
We finally just put Ubuntu 20.04 on here for fun.

859
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,520
But something kind of hit me right in the face

860
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
when I first started playing around with this thing,

861
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,280
as I had some trouble booting other Linux distributions

862
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,960
on there.

863
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,600
It's this newfangled hardware, Wes.

864
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,160
What exactly was going on with that?

865
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,320
Well, there was fast boot enabled.

866
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,920
Basically, the default BIOS settings

867
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,400
made it very difficult to get a USB drive recognized.

868
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,440
First of all, it's only USB-C ports on this thing.

869
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,240
It's default BIOS, you say?

870
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Yeah, that's right.

871
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,840
Now, it's UEFI now, Chris.

872
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,040
UEFI?

873
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
Is that a worm?

874
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,520
So you're going to live the dongle lifestyle, right?

875
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,760
So you got your little USB-C to USB-A adapter.

876
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,600
You've plugged in your Linux distribution.

877
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,600
You're hoping it's going to boot, and you just get Ubuntu

878
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,120
again.

879
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Yeah, you get kind of weird stuff, actually,

880
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,760
depending on the distribution.

881
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,800
In elementary, I got the elementary OS splash screen,

882
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,920
and it started booting elementary OS.

883
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,800
And then when the splash screen disappeared,

884
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,920
I was in an Ubuntu desktop.

885
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,640
It was the strangest thing.

886
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,000
And then when I booted Manjaro on it,

887
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,960
I had really kind of strange mouse glitchy issues.

888
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,520
But all of that kind of I just attributed

889
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,880
to the thing being so dang new.

890
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,800
But after you solved it, it was really kind of no big deal

891
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,520
at all.

892
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah, I spent most of my time with it running Arch,

893
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,200
and it was performing great.

894
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
I love that you put Arch on it.

895
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
You're such a maniac.

896
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,880
So like we said, this is now no longer

897
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,240
the most latest and greatest edition.

898
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,320
They have one that has been just announced at CES.

899
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,240
So we called up Dell, and we said, hey, guys,

900
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,760
what's the difference between this here laptop

901
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,600
and the new one?

902
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,840
What's the big difference?

903
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,160
And Damon from Dell obliged.

904
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,080
The big difference is the focus on the 9300.

905
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,760
So first, it is a completely redesigned machine,

906
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,320
even though they look very similar side by side.

907
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,320
And again, that is because the design tenets have not

908
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,640
changed radically.

909
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,680
But the materials and the technology that we've got

910
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,120
have let us continue making it smaller, smaller, smaller.

911
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,520
And you can only eke so much out.

912
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,760
But in this one, we do have managed

913
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,680
to get it a little bit smaller and maximize the screen.

914
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,840
So we're maximizing the things that matter, the screen,

915
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,120
the keyboard, the touchpad, right?

916
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,520
So the touchpad is bigger.

917
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,360
The keyboard, if you look at it from the two models,

918
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,920
the keyboard now goes edge to edge.

919
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah.

920
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,560
And of course, the screen is probably

921
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,480
the biggest point of difference between the one we have

922
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,840
in studio and the one announced at CES.

923
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:16,280
The display, we've gone from a FHD and UHD, which is,

924
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,320
you know, you're 1920 by 1080, and you're 3840 by 2160.

925
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,640
We've moved up to a 10, excuse me, the 16 by 10 aspect ratio

926
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,480
instead of 16 by 9.

927
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,640
So you get that extra vertical space.

928
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,640
And the way we did that is by almost eliminating

929
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,400
the bottom bezel.

930
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
There we go.

931
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,320
A little bit larger screen ratio, a little bit nicer

932
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,040
keyboard to body ratio.

933
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,840
And those sound like small changes,

934
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,560
but take credit what he said, to make those kind of changes

935
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,920
on a laptop that's already this small with such a nice screen,

936
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,800
that's a lot of work.

937
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,560
Yeah.

938
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,880
So we had this one in-house since before Christmas,

939
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,640
and Wes and I traded it back and forth.

940
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Wes got to spend quite a bit of time on it,

941
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,280
and then we decided to just put it in studio

942
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,760
and run benchmarks on it.

943
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,520
And I'll tell you, if you're thinking

944
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,360
about a laptop like this, here's a couple of things

945
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,200
that I really like about this.

946
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,240
Number one is it's all USB-C now.

947
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,080
Even the power, we've all gone USB-C.

948
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,160
And because I kind of just over the last couple of years

949
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,440
have been making the transition to getting a dongle for this

950
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,160
or changing from an HDMI cable to a USB-C cable,

951
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,920
just kind of making these changes,

952
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,400
pretty easy to just slot this in now to my existing workflow.

953
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,920
Right, once you've got USB-C docks hanging around, then,

954
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,160
OK, not a big deal.

955
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,920
The keyboard remains pretty good.

956
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,560
It's not my absolute favorite keyboard.

957
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,600
No, I mean, I'm using the ThinkPad most of the time,

958
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,560
so it wasn't quite as nice of that.

959
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,840
But it's so much more portable, it kind of makes up for it.

960
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,400
And unlike our ThinkPads, this has a nice backlight keyboard

961
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,920
too.

962
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,120
Backlight keyboard and that screen.

963
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,360
Yeah, OK, so the screen is really great.

964
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,840
Even on ours, the non-CES edition,

965
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,560
the screen is really great.

966
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
And so this is what I wanted to say,

967
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,600
is I think this laptop now that they have released the CES

968
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,520
edition is sitting in a very sweet spot for those of you who

969
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,320
are OK having something that's just about as good as the latest

970
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,680
and greatest edition.

971
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,920
And if your workload is disk, IOT heavy, or CPU heavy,

972
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,200
or those two things together, you

973
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,520
would be very impressed with what this laptop can do.

974
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,240
Again, we'll have comparison benchmarks

975
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,320
linked in the show notes.

976
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,240
You can run the exact same benchmark on your hardware

977
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
and see how it compares to this laptop.

978
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,680
But in short, this thing was benchmarking

979
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,600
at ranges of high-end Ryzen desktops with high-speed disks.

980
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,480
Like, it's really crunching numbers in the CPU

981
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,320
as fast as possible, really lighting up the cores,

982
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,920
and it can suck data on and off of that disk.

983
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah, we did some tests doing a whole bunch of video encoding,

984
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,400
and it performed very admirably.

985
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Sure, the fan does kick on, but it

986
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,480
doesn't get crazy hot because it actually has very good thermals.

987
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,820
So I couldn't tell you, well, it needs more performance.

988
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,040
I couldn't say to you the screen isn't good enough.

989
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,240
The trackpad, I think, is the best trackpad

990
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,480
you can get on a computer pre-built with Linux.

991
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,640
The build is, it's like all the previous XPSs, it's very good.

992
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,820
The question is, can you actually buy it now

993
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,360
that the new version has been released?

994
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,000
And could you maybe get it at a slight discount?

995
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,440
Maybe you want to do a little budget shopping.

996
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,400
Well, I asked, Damon, just that.

997
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,120
So I'm glad you asked that because, interestingly enough,

998
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,800
a lot of times you'll see manufacturers

999
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,600
they'll discontinue a model after they bring in the new one.

1000
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,520
And they're going to actually let the older generation

1001
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,920
model live on for a while next to this one.

1002
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,880
I think it's an experiment to see

1003
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,840
how folks feel about the changes that we made and whatnot.

1004
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,800
But so you'll be able to go to Dell.com

1005
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,960
and you'll be able to click on XPS 13,

1006
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,440
and it'll give you an option, XPS 13, 7390,

1007
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,880
or it'll say new XPS 13, and that will be the 9300.

1008
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,600
So they will live on side by side.

1009
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Right now, I think both of them are starting at 999,

1010
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,720
but things do go on sale from time to time.

1011
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,600
That, I think, is the hint there.

1012
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,640
And depending on how you price them, the prices will change.

1013
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,280
But I think if you watch for a sale,

1014
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,640
the version we have here in studio, the 7300 version,

1015
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,240
will be very competitively priced soon.

1016
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
Last time I looked, there was $100 off going on right now

1017
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,120
over at Dell.com.

1018
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,040
Oh, really, already?

1019
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
The mileage may vary, but yeah, it's definitely worth looking at.

1020
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,240
Yeah, because I could see them keeping this around

1021
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
and doing special discounts, Black Friday sales,

1022
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,560
all those kinds of things.

1023
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,920
Because there's just a scale of economies

1024
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,240
just since they've been building this for so long,

1025
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,840
and they have the newer version now.

1026
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,800
And there's really nothing I could ask.

1027
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Would I like a slightly wider screen?

1028
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,160
Sure.

1029
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,800
The other thing that's pretty great

1030
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
is the new edition has been changed to 1610.

1031
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,040
This is a 16 by 9 ratio.

1032
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,480
But again, I don't know if it's really necessary.

1033
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,440
So I thought, well, where is this going?

1034
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
Because in talking with them, it's

1035
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,720
clear that Dell is feeling pretty

1036
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,560
good about the success of the Sputnik program.

1037
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,120
It started as this crazy idea of,

1038
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,680
let's just ask them what they want from a computer,

1039
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,320
and then let's take our best rig that we sell

1040
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,880
and give them that, which was a weird concept.

1041
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,360
Right.

1042
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,240
They didn't start with a netbook line, something cheap and easy.

1043
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,640
Which is what everybody else was doing.

1044
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,960
They had actually taken a crack, I

1045
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
don't if you remember, at a really cheap laptop.

1046
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,400
Oh, right, right.

1047
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,800
That was from a different area of the company.

1048
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,720
And this was a risk because it involved

1049
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,800
spending a lot of time ahead upstreaming drivers.

1050
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,280
Before they even shipped a product,

1051
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,880
they had to pay developers to start upstreaming, right?

1052
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,520
And work with their partners to do licensing.

1053
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
Wait, how do we Linux again?

1054
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,320
Yeah.

1055
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,040
So it was considered sort of Barton going out

1056
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,800
on the edge with this idea.

1057
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
And using a fund that had been established

1058
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,120
in the company for crazy ideas to just seed this thing.

1059
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,200
Now you fast forward, and it appears

1060
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,440
this has been looked at as one of the more innovative successes

1061
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,320
inside the company in a while.

1062
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,480
That's where we're at now.

1063
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,760
We could be seeing big things coming from this.

1064
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,240
And right.

1065
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I mean, with a big corporation like that,

1066
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,680
if it's not going to perform well for the company,

1067
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
at some point they're going to exit.

1068
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
And it's been going on for a long time.

1069
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,880
And I think we as a community need to recognize

1070
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
not only the importance of that, but how great it

1071
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,040
is that we have a really rich hardware

1072
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,120
ecosystem where each of them have their advantages.

1073
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,480
There's clear advantages from each vendor right now.

1074
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,240
And so you have to wonder, where are things going in the future?

1075
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,000
Who's going to take the risk on the next big thing?

1076
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,360
Like an ARM laptop, or maybe an all Ryzen system.

1077
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,280
I know a lot of people listening are asking,

1078
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,560
did he ask them if they're going to do Ryzen?

1079
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,640
Well, I did.

1080
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,920
And it sounds like maybe it's not outside the realm

1081
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
of possibility.

1082
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,200
You know, I think if you just look at the product lines,

1083
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,720
Dell already carries AMD product lines, AMD components

1084
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,400
in our product lines.

1085
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,960
There's no reason why in the future, if that makes sense

1086
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,000
and we hear that feedback from our customers,

1087
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,560
why we couldn't incorporate something like that,

1088
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,520
if it makes sense in the bigger picture, right?

1089
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,480
ARM, I'm not really the right person to comment on that.

1090
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
You know, I can tell you that we are always

1091
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,080
looking at the technologies that are out there,

1092
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,840
because we don't ever want to look out there and just say,

1093
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,560
oh, well, this is off the table, because we just, you know,

1094
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,840
we're always looking at the technologies,

1095
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,280
seeing where they're going, where the pros, where

1096
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,160
the cons, strengths, weaknesses.

1097
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,400
And does it make sense for our customers?

1098
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,360
Is it a good strategic move?

1099
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,480
So sounds like if enough people ask over time,

1100
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,080
they could go that direction.

1101
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,040
And that'd be pretty neat to see something like that XPS 13,

1102
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,200
but all Ryzen would really be cool.

1103
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,580
I would love to play with that.

1104
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,120
And Ryzen's getting more and more

1105
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,160
applicable for something that size.

1106
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,840
So Wes, I want to give you a chance

1107
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
to talk about it a little bit, since you

1108
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,400
spent a considerable amount of time with the laptop.

1109
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Yeah, I pretty much use it as my day-to-day work machine

1110
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,400
for at least a week, I would say.

1111
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,680
Yeah, and then plus, all of the horrible torturing.

1112
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,480
I just basically say to Wes, like,

1113
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,760
let's run these benchmarks.

1114
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,760
And then Wes really has to do all of the setting it up.

1115
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,880
And I was impressed.

1116
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,200
I mean, we had like net data going.

1117
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,120
I actually set up a little, had data

1118
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,000
going into a Prometheus cluster so we could watch

1119
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,200
as it was encoding.

1120
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,960
It's pretty geeky.

1121
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,000
It was pretty geeky.

1122
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah.

1123
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,880
I was impressed.

1124
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,200
Now, there's a couple of things.

1125
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,240
Dell still hasn't fixed the EFI on their XPS line.

1126
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,120
It's not like it's terribly broken.

1127
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,640
Yeah, but if you want to do fancy stuff like that,

1128
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,000
you can boot the kernel with what's known as EFI stub,

1129
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,600
where due to some clever hackery on the kernel's part,

1130
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,340
you can make the kernel act like an EFI executable.

1131
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,400
So you can just boot the kernel, no boot load or nothing.

1132
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,680
But you obviously have to give it some commands, right?

1133
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,280
What, you know, where the inner RAMFS is, and the root,

1134
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,800
and all that.

1135
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
EFI supports all of this.

1136
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,280
Unfortunately, Dell's EFI does not pass those variables.

1137
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,600
The upside is I discovered a neat little project, which

1138
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,280
is alternative.

1139
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,940
Maybe you don't want grub, and you don't even

1140
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,920
want system deep boot.

1141
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,420
I don't.

1142
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,920
Nope.

1143
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,560
Super minimal.

1144
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,880
It's just a little C program.

1145
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,960
All you need is like the GNU EFI development libraries,

1146
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,040
and you just build yourself a custom bootloader

1147
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,080
to just boot your kernel.

1148
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,880
Nothing else.

1149
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,360
That's all it does.

1150
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,240
That's pretty slick.

1151
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,400
Yeah.

1152
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,200
So if you're interested in that kind of booting hackery,

1153
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,280
we'll have links to that.

1154
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,680
I actually kind of appreciate you mentioning

1155
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,340
that kind of feature, specifically

1156
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,400
for this class of workstation.

1157
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
It's meant for developers that are building things.

1158
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,500
You might need to boot into another OS.

1159
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,400
I mean, ideally, I should think, I should think,

1160
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Dell would love the idea that mainstream, open source,

1161
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,040
and free software developers, large, maybe Linus or Greg Kh,

1162
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,520
would be using one of their devices.

1163
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,600
But supporting things like that are kind of necessary.

1164
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,440
It's the kind of details that that market is

1165
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,080
going to find in your product.

1166
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,840
But again, if this is what we're getting down

1167
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,760
to in terms of our criticism, it's

1168
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
also a measure of how good they're doing.

1169
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:57,720
Right.

1170
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,480
So the flip side is once I got that working,

1171
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,960
boy, this thing boots fast, too.

1172
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,520
It's just performing all around.

1173
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,240
Yeah.

1174
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,360
I can't stress how fast that thing can get bits off the disk

1175
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,600
and shove it into the CPU.

1176
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,060
It's so glorious.

1177
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,920
It's amazing.

1178
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,080
Now, the other issue I ran into, I mean, out of the box,

1179
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,000
it was working great.

1180
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But as we mentioned, even if this isn't the newest laptop,

1181
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,200
it's still pretty darn new.

1182
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,600
And it's actually got a Wi-Fi 6 chipset inside of it.

1183
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Yeah, tell me about that.

1184
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,200
Now, it has already been upstreamed.

1185
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,660
But if you're not running one of those distributions that

1186
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,520
gives you a nice, new, modern kernel,

1187
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,980
you're going to run into some problems

1188
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,200
and probably won't have Wi-Fi out of the box,

1189
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,520
like if you install, say, like an older elementary OS.

1190
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,560
How was it under Arch?

1191
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,880
Oh, yeah, Arch worked just fine.

1192
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,400
And did you have to do anything with 2004?

1193
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,920
2004 worked right out of the box.

1194
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,980
And thankfully, it is Intel Wi-Fi.

1195
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,040
So there's actually just driver firmware

1196
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
you can go download and add to your system,

1197
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,720
even if you don't have the newest kernel.

1198
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,280
And if I'm not thinking through this,

1199
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,400
when we did the 2004 install, we opted to use ZFS.

1200
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,720
So we're talking about how fast this thing is

1201
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,520
with using ZFS on it, too.

1202
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,080
Just as a note, it doesn't seem to have impacted our perception

1203
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,880
of the performance.

1204
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,600
No, not at all.

1205
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,860
Or really, the benchmarks.

1206
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,320
I mean, we did those benchmarks all using ZFS

1207
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,840
for this last round.

1208
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,640
It screamed.

1209
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,080
Pleased to report, too, that in our early 2004 testing,

1210
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,720
ZFS option is still performing great.

1211
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,560
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

1212
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,840
My only kind of criticisms that I really have for this thing

1213
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,360
is the fan noise is a little significant.

1214
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,000
Once it's up, if it's really doing work,

1215
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
you're going to hear it.

1216
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,280
And the kind of workloads that I would throw at it

1217
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,800
would push the noise levels that I am comfortable with,

1218
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,900
because I work on mic a lot.

1219
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,860
And so it is an issue in that regard.

1220
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,880
And so if you're sensitive to noise,

1221
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,720
it's not a white noise.

1222
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,480
It's a little bit of a harsher kind of a pink noise.

1223
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,920
You can definitely tell those fans are getting aggressive.

1224
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,320
But you trade for that.

1225
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,040
You get something that's so thin,

1226
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,680
you don't even notice it in your bag.

1227
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,080
What was so great about it is both Wes and I

1228
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,200
could just slip this in our bag that's already full of stuff,

1229
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,680
and it was no big deal.

1230
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,760
It would also be perfect.

1231
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,640
Maybe you have an existing work laptop,

1232
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,240
and you also want to bring your personal to keep that separate.

1233
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:05,800
Beautiful.

1234
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,760
And I think if you remember, they're

1235
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,240
targeting the developer where that workload is often

1236
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,040
it's bursty in terms of CPU.

1237
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,160
Maybe you're building.

1238
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,660
But otherwise, it's terminal, or it's your IDE in a browser.

1239
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,360
And in those conditions, so one of my famous

1240
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,440
just sort of sit-in-there working mode that I did

1241
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
is YouTube video.

1242
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,480
Then I pop that out into picture-in-picture.

1243
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Then I use the browser.

1244
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,400
I'm using the terminal.

1245
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,980
I'm doing stuff, but nothing massive chatting,

1246
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,840
looking things up, putting together a doc.

1247
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,920
Active multitasking, trying to get stuff done.

1248
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,000
In that scenario, you don't even have to hear it.

1249
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,600
I mean, it's not.

1250
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,880
I mean, we're talking like when you're really

1251
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,040
pushing with that multi-focusing.

1252
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,560
That, I think, is the thing to know

1253
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,680
is that the curve settings, it's quiet almost all the time,

1254
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,680
and then it gets really loud.

1255
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,840
And as you would expect, but it's just

1256
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,560
one of those things that I'll also mention is in that,

1257
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,480
I saw battery life ranges from five hours,

1258
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,160
if you're not pushing it very hard, to three hours,

1259
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,520
if you're pushing it pretty hard.

1260
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,720
And remember that thing's got a very bright screen, too,

1261
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,000
so you can back that down a little bit.

1262
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,720
And that'll also vary your mileage.

1263
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,000
I think if you do some tuning, you'll

1264
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,800
probably see seven or eight hours

1265
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
if you're not doing too much with it, but you're right.

1266
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
There are some trade-offs for the portability.

1267
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,200
We both really like holding it, too, which is a weird thing.

1268
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,560
But we both, I think, really enjoy the feel in the hand.

1269
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,160
Where they've put the bumps on the bottom,

1270
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,440
it makes it easier to hold on to so it doesn't slip out.

1271
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,000
It's got some traction.

1272
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,040
It's just a pleasant machine to interface with.

1273
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,540
Yeah.

1274
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,680
If you are in this area of considering a MacBook Air class

1275
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,280
machine or a MacBook 13, that range of device,

1276
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,080
or a really nice high-end thin ThinkPad,

1277
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,920
I would definitely add the XPS to your line,

1278
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,440
if that's your category.

1279
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,600
The thing about this XPS 13 is it packs more of a punch

1280
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,760
than you expect in that small packaging.

1281
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah, I think the only complaint I still have,

1282
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,760
including with the new model, is that 16 gigs of RAM.

1283
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,920
Yeah.

1284
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah, it needs more RAM.

1285
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,920
It needs a lot more RAM.

1286
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,680
But they're using a very special low-power everything

1287
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,080
in that thing, so I can understand that.

1288
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,640
But it's pretty great.

1289
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,040
We didn't play around much with the battery testing,

1290
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,440
so there's probably others that will give you

1291
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,400
more details on that.

1292
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,160
Because we use it first.

1293
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,360
A lot of times, our processes use it as a work machine,

1294
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,160
run it through all of its paces as much as possible.

1295
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,120
And then something we try to do in all of our reviews

1296
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,520
is post at least one comparable benchmark

1297
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,480
so you can see where it would fall in your range,

1298
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,080
see if it's worth the money for you.

1299
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,200
And then the other thing we try to do, if we have time,

1300
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,440
and thankfully, Dell was very generous with our time

1301
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,520
on this one, is we try to throw a couple of different distros

1302
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,000
on there.

1303
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,720
Because I like to do that.

1304
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,120
If I buy a piece of hardware, I want

1305
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,280
to know that I can run more than just what ships on there.

1306
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,720
I think that's what's so funny about this.

1307
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,840
We're really celebrating the fact

1308
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,280
that you can just buy this Linux laptop

1309
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,120
and it comes with Linux, but all of us want to go customize it.

1310
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,400
Isn't that the thing, though?

1311
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,760
For one, I like to explore.

1312
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
Two, I want to vote with my wallet,

1313
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,440
and I want to show that I'm buying a Linux machine.

1314
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,240
Absolutely.

1315
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,920
And to me, if it's running a mainstream distro, what it says

1316
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,400
is it runs a mainstream kernel, likely.

1317
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,900
And so even if, when it's brand, brand, brand new,

1318
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,280
it's got some patches, the great thing about these Dells

1319
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,280
is they're upstream in that stuff.

1320
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,960
So you give it a little bit of time,

1321
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,640
and it's just in the mainline kernel.

1322
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,280
I love that.

1323
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,480
And it's pretty nice.

1324
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,260
So it's a pretty good machine if you're in the market.

1325
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,560
And we should put some links to it in the show notes.

1326
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,520
That would be good.

1327
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,080
And thanks to Damon for stopping, well,

1328
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,440
for letting us call him up and ask questions.

1329
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
I was going to say stop and buy, but you could probably

1330
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,400
tell we called him on the phone.

1331
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,700
We do that every now and then.

1332
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,880
We call them so you don't have to, right?

1333
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,720
That's right.

1334
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,500
Yeah, before we get out of here, we

1335
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,280
have another unplugged to record,

1336
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,320
but this is nearly the end for the download audience.

1337
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,120
We have a pick, and this one's pretty cool.

1338
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,320
It's called Glow.

1339
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,120
And I actually don't remember which one of us

1340
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,760
found Glow, because I don't think it was me.

1341
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,100
I was going to say it was you, but maybe it was Cheesy.

1342
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,560
Cheesy, did you find Glow?

1343
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,520
Maybe.

1344
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,520
I don't remember.

1345
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,560
I love it.

1346
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,160
The thing is, we've been pick shopping.

1347
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,720
We spent the holiday, a lot of us

1348
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,280
making lists of our favorite picks and stuff.

1349
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,480
And so we've all got ones that were just

1350
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,500
thrown in the mix right now.

1351
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,680
This is a really nice looking way

1352
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,920
to render Markdown on the command line.

1353
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,360
It must have been from Cheesy's video.

1354
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,840
It's super easy to install.

1355
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,600
You just brew, install Glow.

1356
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,120
Anybody?

1357
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,280
Get out of here, Mac guy.

1358
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,240
Actually, no, there's brew for Linux now, too.

1359
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,200
It's fine, it's fine.

1360
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,160
I know, I know, I know.

1361
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,520
But I just tried to trigger you.

1362
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,360
I just was seeing if you were listening.

1363
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Of course, there's other package managers that have it, too.

1364
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,440
Yeah, it looks like there's binaries for Windows, Linux,

1365
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,280
and FreeBSD.

1366
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,680
Yeah, it's in the AUR, too, by the way, Arch.

1367
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,780
Anyways, it's just really nice, because we often

1368
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:47,400
will be talking about these massive electron applications.

1369
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,420
Well, instead, you can do it on the command line.

1370
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,000
It might all be NPM on the back end,

1371
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,580
but at least it's on the command line.

1372
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,720
That doesn't matter, right?

1373
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,520
Web apps on the command line don't matter.

1374
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,680
What you do is you run this in hyperterm or whatever it is,

1375
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,960
that Windows terminal that's based on Electron,

1376
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,840
and you're really set.

1377
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,640
You've got to make sure you keep Electron around.

1378
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,200
So we'll have a link to Glow, which does look really nice.

1379
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,560
I kid around, but it actually looks really fantastic.

1380
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,360
I love that their description is render Markdown on the CLI

1381
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,120
with pizzazz.

1382
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,360
And pizzazz is an italics.

1383
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,960
Which made me think of pizza.

1384
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,340
I want a Linux-powered pizza oven.

1385
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,320
That's what I want.

1386
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,080
I want to do a Linux-unplugged pizza party,

1387
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,960
like we did that barbecue.

1388
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,720
I also want to do a barbecue, though.

1389
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
There could be barbecue pizza, my friend.

1390
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,200
You're reading my mind, Wes.

1391
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,560
You're reading my mind.

1392
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,200
All right, we'll go over to linuxunplugged.com

1393
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,280
slash 337 for links to everything

1394
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,920
we talked about today, as well as linuxunplugged.com

1395
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,000
slash contact if you want to correct us,

1396
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,280
or more importantly, share a pic or an insight or something

1397
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
you've been thinking about.

1398
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,320
We love hearing from you.

1399
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,200
And last but not least, go get more Westpane

1400
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,720
over at techsnap.systems and get daily, weekday news,

Bye

1481
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,420
episode just want to make it clear that's not what I'm saying what you're

1482
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:11,300
saying don't all right let's go pick a title over there JB titles calm it makes

1483
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,940
me think you know in the US we've got this whole impeachment thing but it's

1484
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,580
always very popular to go find the clips of the politician from like ten years

1485
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,180
ago saying the opposite makes me think we could find some last clips of you

1486
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,580
that might be pretty and oh no kidding that's where some of this comes from is

1487
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:31,380
reflection on I was one of the loudest mouthpieces for advocating everyone use

1488
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:37,700
Linux and I mean you remember the switch competition I that not only was that

1489
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:44,420
manifested in the podcast but it came out in my career I made a consulting

1490
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,460
career out of going in and converting people's Windows installs to Linux in

1491
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,180
the last part of my IT career and sometimes looking back at it I think in

1492
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,380
most cases for file and print and basics I was always right but I'd never even

1493
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,220
really considered Windows right the stop and think of like this is really what I

1494
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,740
should be doing and then if I had to use Windows it'd be in a VM and now I've

1495
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:15,340
gone from a like die-hard what would you call that evangelists to I don't know if

1496
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:20,060
advocates the right word but now I'm much more of this is a tool that works

1497
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:26,780
really well for me and I think works really well for a lot of uses but if

1498
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,580
there's a tool that works really well for you that's fine it seems like it's

1499
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,980
kind of the stage of any sort of relationship right you fell in love with

1500
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,220
Linux at first it rescued you from the depths of Windows so it's natural to be

1501
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:39,500
infatuated with it yes but now it's just it's another tool in your tool belt and

1502
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,620
you can think about a little more critically yeah initially it was solving

1503
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:48,240
really significant problems for me and it was doing it for free and I was

1504
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,980
blown away it was just yeah I can this is something I can even do and now it's

1505
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,180
transitioned to well I can understand why using Photoshop is important for you

1506
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,780
or I can appreciate that you like the Mac better that's fine I think this is

1507
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,820
great you know I really and I think part of it too has been my distro hopping and

1508
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,140
my desktop environment hopping when I get really into something for a bit and

1509
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,140
then I moved something else Michael this is great and then I realized it's all

1510
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,100
kind of great and whatever I want to use is fine right it doesn't have to be the

1511
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,580
only solution for everybody it's that there's a lot of good options yeah and I

1512
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:28,900
think the other aspect to it that we sort of fail to appreciate in 2020 is

1513
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:37,260
it doesn't really need the same kind of evangelizing we won in terms of market

1514
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,540
penetration and server and mobile and as a default way for most software

1515
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,220
development that happens at scale like that's just now a given that wasn't a

1516
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:50,700
given in the late 90s in the early 2000s right especially after Microsoft

1517
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,820
survived the antitrust trial it was like oh crap they're still here yeah I mean

1518
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:01,140
it was that's where I think a lot of the anger towards Microsoft came from is it

1519
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:06,500
was a competition for how software was going to be developed for the next

1520
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,180
decade and beyond 20 years now right 20 years right this is when we were dealing

1521
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,860
with y2k I mean put this in context this is when we were this was the time and in

1522
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,380
that time things were not so great there was no Linux in everyone's pocket there

1523
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,540
was no every router running Linux there was no cloud there was other people's

1524
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,740
computers and they ran everything from Unix to NT to Linux and we'd had the

1525
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:36,020
whole Unix Wars era and Windows and go whoof there was a lot that just was

1526
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:42,780
uncertain and so it felt it felt necessary to evangelize Linux in a very

1527
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,100
direct way now here we are where most people's

1528
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,220
information's in a cloud provider that they're getting access to through a web

1529
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:56,300
browser we have electron we have snaps and flat packs you have just about every

1530
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,300
vendor doing their best to appeal to every type of user with Microsoft with

1531
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,220
the subsystem and with Apple's new Pro hardware and with the various different

1532
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,340
Linux distribution attempts and Dell Sputnik program it's like there's so

1533
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,700
many options that all can do the job now so it's kind of like whatever works for

1534
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,620
you I can't really pass judgment on anymore I just who the hell am I I just

1535
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:22,220
know what works for me I know it works for our group and beyond that I'm good

1536
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,780
have at it whatever you want to use and so I think that's where I look at this

1537
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:33,140
and go don't make my tool that I use for my job less powerful don't take pseudo

1538
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,740
away I mean imagine even you laugh but they're talking about no home partitions

1539
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,860
like that's better no no drive encryption that's better like yeah for

1540
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,620
average users but that user doesn't actually exist where this user base is

1541
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,820
here and expanding at a very rapid clip right and it'd be interesting to have

1542
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,580
some more examples because I think home partitions are a good solution to or are

1543
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,940
a solution to a lot of things but probably at least a subset of those

1544
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,980
solutions could be better handled or more approachably scalably handled in

1545
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,540
other ways right so with it's a technology problem not a human problem

1546
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,180
the software could be managing the encryption and managing the partitioning

1547
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,940
and the user could be blissfully unaware of it or you know maybe in modern

1548
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,420
parlance they should be sub volumes or what whatever right but I think this

1549
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,580
encryption is exactly is that example right because I five years ago you had

1550
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,660
to go learn a whole bunch about Lux and do it do it all yourself and customize

1551
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,100
it to get to get it at all and these days it's just a checkbox when you

1552
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:42,620
install Fedora
