00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Check this out West found it wiki house. It's an open source project to reinvent the way we make homes

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,300
It's being developed by architects designers engineers inventors manufacturers builders

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,440
Collaborating develop the best simplest most sustainable high-performance building technologies that anyone can use. This is kind of an awesome project

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,880
They're like on their fourth and a half iteration right now of it

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,080
This video gives you a little bit of details about it here

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,660
This is the team we're at the beginning of an industrial revolution which is allowing us to use the web and digital tools

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,100
To make it much much simpler to design homes that are customized to each of us

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,520
So they're showing a website where you go in and kind of customize the home and it creates the like the printing spec that can even

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,980
Be locally printed using digital manufacturing tools and then simply assembled even by small businesses and homeowners themselves

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,400
really robust sustainable beautiful homes that has the potential to fundamentally change the rules of

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,440
How we make houses in Britain instead of selling the land to just one developer

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,340
We divide sites up into plots to be bought or rented

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,780
Directly by local families at a price that they can afford together with the local planners

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,480
The community would develop an outline

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,600
Neighborhood plan and a basic set of design rules as long as you stay within the rules

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,440
You can build modify or extend without having to get any further planning permission from the council

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,800
That's residents are then free to create their own homes using any building method supported by not just one or even ten companies

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,760
But hundreds of companies so I watched a couple of videos they have on YouTube from a couple

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,520
One of the ones I watched was a couple that made a house and they said that there's the first time they've ever done anything

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,020
Like this, but the thing that was really awesome for them was that there were so many other community members that built a house before

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,720
Them where they had found something that didn't work quite right or made little changes

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
And so the by the time they were on version 4 another beyond the version they were even using

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,440
There were so many little things as they were so many like, oh, I'm so glad somebody thought of that

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm so glad somebody thought of that. It's awesome. And it's kind of like how you would share a 3d printing spec. Totally

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Really neat. So it's a wiki house dot CC

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,280
Yeah, I don't know

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,700
I part of me loves the whole tiny house thing because I think sometimes

28
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,100
People just by default think they need some huge palace to live in when you could probably get by with a lot less and have

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,860
A lot less to have to manage and keep up, you know, keep clean and keep on top of repairs

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,860
I think a small house could work for a lot of people

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,620
But if you're somebody like me, I'd have nowhere no idea where to start

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,460
Wiki house dot CC seemed kind of fun an open-source house. I'd like to see what some of these finished houses look like

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,060
Somebody build one and let us know. Yeah, there we go. Come on audience

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,820
This is Linux unplugged episode

35
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,620
188 for March 14th, 2017

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,740
Oh

37
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,380
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's so excited about Pi Day. It's borderline obnoxious

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,680
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. It is a big day today. Not just Pi Day

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,120
It's a major birthday of 23 years today and nobody's talking about it. Do you agree?

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, no, we literally had to fact-check it three different places because nobody's nobody's talking about it

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Well, we're gonna talk about today on the show. It's a big deal. We're gonna get into that. Plus, are you ready for the challenge?

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,960
I have no idea. I like that honest answer, Wes. On Pi Day

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,100
We thought what would be better than Mycroft on a Raspberry Pi?

44
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,160
How about Mycroft and Alexa on a cancel on a Raspberry Pi?

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,740
cancel

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:45,220
We're gonna try to load them both Mycroft and the echo software platform on a Raspberry Pi

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,900
Live on the show and see if we can create the ultimate

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,780
personal assistant powered by a Raspberry Pi on Pi Day plus we're gonna give you an update on some of our favorite open source projects that

49
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,120
we follow every single week and then

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,720
Despite Wimpy's denial

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,720
VR on Linux

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Had a big boost this week. It actually ladies and gentlemen, may be crossing into the legitimate territory

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,960
What what I know I I did not actually think I'd be saying that on this show anytime soon

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,880
But I we got everything from gaming to creating a VR Linux desktop

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,740
Yeah, and also those people who say AR is the future

56
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,020
We're gonna talk about that too wimpy

57
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,940
I mean, we'll be talking about that later on in the show and we're gonna wrap it

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,220
We're gonna wrap it wrap it all up with a celebration of 23 years of the official release of

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,740
The Linux kernel and only in the only way your Linux unplugged show could the only way so we got a really big show

60
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,300
So big so let's real big great show ever great best show ever

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,900
So let's bring in our mumble room to make it all happen time-appropriate greetings virtual lug how

62
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Hello everybody it is good

63
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,780
Alexa and stop. I'm not talking to her. Did you she's very eager to gosh?

64
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,860
I I feel like something to prove I feel like she's getting triggered more today than she ever has before

65
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,100
I think she wants to be in the show. She wants yeah, she should dial into the mumble room

66
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,620
Well guys I want to start with I we always like to open the show with some of our favorite open source project

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,620
And there's nothing too much higher on that list except for maybe comp isn't barrel

68
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,300
It's the matte desktop, and we have a big release version one dot one eight

69
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,140
released

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,060
just yesterday

71
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,900
Martin Wimperth, I'm not familiar with who Martin is but maybe wimpy could help us understand

72
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,740
What's new and mate one dot one eight hello wimpy hello there? How you doing good good?

73
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,980
And very excited about the new release it seems like the March towards gtk3 continues, right?

74
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,900
Well the March towards gtk3 or completing it. I should say yeah

75
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,460
So we're finally there as in everything is now only

76
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,540
buildable with gtk3 and

77
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,780
any of the remaining GTK to support code that we had kicking around has been ejected and

78
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,980
the

79
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,640
One dot one eight release has really been focused around

80
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,860
Cleaning up that gtk3 implementation. There's still a bit of work to do, but this is a huge step forwards

81
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,220
On a number of fronts bringing the whole underpinnings up to date

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,520
Fat and it looks like oh hi there. It looks like it's based on three dot fourteen is that right?

83
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,580
It supports gtk3 14 and up. Oh, I see that's what it. That's the lowest I see

84
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,140
That's the lowest it will support yeah, but it supports all the way up to three two two

85
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:50,060
Notifications now implemented awesome lock screen will load the user selected background very nice new features

86
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,460
Yeah, that one. I think is probably going to be about the most popular. Which one's that?

87
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,340
the

88
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,980
Setting the lock screen on to whatever the selected backdrop is rather than the system really really we've had people asking

89
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Things everyone notices I suppose

90
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
it's it's a curious one because

91
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,660
Where that where that image is set it runs in a in a

92
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,100
Process with elevated permissions, so the reason that we hadn't done it for such a long time is there were security considerations

93
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,260
So had to be done properly which it has been done

94
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,340
So now when you change your backdrop, and you lock the screen that is the backdrop

95
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,860
You'll see on the lock screen which is a small thing, but lots of people have been asking for that for ages

96
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,380
So this I believe also is landing in 1704 so anyone that will have a point to 1704

97
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,460
Will have a point to one dot one eight is it my m is that right am I getting that wrong?

98
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah, it has landed in fact. Oh it has already

99
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,300
Yeah, it's it's it's landed at some point today, but yeah, it's all in there now

100
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,620
So if you're running the up into Marte 1704 alpha

101
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,260
Yeah, and you apt update and apt upgrade you'll you'll get all of this stuff now now

102
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
Was there a debate to go directly to two?

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,900
Well, yeah, so yeah, yeah

104
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,620
I I was myself and the fedora maintainer were keen that we call this to do. Oh, yeah, okay?

105
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,260
That's my thought you know democracy is king

106
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,620
There was a 50-50 split on on the vote as to whether we were going to go to dot naught and I decided that

107
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,700
It wasn't worth it wasn't worth fighting over so step down

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,220
So this is one dot one eight

109
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,300
But this has got all of the features in it that we discussed when I was I was trying to push the agenda and say

110
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,100
That this should be a 2.0. Release. Well, I suppose it's it makes it seem less of a big change

111
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,460
Which is probably comfortable to imitate users and some just some degree to some. Yeah

112
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,380
Yeah, some of the other developers feel that it needs some a bigger significant

113
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,220
Step forward in terms of technology support for it to be a 2.0

114
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,300
So they're suggesting that the 2.0 will only come when?

115
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,540
When Wayland is supported so that could be some time

116
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,660
Interesting idea though. We get there interesting. That's the same thing as like that, you know, Linux 2.7

117
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,100
hundred and fifty

118
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,620
Yeah, it's gonna result in the same kind of ridiculous thing

119
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,740
Joe you had a point about the shifting sands of GTK. I want to hear that

120
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,980
Yes, so Martin good to speak to you on this show one of the many we've spoken to each other on

121
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,740
But GTK it seems to me is just a constantly shifting sand

122
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,140
Isn't it where you you you seem to not be able to be sure exactly?

123
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,660
Which one's going to be the stable version and stuff? So that must factor into your decisions

124
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,500
In terms of porting it to GTK 3 and finalizing things and making things stable as Marte is famously known for

125
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,820
Yeah, so the we've been you know

126
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,340
Struggling with keeping pace at the at the rate of change in the GTK 3 toolkit for a number of years

127
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,420
But with GTK 3 2 2 that is now

128
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,100
Behind us. So GTK 3 2 2 is now

129
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,420
That is now behind us. So GTK 3 2 2 is going to remain the same

130
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,100
There's not going to be a 3 2 4 3 2 2 is just going to get point releases that fix stuff

131
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,460
But no API or API changes as far as as far as I'm aware

132
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,700
so the Marte desktop is going to or at least what we've discussed is stick to GTK 3 2 2 now because

133
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,580
Because we can stabilize and coalesce around that and refine what we've been working towards

134
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,860
And there's a lot of good stuff that we can still enable

135
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,900
on top of GTK 3 2 2

136
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,780
And GTK 4 is just around the corner

137
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,820
But the GTK developers have made it clear that GTK 4 is going to be

138
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:07,580
a very much iterative development with lots of API and ABI changes in the early versions

139
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
and that they will

140
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,500
Make it clear when a GTK 4 release

141
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,420
Gets to an API stable version

142
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,900
So it's not how things have been in the past where they've you know attempted to maintain or that with GTK 3

143
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,100
This is part of the problem why that why they're changing this in GTK 4

144
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,180
But they're not going to try and maintain stability in GTK 4. It is going to be very much rapid and right

145
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,060
All things are going to change for quite some time. So

146
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,420
Not a platform we're going to target because we've been living with that for a number of years

147
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:49,180
And we now just want a quiet life and just want to just clean things up and maybe add a few features rather than keep on fighting

148
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
You know the constant change in the API

149
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,740
So I also had a little inclination that perhaps we should oh is it chillin? It's chillin, right?

150
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,940
Ubuntu chillin. We should follow up on that because was it was it two three weeks ago you and I were talking about it

151
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,420
And I think what sort of piqued your interest. Do you have any updates on that particular project for us?

152
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,100
Yeah, so um, i've i've spoken to a couple of guys from the chillin team

153
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,940
So when we last spoke whenever it was a few weeks back

154
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,020
They'd obviously announced that they had um forked. Uh,

155
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,660
Some big chunk of Marte and called it UK UI

156
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,780
And that they'd given it very much a windows-esque look and feel

157
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,620
And this was going to be the new default in uh, Ubuntu chillin, which is the distro that's specifically made for the Chinese market

158
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,300
Um and working with them what we've been able to do is instead of forking like a

159
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,780
We've been able to do is instead of forking like all the things we've now got that down to just seven packages

160
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,580
so they're forking seven packages and

161
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,140
I think two of them are actually

162
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
um, not so much forks but

163
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,460
derivative works, um in their own right so that they don't really count so there's five packages that are forks of Marte

164
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:13,580
Um, so what that means is that they're going to be sitting on top of most of the Marte stack with just a few packages

165
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,260
Um that they need so obviously they need their own session manager because they need to identify as their own desktop session

166
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,180
and

167
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,180
most of the other

168
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,340
Uh packages that they've forked things like i'm not quite sure how it's pronounced but peony or peony or something like that

169
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Which is their file manager?

170
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
which is forked from kaja and

171
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
um

172
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:43,980
That we're simply not going to accept the the changes that they've made upstream because they've basically made it look exactly like windows explorer

173
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,660
Which just doesn't fit with you know, what Marte is setting out to do

174
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,300
So there are some things that they're just going to fork they're going to maintain that themselves and it's fair enough

175
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,340
Um, but then most of the other stuff they're going to sit on all of the same underpinnings

176
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,500
So they will get to benefit from this new

177
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,980
Uh Marte release in 1704 because that's going to be the first release of Ubuntu chillin

178
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,580
That features the new uk ui desktop

179
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,540
So um, they get a new

180
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
new uh set of packages as well

181
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,340
So they uh, they've they've modified it to look more like explorer. That's interesting

182
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,380
I wonder if they'll also update it to include the new ads that windows 10

183
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,980
Oh, i'm kidding

184
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,220
So wimpy, how has it gone just communicating with them?

185
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,260
Has it been is it been fairly effective and efficient and they seem to be receptive to talking to you. Yeah

186
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah, it's been great. So they filed a bug in launchpad that outlined everything that they wanted to fork

187
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,780
um

188
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,420
and there's another guy who works on Ubuntu gnome and he's also one of the um,

189
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,460
Uh the community developers for on the on the desktop side of things as well

190
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,300
So jeremy beecher and he's he's been helping them as well. So we responded on the

191
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,660
um on their bug and basically said do you need to fork all of this stuff and here's some ideas about how you can

192
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
save yourself some effort and

193
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
just

194
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,820
Use some of the facilities that they exist in marte so that you don't have to fork everything

195
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,500
So we talked through there and and I said, you know, come and join us in irc. This is our channel

196
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,700
These are the people you want to talk to which they did

197
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,260
So we've had a good a good discussion with them and um, yeah, uh, I don't know that we'll be

198
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,380
Closely collaborating. I think they've got a lot on at the moment to try and get this first release out

199
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,420
And then after the first release out is out for them. I'm going to go back to them and see if I can get them more

200
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,260
More involved with with marta as a whole because obviously they're they're going to be using great chunks of it

201
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,700
And it'll be nice to see

202
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,220
If they get a lot of users on it, too

203
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,460
It'd be good to get some of their observations and bug fixes or at least bugs they find

204
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,620
I've heard there's quite a lot of people in china. Yeah, and there's quite a lot of people using Ubuntu

205
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,820
Yeah, definitely

206
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,260
China seems like you could get some good feedback and input at least if nothing else indeed indeed. That's fascinating

207
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,300
I I wanted to uh shift gears and talk about uh rising just for a second

208
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,660
But it was actually following up to something that uh poppy and wimpy

209
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,940
Were discussing on the uh latest episode of the ubuntu podcast of the new season. Yeah, and it's something we touched on too

210
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:24,220
A little bit and it's it's rising and I wanted to I wanted to pick your guys's brains. Uh, specifically around

211
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,300
We so your ubuntu podcast covered it and I think we discussed it on

212
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,260
It was either this last little linux action show or the one before I can't remember exactly because we pre-recorded a couple of them

213
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140
uh, and I I noticed that

214
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:43,260
Hoping you seem to sort of shrug it off. But the more i've thought about this. I really think that perhaps amd might be willing to make

215
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,620
a big

216
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,820
A big product differentiating change here. Uh, and so what do you think poppy? Do you think we could be?

217
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,620
Looking at the at the possibility of amd stepping up and saying we're going to take the amd control processor

218
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,860
We're going to take some of our binary blobs and we're going to open source them and not just for the desktop

219
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,220
But maybe also for server and other uses do you think it could happen?

220
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,700
I'd love to see it and I feel a bit jaded because I've heard

221
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,340
Numerous times that amd are going to do the next big thing and you know this next

222
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,420
Product that they're going to come out with it's going to be open source. It's all going to be clean and it's going to be

223
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,540
The thing that's going to kill nvidia or it's it's it's the thing you want to put in your computer and

224
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,620
I just don't I just don't because I don't trust them. I don't trust them

225
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,460
To deliver on what they keep saying they're going to deliver

226
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,140
But do you think it also betrays the fact that perhaps there has been some internal discussions and debating and they feel like it's something

227
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,540
They should do but I can't quite figure out how to pull the trigger

228
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,700
And that was exciting to be able to see, you know a conversation on reddit turn into a ceo level conversation

229
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,380
Yeah, that's great. And I hope it follows through. I hope it doesn't just die as yet

230
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:00,060
Another project internal to the company that you doesn't actually materialize or they realize well actually there aren't that many desktop linux users

231
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,340
So we don't really care. It just seems like even if they didn't even if they didn't care about the desktop

232
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:12,540
Even if they didn't care about the desktop if they just totally ignored the desktop the benefits of doing the server side for gpu-based

233
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,180
Tasks and entire server systems built using amd's whole platform

234
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,020
It feels like they would they would almost become the default for really reliable completely open

235
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,740
And and by the way by completely open also means auditable linux servers

236
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,340
I would love that to happen. I'm just not holding my breath. Yeah

237
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Yeah, okay. All right. It feels like to me and I hate to use this term because it kind of feels like a debug term

238
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,180
But in the post-snowden quote-unquote or the post vault 7 reality

239
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,620
If I want a highly confidential highly secure cloud server, I would like to have something that is

240
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,380
From the blobs that run the hardware all the way up to the code that runs my web server

241
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,220
And the web apps that run on top of it

242
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,300
I would like to be able to audit that especially if i'm a government institution or or a non-profit of some type that might be

243
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,300
In the political light. I feel like this is this was the market pressure would almost would almost just

244
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,580
Handsomely reward amd enough to make it worth it just in the server area alone. I could be wrong

245
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,700
Does anybody else in the moment have a sense of that before we move on?

246
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,580
I'm, pretty excited about ryzen, even though I don't have any intentions of buying. In fact, I may be buying a

247
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,540
A 1080 graphics card from nvidia pretty soon actually for just a vr, but i'll save that for later

248
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,460
All right, so what happens?

249
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,780
I share poppy skepticism because it said the same thing in 2009

250
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:42,300
And I think I kept believing that right up until vulkan came out. Yeah for every other platform, but amd

251
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Yeah, I I agree. Joe you were going to say something too

252
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,340
Yeah, I was going to say what happens when they do their next deal with microsoft or sony for playstation or xbox?

253
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,900
And have to put a processor in one of those

254
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,460
You can be sure right. They are not going to want that stuff to be open source, right?

255
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,980
Right. I just really would love to see some solid competition to intel because it's not just the graphics, right?

256
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,420
It could be it could be the whole platform would be so I agree

257
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,460
I'm trying not to get too excited about it, but just the idea and who knows how accurate it is and perhaps I

258
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,300
Sorry, chris in a dream world. Yes. I agree. I would love this. I would love for it to be yes

259
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
The comp the compute platform of choice, right?

260
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,820
Like whether it's you know, you could throw out your intel cpus throw out your proprietary nvidia drivers and you could go all in

261
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,100
amd and have your racks full of

262
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,660
CUDA cores doing all your compute and you could be super happy with everything being open source and auditable

263
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm

264
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,380
Yeah, imagine really 4k gaming and vr with uh open source amd drivers, right? That is surely the dream

265
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,180
Yes, joe joe you mispronounced ar there

266
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,620
There it is

267
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,620
We're getting there. We're getting there

268
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:04,140
Yeah, okay, um, so ryzen's an interesting development from amd, but I think it's most interesting, um in for server use because

269
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,100
What you're getting is something that's a little bit cheaper

270
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,620
Um almost equivalent, um in terms of compute power not quite intel can best it in in in most areas by just a smidge

271
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,980
But the big thing the big thing at the data center is is power

272
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,940
And this these new ryzen chips are significantly lower power than the equivalent intel. That's a great point

273
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:31,180
So I think that's where it matters and likewise if amd have any aspirations to

274
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,300
Uh make their uh cpus available through libre boot or core boot or whatever

275
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,260
Um, then it makes most sense in the server market because the linux desktop market share just isn't big enough to warrant them

276
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,780
Uh putting that time and effort in but they could be persuaded that on servers

277
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,300
There's there's some benefit to that imagine a world

278
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,260
Just just just because often you'll see well, why do we want commercial software on the linux?

279
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,060
Desktop, why do we care if we have more users for linux desktop? Maybe it should just be for us technical people

280
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,580
We'll have a haven of an os built for us. Oh, that sounds nice. Yeah, it does

281
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:14,700
But imagine for a moment if you will ladies and gentlemen, let's imagineer that adobe has released photoshop premiere and after effects on linux

282
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:22,860
If this is the if that if those applications existed on the linux desktop amd would probably be all in on doing this

283
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,420
This would be an obvious decision for them because they would want to dominate that workstation market

284
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,580
So that's why I say like I don't I at the end of the day

285
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,660
I don't necessarily want a desktop full of closed source applications on my linux desktop

286
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,940
But if we got a couple of market dominating applications for a couple of segments

287
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,660
Then all of a sudden there is a lot more reason to invest in the desktop platform and right now our best in

288
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,820
Is the server or mobile market and we hope to god that there's a trickle down effect that applies to us desktop users

289
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,280
That's what we have right now. And if we had a couple of just totally category owning applications

290
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,820
that demanded

291
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:08,380
Great hardware. You would see companies like amd tripping over themselves to deliver this and we're just we just we're not there yet

292
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,940
What were we talking about dream worlds a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, I know well, even if you look at it

293
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,300
Seems like it should be an adobe's best interest unless they feel like distributing uh photoshop via the microsoft app store one day

294
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,460
It seems like it should be obvious

295
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,180
They should be seeing the same lights that valve is seeing the same warnings

296
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,740
But we're going to get there actually in just a moment. Uh, but

297
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,140
Yeah, yeah, maybe I maybe my uh, maybe my linux goggles are just too rose-colored for me to understand why they don't do it

298
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,020
But I tell you what, uh, there is like a suggestion why they don't do it. What is it?

299
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,940
Package distribution is a massive pain. Yeah, I know but it's that that is actually solvable

300
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,060
It is it really is it's not perfect, but it's it's not only is there things like snaps

301
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:56,460
But there's also just target an lts of buntu. I was gonna say that does seem to be like a it's not ideal

302
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,500
But it does mostly just every other distro will figure it out

303
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
They would have to be like, you know

304
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,740
Dealing with a bunch of hate from us to like so many people like oh, why are you picking me?

305
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,380
I disagree. I wouldn't I agree deal with hate from a very small minority people who would never run their software and the professional market

306
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,660
Would not care

307
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,020
Yeah, plus stick it on ubuntu and what's going to happen people are going to port it to arch and exactly

308
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,340
Yeah, there'll be an aur in 15 minutes that pulls down the deb and installs it on my arch box

309
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,780
That's just you know, that's why also if you look at what valve did where they just created an ubuntu runtime inside their directory structure

310
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,300
And now they just did they just held their directory structure and they just they just held their directory structure

311
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,180
And now they just did they just held they have all of their folks play target to that and that works fine

312
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,340
Adobe could do that adobe could create a horribly out of date runtime environment full of libraries

313
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,080
They do not take advantage of the latest features of my system and they could target that and make applications

314
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,540
For all the linux desktops that would still be 20 times better in performance than they are on windows

315
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
snaps is a new lsb

316
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,380
I would also take a snap. I would even I would even take an app image

317
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,060
I I I tell you there is hardware out there now like the oryx pro and the xps 15

318
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,780
That if I had a competent video editing software and and and compositing software besides blender

319
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I would pull the trigger. I would pull the trigger

320
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,140
I would I would not be doing the show right now. I'd be buying that hardware. I would pull the trigger so hard

321
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,860
I just would love to see it and then maybe that we'd have a viable platform, you know for real creative professionals

322
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,340
You can put some elementary on there if you had that lts support. I love that. I love it

323
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,980
So we're gonna we're gonna get into valve here in a moment and also our old friend sync thing

324
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,380
Some interesting. Yeah, some interesting numbers from syncing in a while since he's come around, but yeah, it's back. Yeah. Yeah

325
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,660
It's back in town. Yes visiting the pacific northwest all synced up

326
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,580
We're gonna sync up with yeah, that's right. I see what you did there west that's that's pretty good

327
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,840
First we're going to talk about linux academy at linuxacademy.com

328
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,060
Unplugged go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial a free seven-day trial of a platform

329
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,820
to help expand your mind about linux linux the nitty itty bitty details and also

330
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,560
The really big heady stuff built around linux like that open stack azure containers

331
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,140
Infrastructure management they make it all really accessible

332
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,740
whatever it is, if you're just learning how to manage a firewall on a linux box or

333
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,660
Browse the directory or if you want to go all in on the really huge topics

334
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,220
They've got self-paced in-depth video courses

335
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,140
They have labs give you hands-on experience instructor mentoring when you need it

336
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,140
I don't know what to call it because the platform feels like something that is

337
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,780
Like like like a platform sounds like something you do to to to connect a whole bunch of stuff and sell stuff

338
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:43,020
Like it's not a it's it is a learning. It is well, you know what? It's an online academy. That's what it is

339
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,660
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of linux azure and aws open stack and devops

340
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:57,580
A sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed meet linux academy an online linux and cloud training platform

341
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:05,020
That uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs to give you real world experience for a wide range of skills

342
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,020
Trained for your certification learn the latest devops tools and grow your skill set to do better work

343
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:18,700
Linux academy is not just a video library our scenario based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on

344
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:25,740
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification or promotion at work

We add new training every week. So you'll always be up to date on the latest tech

346
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:38,220
Sysadmins of every experience level use linux academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the linux ecosystem. You should too

347
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I've never installed gnu

348
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,500
linuxacademy.com

349
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,580
Plugs where you go to support the show sign up for a free seven-day trial check out some of their downloadable comprehensive study guides

350
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,900
The vibrant community packed full of jupiter broadcasting members the course scheduler that works with your busy schedule

352
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,880
When you need it at linuxacademy.com

353
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,620
Slash unplugged. Okay before we get into the sync thing. Hey, hey wes. How's it going out there?

354
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:17,660
Yeah, yeah, you're doing it. He's got a raspberry pi. Why are you doing it in the other room wes?

355
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,140
Are you using the tv out there for your screen hilarious? That's awesome. I feel like I should take a picture of that

356
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,300
So, uh, what do you have right now on the raspberry pi right now? We've got a minecraft

357
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,660
It should maybe be working. I might need to restart it. I just plugged in the microphone

358
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,660
I brought for it. Oh good thinking, but it's all paired up with their online service now

359
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,780
So good so the step is alexa if that's working

360
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,620
So the minecraft portions might might be working right? That's awesome. All right. Well, we'll check back in good work

361
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,420
I mean, that's it. Nice. That's a nice that's that's a pretty good accomplishment right there wes i'm impressed already

362
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,700
So sync thing has published some I don't I I think this is new data dot sync thing net

363
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,300
It's new to me at least and they're showing the total number of unique users that have reporting turned on which by the way

364
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,740
Not on my default

365
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,700
uh, and uh, it's fascinating because what it basically shows is a

366
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,660
consistent with the exception of uh, the release from dot 9 to dot 10 a consistent trend line of growth

367
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,220
Uh new users joining every single day growing

368
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,660
Uh each version getting more downloads than the last version files managed per device growing

369
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,540
Memory usage growing. Haha, I get it. So, uh, I thought actually

370
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
in in the age of of

371
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,660
Uh constantly talking about how dropbox is this or dropbox is that or libre vault's gonna be or libre vault can't be

372
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,260
I thought it was interesting to go back and revisit our old friend sync thing and see how active it actually appears to be

373
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,260
um with uh

374
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,500
Nearly now 30 000 unique users that have data reporting on per day

375
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
Active not bad

376
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,260
Yeah

377
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,220
Yeah, I saw some discussion about this too. Like some folks are saying there's not very many relay servers still so uh,

378
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,620
Uh one guy's got one going on digital ocean and it's like on the san francisco data center

379
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,300
It's like one of the most popular on the west coast

380
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,060
Oh, wow, not that many running

381
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,860
So people are working on setting up containers with the relays in there to help make it easier for people to throw those up

382
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,540
Yeah, have you messed with it at all sync thing? Have you ever have you been I still have a couple things going

383
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
They've just been running. Yes, uh

384
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,620
Very much in the background. So this is actually a good motivator for me to kind of

385
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,820
Check back in with that. See I mean it's all been working because I use it

386
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,340
Uh, but really it's just a way to easily shuffle files around right now. Mm-hmm

387
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Wimpy, you know i've got to ask. Oh, go ahead

388
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,940
I use it every day. You are you are producer michael. Ladies and gentlemen to the rescue every day. Tell me about it

389
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,540
I use it to sync all my some config files for multiple computers and also for a

390
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,260
Custom to do system that I built and uh, it syncs through my phone through multiple computers and a pie

391
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
on a pie now is there um

392
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,180
Um, yeah

393
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Is there ever any issue of like, uh?

394
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,220
You have the same program running on two computers at once and the and the config files are getting written to by both programs

395
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,140
Uh, no because you can set it to be one as a master. So if there's a conflict it always pulls from the main one

396
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,900
That's it

397
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,220
That's exactly what i've thought about using sync thing because the nice thing about sync thing as opposed to something like dropbox

398
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,020
Is you can have sync thing look at any folder on your file system

399
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,060
So multiple sync folders. Yes. Yeah

400
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,340
I and the best part is that you don't have to have like a specific

401
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,460
Um folder for this you can just pick one random. So I don't I don't have a sync thing

402
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,220
Uh infrastructure in this like you just go in and say you can actually

403
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,780
Create like ids for each folder so you can have a different name for the different folder on the thing

404
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
As long as the sync idea is the same

405
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,700
That's a good tip

406
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,300
Wimby do you have anything to contribute to the sync conversation before we move on because I always go to you

407
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
But I don't know if there's much you have

408
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,140
I haven't used sync thing in ages because I switched to a different solution for what I was using

409
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,740
Any updates or anything you want to share with the class or nothing in particular?

410
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,180
No, not about sync thing. I can't add anything about syncing in general. I can't remember what you switched to

411
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,860
Uh, well my my use case for sync thing and bit torrent sync before it was to sync

412
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:12,540
Dot files and stuff like that and i'm now using yadim, which is yet another dot manager and uh, that's git based

413
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,980
And that's right brilliant. That's what i've been thinking about using too is something git based

414
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,460
I hadn't had a oh look into that. Thank you. Yeah, it was great. All right, so let's talk about your favorite subject. Um,

415
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,700
I feel like we well, you know, I feel like we can we can talk about it now

416
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,580
We can you want do you want i'll give you a little more time i'm gonna give you a little more time

417
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,260
Let's talk about vr on linux. Oh, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it

418
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,100
I got an htc vive sitting in the other room right now. So I feel like uh, I just got to bring it all out

419
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,500
Uh, so valve starting with this particular story not necessarily directly vr but probably going to play in a little bit valve has hired

420
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,540
Another developer who a well a well-known one too keith packard

421
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,260
He's worked on the x windows system in the past

422
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,100
He worked for intel then he moved to hp and now he's at valve to continue development on the linux driver stack for graphics

423
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,820
So that's a bit of news. Yeah, it's a bit of news right there. So that's something that I thought was worth mentioning also

424
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,100
um

425
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,620
Steam vr has gotten some update builds for steam vr beta now with linux support. Ladies and gentlemen

426
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,940
valve has pushed out linux support for their steam vr

427
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,900
And uh, they've set up a couple of different resources that I want to point you to if you're trying to make this work

428
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,980
Number one is they have a github issues tracker for the valve software account

429
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Which I have linked in the show notes

430
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,580
And there are some community threads in the steam vr group specific to linux. I have those linked as well

431
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,700
If you're on arch, I also have a warning for you

432
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,620
It looks like there is currently an issue with the invidia beta driver

433
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,540
Which is required to use steam vr and the module failing to build for the arch kernel 4.10

434
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,420
So if you're on arch and you want to play with steam vr

435
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,380
It looks like you need to use the lts kernel on arch for now because that module will build

436
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,820
That's that seems to be one issue right now because you have to be on a fairly recent

437
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,740
Kernel and you have to be on the beta version of the invidia driver and you have to have something that supports balkan

438
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,380
Balkan so that is uh, that is sort of the state of steam vr right now

439
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,380
And it looks like also there is sort of uh at the same time

440
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,220
A really interesting write-up about somebody who decided to modify a few programs

441
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,020
Chain a few things together and create a vr workspace for linux

442
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,660
And it's kind of fascinating how he did it. He said first

443
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,380
I needed to figure out a way to capture the images running on my desktop

444
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,460
There's a lot of ways to do that. So I ran the xypher display server

445
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Then I had this thing set up to take screenshots which used some python scripts

446
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,740
The screenshots are handled and are base64 encoded

447
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,560
He made those images available for a smartphone with through a data distribution service. He chose crossbar

448
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,960
The crossbar system is a networking platform for real-time applications

449
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,320
It has a static web server built in which can be used to distribute javascript to a smartphone

450
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,120
So then his smartphone client then connects to crossbar or whatever

451
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,360
Whatever the in-between thing is could be the linux client could be anything connects to crossbar

452
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,240
It feeds the images from something uh from from the system and it titles them as topics

453
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,800
So then crossbar is configured around the web server and it runs on port 80 80

454
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,160
Then you point your machine at that on the same network you open, you know ip address port 80 80 and it's set up to run

455
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
linux desktop applications

456
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,000
In vr now, I just blew through all that because there's no way i'm going to walk you through all of the python code

457
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,960
That he set up and stuff like that

458
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,240
But we do have it linked in the show notes a way to take individual apps

459
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,440
And project them into vr using any kind of anything from the vive to google cardboard

460
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,560
And uh, so he looks at things like stellaris and uh and apps like that to uh as a way to take advantage of this now

461
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,040
having listened to uh, episode one of season 10 of the ubuntu podcast

462
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,040
I heard wimpy talk about his uh experience with augmented reality and I heard wimpy proclaim

463
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,280
That augmented reality was the future and the vr was not going to be the future and I have to I have to strongly

464
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,000
strongly disagree because a I will present that I believe what wimpy was experiencing was in fact virtual reality and not

465
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,080
Augmented reality because there was no jet engine in the room. It created the entire jet engine from a virtual reality

466
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,160
So a I would I would argue wimpy did not in fact experience augmented reality and b

467
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,480
Are two which I forget which mechanism i'm using I would argue that

468
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,120
That ar and vr are not mutually exclusive and that they may be more closer to the same thing than that's not a coke

469
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,000
And pepsi competition is what i'm trying to say now. I look at this. I look at steam vr

470
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,640
I look at the fact that you have even just these

471
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,400
easily

472
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,000
Put together methods to put some sort of rudimentary vr experience together and I say to you with htc vive shipping

473
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,160
With steam vr shipping and with systems like this that even work with simple applications like vr cardboard simple

474
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
vr has arrived for linux

475
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,200
With all due respect chris you're wrong. Okay, tell me

476
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
That's why we like yeah

477
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,200
Is an ar system because while the jet engine isn't in the room you can see through the glasses and the yeah

478
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,880
um, the user interface is on the wall so you can glance up at the wall and

479
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,600
Navigate through the menus. They're over on the wall over there. So you could leave them on the wall

480
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,280
Oh, I like that

481
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
But couldn't they do that in a virtual room just as well

482
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,240
You could but you can't see what's what's around you because with vr, but the jet engine isn't there?

483
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,360
No, but with vr nothing is there with

484
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,160
The table what you made everything around you is there okay what you may not have gleaned from the the demo that I

485
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I got to do was

486
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,000
Uh, the use case is i'm a jet engine repair man

487
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,880
There is a jet engine in the room

488
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,720
And I want to bring up this vr overlay sure and the service manuals in front of me

489
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,800
as part of

490
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,820
the additional context to what i'm doing and the idea here is that as a maintenance

491
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,840
engineer you have access to stuff in front of you immediately and

492
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,320
And you can reference that and the hope is that there will be fewer human errors when you're doing these sort of maintenance

493
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,440
Operations because all of the information you need is available to you and you can check out

494
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,360
Uh where the parts are on the virtual model before you actually go and start, you know

495
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,800
Spanning the real engine. I like that. I would I would say two things. Number one. I would say, uh,

496
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,920
Uh, I feel like you could still do all of that in vr. You would have a headset on you wouldn't see through it

497
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,680
But there would be sensors that would be aware of the physical shape of the object

498
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,560
And they would that physical shape would be represented in the virtual reality that would be proportional to the actual object

499
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,160
But that said i'm really just playing devil's advocate because to me ar does seem to make way more sense

500
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,040
Especially in the industrial applications where you have a known setup

501
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
It's maybe a factory or it's a jet engine or whatever

502
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,360
It's it's a reactor even and but it is it is always in this spot in the room

503
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,020
It is always this dimension. It always has these components. It always has these attributes

504
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,500
And and that to me seems like a much more achievable

505
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,000
Practical a practical application of this technology simply because

506
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,600
Those variables are locked down and they're known quantities when you have people's homes

507
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:42,080
where you'll never know the layout and the lighting is always going to be different and the colors are always going to be different and

508
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,800
The and all of these all of these random variables. I think that's where ar begins to break down and vr will be stronger

509
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,600
Can I just find an analogy that I often like to go to right and that is with networking

510
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Okay

511
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,640
It took quite a few years for us to get

512
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,760
wired networking perfect with the tcp ip stack and all that kind of stuff and we got to gigabit and

513
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
And all that kind of stuff and now that's working perfectly

514
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
and beyond and then

515
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:17,120
In parallel we were also working on wireless and we got to um, you know g and n and then ac and beyond

516
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,360
and it feels like

517
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,640
ar is wireless wi-fi and

518
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,040
Vr is wired and they're kind of two ways to look at the same. That's how I see it

519
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,160
That's a that's a great analogy. I really do see it as two almost complementary technologies in some sense

520
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
They are complementary, but they're not the same

521
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but the wireless isn't the same as wired, but they they're still complementary and you you kind of

522
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,080
Need to to build that base of virtual reality first I feel and perfect that

523
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,320
And then once you have that then you introduce cameras and blending of that into the rest of reality

524
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,020
And and that's when it's going to be truly useful. Also, don't you think virtual reality seems more applicable to entertainment?

525
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:04,120
Games movies porn perhaps whereas augmented reality seems more applicable to industrial applications

526
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,780
Or getting getting work done or even here in the studio west wouldn't it be nice to have ar

527
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,820
Overlaid on the equipment when you're setting up for tech snap. Absolutely

528
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,020
I want to jump in here because there's there's a key point that you're missing and and you're right you're talking about

529
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:23,620
Using it in the home, right? So at the moment if you've got a vive you've got to blindfold yourself and tether yourself to a computer

530
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,740
Yep, and then stand in a room big enough that can accommodate all of the other poles and things

531
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Yeah

532
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:37,380
Yeah, so you need a very much actually that's that is legitimately a problem. Yeah, so you talk about entertainment

533
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,940
I don't think any of that is particularly entertaining and also it's kind of solitary because

534
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:49,220
Doing that with two people. Basically, you're just going to chin each other aren't you? I mean you you're going to be walking around blind

535
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,020
Hang on. Hang on wimpy. Hang on yours. You're trying to tell me that people don't want to play games on their own

536
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,140
Connected to a billion other people in the world

537
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,620
Uh now, I know they like to play with the other person in the room

538
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,540
Well, I I mean, let's not let's not forget I two

539
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,780
Really apparently smart individuals would seem to think people are very interested in this and that would be mark zuckerberg and gabien

540
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,140
They both seem to agree that people are going to want to put these full visors on and be completely

541
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,140
Lost in this virtual holodeck

542
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,740
So yeah, it's like you're sitting in front of your workstation your battle station. It's it's very similar. There are a few people

543
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,540
There is there's a niche of people who are going to want to do that

544
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,620
But probably more mainstream is more like the wii where it's kind of more cartooning

545
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:37,780
You've got these motion controllers and and now with the switch and stuff like that. So it feels like there are two markets there

546
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,340
But the the ar headset I had on a couple of weeks ago

547
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,900
Was was a helmet it you you wore it like um a hard hat. Okay?

548
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,900
Um, there were no cables. There were no wires. The whole thing was self-powered running a boon

549
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,860
And and I wasn't blindfolded. I could see everyone and everything around me

550
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
And I was also able to see

551
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,220
The 3d images that this thing was projecting into a space that I could move around it and interact with it

552
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,420
That to me is light years more compelling than being

553
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
tethered and blindfolded and

554
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:22,660
Not being able to see what's going on. And whilst I agree. There's an application for vr for gaming. I I can totally see that

555
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,220
At the moment. I haven't actually seen any compelling game. I'm not a big gamer, but I haven't seen any compelling games

556
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,540
That utilize vr at the moment. We just have a shitload of tech demos

557
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,860
I-racing is amazing. I but I think wimby. I did one compelling. Yeah, I kind of take your point there

558
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,160
I take your point there overall to be that is true. Like I I can't I can't I can't articulate

559
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:52,100
The absolutely killer app for vr. I I am interested in this why it's just really quickly blasted through it a few minutes ago

560
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,100
I am kind of interested in

561
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,860
In what I could do with vr and and my desktop just for a little bit

562
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:06,100
Do with vr and and my desktop just from like a maybe a content creation standpoint

563
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,660
But that's so far down the road. It doesn't really seem

564
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,420
And ar may be even better for that. I don't I grant you I can conceptualize the the real good use cases for ar

565
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,420
Uh much easier and that's why i've been more of a kind of more of on that side of the fence

566
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,060
But I i've come to see it more like joe's with joe's analogy is wireless and an ethernet

567
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:30,660
Uh, I I think vr the time the time I was really blown away by vr

568
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,880
It was sort of a hippie good feeling experience where I I got the oculus dk2

569
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,300
I put it on my head. I put on headphones and there's like tech demos same stuff tech demos

570
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,100
And so what tech demo did I try? Well, I tried they go float on a raft in the middle of the ocean tech demo

571
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,700
and um, I think it's in part because I had had headphones on so it was a more immersive experience, but

572
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,180
I I took that off after five minutes and I felt like I just meditated for 30 minutes

573
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,220
It was a really powerful sort of like holy shit. I really kind of

574
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
not all of me, but

575
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:06,740
50 percent of me maybe even 40 percent of me felt like I was actually on a raft in the middle of the ocean

576
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,820
And that was uh, that was a pretty intense experience. It took you out of where you were

577
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,620
Yeah, because I was actually in this room. Yeah, but it uh, that was a pretty so and then and then I

578
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,020
Then because I was so impacted by it. I then wanted everybody around me to try it

579
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,300
So I then I put the helmet on there. I try this. Oh, you think it's crazy

580
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,980
People were generally pretty impressed. Uh, I saw intense experiences a second

581
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,220
Um, what was it that made vhs successful over beta max?

582
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,460
And what was it that made uh blu-ray successful over hd dvd?

583
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,820
Speaking of intense experiences that you touched on earlier chris

584
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,580
It's it you know, it's it's not a comfortable topic for most people to talk about but it's very

585
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,600
Very possible that porn is going to drive what becomes the next

586
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
uh, yeah

587
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,240
In the case of hd dvd and in blu-ray that was sony spending billions of dollars and getting

588
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,880
Uh exclusivity deals with movie companies

589
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,120
That's true, too

590
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,320
That is you know

591
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,200
We will we all we will all just look back at this in five years and laugh at all of our of our floundering

592
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,200
To figure it all out. But yeah

593
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,000
Okay, so I we just got a note from uh, dan for techsnaps. There's a blizzard west. There's a blizzard over there

594
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,920
That's uh, so we're gonna pick the pace up

595
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:25,000
But I do want to celebrate the 23rd year anniversary or the birthday if you will of linux 1.0

596
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,880
And then we'll follow up on west's challenge over there. So before we jump into the rest of the show, let me thank ting

597
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,080
Thank you ting. There you go. Thanks. They're the best. All right linux.ting.com. Well, we're basically done

598
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,240
What you you didn't know that ting is a is a mobile service provider super simple

599
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,080
Have you been six dollars a month for the line guys and you just pay for what you use? It's amazing

600
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,840
Go to linux.ting.com and check them out. They have such a simple

601
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,800
I really feel like it's almost too good to be true

602
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,480
Like this can't be possible if I hadn't been a customer for like two and a half years now

603
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,360
I'd tell you this can't be true. I didn't believe it. This can't be true, but it's true

604
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,800
It's actually how they're structured. They're so first of all, they're owned by two cows

605
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,000
So this is like they've been around for a while

606
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,480
They know how to do this kind of stuff and they've set up an mvno network where they have cdma and gsm

607
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,560
You get to pick from it, whichever one works better for you. You pay six dollars a month plus your usage

608
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,480
Whatever uncle sam takes that's it for a line. That's it. It's really nice. They got great customer service. Go check them out

609
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,960
They also have a blog right now on the most

610
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,720
well

611
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,960
Capable is probably a generous thing. I was gonna say the best smartphones for under a hundred dollars. I'm gonna say the best

612
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,720
Capable smartphones under a hundred dollars. Yeah, check it out. They have it at their blog. Just do us a favor and start

613
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,080
By going to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged show

614
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,560
so

615
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,240
These are the final moments of the show west. I know you're doing great. You got a lot going on

616
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,680
So what I want to do

617
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,820
Is i'm going to give you a little time by celebrating the 23rd birthday

618
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,640
That's of linux 1.0. Yeah 1.0 came out on march 14th

619
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,620
1994 and what I decided to do to sort of celebrate this moment. I was trying to think what could we what could we really do?

620
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,140
I wanted to do a little time machine

621
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,580
I wanted to do a little time machine and i'm going to play i'm going to play an interview on this show

622
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,500
I would be willing to bet I I got a guess nobody i'd be willing to bet nobody

623
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,140
Has seen this before it's possible

624
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,820
But i'd be willing to bet you haven't because this was taken from a live recording of cnn

625
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,140
recorded to vhs

626
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,180
And uploaded by a dude to youtube recently

627
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,700
I've never seen it before and I and it's it's great because it's linus around

628
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,180
1997 98 if from what I can kind of grok

629
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,740
And it's it's so awesome because the clip starts out in the typical

630
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,660
Do you worry about bill gates? Does bill gates worry about you?

631
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,140
Is mike, you know this whole threat model and you could tell him the answer bill gates might be worried about linux

632
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,900
But linus ain't worried about microsoft. Do you think that bill gates worries about you?

633
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,380
No

634
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:04,460
Um, I think he thinks about linux a lot because I just think that he's a person who likes to be in control

635
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,620
I mean microsoft is it's his baby

636
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,380
and

637
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
he worries about anything that

638
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,540
Keeps his baby from being number one and linux is one of those things

639
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:21,580
I don't think he really really worries deep down because he can always look at and look at his pile of cash and then say

640
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,660
Okay, i'm, okay

641
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,460
So do you see that?

642
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,900
Somewhere down the line that linux is going to be bigger than microsoft

643
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,660
I think this microsoft is going to be smaller than microsoft. Oh

644
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,740
that

645
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,220
Microsoft is obviously in an enviable position from a market sense right now

646
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,380
But at the same time this is what what's called despotism to control a resource

647
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:53,580
And that's what happened in the old west when when people control the resource of water and became very rich in the process

648
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,700
It's a powerful tool for for making money

649
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,300
But it does have one downside and the one downside is that

650
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,180
It never lasts forever and when when it breaks as a tool

651
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,820
Uh, you've lost everything

652
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,060
That field that that was pretty good. That was that was that was late 90s

653
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:19,900
That was late 90s, uh linux was just a baby back then but starting to get some server traction

654
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,160
So now let's fast forward to 2001

655
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,260
about uh

656
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,300
About four or five six years out from the mobile revolution

657
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,660
Yeah before android before ios and uh linus sits down with uh charlie rose

658
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,580
Or a stupid question to ask will linux supplant windows?

659
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:44,220
It's a hard question to answer. I don't know if it's a smart question to ask. Why is it hard to answer?

660
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,300
I mean either well, it's

661
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:53,340
This just be a niche operating system that I I think linux has a very strong future on the desktop actually

662
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,260
It's a desktop

663
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:01,820
Including the desktop. I mean linux already has like a quarter of the uh web server market or more

664
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,860
So so in certain markets linux is very strong today. The desktop is obviously for a lot of reasons

665
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,940
It's a very interesting market

666
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,900
And it's also very obviously a market that microsoft completely dominates today

667
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,420
And makes a lot of money dominating

668
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,500
Uh, and it's a market that a lot of people have tried to enter I mean apple

669
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,180
IBM tried with os2

670
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,140
Uh a lot of the unix vendors tried and the only reason

671
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,420
Like your average person doesn't even know that they tried is that they failed so horribly

672
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,660
And uh, the reason I I think linux actually has a chance

673
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,580
and

674
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:50,620
Why I feel in five years the situation will be different is that linux kind of works around the market it

675
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,980
A lot of people are very interested in the desktop

676
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:59,180
So a lot of people will be working on all the applications going on the desktop making it look nice

677
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,540
And you can really see the the changes that have been going on in the last few years now

678
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,540
He was close, you know, he says you know

679
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,100
I want linux to take off on the desktop in the next few years

680
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:14,460
But there was something he said in there that was very accurate and that was linux works around the market

681
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,740
And so it's I think that with that sort of mindset that uh when he talks about this next thing

682
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,700
I thought this was fascinating linus says

683
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,380
What would be most disappointing for him about linux in the future?

684
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,460
Would be if it all went exactly how he expected it would go

685
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,420
I don't control the thing. I'm actually the

686
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:40,860
The single nicest thing about linux as far as i'm concerned has been how it has evolved in ways. I hadn't expected it to

687
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,640
People are doing things with linux that I never envisioned

688
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,580
People are doing things linux that i'm frankly

689
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
Not that interested in that's fine

690
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,740
And it's very interesting to see how people use linux even if they use linux in ways that I would never use it

691
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,060
So i'm hoping that I mean in five years

692
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,380
If I were to make a prediction right now

693
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,340
Which i'm not going to if that prediction actually came true i'd be really disappointed part of it

694
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:10,940
Because there ought to be unexpected. Yeah, a lot of the fun has been that people have done things. I never expected

695
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:17,180
I wonder if android would fall into that because that was that was about five years out from from android being announced

696
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:24,220
A world before smartphone. Yeah, isn't that something and so I wonder if android would fall into that category. So here we are

697
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:30,140
23 years later this day in history march 14 1994 linux 1.0.0 was released

698
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:37,980
Of course, it was 91 really when version zero zero. What was it zero dot zero zero two, I think was announced by linus

699
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:43,500
So that's some people celebrate different days, but I think if you go by the 1.0 release that's today pi day

700
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:49,820
Especially where here, you know, it's starting to become a little more serious and the you know, like the enterprise server thing

701
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,620
Yeah, the linux we know today. Yeah. Yeah

702
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,980
Yeah, uh, I will have some links to some of those videos

703
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,500
Uh, yeah, because I was doing some trolling to find those I had not seen those interviews before

704
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,300
Linus was on charlie rose to promote a book

705
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,260
Yeah, let me see if you know what? Let me see. I don't know if I have the original beginning

706
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
But that is actually kind of a fascinating

707
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,860
That's a fascinating aspect of it is I in fact

708
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:18,620
I think I made i've created like a linus folder now where I just have interviews with linus torvalds

709
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:24,780
And uh, yeah, here it is. Here's part one where I think he's introduced as as with as amongst other things an author

710
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,700
Oh, we don't need the old charlie rose intro wow, although it's so 90s it's almost perfect it's so

711
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,100
Actually, it's kind of what it is now that's horrible

712
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,540
Charlie rose

713
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:48,300
Linus torvalds was just a 21 year old student in 1991 when he created linux the groundbreaking operating system for computers

714
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:56,220
After developing the system, he posted it on the internet for free inviting users to download share and modify

715
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,500
Its popularity has skyrocketed over the last few years. There are currently more than 12 million

716
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:10,000
In addition tech stalwarts including sun microsystems oracle and ibm have begun incorporating it into their operations

717
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,160
Today torvalds is hailed as a hero by the open source community

718
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,220
His new book is quote just for fun the story of an accidental revolutionary

719
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,400
There you go. I have that book just for fun. Yep

720
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,640
19 uh

721
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,840
Was it uh?

722
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Or 2001 when that book came out 2001

723
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,640
Wow, it's so weird to look back. It's so weird to look back at a different time. Mm-hmm

724
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,960
How long how young linus looked so how young so how young?

725
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,200
All right. So I thought that was fun and happy birthday to version 1o of the linux kernel

726
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,720
And thank you to linus for continuing to work on it for so long. It's a fascinating interview

727
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,160
I will try to get links to the entire ones in the show notes west before we check in on the

728
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,020
mycroft echo challenge

729
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,400
Let's thank digital ocean if you want to run your own infrastructure

730
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,080
Maybe you want to run jarvis or maybe you just want to run your own webmail client or heck

731
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:07,200
Just a sync thing instance digital ocean could have you coverage the simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

732
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,400
To spin up a super fast linux rig on their super nice infrastructure all ssd storage

733
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,000
40 gigabit e connections into them hypervisors, of course the hypervisors run linux running kvm

734
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,760
They got data centers all over the world and they have the world's best interface

735
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,520
Other people are like trying to adapt and compete with digital ocean

736
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,720
But I I think they can't actually compete with digital ocean because digital ocean's interface was created by an organism from the future

737
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,960
That doesn't actually take our corporeal form

738
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:42,080
And what they have done is they've interfaced directly with the digital ocean computers and they have coded right into their editors

739
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,040
This amazing interface. It's the only thing that explains it

740
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,560
And then thanks to a time flux vortex

741
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,120
They're able to pull in this main this code for this amazing api that makes it all simple now

742
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,360
The the I like to mention the interface because it's great

743
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
But once you actually start working with digital ocean

744
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,880
You're going to be using the api even if you don't know what an api is

745
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,720
You're going to end up using it because it's so great so straightforward so simple so bootiful

746
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:11,360
Check them out at digital ocean.com. The pricing is to die for if you want to go hourly check this out

747
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:19,280
Three cents an hour two gigs of ram two core processor a 40 gigabyte ssd and three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour

748
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,720
three cents

749
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,440
That's crazy. Like they have one-click deployments of like an entire ubuntu lts rig with docker

750
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,120
You could try out sync thing or set up one of those syncing relay nodes the discovery nodes in seconds

751
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,680
And just try it out at three cents an hour

752
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,520
It's and and if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a ten dollar credit, right?

753
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,080
In the time it takes you to complain there's not enough relay servers

754
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,360
You could have one going on do use our promo code do unplug to support the show get a ten dollar credit

755
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,000
You just go over to digital ocean.com you sign up

756

757
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,560
Very much appreciated digital ocean dot com and thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

758
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,320
And thank you to everybody for using the promo code do unplugged

759
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,280
All right, wes

760
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,680
I noticed you're sitting here at the laptop. You're not at the raspberry pi anymore

761
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,440
I assume you have an ssh connection. Oh, yeah

762
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,280
Oh, yeah

763
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,160
What are we running as our base linux distro? We are running. Uh, it looks like a fork of raspian

764
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,720
Okay, so something debbie-ish debbie-ish debbie-ish. Okay. All right, and we got microsoft running. We got microsoft now

765
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,880
Hold on. Should I?

766
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,520
Are you ready to what with with poppy's voice? No, that's yep. Oh, yeah

767
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,500
Unfortunately right now wait wait, what what it's only outputting

768
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
on the 3.5 millimeter

769
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,040
Oh, okay, so we don't have a way to play it. We don't have a way but we could set that up for the future

770
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,640
Yeah, that's pretty darn easy. All right, so it's it's just plugged in a usb

771
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,040
So the process of getting microsoft set up on the raspberry pi stupid simple

772
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,040
They even have it so that it'll start up their own little microsoft ap at first

773
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,240
You connect your phone to it then it does like a chromecast style. Hey, what's your lens wi-fi password?

774
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,720
And then from there just it popped up you did like it gives you a little pair which will speak for you

775
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,600
Or you can see the speech log really pair that on their website

776
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,400
And then it just started working you can ask it stuff. So like to log in over ssh. I was just like hey microsoft

777
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,400
What's your ip address?

778
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,640
Really? Yep, I secretly and that's exactly yep, and then poppy was reading me 192. Really?

779
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,400
Yes. Now, how did it go when you tried to get to the echo software? So here's the thing. Uh-oh

780
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,240
It's it's installing but it is a lot more the microsoft stuff was pretty there's a lot of it is in python

781
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
It was pretty lightweight to get going

782
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,520
This just downloaded the oracle 8 jdk. So

783
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,480
It's a little bit different. Uh, there's also like you have to jump through a fair number

784
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,400
I mean I had to go to the microsoft website to be fair

785
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,760
Right and I had to put in a code and stuff and I made an account but the account was very easy

786
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,520
The alexis service you gotta go register as an amazon developer. You gotta check out a number of boxes being like no

787
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
I'm not making money. No, this isn't for kids

788
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,680
Etc, etc. Yeah

789
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,680
And so I think it's gonna work beautifully

790
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,800
Whenever the thing I liked about that is if you are if you are in that camp of this is a cia surveillance device

791
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,680
Put into your home run by a private corporation that has a deal with the cia to run its infrastructure

792
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,960
You're a maniac for using an echo like if that's the camp you kind of find yourself in which I can understand

793
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,200
uh, I think

794
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,960
This shows you

795
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,640
What a tech tech hack this product really is in some sense like once you go through this process you realize

796
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,160
The limitations very quickly of the software. Oh, yeah, that's a good point

797
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,680
So it's a good way like if you're concerned about the security of the echo it

798
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,120
It is a good way to get intimate with what the actual technology stack is that it's using and you realize it's just

799
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,320
It's really plain jane vanilla stuff running on linux. They I mean they they tie it in with their backend infrastructure

800
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,640
I know. I mean i'm just to that point, you know

801
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,400
I just sourced their install script and away it goes and actually that part was actually pretty nice

802
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,720
Like it has some good like hey, yes, do you agree to this?

803
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,000
But then it asks hey, do you want to output over hdmi or 3.5 million? So that part I was actually pretty impressed

804
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,920
Oh, where's the mycroft one?

805
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,240
Yes, I imagine there's a way to go tweak that obviously, but do you have a speaker hooked up to it right now?

806
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:13,120
No, I just have headphones. I know I want to hear poppy speak. I know right? Yeah, I can never get enough of him

807
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,880
I think it should just work. We just have to move the stuff and we just have to find a way to plug it in

808
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,760
Yeah, well, I could just actually I would just I would like to get earbuds so that way poppy's in my ears

809
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,240
You know, I want to just hook them up

810
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,400
One of those batteries yeah, just like that

811
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,960
You get a battery pack for the pie and then you can tether it to your phone through your ting connection

812
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,840
And then you can just be talking with mycroft. There you go all the time. You can also just wiretap poppy's echo

813
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,320
That would work too. Yeah, that might be easier. Yeah, that's probably already done. Let's be honest

814
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,720
Uh, actually they got a little credit bit of credit recently for uh trying to fight a court case

815
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,880
So did you hear about this? Yes, I did. Yeah amazon and then the defendant decided actually

816
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,280
I think we might talk about that very briefly in today's room. Oh, really, you know what? That's a good tease

817
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,720
That's a good tease right there. I will leave it there

818
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,000
In fact, if you're not watching wes on the tech snap program, what's the matter with you?

819
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,960
Dan and wes are really, you know, it's been what how it's been what episode number you on now?

820
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:13,040
Uh eight three ten ten ten ten weeks, although some of those were doubles. Yeah. Yeah, that's true

821
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,480
But damn guys, wow, you guys are cranking those things out. I like it

822
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,800
Uh, well, all right, so then we should probably end it there because yeah, dan's in the middle of a blizzard out there

823
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,240
And he doesn't know how much longer he's gonna have power

824
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,640
So we on the west coast have it easy. I complain about the rain, but dan's in the middle of a blizzard. Yes, exactly

825
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,840
Yeah, uh, well, are you gonna poke at it and see if you can get the echo on there?

826
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,760
We can have some updates. Yeah, maybe we'll do that

827
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,080
We'll follow up on that and see so happy pie to everybody

828
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,920
But so it does seem like what we weren't sure before the show started

829
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I guess I should make this point clear before we go

830
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,440
What we weren't sure before the show was could you take the same base linux image that you use to set up microsoft?

831
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,280
Could that also support the the echo software stack or is there going to be version conflicts?

832
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,240
Would there and it does appear you it seems like it's going to work just fine

833
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,840
I don't know not quite done setting up but uh fingers crossed. There you go. Tune in and find out next week

834
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,120
That's the that's the word on that. I guess i'm kind of curious because that could be the ultimate personal assistant

835
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,640
Yeah, a little bit of this a little bit of that

836
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,360
I'm also curious to play with it, but i'm not like I haven't been at the

837
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,800
Level even to buy a dot yet. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah now if I have one there. Wow, what's my excuse? Yeah

838
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,440
Yeah, you know, I got the assistant on the phone. Oh, yeah

839
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,480
It's really not that different. Yeah. Yeah

840
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,800
All right. Well that brings us to the end of episode 188. We're going to get out here on the account of snow

841
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,240
There's so much more show we could do there's so much more show. So check out the show notes

842
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:34,000
We got more stuff in there that didn't fit in today's episode. Check out next week's episode of the linux action show

843
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,480
We're gonna have a really unique take on our visit to scale

844
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,880
I like it. I also if if it's if i'm somebody who's never been to scale

845
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,600
I would really like it

846
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,800
If somebody's gone every year, I would like it. I watched the video already. No did a great job

847
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,480

01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,540
Most of the web runs on servers powered by linux it's for people who like to mess with computers

854
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:52,660
JBtitles.com that's not us. No. No, certainly not. Wow

855
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,880
Like we we tried to hustle but we're almost we're still almost just on a regular time jbtitles.com

856
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,380
Sorry dan, we're we're working quick

857
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,900
Arguably better than vr a focused mate. That's not bad

858
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,940
Uh, thank you. Mumble room. You guys are excellent and wonderful and the best as always. Oh, yeah

859

That's also true

861
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:20,420
Those stinking penguins bite and dip that chilling people at the end of shows to share the show

862
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, you know, I should do that. I guess that yeah, everybody go share and like was that what you say?
