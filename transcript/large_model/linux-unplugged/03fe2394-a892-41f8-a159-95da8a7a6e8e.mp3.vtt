00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 230, for January 2nd, 2017.

00:17.500 --> 00:24.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's already forgotten what year it is.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.500
My name is Wes and joining me this week is the man, the man behind everything,

00:28.500 --> 00:32.500
the secret sauce of the whole darn network, that's right, it's Rekai.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.500
The man, the beard, the legend.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.500
Oh yeah, absolutely, all of those things.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.500
Alright, well, it's 2018, all sorts of things are happening,

00:41.500 --> 00:45.000
maybe not so much in the Linux world, except in the security front.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
You'll hear more about that as the show goes on, but we've got a good show.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
We had all kinds of technical and physical and perhaps even metaphysical problems today,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
but that's okay because no matter what, it's going to be a great day for the network.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.500
There's an Ask Noah coming up soon, maybe you've even heard from him already today.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, because of some of those metaphysical problems, the show's going to be shorter.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.500
Yes, it will. So this is going to be, you know, first of the year, we're starting out light,

01:08.500 --> 01:14.500
we're on a Linux diet today, so it's going to be a streamlined show, rapid fire, some stories, some ads,

01:14.500 --> 01:18.500
and then we're going to get out of the way so that Ask Noah can be live on its new time.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.500
Because that guy, he's got a hard limit that we can't push into.

01:22.500 --> 01:30.000
Yes, right. Well, we've got some good news today, some good news about some of our friends in the Linux journalism world.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
We've got some interesting behind-the-scenes stuff going on with the Googs,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.500
a big story that's not so great for anybody, really anyone at all.

01:40.500 --> 01:46.500
Some confusing, just a little bit of Linux gaming updates, a couple of open-source apps we want to talk about,

01:46.500 --> 01:53.000
and then a little catch-up on predictions, and maybe we can talk a little bit about our plans for 2018,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
get excited about all the cool tech stuff we're going to work on.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
But to do any of that, I mean, I'm not sure anyone can join us for our weird time today,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.500
but if so, we have to say time-appropriate greeting to the Mumble Room.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.000
What's our mumble status there, Rike?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Empty.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.500
Empty. You know what, that'll happen. People are off probably trying to achieve their New Year's goals.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.500
Or still, you know, have a hangover.

02:16.500 --> 02:21.500
Or still have a hangover, yeah, right? They have metaphysical problems of their own.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.500
I think those are just physical problems.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.500
You're right, those are just physical problems. Thanks for keeping me honest today.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.500
So, regardless of all of that, let's just jump into our first story today.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.000
And that, my friends, is that it's a happy new year. It's 2018. Oh, yes.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
And before we left, we covered some sad news about Linux Journal calling it quits.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
I was sad to hear that they've really been a staple of the Linux Journalism ecosystem for a long time.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
But it sounds like they've been saved. So talk about a happy new year.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
They've been resurrected by the open-source saviors that are saving every project under the sun.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.500
Yeah, exactly. Private Internet access.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.000
They sure have. So as they write, you know, it turns out we're not dead.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
In fact, we're more alive than ever thanks to rescue by readers,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
specifically by the hackers who run Private Internet Access, also known as PIA,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
a VPN owned by London Trust Media.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
They're avid supporters of FreeNode and other larger FOSS community things.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
We've seen a number of stories over really the past year, past two years maybe,

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
of PIA stepping in providing various financial backing or even just buying some services.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
It kind of weirds me out in a way, though. Like, what happens if for some reason Private Internet Access fails?

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
All these things that are now relying on their income are going to fail again.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, you're right. It's good that they are supporting the products that they use, right?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
As they write here, they're really all about Linux and the rest of the modern portfolio,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
things like privacy, crypto, freedom, rewriting the rules of business and government.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't know what that means, but it seems like PIA has the right ideas, but having just one of them...

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, you're only as strong as the weakest link in your chain.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, right. Exactly.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
So this is kind of exactly what Linux Journal had been hoping for, but really had not expected.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Really and truly, they waited to put up their farewell post until all hope was lost.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
And that's got to be so hard, right? You're working really hard. They do a lot of really good work.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
They've been doing it for a long time, and when things just aren't viable,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
sometimes you just have to throw in the towel, and that's a painful experience for everyone.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
But hey, it turns out you don't have to believe in miracles to experience one, because that's exactly what happened.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
So what we know so far, first, the PIA people are hardcore Linux-free software and open-source hackers.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
That does seem to be clear. They also want to do right by developers, users, and the whole free and open networked world.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Second, they're eager to support building Linux Journal 2.0.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
So this is not just like a life support line that's being extended.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It's not that they're going to kind of limp along, which is nice, right?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
But what that means is in rebuilding Linux Journal, they need input.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
They want input from readers, maybe people who haven't been readers.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
If you're at all interested in seeing good quality Linux journalism continue,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I would definitely go have a say, have some voice, let them know what you liked or didn't like,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
what maybe would turn you from not a reader to a reader.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
I know from our perspective here on the network, it's always helpful to have usually constructive criticism.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Third, expect to see some familiar names and faces continuing to work there.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
So if you followed reporters and journalists there that you've liked, they're probably sticking around.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Fourth, they're committed to giving all their subscribers everything that they can to reward you for their support.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
So if you haven't already yet claimed your archive of all the back issues, go do that.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
They really want to take care of their readership, which is important.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And finally, they're committed to leading the way towards new and better business models.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
So they want to use this as an opportunity to work out like how can we,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
now that we have some, you know, injection of funding and support,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
how can we reshape this so that we can continue doing it as the year goes on?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Which I think, I mean, that's an important way to do it.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It won't work to just keep doing the same old thing.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Now that we had a chance to completely shut down, let's reset

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
and figure out the good things that we can do and separate out the bad things that cause us to fail.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, exactly. So, you know, I like this story just because, one, I'm personally a fan of the Linux Journal,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
but then, two, it's nice to start out, you know, 2017 was a rough year in many respects.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's nice to start out with a little help.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I feel like they should have memed it up a little bit and named the blog post New Year, New Me.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
New Year, New Me. Oh, yeah, I like that.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, you know, maybe you should give them some more feedback, Rika. It usually helps me.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay, so this is a lightning show. We're moving right along to our next story today.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Over at ours, they've got some updates on Fuchsia.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Now, we've talked a little bit about Fuchsia on this program before, but no one really knows a ton.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
But it looks like it's now coming to a Chrome OS flagship.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
Google's in-development operating system, Fuchsia, has a new development device, the Google Pixelbook.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
This is a thousand dollar laptop. It usually runs Chrome OS.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
But with the latest builds of Fuchsia, you can swap that out and run Fuchsia right there on it.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
So it really only started development back in 2016. It's Google's third operating system, right?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
So they have Android, they have Chrome OS, and now they have Fuchsia.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Fuchsia is really kind of in its own league there because Chrome OS and Android are both Linux based.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Fuchsia is not. It's described as targeting modern phones and modern personal computers,

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
which would seemingly put it in competition with both of Google's existing operating systems.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But everything's still kind of up in the air, right?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It seems like a from-scratch rewrite of a modern operating system.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
The OS doesn't use the Linux kernel. It instead uses a Google-developed microkernel called Magenta.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay, no, it was formerly called Magenta. Now it's called Zircon.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
I feel like they're doing Fuchsia to build an operating system around the idea of convergence from the ground up.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Instead of trying to bolt it on after the fact.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Right. And you could see they've spent the past decade now trying to play in the mobile space,

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
trying to get it underhand. But Android has never really been theirs.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
They use Linux. They kind of built this weird OEM community that they steward.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
But really there's AOSP in the field as well.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
I can see how they would want maybe a level of control similar to what Apple enjoys.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Another interesting part about it is the renderer they're using is called Escher.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
And it's written using Vulkan. So they're already ahead of the game right there.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
It also seems custom-built to run Google's material design interface.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
So that's just baked right into the ground floor.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Apps are written in Google's Flutter SDK, which produces cross-platform code that runs on Android and iOS and Fuchsia.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
So that's handy. And since there's no Linux, you guessed it, there ain't no GPL here.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
The OS is licensed under a mix of BSD 3.0, MIT, and Apache 2.0.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
They are getting something that most operating systems don't get when they're new.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
They're getting the entire Android app ecosystem instantly.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, right. That's a huge problem.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So yeah, if you can already cross-compile, if you're already developing using this SDK,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
you can just immediately target Fuchsia. That's a big win.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
So it's still incredibly difficult to get Fuchsia running really anywhere.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
Along with the Pixelbook, it supports only two other obscure pieces of hardware, an Acer Switch Alpha 12,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't know what that is, and an old Intel NUX from 2015.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Actually, I might have one of those Intel NUX. I'll have to check.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
Fuchsia can run on the open source QEMU emulator, but Fuchsia's graphic stack, as we said, requires Vulkan support.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
QEMU doesn't have Vulkan support yet, so you get a command line.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Command line Fuchsia, I really don't know how helpful that is.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
It's not like the target of... I suppose you could poke around at some of the internals,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
see how posicy it is, that sort of thing. I would be curious to try that,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
but it doesn't give you a good taste of what Google's end design goal here.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
They used to have a system UI that was packaged up that you could run, but that doesn't exist anymore.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Is the terminal material design?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
You know, I don't know. That's a good question.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay, so one other fact that I thought was really interesting in this whole thing

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
is that the Pixelbook installation process that they've described for this is kind of strange.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Google recommends installing the OS with a USB drive, sure, nothing unusual there,

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
but the media creation process is, quote-unquote, destructive to the USB device.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
That's right. You actually have to sacrifice a USB device to the Fuchsia gods to get the OS running.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know what they mean by that, but it's a little concerning.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm looking at the Fuchsia screenshots.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
It very much reminds me of Windows 10 mixed with Android.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Interesting. Is that something you would be interested in using?

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
Like the Windows Universal App Store apps, like Mail, how they're all very flat and single-colored,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
but then it's got the Android headers. It's really weird.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't know if I'd be on a desktop. I don't think so.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
Now, it is important to point out here that the extreme difficulty in getting this all running

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
really reinforces the fact that it's still heavily in development.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
It hasn't been released anywhere publicly yet.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Google isn't really ready to talk about or encourage people to try it.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
It took them like five years to turn Android into a real product,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
so if Fuchsia survives that long, maybe we'll see it in 2020, sometime later.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Hence why in this screenshot they open the email app and it just says bad module in all caps.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Okay, but a larger question that this makes me wonder, I wonder what your thoughts are on it.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Does this spell the N of Linux in the embedded space?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Are people going to flock to this?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
I mean, people can launch it if it's simpler, if it has less of some of the Linux drawbacks,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
if it has a more friendly license to OEM-type vendors.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Well, lucky for us Linux people, Google is really bad at launching software.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Burn!

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Their only success is Android, and that's because they let other people launch it for them.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, I guess you're right about that.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
So you don't really see Fuchsia having a huge future.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
No, and for all we know, it's only going to be an internal Google thing anyway.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
They haven't said it's going to be like this widespread OS that's going to be on all kinds of devices.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You're right. So I should just shut up about my speculating.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Linux is fine.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
For now.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, all right. I like that.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
We're going to keep on this hopeful new year's trend.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I'm going to say at least for 2018. That's my prediction, Wes.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Okay, okay. Well, you probably won't be able to use it here anytime soon,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
but you can bet the second that you can run Fuchsia on a phone,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
you're probably going to be able to try it on our first sponsor today.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That's right. It's our friends over at Ting.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Head on over to linux.ting.com.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
There, you'll find a smarter way to do mobile.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, okay. So when you first find out about Ting, you're like, yeah, okay, whatever.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
It's another one of those, you know, pay for what you use sort of plans

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
where I have to like prepay, but I don't have a contract.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
No, it's not. It's not really like that.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
Ting does it differently than just about anyone else out there.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It really is a smarter way to do mobile.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And when you find out that the average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
you'll kind of start to see why.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
I've run into a few people who knew about Ting before I told them,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
so I was really happy about that. I was impressed.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
I was like, yeah, you guys are already on the bandwagon of people on the know,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
but they didn't have the advantage that you, dear audience, have,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
which is by going to linux.ting.com, you get a $25 service credit if you sign up.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
So that'll probably pay for most of your whole month, first month's bill, maybe more.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Or if you need a new device, go check out their shop.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
They have a ton of great latest and greatest stuff. You can use it there too.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Before you do that, to convince yourself that you're really going to save a bunch of money with Ting,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
which you almost certainly are if you're a tech savvy individual

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
who has Wi-Fi in most of his life or his or her life,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
that's where Ting really starts to make sense.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
If you want to use like a thousand gigabytes a month, it can make sense there too.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That's the magic of pay for what you use.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
So head on over to their rates page. Lines start at just $6 per device.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
So you have two devices, $12. It's so easy, and they have this great little,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
this great intuitive dashboard you can use to sort of figure out what you're going to pay.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
You can deactivate, activate Lines. You don't have to call anyone to do any of those things.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And then to figure out your bill, it's super simple, right?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
You just take your usage. Maybe you use like a hundred minutes a month, nothing big, right?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
How many phone calls do you really make?

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I don't use any text messages because thankfully I've managed to convince most of my friends and family

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
that there's better ways to communicate.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Telegram.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah, Telegram, Disgram, Signal. There's a thousand different options.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Just don't use text messages.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
But maybe I get like a couple a month just because someone else or an automated service

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
or I ordered some food and then just whatever data you use.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
So if you're smart and savvy with Wi-Fi, maybe you use like a 500 megs a gig.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
That monthly bill right there, that's $22.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
That's the cost of like one meal out and you get cell phone service for the whole month.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And it comes with all the things that you want, right?

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Like it has three-way calling, it has tethering if you want to use that,

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
voicemail, all the standard features and none of the early termination fees or mandatory contracts.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
I feel like the only reason Ting isn't like the biggest carrier in the United States

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
is because too many people don't know about them.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, you're right. So go spread the word.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
The wise, wonderful word of Ting at linux.ting.com.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
And thank you very much to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
Okay, so I think it's time that we move on today and we discuss some big news.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
We're not going to do a deep dive into this.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
That'll almost certainly happen on the TextNet program before too long.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
But we have to talk about it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's not so positive.

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
Kernel memory leaking Intel processor design flaw forces Linux and Windows to redesign.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Now when this story first dropped, I don't know about you,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
but I saw a lot of references just to Linux.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And I think that was because that was where some of the first open source patches that we saw

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
involved in this story were.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
So a lot of it was reported that this was like maybe it was a Linux flaw or what's going on here.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
It has come clear that it doesn't look like AMD systems are affected by this vulnerability.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
It's just Intel only.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
But let's get into that.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
So a fundamental design flaw in Intel processor chips has forced a significant redesign of Linux,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Windows, and other kernels.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
So Linux and Windows are the first ones so far to have moved on this issue.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
But OSX, anything else that's running on Intel and takes advantage of some of these features

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
will have to be redesigned as well.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Does that mean Android too?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Because there is Android x86.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
I guess they'll just get it with, as long as Android picks up from the kernel patches.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Oh yeah, I suppose.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah, but who knows if they will, right?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
That's one of the huge problems there.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
So programmers are scrambling to overhaul the open source Linux kernel's virtual memory system.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
And Microsoft is also expected sometime this week or on the next patch Tuesday, the latest,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
to release a patch there.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
So one important note here is that both of these fixes right now incur a performance hit

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
on Intel products.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
So the effects are still being benchmarked, but it's somewhere between 5% and 30% of a slowdown,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
depending on the task and the processor model.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
More recent Intel chips have some features that will make this performance hit not so bad.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
But basically the performance we've come to know and love from these wonderful Intel chips

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
may be reduced because it's just not safe to do so, right?

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
So details of the vulnerability, they're still under wraps.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
So we don't know a lot, but we have seen various movements reported all over the place on the

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
kernel mailing list, et cetera.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
We're expected to let, all this is supposed to come out in the open sometime probably

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
this month, but they're giving people time to patch as is usually good policy.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
But we get to talk about it and speculate anyway.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So hey, isn't that fun?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
We do have some details, right?

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
So right now we know that it affects modern Intel processors produced around the last decade.

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
And basically it allows user space to read kernel memory or at least possibly read kernel memory.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
This ends up in potentially bypassing KSLR, kernel address space layout randomization.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
It's really no good.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
So the fix is to separate the kernel's memory completely from user processes using what's

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
called kernel page table isolation or KPTI.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
So whenever a running program needs to do anything useful, so just write a file, open

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
a network connection, it has to make a syscall, hand control back to the kernel to carry out

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
the job, make that transition.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
And so to facilitate that, the kernel gets mapped into all the user space processes virtual

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
memory.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So it's just sitting there, you can do that quickly.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
That's no longer going to work.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
What we're seeing here is that there's what's called speculative execution.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
Intel processors will try to predict what code is going to get executed and will run some.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
In this case, it looks like some of the security checks that should prevent user space processes

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
from accessing kernel memory, they're just not being done.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
What did you think about this story, Mr. Beard?

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
I think it's a whole lot of stuff that is way over my head and I'm glad people are fixing it.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, right.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
So like with these new patches, they're going to move the kernel into a completely separate

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
address space.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
So it's not just invisible, it's just not even mapped at all into the user space's virtual memory.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
It shouldn't be needed, but there's a flaw in Intel silicon that allows kernel access

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
protection to be bypassed.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
We're not quite sure of the details yet.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
But the downside is that it's relatively expensive to do these new safeguards, right?

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
So each time you have to switch between them, there's more flushing that has to do.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
You have to make sure that kernel memory is not accessible at all to user space, even

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
with the speculative execution.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
We're not quite sure of exactly what the implications are.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
A bunch of patches have been proposed.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
It seems like AMD is not vulnerable.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
We're not sure what the final performance hit.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Really nothing is final.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
But it would, you know, it does allow more vulnerabilities to get executed.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
And where you currently couldn't find kernel address information, now you can.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
So best case scenario, it's possible the bug could be abused to defeat KSLR, especially

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
with things like return oriented programming.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
It may not be that severe.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Time will tell.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
I was reading apparently over at the chaos communication conference earlier this year,

20:28.000 --> 20:35.000
somebody was describing a pure JavaScript ASLR attack, where you could exploit this

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
purely through the browser.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Wow, yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
So yeah, there had been some previous research done as well, like this summer with some patches

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
called Kaiser that people had looked at, but were concerned about the performance hit.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
I think a big thing to note here is that shared systems are one of the ones that are most

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
vulnerable to this.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
In particular, some of those big name cloud computing environments, things like EC2, Azure,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Google Compute.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
So over at the Python sweetness blog, there's a really great discussion about just all that's

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
going on.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
They have a really good summary of following the different patches, looking at LWN's coverage,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
looking at the actual mailing list.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
So if you're interested at this, if you want to get in on all the speculation, go check

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
that out.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Also note that you'll probably start seeing some things from if you are using these cloud

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
services.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So Azure has already said there's going to be some maintenance reboots on the 10th.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
AWS has sent out some emails saying, hey, we've got a major security update.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Look for, you know, your instances are going to get restarted.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
We're going to have to do some maintenance there as well.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
I do like that the Python sweetness blog is kind of like doing reverse engineering to

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
figure out what's going on because they're not being so public about it.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Right?

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
So that blog's titled, The Mysterious Case of the Linux Page Table Isolation Patches.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
It is interesting, right?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
We live in this world where responsible disclosure is very important, but we also have open source

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
products.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
So I'm sure Microsoft has been making a bunch of patches, but we just don't get to talk

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
about it.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Okay, so as we've said, this is a lightning show.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
We have to move right along.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I want to keep talking about it.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But again, check out TechSnap.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
TechSnap will have an actual in-depth explanation where we have real details.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
That's not what this show is about.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
This is Linux Unplugged.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
We're about having some fun.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
We skip the details.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
We skip the details.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We have rampant speculation.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
We abuse our airtime.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
We give unplugged opinions that may not be grounded in reality.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, exactly.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And I love it.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
So moving right along, we've got another sponsor for you today, and that is DigitalOcean.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
You may be concerned, right?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
You're concerned.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
You want to make sure that you, if you're using cloud services, the people behind them

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
are, have security in mind that are going to be doing these patches as soon as they're

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
available, that they're reading these articles and are concerned about your security, and

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
DigitalOcean is really the place to go.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So hopping over to DigitalOcean.com, we've got a promo code that you can use.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
It's D-O Unplugged, all lowercase, one word, D-O Unplugged.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
That'll get you.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
A guy with some nice hair told me that it's a promo code of power.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It is a promo code of power.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
That guy is so smart.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't know who he is, but he's wise.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah, so what can you do with that promo code of power?

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
Well, you're going to get a $10 credit, and prizes at DigitalOcean, they start at just

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
$5 a month.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
What do you get for that?

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Well, you can get a droplet two months for free, Wes.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Two months for free.

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
And that droplet comes with 512MB of memory, one super fast virtual CPU, 20 gigs of all

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
SSD disk, and a whopping one terabyte of transfer.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh, yeah, and this isn't your grandfather's transfer.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
This is like real international peering, top notch, 40 gigabit E, right to the KVM hypervisor,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
all the technologies that you would use if you were building a data center.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
It's like your hard line in some internet.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, exactly.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, right to the brain.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
It's incredible.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
I will frequently use DigitalOcean just to proxy download things because they're so much

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
faster.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
It's as close as you get to the matrix until we have the matrix.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah, so on top of all of this, you also get their amazing dashboard, which is all powered

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
on their incredible API.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Whatever technology you're doing, right, so maybe you're using one of their big name competitors

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and you're like, I just want to take out this DigitalOcean thing.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Probably all the scripts, command line, third party tools, stuff like Terraform, they're

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
already supported with DigitalOcean.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
They have drivers for them.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Integration is super simple and easy.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
And if you're like me, you're going to compare the APIs and you're going to be like, wow,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
why aren't all APIs this simple and well-documented?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
It's just a pleasure to work with.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, as an example, we wanted to be able to turn off and on droplets from the IRC to

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
be able to control some of the stuff for the show.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
We got a plugin set up in like 15 minutes.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I went into the developer room.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I was like, listen, guys, I need this.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And 15 minutes later, he's like, here's a plugin.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Wow, that's incredible.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
That is literally amazing.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
And they have like API toolkits for most of the major languages.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah, they really do.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Plus, they've got a whole bunch of other features that you probably want to take advantage of.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
So things like load balancing, monitoring, private networking between droplets.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
They've got snapshots available.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
They've just introduced object storage.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
They also have attachable block storage up to like a huge amount, all SSD disks.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Maybe you want to go play with ZFS.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
DigitalOcean is a great place to do it.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Maybe you don't want to have to build a bunch of compile.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Maybe you're doing the Gen 2 challenge and you don't want to have to compile a bunch

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
of stuff on your machine.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Go spin up one of these like $20 an hour, $20 a month, excuse me, $20 a month droplet,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
three cents per hour.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
You get two CPUs, two gigs of RAM, 40 gigs of all SSD disk and three terabytes of transfer.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's such a deal.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
And not only that, if for some reason you're listening to Linux Unplugged just because

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
you're looking for people that like Linux and you want to hate Linux, you can even run

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
BSD over in DigitalOcean.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
You absolutely can.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
That's the power of that KVM hypervisor, my friend.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Anyway, don't take our word for it.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Go to DigitalOcean.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Go check out their awesome community-maintained documentation.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Go check out their super friendly community of users.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
Go check out their incredible dashboard, digitalocean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
and thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Okay, so back to the show.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Here's just an open source app.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I thought we'd talk about it.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
In the spirit of open source, this article is from last year.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, it's true, but I think it'll be relevant in 2018 as well as we take this time to look

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
at how do we want to do things as open source enthusiasts, open source users, and do we

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
have the tool sets we need?

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
So one thing a lot of people I know use or have used is Evernote.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I don't know about you, Beard.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Are you an Evernote user?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
No.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
I've considered using Evernote, but I just never got around to it.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, sure.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Well, would you consider giving Joplin a try?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
It's a new open source Evernote alternative.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
It depends.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
Is it any better than all the other alternatives that supposedly existed?

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Well, let me tell you a little bit about it, and maybe you can answer that question for

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
yourself.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
So it's an open source cross-platform note-taking and to-do application.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It can handle a huge number of notes.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
You can organize them into notebooks and synchronize them across all sorts of different devices.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
The notes can be edited in Markdown, either from within the app or your own text editor

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
doesn't matter.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And each application has an option to render Markdown with formatting, images, URLs, all

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
this kind of Markdown enhancements we've all come to know and love.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Plus, any number of files, such as images, PDFs, whatever, can be attached to a note

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and notes can also be tagged.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
So you've got a lot of primitives to work on here.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
The creator started developing it when Evernote changed its pricing model, and because he

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
wanted his 4,000-plus notes to be stored in a more open format.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
As we've talked about so many times on this show, cloud services can be great, they can

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
be value adds, they can help your business, they can stream on your workflow, but you

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
are at their mercy.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
And so when it's a streaming music service, it's pretty easy to say, well, I don't like

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
them, or they folded it, I'll switch to a different one.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
But when it's something like this, when it's a smaller company, we are all pretty sure

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
that Google Drive will be around for the next million years, but who knows, really.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
And especially for some smaller companies, you may not have assurances that you will

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
have access to your stuff.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
And when it's important to your business, when it's important to your life, if you don't

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
have an easy export option, that can be really dangerous.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Indeed.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
So to that end, there are three Joplin applications, all under the MIT license.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
You have a desktop version, which is Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
There is a mobile version for both Android and iOS.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
No fuchsia yet, I know you're disappointed, Beard.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
And check this, there's a terminal application for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
So they all have like similar user interfaces, and they can synchronize with each other,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
so it's really like a complete set there.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And they're based on open standards.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
This might make you a little upset.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
They do use SQLite, that's great.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
They are made in JavaScript though, so hopefully that's okay with you.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
They use TerminalKit, which is a Node.js terminal framework I had not heard of.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
The desktop apps use Electron, and then React Native for the front-end devices.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
It's also offline first, so data is always available on the device even without an internet connection.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
So you don't have one of these annoying apps where even though it's stored locally,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
you're waiting for the thing to sign in or figure out that,

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
hey, I just want to read this note I left for myself even though I'm on the plane.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Oh, and it's got a multi-service support for its back-end syncing,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
so you're not tied to a particular service.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, exactly. Yes, exactly.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
So the synchronization is designed without any hard dependency to any particular service.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Most of the synchronization process is done at an abstract level

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
with access to external services such as OneDrive and Dropbox.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
It's just like a lightweight driver.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You can ideally plug that in, play.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Maybe we'll see some support for other things like Nextcloud,

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
things like any of the other popular syncing alternatives that are out there.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
A sync thing comes to mind, LibreVault.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah, you do have to sync manually the first time that you use a new service,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
but after that it's automatically syncing in the background.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
Excellent. So it looks like currently you can sync with OneDrive or the local file system.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
A Dropbox driver will be available.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
They're waiting on another upstream bug to be fixed before that happens.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
I think it has two major advantages over the past Evernote alternatives.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Okay, yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
One, it has the ability to have attachments, which like none of the other ones do.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And two, it has the ability to import from Evernote.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh, okay.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
See, that's a huge deal.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Including attached files.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Including attached files.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
So that means you should be able to go over to Evernote.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
If you're ready to jump ship or you just want to even try jumping ship,

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
go over to Evernote, export all your stuff, fire up a Joplin instance, and get it going.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Yep, they've got the instructions and we'll have them in the show notes.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I like that.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
They've got some pictures.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
You can go check this blog out.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's over at opensource.com.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It does look like they're pretty similar across applications.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
That should make it pretty easy, even if you're trying to,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
maybe you're trying to sell a spouse or a family member on it

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
and you want them to join the crew.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It should be easy to support across platform.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't know if I'm about to try it, but I am pretty curious.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
And I'm intrigued that they have a terminal application as well.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
That makes me, the Linux nerd, feel pretty at home.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I kind of already like it more than Evernote because it supports Markdown.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
And Evernote doesn't.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I know, yeah, exactly.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I thought that was a huge deal right there.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
And I do like that the, you know, it's focused on some of its core ideas

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
and that that syncing and other sort of third party concerns are left outside.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
That seems like it should be flexible enough to remain relevant

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
regardless of whatever, you know, when Dropbox dies, this will still work.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
And not only does it support Markdown, it supports Markdown correctly

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
because it has the editor and the rendered view, right, side by side.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
That's something that Simple Note never really did.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, you're right about that.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
And it's funny like it sounds like a small thing,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
but that actually matters a lot when you're for usability.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah, especially when you go to, you know, you're taking a note

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
and then you paste it into something else later when you look at the note

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
and it's rendered all wacky.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Rendered all wacky, exactly.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
All right, well, hopefully that's something people are interested in.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
If anyone's using it, I would love to hear about it.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Do let us know.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
It seems like it might be a handy new thing that you could try deploying out.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
It should be easy too, right?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
You're not installing a bunch of services,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
you're not having to run a new server,

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
even though we know that would be easy with some of our previous sponsors.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Just install it on a couple of devices, get syncing going.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
You probably already have one of these accounts

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
and away you go to a more open source 2018.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Wes, why are you giving me good apps?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
I don't need any more projects right now.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
You sure don't.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Okay, so since we've got the beard up in here,

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
I thought maybe we would just take like just a quick moment

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
and talk a tiny bit about some gaming on Linux.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Okay.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I don't know if you heard about this,

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
but there's kind of been a weird Linux valve Steam related controversy going on.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
I have not heard about this.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Okay.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Oh, interesting.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
So, are you familiar with Catbot?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Nope.

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
So, apparently there's some new cheating tools going around in the Steam world

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
and there's been a big controversy about,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
are they banning Linux users before they should?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Are they banning Linux users just based on their name?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
There have been some updates to the story.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
So, it sounds like, of course, it's not as extreme as one might think,

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
but let's get into the details.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Catbots, if you're not familiar with the term,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
are player-created bots that flood TF2 servers,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
lining up headshots on everything in sight.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
They're called names like Catbot1574, and they're a huge nuisance.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But in an attempt to stamp them out,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
some players are claiming that Valve has crossed a line.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Anybody with Catbot in their Linux username,

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
yes, not their Steam username, their Linux username,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
will now find themselves with an automatic VAC ban,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
regardless of whether they're actually booted up TF2 or not.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Now, one thing to note here is how many Linux users

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
actually have Catbot in their username, right?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
But there is like the potential that's not necessarily a good way

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
to decide these things.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Listen, Wes, don't judge me just because I like cats

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and I want to turn one into a robot.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Right, so there was some discussion over on a GitHub thread.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
One user said, I installed Ubuntu in a virtual machine,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
named the computer Catbot918, and installed Steam.

34:27.000 --> 34:33.000
Within an hour of not playing anything, I received a ban.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Now, a GitHub moderator for Valve did confirm that the policy was,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
in fact, a deliberate attempt to combat bots,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
but they did add that it was not open for discussion on GitHub, right?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Valve has been pretty famously, they're pretty closed

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
about the anti-cheating steps they take,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
partially because, you know, if you know about it,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
it makes it a lot less effective.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
And generally, they do it in good faith, I would say,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
to try to keep the games fair,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
make sure that you have a good community going on

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and that it's an enjoyable game to play.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
However, contrary to that, Valve has since contacted

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
the people that wrote this article and said that,

35:12.000 --> 35:18.000
in fact, was not deliberate and that, what was it,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
the claims were a tactic employed by cheaters

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
to try and sow discord and distrust among anti-cheat systems.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah, isn't that an interesting development?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
So, like, at first it sounded like, oh, boy,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
is this like a misstep that's hurting Linux users,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
even though, as we know, it's a tiny percentage of the gamers

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
actually on Steam.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
But no, it looks like this is just, you know,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
a false flag tactic that people are now trying

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
to get everyone upset about when, really,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
it's not what's happening.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
So, as they say, VAC will not ban you

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
for simply having Catbot in your username,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
either your Steam profile or your actual Linux account.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
The bug report, and I suspect many of the posts on the thread,

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
are a tactic employed by cheaters to try and sow discord and distrust.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
VAC has many different types of detections,

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
and, you know, Steam doesn't really want to comment on them,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
but they will say that all detections require

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
that the detection occur while a user is actively cheating

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and connected to a server.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So, like, you need to be playing the game

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
and connected to a VAC-secured game server

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to actually get caught cheating,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
which, I mean, that makes some sense, right?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
The other thing I thought was interesting in their comments

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
was that they said,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Linux historically hasn't been a problem for cheating.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
The base rate of cheating is significantly lower on Linux

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
than it is on Windows.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Unfortunately, a healthy community of cheaters

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
got bought on Linux, and their impact on TF2

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
became large enough that they simply could no longer be ignored.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So, those ban users are now very annoyed

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
that the VAC has dropped the ban hammer on them.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
What do you think? Is this reasonable policies by Valve?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Just a bunch of fluff?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I think it's perfectly reasonable by Valve.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Apparently, the cheaters are spreading a whole bunch of fake news, Wes.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah, I mean, I think we're definitely seeing some fake news going on here.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Oh, but that's the world we live in.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
That's the 2018 world. That was the 2017 world.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
It's all part and parcel of the same thing.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Have you had any interesting gaming developments in your life

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
in 2017 or coming up in 2018?

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Wes, I've been too busy moving. Video games are not a thing,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
except for the fact that I've started streaming again.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You have? Oh, wonderful.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I decided that I'm going to try to stream every single day this year.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
That is an impressive New Year's resolution, sir.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Good luck to you. Thanks.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Okay, so, moving right along in today's lightning show,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
we've got one more sponsor to knock out of the way

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
before I move on to our final topic of the hour.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
So, first up, maybe you've made some New Year's resolutions.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Maybe you're finally going to...

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That's not the right one. What am I doing over here?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I got my tabs all over the place.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
That was, in fact, my New Year's resolution, Wes.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Right? Yeah, exactly.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
But maybe you don't quite have the skills that you need.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
You probably don't have the skills that you need.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Maybe you do.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
But if you don't, I know the perfect place to go.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Can you guess?

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
It would be an academy.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Yeah, but it's not one of those ones that'll teach you

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
how to do underwater basket weaving

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
or how to cook a steak the correct way.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Now, you should learn how to do that.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But if you want to learn about Linux,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
there's no better place than linuxacademy.com.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Go there right now.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
They've got a sale going on.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It's extended through January 9th.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
You can get a free trial

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
and go test out this incredible learning resource, right?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
When I first heard about Linux Academy,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
it was kind of new, new kid on the block.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It hadn't been used so much,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
but now it has grown an incredible amount.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I now see it on a ton of resume applications

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
when I'm interviewing people,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
people I had never talked about it before with,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
so sedmans all over the place are talking about

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
what a great resource it is,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
and that's because they have awesome tooling

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
to make it easy to learn, stuff like Nuggets, right?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
So if you don't have a ton of time

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
to go do like an hour-long tutorial,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
check out some Nuggets,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
just little bits of fun information.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
You're probably going to learn something.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah, nice course scheduling

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
so you can adapt it to your schedule.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah, exactly, right?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
You have unlimited access to the courses.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
They have hands-on labs and exercises,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and you can customize it.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
So if you're trying to learn on a Red Hat-based distribution,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
yeah, they got servers for that.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Maybe you're really invested in the Debian ecosystem,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
or you're an Ubuntu admin,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
or you're trying to learn one from the other, perfect.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Linux Academy, they custom-tailor the courseware

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
so that it matches whatever distribution

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
you're actually using,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and you don't have to worry about the expense

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
of trying to figure out, like,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
oh, gosh, I got to spin up an AWS account,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and am I going to go beyond the free tier,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and how much is this going to cost me?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Linux Academy manages all that

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
behind the scenes for you.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And on top of all that, they do certification stuff, too.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
They also do certification, so it's a great way,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
if you're trying to train for a certification,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
go check out the ones that they have available,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
because it's really going to be some of the best

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
resources that you can find on the Internet.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
And, you know, if you're like me,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I was resistant at first.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I was like, well, I'm pretty good.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I'm a pretty good self-educator.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I know how to find resources. I'm a good reader.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
But these days, with the speed

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
of how Linux and open source is moving,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
what you end up doing is you end up with a whole bunch

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
of links that are, like, three, four, five years old.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Maybe the author has come back,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and, you know, they wrote up a tutorial on their blog.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Maybe they had an updated post, but probably not.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And so you're trying to, like,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
especially as a beginner, you're trying to

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
hodgepodge, bring that together, build your understanding,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
and it's just not very efficient.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Linux Academy has people who use Linux.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
They built their site with Linux.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
They're Linux enthusiasts. They're people like us,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and they keep this stuff.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
It's always up to date. They have the latest

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and greatest software that you're going to want to use.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And maybe you're trying to learn some cloud platforms.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Maybe you want to get up to speed on containers.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Perfect use case for Linux Academy.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
And they have great support.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
So maybe you just want to do it on your own

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
to try to get into the Linux field.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Or if you're already there, it's a great way to bone up,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
and it's super easy to sell to your boss

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
because they have team support.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
They have an easy way to manage it so that you can,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
you know, you can make sure that everyone is up to date,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
that they've gone through the training that they said they would,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
that they're taking advantage of the program.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And they even have profile pages now, too.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
So you can go do a bunch of training, do grading your courses,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
and show that off to prospective employers.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah, some feedback that we've gotten recently is

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
some people have recommended Linux Academy to their employers,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
and then Linux Academy courses got deployed

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
for the entire company just to bring everybody up to par.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Really? That's fascinating.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Yeah, exactly. That's a great way to do it.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
You have a common base understanding,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and you know that it's going to keep getting updated,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
so it's just a great value.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Or if you've got your boss trying to get you to go get more certs,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
and you want to get some brownie points with him,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
try to save some money, you can be like,

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
hey, can I go get my cert via Linux Academy,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
and it'll save you some money.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
It'll save you some money, and it's more flexible, right?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Instead of, like, going to a dedicated thing

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
where you're just going to learn one thing,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
after that's done, keep using Linux Academy

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and go learn a bunch of other areas where you need to know.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
It's perfect, especially if you're trying to transition into a new field.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
So go check it out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You can try it out for free, so there's really no risk,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and if you're anything like me, you'll be hooked.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Thank you very much to Linux Academy

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
All right, so as we said, we're flying through today's episode,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
but it is the new year, right?

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
New year, maybe not so new us, something like that.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Refreshed us? Refreshed us.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Now, but it does make me think it's time to think about,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
you know, the end of 2017,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
you're thinking about all the things you didn't do,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
you're thinking about the terrible stuff that happened,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
but it's new, it's fresh, and I don't know about you, Beard,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
but I've been trying to think about, like,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
what is it that I want to accomplish this year?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I know I won't get all of it done,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
but I want to set some high goals that I can try to achieve and work towards.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
In that spirit, I thought it would be good to talk about

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
all the annoying tech chores you need to do when you have the time,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
because this is probably something you should add to your list of 2018 goals.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
A fresh start to the new year.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah, exactly.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
So, first up, update your software.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
This might be not as relevant to us Linux users,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
but I think it still is, right?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Especially, like, you probably have software on your phone,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you have software on systems you don't use that much,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
and you have firmware on probably all kinds of weird embedded devices

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
that you don't think about.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I would add to that, not just update your software,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
but reevaluate your software and see if there are better alternatives

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
that might make your life better.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Right. Like, don't just keep using the same old stuff.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Don't throw it away if you don't need to.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Maybe switch from Evernote to Joplin.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Yeah, exactly. Or at least give it a try, right?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Allocate a little bit of time.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Maybe you can make something better.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You've been hooked on proprietary syncing.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Try out Nextcloud.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's one of the things I'd like to do this year.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm realizing that I don't love Google Drive.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I have it, but I don't love it.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
And I don't really have a great...

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I have local file systems that I keep in sync,

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
but I don't have this, like, richer way to sort of share lists

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
and make notes to myself.

44:14.000 --> 44:20.000
I challenge people to set aside 30 minutes for every day

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
for the remainder of January just to do research

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
to try to improve their lives.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Ooh, that's a great... You're just so smart, Beard.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
So some other things you should do.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Free up some space.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
We were talking on the way up to the studio today,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
it sounds like you're in this boat.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
You get in that place, you're over 90% on your file system,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
and you just can't download the stuff you want.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, yeah, I don't really have a choice, though,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
because the reason I have no space

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
is because all my other drives died.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Yes, totally.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But go install a couple tools that'll help you.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
One I love in particular is ncdu,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
which is like the normal du command,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
but an ncurses interface.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
It makes it super easy to rapidly scroll through

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
what's taken up space, drill down into folders,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and you can delete files right from the same interface.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So it's super easy.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
There's a KDE one, I think it's like K...

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
directory statistics or something like that?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Yeah.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Kderstat?

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Kderstat, yeah.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
And it wasn't Winderstat, the popular Windows program,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I think was originally forked from that.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
So there's a lot of good software you can use,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
but it really is...

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
You'll probably find a bunch of files that you forgot about.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's a great time to go clean up that downloads folder.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
That's one that always gets me.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
It's really nice to get a nice visual of...

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
like, a visual representation of what's taking up your hard drive.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah, exactly.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
There's a couple tips in this article in particular

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
that are a little more Windows.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So one is scan for problems.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Well, I don't know how much you want to do that on Linux

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
or need to, but it is a good idea to have some regimen.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
You can do it on Linux, it's just a little bit more manual.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Just go check your log files.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
See what's going on.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah, exactly.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Go check your log files.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
The other thing I would say is if you're running

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
any cloud systems, business systems, anything else,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
maybe now is the time to check out some monitoring.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
Just start getting some metrics, get some statistics that you can use

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
to track system health or really anything else.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Go set up a simple Nagios server or something better

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
if you want to make sure that you monitor your home network

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
or your droplet.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
It can be super easy, and you'll probably learn a lot on the way.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You can even set it up for your desktop,

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
see what it's doing throughout the day.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
One tool I love in that space is NetData.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
It's by the same team that's made Firehole,

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
which is the firewall IP table system that I prefer.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
NetData is super simple to install.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
It has its own web UI built right into it.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's super efficient, and it has pluggable backends now too.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
So if you just want to have disposable metrics

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
you can look at when you need to, it does that.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Or you can ship them off to a backend server

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
and save them for later.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Okay, so this one is not necessarily tech-based,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
but it is definitely true.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Get your photos organized.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
You just have so many, and you take them all the time.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
I saw you taking them earlier today.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
You're taking them with me right now,

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
even though I asked you not to.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I can't help it, Wes, you're so pretty.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, so just here's what I ask.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Make a Wes folder, a Wes pictures folder.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Put it right on your desktop so you have easy access to it.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
But sort those things out.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
I don't know.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
I don't feel like when they say get your photos organized,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I don't think they mean like file structure-wise.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
No, they don't.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
You probably want, you know, meaningful tags and NetData info.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
Like a really great Linux photo organization software.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
You know, there almost certainly is.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I've used Darktable, and I've used Raw Therapy a bit myself.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah, I think it's Darktable.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Yeah, Darktable actually recently had a new release,

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
so go check that out.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It's definitely something to try this year.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
Okay, and then finally for this one, update your router.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Now, we touched on that briefly,

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
but more and more devices these days are auto-updating.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
But go check.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Right now is the time,

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
especially if you're like the IT person in the family

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
and you're willing to do this.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Maybe go check on, you know,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
go check on some of your family members.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
We've seen various things like the crack attack

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
and other recent exploits.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It's a good idea to make sure you're patched for.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
Yeah, I think they're talking about updating your router firmware.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
And personally, I would consider also updating the router hardware

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
because often the routers that are in place with your family and stuff,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
maybe yours is good, but your family.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Right, they don't know these things.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
They just bought it at Best Buy and installed it

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and have never thought about it again.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Or got a bargain basement once applied by the RSP

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
that they're getting charged for every month.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yes, exactly.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
So there's a lot of options, open source friendly or not,

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
but you really want to have, especially things like Wi-Fi.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
It's 2018 now.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
We got to have these things.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
This is like base infrastructure.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
So maybe go check out like a Unifi system.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Google's Wi-Fi seems popular.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I can tell you that I've gained a lot of family goodwill

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
by just going to my family and saying,

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
hey, I need you to give me $100 up front to buy you a new router,

48:48.000 --> 48:55.000
but you will, in perpetuity, that's the word,

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
you will save $10 on your bill every month for as long as you have it.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Boom.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yeah, see, look at that.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Wow.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
It already pays for itself after 10 months.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It already pays for itself after 10 months.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
And your Internet will probably be faster.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
And your Internet is probably going to be faster.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Yeah, I like that.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Okay, so this was Gizmodo's take.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I thought we'd just, as we're wrapping up today,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
check out what NetworkWorld has.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
These are Linux resolutions for 2018 for both Linux admins and users.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
So I like number one a lot, automate more of the boring stuff.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I think that's definitely something we would like to do over here at JB.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
We'll probably talk more about that some on the TechSnap program,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
but you're always down in the trenches.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I think that's something you would agree with.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I agree.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah, it's just important that like if you're going to spend time doing it,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
we only have so many days left in 2018 already.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Don't waste them doing the same thing over and over and over again.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
And if you don't feel like automating your stuff, come help us automate ours.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We've got a nice development community.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We could always use more people.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I think this year I'm finally going to make the move to having

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
a legit configuration management system running my home servers

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
and other droplets and assorted computers.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Save you a lot of time.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Yeah, I've tried Ansible in the past,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and it didn't quite work for my use cases.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I think I might stand up a standalone Chef server

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
or maybe give Salt a try.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
But either way, it's going to be an exciting journey,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
and I'm excited to have some reproducibility.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
You know, I've already run into some systems that are working great right now,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
but reflecting on it, it's like, well, I would never,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I shouldn't have made it this way.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I would not make it this way again.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
And it's going to be a lot of work if this system fails,

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
and I have to rebuild it from scratch.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
Okay, so number two, learn a new scripting language.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Maybe just learn a new language in general.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
It's a good way to keep your brain flexible,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
and you might learn a new paradigm.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
So if you haven't tried JavaScript in the past five years,

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
a lot has changed, maybe try that.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
If you haven't done Python before, it's more popular than ever.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Make sure you do Python 3, but check it out.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
I would suggest Ruby.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
There you go, yeah.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I am the Ruby peddler.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
The Ruby peddler.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
There's even a very easy way to learn it.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
If you go to poignant.guide,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
you will get a nice illustrated guide to Ruby.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
That's beautiful.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Okay, so in that same spirit,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
try a distribution you haven't used before.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Maybe take the Gen 2 challenge.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
If you haven't used Arch before, try that.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Or the elementary guys are doing great work,

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
give that one a shot.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
I think for me, I'm going to try Void.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Oh, Void, yeah, that's a good idea.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Because not only is it a distribution I haven't used before,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I basically know nothing about it.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
You know nothing about it, yeah.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Or what's the other thing, Nix?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Nix, that's what I was about to say.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, Nix, or what's the GNU one?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
GUIX, GUIX, I don't know how you say it,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
but both of those are really interesting,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
functional approach to configuration management

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
built into the distribution.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't want any GNU in my life.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
That's fair.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
I like it because they use Scheme,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
well, Guile to configure it, so I'm interested.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I'm still waiting for my Linux kernel

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
with the BSD user line.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Fair enough.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Oh, okay, interesting.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
So K-free BSD, or Debian slash K-free BSD.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
No, that was reversed.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
You want the opposite of that.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Exactly.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Interesting.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Well, maybe 2018 will be the year for you.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Probably not, though.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
All right, so number four, embrace cloud technology.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
I guess so.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I don't know if I would make that a resolution.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
If it's useful to you, it's probably worth checking out,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
but it'll probably happen anywhere.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
This seems like a trend because that Gizmodo article

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
also suggested moving to the cloud.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I'm just going to skip over that because, yeah,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I mean, use it if it's useful.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
It's certainly available,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
but I don't think you should make it a focus.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Indeed.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Rather, focus on system security

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
and verify that your backups are working.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Those are both super important.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
That goes back to checking your logs

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
to make sure nothing weird is going on.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, set up some basic monitoring,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
maybe set up fail to ban or other things that will help make sure,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
and go rotate some keys.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
If you have been doing this,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
start following some SSH best practices,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
start using a password banager if you're not already,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and get automated backups.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
A big thing for me this year is I want to get

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
some of my friends and family on my backup system

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
so that we can do some multi-site relocation.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Right now, I have at least one copy,

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
but I would like two copies, at least one of them offsite.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
So like three copies total.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I don't know if I'll get there, but I want to start on that path.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
I'm going to add a 6.5, try out ZFS.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Yes, absolutely.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Start getting snapshots in your life.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Get used to it, and then before long,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
it's going to become second nature,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
and you're going to thank yourself that you did.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
And five and six kind of lead into number seven.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Yeah, they do.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Pick up some new troubleshootings.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Yeah, if you find a problem,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
you're going to be learning to do number seven.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
We already touched on number eight,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
which is pay attention to metrics, but it is nice.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
It doesn't take that much time to just get some base metrics,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
and then later in the year, you'll be thankful.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I don't think I've ever had a time where I had data

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
and I was upset that I had data, right?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
It's almost always the opposite.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I would love to have seen what the load was during that period,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
but I didn't have metrics.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
I would suggest doing number nine,

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
which is document your procedures in combination

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
with the Evernote alternative from earlier in the show.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Yeah, go try out Joplin.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Have your documentation with you everywhere.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Yes, go try out Joplin.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Maybe try out Nextcloud or some other services, SyncThing,

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
whatever you can do to make sure

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
that you have this sort of stuff available.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
You could even run your own open source wiki on a droplet

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
if you wanted.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
That could be something that would work for you,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
but document, document, document.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
That's one thing that saved me,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
even though I don't yet have a great configuration management

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
at home.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
At least I'll go to a server I haven't touched in a couple years

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and I have a document laying out exactly what I installed,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
why, it really helps a lot.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
A lot of the rest kind of just all go together.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Teach a class, take a class, find a new job,

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
make your current job better, get a cert.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
All of these, Linux Academy.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Linux Academy, there you go.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Okay, well that about wraps it up.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I hope we've left you somewhat inspired for 2018.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I know I am, right?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
There's a lot of cool technology.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
There's a lot of stuff you can do, and as Linux users,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
we're really empowered because all of this is,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
most of it's like free, open source,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
and we're already interested in it.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
So how do we not, we'll be hurting ourselves

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
if we don't take some time to play with this stuff.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
But at the same time, the last one on the list is have a life,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
take a vacation, take some time off.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Yeah, remember that this stuff is supposed to be fun.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Don't stress out about it.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Set up some good habits, some good workflows,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and just have a good time.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Yeah, Linux will be here when you get back.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, is that an upright?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Exactly.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
All right, well that's going to wrap it up.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
I hope you're real inspired about 2018.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I know I am.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
How about you, Beard?

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Pretty inspired.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
All righty, well thank you for joining us here

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
on the Linux Unplugged program for this special

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
super duper unplugged edition.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Mr. Beard, if they want to see more of you,

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
where can they find you?

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
Twitter.com slash for Kyle P or rec.net.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Excellent.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
I'm streaming every day.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
We've also got a ton of great JB content.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Ask Noah's coming right up, so make sure to check

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
them out at their new time.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
My Twitter is at Wes Payne.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And head over to jupitabroadcasting.com.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
