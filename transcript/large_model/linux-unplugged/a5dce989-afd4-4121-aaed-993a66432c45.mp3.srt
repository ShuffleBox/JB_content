1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
breaking news here on the show.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,520
It looks like it's coming from Mike Larbs over at for Onyx.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,920
This is CNN breaking news.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,520
Amazon is hiring DX, VK, Mesa and Proton Linux developers for for Luna Cloud Gaming.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,220
Is that their streaming thing, Luna?

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,760
That's their cloud gaming thing.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,700
This is big.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,260
So now you're going to have Collabra, Valve and Amazon,

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,560
all funding developers to work towards this same stack.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,660
Wow. This is a big news day.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,000
There's a lot going on today.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,840
I wonder if that means Luna's rebasing from Windows to Linux.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,280
Yeah, that's you would have to think, right?

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,820
The job posting also provides some details of the work.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,820
It says, quote, The role involves working with Proton, a compatibility layer

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,080
to run Windows games on Linux using wine.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,320
Luna is committed to working with the open source community around Proton.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,700
This role will commit code to open source projects such as Proton and wine

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
in pursuit of running games in a stable and performant manner.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
There's a lot to kind of unpack here,

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,260
because it could suggest they are switching to Linux on the back end.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,040
I mean, that would be pretty incredible

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,640
because that would mean both Stadia and Amazon's offerings

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,300
require that the games work on Linux.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,480
Then you had the steam deck coming.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,140
Man, that's a lot of momentum towards games,

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,720
at least getting some level of compatibility with Proton, right?

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,160
Maybe not native Linux games, but Proton games, because this is huge.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,220
I think if you're going to if this if Proton, if targeting for Proton now

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,000
means you get your game running on the deck and you get your game

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,740
running on Luna, that incentivizes developers to actually make that happen.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,240
It's a starting point, right?

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,480
Like if they're doing this, then they're definitely working on a Linux platform

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,840
to run games on, which means this probably is the first step.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,620
Like first, having their existing portfolio of Luna games working

36
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,380
and then their next step is opening the doors for Linux native ones.

37
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,960
That's the optimist in me. I'm hoping that's what's happening.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,820
Yeah, right. Yeah, no, I'm with you.

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
Well, and what is this also going to do to the steam stats?

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,100
Because I'm sure there are internal stats that steam tracks

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,200
of how many people are playing games on Linux.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,540
If more games are playable on Linux, does that increase the percentage

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,740
of Linux gamers?

44
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,640
I mean, they'll probably benefit just from seeing developers

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,900
more interested in targeting that platform now.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,680
And the pricing is not bad.

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
I mean, it's it's something that like only a huge company like Amazon could offer.

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,180
If you think about what they're doing on the back end for the US right now,

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,460
it's going to be six dollars a month and you get access to games with that price.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,920
And then they're going to offer like a package that's a step up

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,000
and you get higher refresh and you get access to even more games.

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,600
And then there's going to be a family plan they're going to have

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,100
where for like a small like three dollar a month additional fee,

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
your kids can get access to it all.

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,200
And it's filtered for kids depending on their age.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,540
It's a family plan for like multiple people.

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,580
I don't know. It's also early days on this stuff.

58
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,620
But I like seeing the tech involved.

59
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,120
And like, what what kind of investments will this get?

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,520
How much adoption will it all be? Kind of similar.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,000
I mean, Amazon seems to have a better stick-to-it-iveness than Google does.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Maybe maybe we'll see something interesting here.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,040
Yeah, maybe. But also, I feel like Amazon music and Amazon photos,

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,740
those are not the big services.

65
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,840
That's true. I use them. They're nice.

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,500
Yeah, they are. Yeah, I agree.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,740
And they often have worked with Linux.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:25,820
So there's that. Hello, friends,

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,720
and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
My name is Chris. My name is Wenz.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
And my name is Brent. Hello, you two.

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,600
I like the outfits. Nice job on the coordination.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,100
Well, thank you. It's the purple.

74
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,360
We have a very fresh edition of the show.

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
In fact, we'll be talking about Pop!

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,380
We'll be talking about Pop! OS 2110, which was released just a couple of hours ago

77
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,980
as we record, but we've had our hands on the ISOs for a little bit longer than that.

78
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,380
And we've tried it out on a range of hardware from the high end to the low end.

79
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,520
And we'll give you our take.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,420
Plus, Carl Rochelle, the CEO of System76, will drop by to talk about a few of the features

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,460
and correct a few things that are out there as far as like versions of GNOME and whatnot.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
And on top of all of that, we have our community news and well,

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,960
a few things I got to tell you about.

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,600
And as always, we're going to round it out with some pics and some emails and all of that.

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,180
So, before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our mumble room.

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,280
Hello, Virtual Lug.

87
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,180
Hello.

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,380
Hello.

89
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,240
Hello, there.

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,640
Hello.

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,080
Hello, all of you.

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
Man, we got a great showing today.

93
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
I'm really, really grateful you're here because this is like one of our last Tuesdays.

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,220
And then we're moving to Sunday for our live time.

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,920
Next week, it's the Tuxes.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,960
Very excited about that.

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,060
So, Tuxes.party, if you haven't gotten your chance to vote yet.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
So, that'll be the 21st.

99
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,000
And then our last Tuesday live stream, which is kind of actually making me sad now

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,180
that I say that, will be December 28th.

101
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,080
And that'll be our predictions where we not only own which predictions we got right or wrong,

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,640
but we'll make new ones for 2021.

103
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,380
I know. I know.

104
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,020
I know. I don't even know.

105
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,820
Like, I've been thinking about it.

106
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,880
There's a lot going on.

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,360
It's going to be a hard one to do predictions for, but we'll have to figure that out.

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,120
And then just shortly after that, on January 2nd, we're going to do a potluck and new server

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,200
christening at the studio right here at JB1.

110
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,740
And I'm trying out Get Together for this one.

111
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,900
This is an open source one that you can self-host.

112
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,600
It's a meetup alternative.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,340
It's gettogether.community.jbhq if you want to see our page.

114
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,080
And I'll have a link in the show notes.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
And go there.

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,440
I figure why not use like a small scale event like this?

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,380
Because it's just going to be a hand.

118
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,480
It's going to be an intimate gathering.

119
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,620
And great opportunity to try a meetup alternative that people have suggested before.

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,860
So we'll have a new server christening get together link in the show notes.

121
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,800
I don't know if you join it.

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,500
I don't know how it works, but I'd like, yeah, you attend it.

123
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
That's their option.

124
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
You attend it.

125
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I want to know how many of you are coming.

126
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,140
I've heard from like three people and I expect it's going to be somewhere between three and

127
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
a dozen.

128
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Now, look, I know.

129
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,080
I know this is, you know, the Pacific Northwest is like the Westest of the West Coast and

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,680
it is way up in the corner of the country.

131
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,940
I appreciate that it is difficult to get to because I frequently have to drive here.

132
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
It's a pain in the butt.

133
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,940
And I know it's not, it's not possible for everybody to get here.

134
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,780
So we are going to attempt to live stream this thing.

135
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,860
I mean, I don't know how it's going to work.

136
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,660
I'll attend virtually if you let me.

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,900
Yeah, I'm going to try.

138
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,860
So Brent didn't know it, but like yesterday he kind of volunteered to be like the camera

139
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
guy.

140
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Oh yeah.

141
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Yeah, yeah, sure.

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
MC Jerva.

143
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
What else do I have to do?

144
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,620
You know, Brent, as you walk around with my internet phone connected back to OBS, right?

145
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,500
So you, we could take people out to the server garage and when we kick it on.

146
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Now you're talking.

147
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,180
I mean, keep the dreams going.

148
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,620
And then what we'll do is we'll just transition to a traditional stream.

149
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:56,380
So my thinking is people will show up around like 1130, 11 AM, maybe 11 AM, uh, JB time.

150
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,340
We'll do, we'll get the potluck going, you know, we'll eat around 1130 around noon.

151
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,460
We'll get the servers fired up, hoping all that goes well.

152
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,060
And then around one, we will, the three of us, you, Wes and myself, we'll move into the

153
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,100
studio and people can hang out in the living room and listen to the live recording from

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
the living room of the studio.

155
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,740
We'll put the speaker out there, we'll bring it up on the TV and uh, so that people can

156
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,820
attend a live lup if they like, and then we'll wrap up the show and um, people can, you know,

157
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
say their goodbyes and that'll be it.

158
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,500
It'll probably be like, you know, from like 11 AM to 4 PM is what we'll probably do.

159
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,220
Uh, just to be clear, um, does this mean I'm invited then?

160
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Yeah.

161
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,540
You're supposed to be down here then.

162
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Yeah.

163
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Yeah.

164
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Yeah.

165
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,420
In fact, I'd like you to show up before then, you know, cause we got like this whole thing

166
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,100
we're planning, you know, I gotta do some catering too.

167
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,740
We gotta have some food there, right?

168
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Yeah.

169
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,740
Right.

170
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
You're going to have to do some cooking.

171
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,620
Everybody's going to want a taste of that brunch, you know, they're talking about brunch

172
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,860
and I've also decided to punt a new Linux show launch that I had planned for the beginning

173
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
of the year.

174
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,300
Uh, because I am, I'm trying to do too much.

175
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,940
It's you know, last year the holidays were like not even a blip on my radar because everybody

176
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
just canceled all our plans.

177
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,220
But this year it's like this fractured beast that has become this entire thing that I have

178
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
to manage.

179
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,420
Plus there's a business I'm running, plus there's shows I'm trying to do.

180
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,360
And I want to do a good launch when I do launch a new show.

181
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,620
So I'm keeping my powder dry and I've decided not to launch a new show at the new year.

182
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,600
But LUP is still moving to Sunday, LAN will be moving to later in the week.

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,660
We're still just kind of determining the details of that, so I don't have that for everybody

184
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
yet.

185
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,780
All the more reason to stay subscribed so you've seen what happens regardless of what

186
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
we say.

187
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,340
Great point, Wes.

188
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
You know what?

189
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,740
Pro, pro podcaster right there.

190
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Good thinking.

191
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,820
So we will have a new LUP live day.

192
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,220
We will have a new year party and we will have a new server christening all happening

193
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,020
on January 2nd, get together.community.jbhq for the link to that or link in the show notes.

194
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,460
And with all of that, let's move into the news today and really there is one big story

195
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,580
as far as the Linux desktop and Linux community is concerned, and that is the release of Pop

196
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
OS 2110.

197
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,060
So joining us is Carl Rochelle, the founder and CEO of System76, of course, the place

198
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,100
that makes computers born to run Linux and Pop OS.

199
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,220
Who better to chat Pop OS 2110 with?

200
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,020
Hey, Carl, welcome back to the show.

201
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,140
Thanks for having me.

202
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Thank you for being here.

203
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,380
Super last minute and all of that.

204
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,940
But today, just like two hours ago, Pop OS was released.

205
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,380
And so we thought, you know, we got to talk about this with you because it's a mix of

206
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,060
really interesting components.

207
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,360
I think maybe that's where I want to start with you.

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,980
The kernel, for example, 5.15.5, right?

209
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Super fresh.

210
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,540
But GNOME 3.3.8, yet at the same time, there's this new application library that is a totally

211
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,780
new innovation from System76 and the refresh OS feature.

212
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,660
So there's like a there's a mix here that feels like, are we starting to see the building

213
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,620
blocks of what might actually be a full Cosmic desktop one day?

214
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,160
Perhaps visually, but not really under the hood.

215
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,280
And actually Pop 2110 is based on GNOME 40.

216
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
So it is.

217
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
OK.

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Yeah.

219
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,480
So it's GNOME 40.

220
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,780
Our last release was in June and it was 2104, which, you know, supposed to be April, right?

221
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,100
And this one's 2110, which is supposed to be October.

222
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,180
But Cosmic, the first release, we want to spend a bit more time to polish it up and

223
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
get it ready to go.

224
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,260
And then it was a shortened time for this cycle and we wanted to get some things in

225
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,300
and adapting to GNOME 40 is what actually pushed it out further to make it to December.

226
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,980
So we anticipate the next release, 2204, to actually be in April next time.

227
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,660
But that's the reasons that that delayed and GNOME 40, it was a lot of work just adapting

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,460
the Cosmic workflow to the changes that came with GNOME 40.

229
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Right.

230
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,540
So my thought there, too, is there were some back end changes, too.

231
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,180
So like the Launchpad transition happened from Launchpad to, is it GitHub now or GitLab?

232
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't know.

233
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,100
But you've moved off of Launchpad for the back end stuff now.

234
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Right.

235
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Yeah.

236
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
We're hosting our own our own packages.

237
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,380
Those are the custom System86 packages that we create for Pop OS.

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,700
The rest of the stack still comes from the Ubuntu repositories.

239
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,340
The main reason for moving off of Launchpad was during our last release, it would take,

240
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,500
we probably lost a week or more waiting for builds.

241
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:30,260
And so we push a new build, QA would get it, they'd run it through their process.

242
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,540
There'd be some changes that needed to be made and then we push it up again and it would

243
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,180
be hours until hours, sometimes a day, until we had new packages built.

244
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,780
So we just got tired of waiting.

245
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:50,460
So we built a new CI, built a new service for the packages that we built and that dramatically

246
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:58,100
increased our iteration time from engineering to QA to release.

247
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,220
Now if I were to predict, and it's our predictions episode in a couple episodes, if I were to

248
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,780
predict that Cosmic would rebase one day off of Ubuntu, would I have a good shot of that

249
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,020
prediction coming true?

250
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I think that's unlikely.

251
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,020
That would be a pretty significant change for our users.

252
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't know if it would be an improvement for them.

253
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,100
We've looked at Fedora and Arch and other options for basing Pop OS.

254
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,940
And at the end of the day, Ubuntu makes an incredible base to build desktop experiences

255
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,180
off of and we think we can achieve the same kind of advantages that there are on Arch

256
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,980
and some of the advantages in Fedora and some of the things they're doing in Silverblue,

257
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,900
but on top of an Ubuntu base.

258
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Sure.

259
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,780
So you sort of feel that the compatibility that an Ubuntu base provides is maybe one

260
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,180
of the features of Pop OS?

261
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Right, yeah.

262
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,180
So you can look at what we're doing with Linux kernel now and we've been rolling on kernels

263
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,580
for quite some time, although they were always based on the Ubuntu kernel with patches for

264
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,580
new hardware enablement that we required for shipping products.

265
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,660
But there's a lot of other improvements that are coming faster in the Linux kernel that

266
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,620
we wanted to deliver in a similar way to the way Arch provides that to their users.

267
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,980
So now we have a new kernel policy where we're tracking the latest releases and running it

268
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,820
through the same QA process that we run the latest NVIDIA drivers through.

269
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:33,220
So the QA team has the full access to a complete lab of 76 hardware which covers a lot of chip

270
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,500
sets and configurations.

271
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,340
In doing so, our confidence grew that we'd be able to do it in a quality way that matched

272
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,860
what we were able to deliver before.

273
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,060
And so that's one of the shifts and things that we're learning from other distributions

274
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,180
is that users appreciate fresh packages and so we're working on, it's one step on working

275
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
on delivering that.

276
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
I love hearing that.

277
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
Yeah.

278
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,340
You know, so that kind of stuff is really music to my ears.

279
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,460
So yeah, I'm one of those users.

280
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,400
There's a few other things in here that I just wanted to cover with you as much as you

281
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,500
care to go into it.

282
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,820
But a couple of features that I think are really sort of fascinating, one of them is

283
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,620
this refresh OS feature that gives you the option to reinstall the OS without deleting

284
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
user data.

285
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,180
Can you just talk a little bit about the thought about prioritizing that as a feature, kind

286
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,180
of what went into that?

287
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,660
At first, it's actually been around for years.

288
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,860
It started, I think, and it might have been, I mean, in 2018, but we wanted to build a

289
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,780
new installer for Pop!

290
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
OS.

291
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,220
Ubiquity, we had some problems with the way that the powder box experience for an OEM

292
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
customer worked.

293
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,180
And so we wanted to build a new installer and we architected it in such a way that it

294
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,540
would create a restore partition.

295
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,460
And when you receive your computer, you're actually, during your setup, it's actually

296
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,080
installing the operating system.

297
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,540
But because of the way it was written and its efficiency, it installs it so quickly

298
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,260
that it doesn't feel like there's some gap of time.

299
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,480
What that enables us to do is offer full disencryption out of the box.

300
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
So the restore partition was kind of free.

301
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,980
We got that for free when we were redesigning the installer.

302
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,660
And one of the slickest parts of it is that you can go into the restore partition and

303
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,140
you can launch it from within settings.

304
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,820
You can go to OS upgrades and recovery and you can just click a button that says refresh

305
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,760
OS and it'll reboot to the recovery partition.

306
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,640
Click a couple of buttons, reboot, and your system is brand new, fresh out of the box.

307
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,660
And you have all of your files and documents and everything else there.

308
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,460
So it's not only just a nice feature for disaster recovery if something goes wrong, but every

309
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,260
once in a while you've been running your computer for an upgrading for a few releases and you

310
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,140
just want to clear out perhaps old dead apps that you haven't been using for a while.

311
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,740
It's just a way to start out brand new without losing anything or taking a step back.

312
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Yep.

313
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,220
And just to be clear, because there's been some question online, is that available on

314
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,880
any machine that does a clean install of POP or is that only available on system 76 machines?

315
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,060
That's any clean install of POP.

316
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
All right.

317
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,460
That's a feature that I think is also going to be really great like on my Raspberry Pi

318
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,180
400, which is one of the places I've been running POP 2110.

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,620
And that's an area where you could definitely get a little performance benefit every now

320
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,540
and then probably refreshing your OS like that.

321
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Oh yeah.

322
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,780
And the other thing with the Raspberry Pi or regular PCs as well, but if you're using

323
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,860
it to tinker with stuff and you're building things and experimenting and you just want

324
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,060
to start fresh, you don't have to download an ISO, burn it to a USB drive or any of that

325
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
kind of stuff.

326
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,380
You just reboot the restore partition, reinstall and you have a fresh install.

327
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
That really is.

328
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
All right.

329
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,060
I want to, right before I let you go, I just want to zoom out a little bit.

330
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,660
You know, I've been following you for 16 years and I know how dedicated you guys are

331
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,700
to this craft and to the Linux community and free software.

332
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,040
And I'd like to pick your brain as we're at the end of the year.

333
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,780
It's been a bit of a rough year with interacting with certain open source projects online for

334
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,820
system 76 over the year.

335
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:16,060
I'm curious to know what you think will be different from a system 76 standpoint in 2022

336
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,660
and how the company goes forward with community interaction or upstream coordination and that

337
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
kind of stuff.

338
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:33,820
I think the recent kerfluffles, I guess they are, I think they're narrow when it really

339
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,660
comes down to it.

340
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,340
The challenges that we tend to have are in areas that we disagree with the presentation

341
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,620
layer of GNOME.

342
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,780
We think that a desktop environment should be a number of components that you put together

343
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,540
to build an experience.

344
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:55,560
And that experience can be unique for a user or unique for a company or unique for a project.

345
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:03,820
And that differs in the way that GNOME is progressing, which is fine, it's just a difference.

346
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:12,340
So I think now that we're working on a desktop environment that will be unique and we coordinate

347
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,180
with other areas of the GNOME stack that aren't as controversial, I suspect that those type

348
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:28,080
of things that have really come up since 2017 with theming or icons or any of those changes

349
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,700
that we tend to think are necessary for our users, since we won't be doing those things

350
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,060
or modifying GNOME in that way, I think it's less likely that we'll have those type of

351
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
controversies show up.

352
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Sure.

353
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,620
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

354
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,680
It's been an interesting journey for Pop OS because it's clear there's a real natural

355
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,820
evolution line here where I admit it, when it first came onto the scene, I was like,

356
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,900
why do we need this?

357
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,080
This is essentially Ubuntu.

358
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,580
Why do we need Ubuntu with a different theme again?

359
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,000
And now here we are with 2110 and there's a lot of things Pop OS is doing differently.

360
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,380
And it's a lot of value add stuff.

361
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,540
I don't have issue with any of it.

362
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,700
And I wonder if just this desktop change and getting a stronger visual identity isn't just

363
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,460
part of this evolutionary process, like it was always going to happen.

364
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,340
And in free software, you have a lot of times people that are overworked.

365
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,040
There's a lot of passion on both sides.

366
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,180
People are in it because they're passionate about it and resources are limited.

367
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,580
And it's an environment that just can kind of sometimes lead to conflict over passionate

368
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,760
ideas.

369
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,480
But it kind of seems like this was maybe always the trajectory.

370
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,540
These things are going to kind of happen as a new desktop distribution kind of comes into

371
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,620
mainstream and it kind of discovers its own identity.

372
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,580
I think what should be expected is that people, I think in the value of open source and what

373
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:55,820
it is, is in that people can shape it to solve problems for other people.

374
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,420
And I think that's one of the core principles of open source.

375
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,020
The purpose of what we build is to enable people to do things with it.

376
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,900
Sometimes we think about that through the computers we create.

377
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,500
And we've been able to do that less so.

378
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,540
We think a lot about how people get things out of our products.

379
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,620
So when we develop a computer, we think about how can we make the best machine learning

380
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,180
desktop, not for people to put things on our platform, but to use our platform to get things

381
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,540
out of it.

382
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,700
And with the operating system, that's just an extension of that effort is enabling people

383
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,300
in the most efficient and best possible way to create things with the software that we

384
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
make.

385
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,060
And I think that's going to also be the case with cosmic desktop environment as we build

386
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
it.

387
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,580
It's not something that's modular, independent components that the people will be able to

388
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,740
put together into their own desktop environments.

389
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:01,140
And I think that that main mission of System76 to empower people is just being extended by

390
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,460
the work that we're going to be doing on the cosmic desktop.

391
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

392
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,820
I will have links in the show notes so everyone can check out Pop OS.

393
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,460
Carl, I hope you guys have a great 2022.

394
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,180
Is there a particular tangential technology to Linux?

395
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,340
Is there another technology that's developing right now that you're getting excited about

396
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,460
that you're going to keep an eye on over 2022?

397
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,980
I couldn't be more excited about the Linux desktop in general.

398
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,220
Everything that's happening, there's innovation happening in all sorts of different corners.

399
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,900
So yeah, we're digging into some of the deeper corners of what's going on in places like

400
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,660
WL Roots and other areas of the desktop.

401
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,140
I think what's happening with Silverblue and immutable desktops is really exciting work

402
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,300
and we're working on things in that area as well.

403
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,620
Hotpack and abstracting the application layer from the operating system is another advancement

404
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,860
that I expect us to grow and be more beneficial to users.

405
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Pipewire is exciting.

406
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,900
I hope to get it into Pop soon.

407
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,980
There's an enormous amount of innovation and creativity happening all throughout open source

408
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:13,140
and it doesn't take much digging to see a lot of creative and exciting things happening.

409
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,660
That's exactly how we feel too.

410
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,980
It's going to be a great year.

411
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Yeah.

412
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,660
This is a really fun time to be a part of the desktop and I'm just excited about what

413
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,940
everyone's working on and where it's all going.

414
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,220
Well, Carl, we're excited about what you're working on.

415
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,580
So thank you to you and the team for another great release and thanks for joining us on

416
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,580
the show.

417
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,580
Thanks for having me.

418
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Appreciate it.

419
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
lino.com slash unplugged.

420
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,500
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

421
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
show.

422
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
So it's lino.com slash unplugged.

423
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,700
And you guys know that's where we run everything for the last few years.

424
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,900
And part of what drew me in was when I met them at Linux Fest in Texas.

425
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,740
I could tell they were there, they were taking it serious and they were really Linux geeks

426
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,460
and I thought to myself, hmm, I got to try them out sometime.

427
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
That's why I tried it really.

428
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,220
And then I discovered, well, they've been around for 18 years and they've really figured

429
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,660
out how to do this right.

430
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,300
And they have stayed competitive like you wouldn't believe.

431
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,420
And now, well, now they're the largest independent cloud provider in the world.

432
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,380
And they've learned that customer support is absolutely critical.

433
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,500
They've invested in being the absolute best in the business.

434
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,200
I got a note from listener Kevin and he said, I've got a $5 Linode, but the support was

435
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
great and helpful.

436
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,940
You'd think I had $100 Linode.

437
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,380
I've never seen such expert level customer support on any other cloud provider.

438
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,940
The company really does what they say, he says.

439
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,220
He says, no support tiers, there were no handoffs, only highly trained techs.

440
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
And Kevin, you know it now, like when you need that, especially if you're running your

441
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,060
business infrastructure on there, it's so nice to know that's there.

442
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,000
Or even if it's just a project or something you're passionate about, it's great.

443
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,740
And then they have a bunch of easy deployments so you can just get going on an application

444
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,140
like Jitsi or GitLab, or you could build something from the ground up with a great, great resource

445
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,260
of documentation to pull from.

446
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,540
And 11 data centers means there's something close to you or your customers.

447
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,600
They have great features like object storage, cloud firewall backups, and they're all on

448
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,160
top of the log for shelf vulnerability.

449
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,740
They were monitoring it from day one.

450
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,140
They haven't seen any breaches in the entire Linode infrastructure, but their security

451
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,740
team is all over it, watching it like crazy, making sure that your systems are safe and

452
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,980
that the Linode infrastructure is safe.

453
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,460
So go build something, go learn something, and try it for yourself and support the show.

454
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,700
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account, and you

455
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,020
support the show.

456
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,100
It's like voting for Linux Unplugged to stick around a little longer.

457
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,220
Linode.com slash unplugged.

458
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,660
All right, well, now we've got the news straight from the horse's mouth, it's probably time

459
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,700
for our takes.

460
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,940
We've all been playing with the latest Pop OS a bit, but Brent, maybe you should start

461
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,660
things off because as far as I know, Pop OS is new to you, right?

462
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,380
I'm a little embarrassed to say I've never actually sat down and played with it.

463
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,500
I've seen, you know, lots of people, I've looked over a lot of people's shoulders while

464
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,840
they're using it and was always intrigued, but never really got a chance to sit down.

465
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,060
And so this was a perfect opportunity.

466
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:15,460
And I gotta say, I had fun in the first few minutes, I just part of the graphic design

467
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,460
of it all was just kind of fun and refreshing, which I totally expected from what I've seen

468
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,460
before.

469
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,720
So that's a little thing.

470
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,820
And Wes, you suggested that I try Ventoy to get this going on some actual hardware.

471
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,100
This is a little bit of a sidebar.

472
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Yeah.

473
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Did you give it a try?

474
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I did try Ventoy.

475
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,260
And I don't know how I missed this tool for so many years.

476
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Still writing ISOs by hand like an animal?

477
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,620
Oh, gosh, what have I been doing?

478
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,300
Which cave have I been in?

479
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,880
So for those who don't know, Ventoy is this tiny little tool that you can get and we will

480
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,580
certainly link to it where you just kind of run it and installs a little magic on your

481
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,420
USB drive and then you just drop ISOs in there as many ISOs as you want and you can easily

482
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
boot from them.

483
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,780
I don't know why I've been DDing to USB drives for so long.

484
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,320
This is embarrassing.

485
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,140
So Ventoy was an amazing discovery in this kind of pop experience.

486
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,020
So for me, that just started out really nicely.

487
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,140
So thank you too.

488
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,860
I found this little device.

489
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,220
I've talked about it before on the show.

490
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,020
You can probably find it if you go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and search for Ventoy.

491
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,260
But you might love this, Brent.

492
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,820
I almost want to get you one.

493
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,940
What it is, is it's a USB thumb drive, but it's like three, four times the size.

494
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,420
And on one end, it has USB-C and on the other end, it has USB-A. And on the inside, it has

495
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,940
an MVME storage drive that I bought off Amazon.

496
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,000
It's like 256 gigs and super, super, super fast.

497
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,300
So when I use USB-C on like a newer machine, it's unbelievable how quick it is.

498
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,780
And with 256 gigs, I've got like a dozen ISOs on there and still plenty of space to spare.

499
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,120
It's my favorite way to try out distros.

500
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,820
And it's just this combination of the Ventoy software, which gets better and better, and

501
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,140
this little USB device that I could put in a generic MVME drive in, a cheapo one.

502
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,420
And it has C and A. It's such a great setup.

503
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,620
You know, I actually imagine that would pair very well with QuickEMU as well.

504
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,020
Do the little, you know, the little wimpy shuffle.

505
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,700
That would be a nice pairing there.

506
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,300
Do you want to do a VM or do you want to do real hardware?

507
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
You got the choice.

508
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,300
It sounds like a great tool.

509
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,360
It actually, it does work.

510
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,740
Like if you just pass in the USB device to QEMU and if you've enabled the EFI stuff,

511
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,380
which QuickEMU helps you do, yeah, it just works.

512
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,260
It's exactly like using it on your actual hardware.

513
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,580
Oh, gentlemen, so much to play with.

514
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,460
So to continue with PopOS, since that was quite the aside, I had a lot of fun at first.

515
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,820
There were a few little things.

516
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,320
I know this was a little bit of a beta that we were playing with, but I had experienced

517
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,180
PopShop for the first time, which people like and some people don't like from what I discovered.

518
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,400
But for me, it seemed like a nice balance of sort of simplicity and choice.

519
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,640
Like Flatpak was super easy to enable and was available in all the searches and stuff,

520
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,620
but it was a tiny bit buggy in my experience.

521
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
But it was nice.

522
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,620
I used it exclusively, which is unusual for me, actually, I got to say.

523
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,620
I've been using PopShop exclusively for all of my updates and installs as well, which

524
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,380
is totally unusual behavior for me.

525
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,340
I tend to go to the command line, surprise, surprise.

526
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,700
But talking about power user stuff, did you try out the tiling features?

527
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,100
I wasn't going to because I thought, oh, this is not the kind of a new feature of this particular

528
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
release.

529
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,500
I was just in the top right corner there and I remember watching Carl sort of buzz his

530
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,580
way around his own machine when we got the tour at System76 this summer, and that seemed

531
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
really great.

532
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
So I did dive in.

533
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,180
I'm a total beginner to tiling.

534
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,300
This is the very first time I jump in because I always felt like it was a bit daunting.

535
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,940
I do love keyboard shortcuts and all of that, but it seemed daunting from all of the other

536
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,060
chatter I've seen everywhere about it.

537
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,780
But I knew Pop was doing something maybe a little simpler from it and giving it a shot,

538
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,860
it was, well, I will say I did find a really nice auto tiling tutorial from Pop OS on YouTube.

539
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,540
And that was like, I think it was like a minute and a half long, but didn't ever get me going.

540
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,740
And I got very, very excited about it.

541
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,740
So I think tiling might actually, I could imagine myself sort of falling in love with

542
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,440
it and I may give it more of a go than just this little spin I had.

543
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,740
So that was a really refreshing experience, I got to say.

544
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,380
Have you guys tried its tiling?

545
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,940
I mean, in a past life, I was definitely a tiling window manager user using Awesome,

546
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,180
i3, Xmonad from time to time.

547
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,460
But that's, you know, that's a whole different setup.

548
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,540
You kind of have to get into that mindset and worldview, whereas I really like the balance

549
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,460
that the Pop tiling strikes where I can have just a little tiling.

550
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,700
I don't have to spend a whole bunch of time configuring it.

551
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,660
And for the most part, it just has some reasonable defaults.

552
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:12,420
Yeah, I would love it if I could just assign some workspaces to tiling and some to free

553
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
floating.

554
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,960
Like maybe my main screen is free floating, but my second monitor is tiled or something

555
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,100
like that.

556
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,580
Or workspace one is free floating and workspace two is tiled.

557
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,620
That would be great because the way the way I tend to set up my Linux desktops is workspace

558
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:39,460
one is maybe a web browser and Kate or G edit and workspace two is slack, telegram, workspace

559
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,420
three is element and discord and workspace four is a terminal.

560
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Right.

561
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,680
And it's just not very efficient as I go down.

562
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,220
The more I increase the workspaces, the less efficient I am about how I arrange them.

563
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,020
Something tells me you really don't like being on workspace number two.

564
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Yeah, pretty much.

565
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,940
And when I'm on plasma, I actually use I'll just I just go all in on the Kwin rules.

566
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
Right.

567
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,420
That's how I kind of make it all work.

568
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,380
And it's it's not tiling, but it's at least kind of declarative about where things will

569
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
go.

570
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,860
And so for me, I kind of end up leaving the auto tiling off and Pop OS, even though I

571
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,140
it would be perfect for me in some scenarios.

572
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,700
So I what I find fascinating about everything you've said, though, Brent, is you have not

573
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,080
yet once made this a plasma versus gnome thing.

574
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,720
And I'm wondering, because you do live in plasma, I'm wondering how this transition

575
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
has been.

576
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,020
Is this a more power user version of gnome for you?

577
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,020
Oh, that is a great exploration.

578
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Hmm.

579
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,220
I think it may be a little early to say, to be honest.

580
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,860
But now that you asked that question, it surprises me that I didn't even think to compare the

581
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
two.

582
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Hmm, interesting.

583
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,320
I think maybe I wanted to come at it with really open eyes and not to have some kind

584
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,780
of idea of what it was going to be.

585
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,460
Without expectations, essentially.

586
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,420
Without expectations and without sort of thinking that it wouldn't work for me.

587
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,940
So I approached it as a potential paradigm shift.

588
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,780
Because I also haven't experienced gnome that much in the last, I don't know, four years,

589
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
I would say.

590
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
Nothing's changed in that time.

591
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Yeah, nothing at all.

592
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,260
And so I thought, well, I should give all of this a try.

593
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,300
And this is the pop OS version of it.

594
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,900
And so I don't have a good reference for what some of the other distributions have as a

595
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
base.

596
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,020
But maybe this is the beginning of that discovery.

597
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,700
Well, I think what you kind of touched on here is sort of what the attitude should be

598
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,380
for anybody who's trying Linux.

599
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,560
Like people who are coming from Windows and trying Linux for the first time should try

600
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,880
to take the mindset that you just took when trying out pop for the first time.

601
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
It's even more nerdy.

602
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,300
But like, it's the same thing when you're trying, you know, a new tool on the command

603
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,540
line or trying like a new programming language, you got to be willing to accept that you might

604
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,060
have to adopt a different workflow to maximally benefit from some of the things that this

605
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,540
new idea is trying to share with you, even if you ultimately don't end up adopting it

606
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,540
long term.

607
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Right.

608
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,500
And just be open to the idea that maybe there's a few things I learned, and I'll just learn

609
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,060
them in increments.

610
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,520
And then they build on top of each other.

611
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,380
But the other thing you haven't really touched on, and it's the thing I have the most opinion

612
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,460
about, it's that new app menu they have, they have a new app launcher that replaces the

613
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,700
full GNOME overview.

614
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,780
And it's more of a box that comes up in the middle of your screen.

615
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,500
And it has kind of a clear folder system.

616
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,580
So applications, utilities, that kind of stuff are all in their own folders.

617
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
All of that's there.

618
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,500
Plus, of course,

619
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,060
You don't say.

620
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,660
It's written in Rust.

621
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,860
Of course.

622
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
So what did you think of this?

623
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,360
Well, you know, so I, again, haven't experienced the old app menu.

624
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,660
And so, but all of the excitement about the new app menu, I thought, I got to give this

625
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
thing a try.

626
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,660
And I knew the shortcut, you know, super A. And then I wondered what was new about it.

627
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,780
Not because I was comparing it to what was old, but I just thought, oh, this seems essential.

628
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,560
And so I wonder what you guys think, because I didn't have a reference.

629
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,880
And so it just seemed to me like it was an essential piece of software.

630
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,860
And so I, from what I understand, it's different in that it's not full screen anymore.

631
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,960
And they've added some other features.

632
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
But can you guys fill me in?

633
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,980
Because I was a little puzzled on this one.

634
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,880
I have to say, I did, I did try it out because, you know, of course, but I'm already so hooked

635
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,820
on like the regular launcher, you know, like not seeing this whole graphical one, but just

636
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,780
the really snappy hit the super key start typing thing.

637
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm so sold on that.

638
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,220
I feel like this doesn't really add anything for me as nice as it may be.

639
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,220
Yeah.

640
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,340
So, you know, what's new here is maybe I think what's subtle about the launcher is or it's

641
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,340
not the launcher.

642
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,380
It is an application menu because the launcher is when you hit super key.

643
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
This is when you hit super key.

644
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:54,100
Hey, this is an application selector and application libraries, what they call it.

645
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,520
And to me, it's both the most interesting thing about this release and the most disappointing

646
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,100
thing for me personally, because to me, it has a very utilitarian look.

647
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,420
It kind of just seems sort of a 90s style application launcher, but it does do the essentials.

648
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
It lets you find stuff.

649
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,320
It categorizes things very easily.

650
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,960
Things are appropriately spaced out and it launches very fast.

651
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,800
So in terms of like a version one, it checks the minimum viable product that I need.

652
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,560
But it's no K runner and it lacks sort of the elegance that the genome shell launcher

653
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,020
and overview has.

654
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,460
It's an odd area, I feel personally, for system 76 to invest their time because this is an

655
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,180
area that upstream genome shell is actively iterating on and legitimately every single

656
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,920
release for the last year has improved this area of the genome shell.

657
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,340
So if you're going to like innovate somewhere in that space, you're kind of like doing work

658
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,980
that's already getting done for you free upstream.

659
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,700
But I think the difference here is system 76 has a different kind of view of how that

660
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,900
should look.

661
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:10,380
So with Pop OS now, you have two options up in the top left area of genome shell.

662
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,980
And one option is your typical like overview where you see your workspaces and all of that.

663
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,540
And they've broken out the applications as a second option, or you can hit super A. And

664
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,880
that brings up this application library that's been designed as a relatively small window

665
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,700
on your screen that's very flat, but it has a couple of subtle features that are nice

666
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,100
and you can see maybe where they're going with this.

667
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,980
Like I'll give you an example.

668
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,780
If you've got a multi monitor set up, it's designed in a way that when you open it up

669
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,580
on a workspace, it'll pay attention to where your cursor is and where your active windows

670
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,740
are and it will open up the application library on that screen and then launch the application

671
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,460
that you've chosen on that screen.

672
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,220
And if you have multiple monitors, that's a very, very, very nice feature.

673
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,580
And it does offer some things like that, that I think do bring value.

674
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,580
But overall, I don't know if I were like directing all of the areas I'd like to see improvement.

675
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,900
This would probably not be the area I would, I would spend my resources on because I already

676
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,260
have a launcher, but it is nice to have a place to browse everything that comes up really

677
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,820
quick that you can invoke with the keyboard if you like and all of that.

678
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,340
One other feature that I was looking forward to in the launcher, I called it a launcher,

679
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,700
it's an app menu, was the install suggestions.

680
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,700
I discovered this in openSUSE as KD take where I could just type the application I wanted.

681
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,100
If it wasn't installed, I could just sort of quickly get it installed through the menu,

682
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
which was really nice.

683
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:45,740
And I did see an app suggestions feature in the app menu, but it never presented anything

684
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,300
useful to me, even if I knew those were available to install.

685
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,580
So I don't know if that's a little bug.

686
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,820
Maybe it was just my own issues because it seems like I always run into the weird edge

687
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,820
cases.

688
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,220
But did you guys see anything useful in that area?

689
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,300
I didn't even try that actually.

690
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
That's interesting.

691
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,140
I was, I got in a pop shop and I was like, boop, pop, beep, I got everything I needed

692
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,220
on my Pi 400 and Thor bless him if they don't have Slack and Telegram right there when I

693
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,820
open the thing up.

694
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,140
Oh, great.

695
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,380
Like they really do nail some of that stuff.

696
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Yes.

697
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,260
When I put myself in the headspace of a new Linux adopter and I want to get these core

698
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
applications, they nail that stuff.

699
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,020
And now we just need Telegram and Slack to finally, you know, actually sync our dark

700
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
style preference.

701
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,180
And then there'll be hardly any setup to do on a new system.

702
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,780
But no, I mean, that's that stood out to me.

703
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Just the whole thing.

704
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,720
I mean, I really like I really like the work in the installer.

705
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
It's one of my favorite installers.

706
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,240
It just feels like it's a quick process.

707
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
It goes smoothly.

708
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,680
It's easy to click through.

709
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,380
And then when you first load it up, you get that that really nice welcome screen.

710
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,620
And it gives you feels like it's one of the most customizable sort of gnomish desktop

711
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
experience.

712
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
It's not too much.

713
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,180
I don't feel like it's the time I take to get plasma up and going, but it does kind

714
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,980
of let me make the system my own in a nice way.

715
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
I agree there.

716
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Yeah.

717
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,240
And they've got some good backgrounds they ship it with.

718
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,220
And that that final setup wizard lets you choose right there at the beginning.

719
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,060
Would you like light mode or dark mode?

720
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Yeah, exactly.

721
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,900
There's also just sort of a snappiness, a modernness, I don't know, you know, we've

722
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,340
been playing with other distros, we play with other package managers, we kind of give apt

723
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
a hard time.

724
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,140
And I don't know what it was, but I was the least annoyed with apt that I've been in a

725
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
while.

726
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Like it just felt it was snappy enough.

727
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
It was getting out of my way.

728
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,260
And part of it probably helped that yeah, like the pop shop actually worked.

729
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,540
It was one of the better experiences that I've had installing a flat pack in a GUI where

730
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,780
it didn't just sort of silently take forever in the background while installed all those,

731
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,240
you know, shared libraries and stuff behind the scenes.

732
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
That was really nice.

733
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
It just it just worked.

734
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Yeah, that is nice.

735
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,900
But also things like, you know, uses system D boot feels like they've customized just

736
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
enough.

737
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,220
They've modernized some of the stuff that I wish that Ubuntu and Debian world would

738
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
change.

739
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,860
And it makes it more like a system I might build in the arch world than kind of the stuff

740
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,660
I don't like and wish I could swap out, but don't ever spend the time to on a Debian system.

741
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,660
That's well put.

742
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,780
You also did a little bit of digging into that recovery environment.

743
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:18,100
Yeah, you know, I've been using Pop OS 2004 as sort of a gaming system.

744
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,980
You know, I do a couple of things on there, but it's really just a pure entertainment

745
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
setup.

746
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
So I haven't felt the need to update it.

747
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,260
So it's been a little bit since I've checked in with Pop OS.

748
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,420
And when I was installing it, I was like, oh, hey, what what's this recovery partition

749
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,260
that exists now?

750
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,260
And it's it's great.

751
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,940
It's just like a little Casper setup, much like much like the live CD itself.

752
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,860
But they've added some tool into the OS to, you know, make sure things happen like the

753
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:46,160
restore partition is updated prior to upgrade in the OS and it kind of keeps that all happening

754
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,940
and just means if you want to refresh things, if you need to reinstall from scratch, that's

755
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,860
available even if it didn't come from system 76, just from a clean install, which I don't

756
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,060
know, I probably won't need a ton of even though I was interested technically in like

757
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,380
the nice stuff they've done to make it play nicely with EFI systems in particular.

758
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,860
But if I'm installing this on a friend or a family's PC, that gives me a nice background

759
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,900
sense of, OK, there's a safety net there.

760
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,900
You know, you touched on something there, Wes, that resonated with me.

761
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,380
And I'll take it just a little bit further and I'll say this.

762
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,020
I wish this was Ubuntu.

763
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,820
I wish this was base Ubuntu.

764
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
Yeah.

765
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,620
Wouldn't that be great if this was like the baseline and then what Pop was building on

766
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,820
top of was already this good and they could just add more stuff, more value on top of

767
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
that?

768
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,820
That's it.

769
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,100
That's that's what I want.

770
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Yeah, it kind of feels like it's the Ubuntu that if they had stayed really excited and

771
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,220
focused on the desktop and we're pushing forward, this would probably be areas they're pushing

772
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,220
on.

773
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,140
And this new application library, it's a good start because if they do want to build their

774
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,500
own environment in the future, it makes sense to get the users familiar with some of these

775
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
tools.

776
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,980
Now, we always say this about switching people to Linux, don't we?

777
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:03,460
Like have them use Firefox and LibreOffice and, you know, tools that they'll use on Linux

778
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,580
like GIMP first, once they get used to those tools, then switch them to Linux.

779
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,140
And then it's only 50 percent of the switch.

780
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,940
And it kind of feels like and I tried to get that out of Carl and he kind of kind of implied

781
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:22,420
it, but it does feel like some of this stuff is laying the groundwork to get people familiar

782
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,840
with a workflow that will become commonplace when they have their own environment.

783
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,580
And I think an application library like this is a good start.

784
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,060
I just don't really understand why there's a launcher and this because this new application

785
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,720
library launches just as fast as the launcher does.

786
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,840
And of course, it's written in Rust.

787
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,940
So it just seems like it should be the supreme launcher.

788
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,740
And if you wanted to kind of take my criticisms I have about the launcher, like the fact

789
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,580
that it feels a little utilitarian, feels a little bit of Windows 2000, but just in

790
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,220
dark mode, it's functional, and that's my way of saying it's absolutely 100 percent

791
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,220
functional.

792
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
It runs fast.

793
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,120
It's not over frilly or anything like that.

794
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,380
It does its core job really well.

795
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,700
But it really feels like because it is one of the very first things you interact with

796
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,960
the Pop OS desktop, it does feel like it sets a tone.

797
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,900
And this is kind of an older workflow, an older environment, a little bit of a more

798
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,140
of a mate experience.

799
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,340
And if you wanted to see something where they're just where they're nailing it, it's over on

800
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
the Mac side.

801
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,940
Actually, I hear about this from developers on Coda Radio.

802
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,820
It's called Raycast.

803
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,920
It's an app launcher and it's good looking.

804
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
It has a super powerful feature set.

805
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,540
The hype is so real.

806
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Get this.

807
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:44,060
A fricking app launcher on the Mac just got 15 million dollars in VC funding, but yeah,

808
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,380
people really care about this stuff.

809
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,940
And that's for a platform, by the way, that comes with Spotlight.

810
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,400
That is an app launcher built in, right?

811
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,160
So people really care about this app launcher stuff.

812
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,980
And what I feel like what we have right now is kind of like this weird hybrid where there's

813
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,740
two components, the application library and the launcher.

814
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,140
And they're both extremely functional, but neither one of them feels particularly graphically

815
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
innovative.

816
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,220
And it doesn't have to be blow away, but it'd be nice to have it feel a little more modern.

817
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,180
One thing I like about the older launcher now, I guess, is that it's at least minimal,

818
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,600
you know, and to some extent that's what I want in a launcher is like just like barely

819
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,540
notice it because it's so fast and it just gets out of my way and it launches the thing

820
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,860
that I want that I'm less concerned.

821
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,180
But you're right, like when it starts taking up as in the application version, when it

822
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,020
takes up more of your screen, having it look pleasing probably gets more important.

823
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,960
Yeah, it just makes it also makes the desktop environment feel like it's more modern.

824
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,700
And when it feels more modern, it feels like it's well engineered.

825
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,240
And when it's well engineered, I think, well, if the OS is well engineered, then I bet those

826
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,620
desktop machines are well engineered or those laptops are well engineered, right?

827
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,440
So it kind of all connects together.

828
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,300
But I tried it on my Pi 400.

829
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,540
And that's an interesting experience, because I also tried this on an older Intel PC that

830
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,580
a listener Mike had sent in to for us that I use for testing.

831
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,780
And it's an older Xeon with spinning rest disks.

832
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,680
And it's a perfectly usable machine.

833
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,860
If you remember how slow it was to use spinning rest, that's what it feels like the Pi 400.

834
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:21,740
And I'm running off of a USB SSD, not an SD card, but it's usable.

835
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,400
And it's perfectly usable as a work machine.

836
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,100
And I'm talking fully up to date Pop OS, right 2110 with the latest Linux 15.5 kernel, latest

837
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,240
GNOME 40.

838
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,960
And I'm using it on a Pi 400, which is a keyboard.

839
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,880
And I've set it up to do my email.

840
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,620
It's got my browser profiles on there, my SSH keys.

841
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:46,020
I like to have this Pi 400 as like my go-to, something's not right with my main machine.

842
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,520
Maybe I'm trying some distro or maybe I didn't remember to bring my laptop or whatever, right?

843
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,700
Like I just have a machine here at the studio that I can get work done on.

844
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,700
And it's great for that.

845
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,820
And in fact, for some reason, that application library concept almost feels like it works

846
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:05,980
better on that little 1080p display I have connected to my Raspberry Pi 400.

847
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,500
Like as the constraints got tighter, the innovations they've done here in 2110 actually felt like

848
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,580
they paid more dividends.

849
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,380
And like, why waste time with a big screen takeover?

850
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,980
Well, that's an interesting environment to challenge it, yeah.

851
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,460
Yeah, it pushed it, right?

852
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
So I like it there.

853
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,920
I think I'm going to leave it on the Pi 400.

854
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,140
But the one thing I'd love to see from Pop OS is I'd love to see them put out a full

855
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,680
fledged ARM ISO image presently, and this is common for a lot of distros, you download

856
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:39,220
a pre-built image and you flash it to an SD card or a USB SSD in my case.

857
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,740
Then you boot off of it and if you're lucky, they'll have a first time setup wizard at

858
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,940
first boot like Pop OS does.

859
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,100
And you set up a user account and all that stuff's fine.

860
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:53,140
But I and a lot of other Pi users are actually beginning to transition to the Compute Module

861
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,260
4 with a built in eMMC.

862
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,980
And it has been so great for distros like OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed where I can just boot

863
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:08,180
from a standard ISO image and I run through the standard installer and I select the eMMC

864
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,180
like a regular disk and then I have what feels like a fully clean install, safer, fresher,

865
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,180
totally mine, right?

866
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,280
When I flash an image to an SD card or to a hard drive, I feel like I'm booting into

867
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,620
somebody else's install, like I'm using somebody else's computer and I'm adding my account

868
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,620
on top of it.

869
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,620
I know it's probably not much technically different, but I would rather just install

870
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,500
on my ARM devices like I install on all my x86 devices.

871
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,640
But I need an actual ISO to do that, not an image file.

872
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,100
But it is nice to have an image file.

873
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,140
And the reality is with Linux 5.15 baked in there now, they're at a point where a lot

874
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:48,860
of the upstream drivers for the 400 and the Pi 4 and the Pi 3 and a lot of other ARM devices

875
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,140
are just built in now.

876
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,480
You don't have to have like a specific image with weirdo patches anymore.

877
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,000
So hopefully we'll see that transition in the future because I plan to keep testing

878
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
on ARM.

879
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, that's just it.

880
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,920
I mean, we're finally in this world where you can have this more traditional behavior

881
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,460
we got used to on x86 in the ARM world.

882
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,580
And OK, yeah, even if it's not strictly necessary, it's so fun to play with.

883
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,580
It's true.

884
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,300
A couple of things to cover before we get out of here.

885
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,540
The Tuxes are next week.

886
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,100
This is our second to last live episode on a Tuesday.

887
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,500
So if you'd like to join us on a Tuesday next week and the week after are your last chances.

888
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
And then it's Sundays.

889
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,220
I also want to say thank you to our members over at UnpluggedCore.com.

890
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,220
This week in particular, some of the best bits are actually in the live member stream.

891
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,220
They're not making it into the show.

892
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,940
We've had to do we had to do an intermission this week.

893
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,380
It happens sometimes.

894
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,300
Our members get that content.

895
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,660
The shows now also offer a totally ad free feed.

896
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,540
So if you'd like a version of the show with absolutely zero ads, that's now available

897
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,820
to our members.

898
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:54,060
And we have launched a network membership.

899
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,440
It's been some work, but it's here and it's a Jupiter.party.

900
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,060
Every member benefit, every ad free feed, the bonus content from the show from self

901
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,900
hosted from Kota Radio.

902
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,020
It's now available for just the price of two show memberships.

903
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,740
But if you sign up before the end of the month, I'm taking two dollars off for a year.

904
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
Jupiter.party.

905
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,180
You can also give the gift of a Jupiter broadcasting membership that's over Jupiter party.

906
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:23,260
Jupiter.party, you know, Jupiter dot something super expensive except for a couple of them

907
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,620
and dot party was one of them.

908
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,620
So how could I not?

909
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,620
So it's Jupiter.party.

910
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Why?

911
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,660
Because it was a great deal on Namecheap.

912
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,560
As you might expect, hearing from you, our dear audience is a big part of where we get

913
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:45,300
topic ideas, find out what you like or really don't like and all the cool projects and software

914
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,980
and services that you're following these days.

915
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:55,500
And this week, Paul wrote in picking up on the Slackware topic from last episode, I really

916
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
enjoyed episode 435.

917
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,500
It was nice to hear Slackware being mentioned.

918
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,540
However, I was a bit shocked that everybody thought Slackware was only updated half a

919
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,540
decade ago.

920
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:12,600
In fact, it's a lesser known secret that there's another version of Slack hiding in plain sight.

921
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,820
It's called Slackware current.

922
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,960
It's a bleeding edge rolling release that's updated several times a day.

923
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,220
Most Slack users are actually running this as we have the latest stable kernels, plasma

924
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,300
on Wayland, pipe wire, and all the new goodies like WireGuard are easily accessible with

925
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,620
packages.

926
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,920
Switching from 14.2 to current is pretty easy as well, you just modify some stuff in Etsy

927
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,220
and then run a normal system update.

928
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,540
And despite it being a rolling release, well, in typical Slackware style, it's still more

929
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,060
stable and bug-free than the majority of long-term releases in those other distributions.

930
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:54,520
In fact, I always upgrade Mila nodes from 14.2 to current since it makes a super solid

931
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,700
and reliable server OS.

932
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:02,820
But with all the benefit of the latest toys, it still makes a great desktop OS as well.

933
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:08,580
And while on that topic of updates, when Patrick's ready, he'll take the latest current as 15.0,

934
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,140
seems due out quite soon.

935
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,540
So is he saying, like, he's using Slack rolling, essentially, is that what I'm hearing?

936
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,540
That's what I heard.

937
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,820
I mean, gosh, I didn't really realize and yeah, maybe we missed this option in our server

938
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,820
poll.

939
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,820
Yeah.

940
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,780
Wouldn't that have been funny to run that as one of our server OSs?

941
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,840
I knew Slackware got updated more than a decade, but I didn't really appreciate that there's

942
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,580
more of a Slackware current.

943
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,180
Although I would not be surprised to learn that Slackware's current is a little bit different

944
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,860
than my definition of current.

945
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,060
I think there's only one way to find out, Chris.

946
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
You're right.

947
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,700
Hmm, perhaps a future episode with.

948
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,140
Staying with the Slackware for one more email.

949
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,860
Tristan wrote in with a nod to our nod to Slackware.

950
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,940
A long time ago when Windows support for friends and family frayed my last nerve and Macs were

951
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:03,580
strange and exotic beasts I couldn't afford, I decided to build my first Linux machine.

952
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,220
With all popular advice and with an abundance of overconfidence, I opted for Slackware as

953
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,020
my distro of choice.

954
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,220
This went as well as you might expect for a noob.

955
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,060
Within an hour, I'd found that my video card modules weren't updated in the bundled Slack

956
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,300
kernel, stumbled my way through a kernel upgrade, got my first taste of Toben C. Hell, then

957
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,940
rendered my system unbootable.

958
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,060
Within the next few hours, I'd been introduced to Lilo and Xorg.com.

959
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,900
As frustrating as all of that sounds, the ability to delve deep into the workings of

960
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:44,500
my OS, adapt it to my needs, and with a careless typo break it entirely, hooked me for life.

961
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,460
Eventually the package management limitations, depths of dependency hell, and badly mucked

962
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,460
up file system mess I had created led me to move on.

963
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:58,260
While I don't see any reason besides masochism and nostalgia to ever go back, I will forever

964
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,260
be grateful to Slackware for forcing me to learn the basic fundamentals of the Linux

965
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
architecture.

966
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,860
They are lessons that have served me well in every distro since, and a forced deep dive

967
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,620
gave me a lifetime passion for the open source concept, community, and the incredible OS

968
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,300
it has spawned.

969
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,700
It sounds like last week we heard a little bit, and even this week, that that's not an

970
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,820
uncommon situation for those who were lucky enough to try Slackware in its heyday, and

971
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,700
I just thought this was a nice nod to that.

972
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:35,080
Yeah, you know what I connected with Tristan's story there was a lot of what Tristan explained

973
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,540
about Slackware, I would say happened with me, but Gentoo.

974
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,080
I learned so much about Lilo and Xorg with Gentoo, and I learned so much about how file

975
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,060
partitioning works and stuff by doing Gentoo.

976
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,540
I always very fondly think of Gentoo in that way.

977
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,420
It forced me to learn the basic fundamental Linux architecture, just like Slackware did

978
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,060
for them.

979
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,220
I love that, Tristan.

980
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:03,020
I think that exactly connects with my experience there, but just one branch over, because Slackware

981
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:07,420
was around when I began Linux in my time, but there was other options at that point.

982
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,540
I think I'd argue Arch is that kind of similar experience for many as well.

983
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,860
I don't know if it's quite as much of a deep dive, you guys would know more than that than

984
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:21,480
I would, but certainly it has you knee deep in some technical stuff and learning, so that

985
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,660
seems like a nice approach too.

986
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,460
Yeah, I suppose it just depends on how deep you go down that rabbit hole, and you hear

987
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,300
that too about Linux from scratch and that kind of stuff as well.

988
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,780
They're great learning opportunities, almost from a computer sciency standpoint, not necessarily

989
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,420
even just from a learn Linux standpoint, although you will absolutely do that, but along the

990
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,100
way you'll also learn a little bit about how computers work, and I do feel like that's

991
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
pretty super valuable.

992
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,740
We've got to keep moving on.

993
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,980
We're going long here.

994
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:54,220
We have a last minute pick, and I got to assume this is a Westpain pick because, well, I'll

995
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,220
read the description and then I think it'll be obvious, quote, this app uses WebRTC to

996
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,020
stream a desktop inside of a Docker container.

997
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,980
Yeah, this has been floating around for a bit, but it looks like there's been a few

998
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:13,180
of these, and in particular Neko here has been revived, maintainership taken over by

999
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,180
a new user.

1000
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,220
I just thought maybe we could highlight it because it seems super flexible.

1001
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,780
Maybe we could use it in an OBS type setup, or if you're just trying to hang out with

1002
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:27,100
remote friends and you want to watch something together, this could be a good option.

1003
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,140
There's a lot of stuff here, but what stands out to me about Neko is, A, it's just very

1004
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,220
smooth, but it's got chat built in, it's got emotes built in.

1005
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,380
It just seems very sophisticated and easy to get started with.

1006
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,380
Yeah, fair enough.

1007
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,300
I was thinking for this, Wes, if you were somebody who frequently recorded tutorials,

1008
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,340
how-to kind of videos, and you wanted a clean setup that you could work out of and then

1009
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,260
after you're done with the video, just kind of destroy it, like maybe you've used a VM

1010
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,500
for traditionally, you could probably use this, right?

1011
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,140
The nice thing is, with a WebRTC stream, I don't know for sure, but I would imagine there's

1012
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,180
a pretty straightforward way to capture that into OBS for recording that kind of thing.

1013
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,520
I would think so.

1014
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,780
It also seems nice just for, you know, we've talked about Jellyfin being able to do streaming.

1015
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,900
There's some sort of custom sites out there that'll do it just for YouTube or just for

1016
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:19,060
Netflix or some of the other big popular platforms, but this is kind of a nice hack using a bunch

1017
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,180
of different technologies we talk about that lets you do this for basically any website.

1018
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:29,460
Neko will have a link in the show notes so that way you can go see their logo with excessive

1019
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
cat butt.

1020
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,820
Oh gosh, I can't help but notice that the cat is very well rendered.

1021
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,180
That's a very accurate, I will just say, it's a treat.

1022
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:43,940
You're not going to forget that logo, you know, you're not, absolutely.

1023
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,300
If you'd like more show, remember there is the Luplug, it gets together every single

1024
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,600
Sunday at noon and when the show moves to Sundays, there's still going to be a get together

1025
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,100
happening there because we won't really be live until about 12, 31 o'clock on Sundays.

1026
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,700
The pre-pre-show is going to happen in the virtual lug and we'll also have an event happening

1027
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,700
on Tuesdays.

1028
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:07,160
So there's more opportunity than ever to participate in that virtual lug and chat with like-minded

1029
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,660
Linux users, ask questions, share experiences.

1030
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,240
It's a pretty fun experience and you can get details on how to join that at linuxunplug.com

1031
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,480
slash mumble.

1032
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,900
And if you are in the tech industry, do not miss Linux action news.

1033
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,460
You got to stay current on this stuff because Linux touches so much of what we do in the

1034
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,780
tech industry now.

1035
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,160
So even if you're not a daily Linux driver, I think it's pretty essential you stay current

1036
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,620
on what's going on in the world of Linux and we do that at linuxactionnews.com.

1037
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,420
But we will be back for a couple of more Tuesdays.

1038
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,420
See you next week.

1039
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,340
Same bad time, same bad station.

1040
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,260
That's right.

1041
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:50,380
So while it lasts, join us noon Pacific on a Tuesday at jblive.tv and then links to everything

1042
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,860
we talked about today, how to contact us.

1043
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,460
That's a big part of the show.

1044
00:57:54,460 --> 00:58:00,060
Our mumble info, our matrix info, including our new cryptocurrency matrix room.

1045
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,060
Yeah, I did it.

1046
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,060
I did it.

1047
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,240
I admit it.

1048
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,740
That's all over there.

1049
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,020
Or you can join colony.jupitabroadcasting.com.

1050
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:15,240
But thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Linux Unplugged program.

1051
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:30,980
And for at least a little bit longer, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1052
00:58:45,240 --> 00:59:02,760
All right, I need the chat room and everybody watching live to go boat over at JBtitles.com.

1053
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,060
And then if you guys would just allow for a second, we're going to have a little powwow.

1054
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:12,340
Brent, Wes, if you guys could just come over here just just for a second.

1055
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,580
The Cone of Silence.

1056
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,580
Not the code again.

1057
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,780
I love the code.

1058
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,180
Well, I've gone and done it.

1059
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,020
I'm going to scratch you guys know I'm going to scratch this new Linux show we're working

1060
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,020
on.

1061
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,900
I'm just going to punt it for now.

1062
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,300
I don't think we're there.

1063
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,360
Yeah, I don't think brunch with Chris was very good title anyway.

1064
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,780
And I don't have the new servers hooked up yet as of right now.

1065
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,460
And I don't know if we're going to run into issues with the storage controllers.

1066
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,780
I don't know if we're going to run into any issues with the disks.

1067
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,340
There could be a bad disk because we bought them used.

1068
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,860
I don't even have a spot cleared out in the garage yet.

1069
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,500
So I'm kind of freaking out just a little bit because the holidays are approaching.

1070
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,260
So I figured we got to let something go right.

1071
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,100
We got to make we got to make a concession somewhere.

1072
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,900
And I feel like I just I had to let I got a punt on the new show so we can focus on

1073
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,700
luck and we can focus on the server stuff.

1074
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,820
Is that new show like permanently canceled or is it just getting moved down the line

1075
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,240
a few weeks or months or whatever?

1076
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,700
I don't know yet.

1077
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,100
So I'm either going to I'm either going to move it down the line, which is my first line

1078
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:24,820
of thinking, or I'm going to take what we were going to do and I might try to integrate

1079
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,740
it into a little bit into land and a little bit into love.

1080
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,820
I don't know.

1081
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:35,500
It feels like honestly, we got enough podcasts at this point and I I could just kind of channel

1082
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,200
that into what we already do.

1083
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,860
But I have not figured that out yet.

1084
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,860
This is what I did is I don't know how it happened.

1085
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,900
I think it's because I'm a dumb person.

1086
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,940
But like I just kept on pretending like the holidays weren't a thing and just sort of

1087
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,980
like bit off more than I could chew thinking, well, I'll just work through this, right?

1088
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,980
It's October.

1089
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:55,980
How hard could it be?

1090
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Yeah.

1091
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,980
Then you forget.

1092
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,820
Oh, wait, no, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that's about to come up.

1093
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,820
Yeah.

1094
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:07,060
I'm really lucky that this show and I don't think land either land on an actual holiday

1095
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,060
like that.

1096
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,100
That is rare.

1097
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,100
That's very unusual.

1098
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,100
Yeah.

1099
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Yeah.

1100
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,300
So I think we're just you know, we're just going to do, you know, business as usual and

1101
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,620
then we'll move to the Sunday.

1102
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:21,620
But oof, I feel bad about it because I was pretty excited about the idea and the concept.

1103
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,620
So we'll see.

1104
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,620
We'll see what happens.

1105
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,180
Maybe it's a cue like you one, maybe early Q2 thing.

1106
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,900
I have another show I also want to do in the meantime, so we'll see what happens.

1107
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,300
I got a couple of ideas going on right now.

1108
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:38,140
It's been a little bit, but you know, it's been almost 16 months since we went independent.

1109
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,140
Wow.

1110
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:40,140
Yeah.

1111
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,060
We're just like 15.5 months into it right now.

1112
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,480
Pretty awesome.

1113
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,700
And so I'm you know, the first bit was really like survive and transition from being an

1114
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,060
employee to running a business and like trying to keep while all the shows right, like without

1115
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,660
missing a week and trying to get all of that figured out and then figuring out how to like

1116
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,820
the income going so I can actually get paid because like for the first four months or

1117
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,260
five months, I didn't make a dime.

1118
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,820
And then like trying to just kind of figure out how to make it sustainable.

1119
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:15,740
And now I'm at the point now where I'm thinking, OK, where do we want to go?

1120
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,620
What's the next 10 years look like?

1121
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:21,020
What's the next big trends in open source and free software and that kind of stuff?

1122
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,240
And that's a really good place to be at.

1123
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:29,300
But it also means that I have to choose wisely because we have limited time, limited resources

1124
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,820
and limited finances.

1125
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,660
And so while there's like a million options now available to me, I really have to be careful

1126
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,660
about it.

1127
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,680
And so that's why I'm just waiting for a little bit, because honestly, if I can make the existing

1128
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:46,080
shows better, that may actually be my first preference and then look at what remains,

1129
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,940
what is still uncovered and then see if there's a space for a show that I think is going to

1130
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,940
be my approach.

1131
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,140
I also think we'd always rather do something well than quickly.

1132
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,140
Right.

1133
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,940
And so that has kind of been our philosophy for a long time.

1134
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,940
You've taught me that, Chris.

1135
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:05,080
And so I think it's probably a great idea to push a little bit and see where it goes

1136
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,300
and see how we grow from now to then.

1137
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,300
Yeah.

1138
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,020
I also kind of feel like one of the things that's holding back how much we can get done

1139
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,940
is we're all remote.

1140
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:21,960
And so if I had like what I really need is I need to not be the person who's like making

1141
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,220
infrastructure things happens.

1142
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,100
I shouldn't because I'm also the CEO.

1143
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,900
I'm also the editor in chief and I'm also the host on most of the shows, I probably

1144
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:34,060
shouldn't be the person who's like clearing space, moving servers, wiring them and getting

1145
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,060
the OS installed.

1146
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,060
Right.

1147
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,220
Like, I want to be, but I shouldn't be.

1148
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:44,020
If our team was all in Seattle, if all of us were here, somebody, one of us would be

1149
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,180
working on the server right now, like one of us, because that's that's how we are right.

1150
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,700
But because nobody, it's just me here and Wes here.

1151
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:56,060
It's like we're we're spending a lot of plates already, so the server is just not happening.

1152
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:01,200
What I what I need is like another set of hands that can just help with some of these

1153
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,420
things like getting the server hooked up, getting the OS installed, that kind of stuff.

1154
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:11,320
And so many times, I think I wish there was like a listener in the area that had time

1155
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,820
to spare that wanted to do this stuff.

1156
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:19,700
But because the audience is so spread out, there's dozens of us everywhere, but we're

1157
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,260
just spread out enough that we don't kind of have that magic that happens when multiple

1158
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,380
people that have the same idea and the same goals are working in the same place.

1159
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,620
We get it every now and then, and we've done sprints in the past and we'll do sprints in

1160
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,620
the future.

1161
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,660
And that we've seen that really happens, right?

1162
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,700
That's where self-hosted came from.

1163
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,840
The last JB Sprint, self-hosted was born.

1164
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,680
Like things come from that.

1165
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,920
But with the Rona and the budget, it's just it's at a slower pace.

1166
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,760
And so here I am, I'm still balancing how I operate this thing.

1167
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,820
Because honestly, for me, doing the shows is a full-time job and anything that happens

1168
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:03,100
outside of the show productions and content preparation is bonus.

1169
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:08,100
The irony is that means running the business, sponsor stuff, taking care of infrastructures.

1170
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,740
It's so much extra stuff that it's a slow pace.

1171
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,860
And I kind of backed myself into a corner because this hardware is dying out in the

1172
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,860
garage.

1173
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,820
So we got to get swapped over.

1174
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:23,420
We got to move before it dies because we all know it's on its last legs.

1175
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,420
Oh, good.

1176
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,580
Optimus is going to just mail us a clone of West.

1177
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,660
Well, actually, that's great.

1178
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,000
Thank you.

1179
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Problem solved.

1180
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,660
Yeah, we tried that already, but it came out evil.

1181
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,460
It was rough.

1182
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,460
Yeah.

1183
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,460
You know what?

1184
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:52,660
You chose the goatee option every time you choose the goatee.
