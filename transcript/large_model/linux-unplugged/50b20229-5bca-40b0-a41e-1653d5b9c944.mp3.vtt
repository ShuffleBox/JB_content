00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 10 for October 15th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.840
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast observing the Linux

00:39.840 --> 00:43.640
landscape from its unplugged observatory high above it all.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.880
My name is Chris.

00:44.880 --> 00:45.880
My name is Matt.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.040
I don't know about all that high above it stuff, but I thought it sounded good.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
Sounds good to me.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.680
Sometimes we kind of get down into it, actually.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
This is true.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.100
You know, this week, one of the things I want to talk to you about, Matt, is how to shake

00:55.100 --> 00:57.240
off this Ubuntu hangover that I have right now.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Oh my goodness.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.840
Yeah, so to really fully appreciate this week's episode of Linux Unplugged, there is a little

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
homework involved.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
You don't have to.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.200
I think it'll stand on its own, but if you have the time, you should go back.

01:08.200 --> 01:14.260
On Sunday, we did Linux Action Show's Ubuntu 13.10 review, and that's sort of the jumping

01:14.260 --> 01:16.480
off point for some of the stuff we're going to cover in this episode.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.160
Then on Monday, we did an episode of Coder Radio called Betting on Linux, which I managed

01:21.160 --> 01:27.720
to turn into a therapy session and really, really dug into sort of the issues I have

01:27.720 --> 01:32.720
around the Ubuntu Dash and why it sort of viscerally bothers me, and some of the issues

01:32.720 --> 01:37.760
I think it might cast about the Ubuntu project in whole, but again, not critical that you

01:37.760 --> 01:41.100
listen to that, but I think it might give you some context, because this week, we're

01:41.100 --> 01:44.680
going to follow up on some comments that you guys have made on our review, some comments

01:44.680 --> 01:48.240
on learning Linux, and then we're going to kind of roll that into the big picture of

01:48.240 --> 01:54.240
Linux, like maybe a world where Ubuntu isn't king, and a world where maybe not all distros

01:54.240 --> 01:58.140
live forever, and they change, and sometimes people have to go somewhere else, and how

01:58.140 --> 02:02.540
Linux users, especially the savvy ones, can kind of control that, and sort of instead

02:02.540 --> 02:06.560
of be victim to it, sort of control what their destiny is.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.560
I like that idea.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.920
I definitely think it's important to remember that, you know, different strokes, different

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
folks, right?

02:12.920 --> 02:15.200
Yeah, and what goes up must come down, Matt.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
That's right.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
Perhaps, perhaps.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.880
But why don't we start with a little follow up for this here show, an ongoing topic.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.960
We've gotten a lot of emails about it, and I've kind of had to be a little picky on what

02:22.960 --> 02:25.660
we put in here, just because we've gotten so many, which is awesome.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.280
But we talked a lot about recently with kids, and learning Linux, and learning computers

02:29.280 --> 02:35.320
in general, and we got a lot of emails from teenagers, you know, young teens, and even

02:35.320 --> 02:38.720
younger than teenage years, saying, hey, don't think it's all of us.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.640
That's awesome, and good for you guys, definitely.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.820
Mike wrote in, and he says, learning the nuts and bolts, Matt and Chris, not everybody either

02:46.820 --> 02:50.320
wants or can understand how things work.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.680
To some, their computer is an appliance and nothing else.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.680
So here's his background.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.860
He says, I happen to be one of the weird guys who does need to know.

02:57.860 --> 03:03.040
As a kid in the late 50s, I built my own radios, learned how to read schematics and solder.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.640
I was also the bicycle repair guy for the neighborhood.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.960
At 16, my first paid job was an electric golf cart repair guy.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.400
After two years in the Army as a draftee from 66 to 68, I got a job as a programmer trainee.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.680
In spite of not having a degree, I just scored very high in the IBM aptitude test.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.480
Next language I learned was the IBM 360 assembler.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.240
He's also picked up five distinct assembly language.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.160
Today, at 66, I still program and do web stuff and administer systems, including OpenSUSE,

03:28.160 --> 03:32.280
Debian, and Ubuntu, and I'm still being paid to play with the toys.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.160
I also have an advanced class in ham radio license, as well as a commercial pilot license

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
with instruments.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.880
I can teach almost anybody to program, but if it's not fun and enjoyable, they'll suck

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
at it.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
Mike.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.680
So this is a great point that Mike makes here.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.560
And you know what else I loved about Mike's email is, so we have, we've gotten emails

03:48.560 --> 03:52.720
from 10-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 16-year-olds saying, hey, don't count us out.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.760
And now you got Mike here at the other end of the spectrum saying, you know, at 66, we

03:56.760 --> 03:57.760
still like to do this stuff too.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.520
And you know, my grandpa, who's quite a few years beyond Mike, also, you know, he loves

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
playing with Linux.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.000
He loves playing with netbooks.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.600
And now he's getting into the open tablets.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.600
I gave him-

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
That's cool.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.960
I guess, I forget, I had a tablet that was going to be the Spark tablet for a while.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.960
Oh yeah, I remember that.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.760
Yeah, I gave it to my grandpa so that way he could load it wherever he wants on it,

04:16.760 --> 04:18.720
because he's just, he loves doing that kind of stuff.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.080
And I think he's, he just hit 80, actually.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.080
That's awesome.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
Yeah.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
You know, it keeps you, it keeps you feeling young.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.280
It keeps you involved and active and doing cool stuff.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.280
You know?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.280
Yeah, totally.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
It's, it is good to see that.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.540
And so while maybe, maybe the general populace, you know, and, and even in a decreasing number

04:34.540 --> 04:37.640
of people will be specialists, there's still some out there.

04:37.640 --> 04:43.160
Now Brian wrote in with response to last week's Linux Unplugged, where we call it, we titled

04:43.160 --> 04:45.200
it the Ubuntu situation.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.240
He says, I think everyone is overreacting.

04:47.240 --> 04:52.000
I've been running Ubuntu 13.10 for a few weeks now and it keeps on getting better and better.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.040
Other than the smart scopes, which I just choose not to use for the online results.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.000
This is one of the best releases so far.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.160
Ubuntu needs to be stable and boring for a release, maybe even for a few cycles.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.440
Unity changed everything and they're now getting to the point of polish and they shouldn't

05:07.440 --> 05:08.800
screw that up.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.680
Everyone outside the hardcore Linux community wants a stable OS.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.680
We are geeks.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.680
We like the bleeding edge.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.800
Do we complain when OS 10 doesn't ship the latest X?

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
No, we do not.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.240
We don't even know about it.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.440
That is the mindset that we need to keep in mind.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.160
They want this to go big time.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.500
The focus on mobile is important.

05:23.500 --> 05:28.840
I can live with a stale OS for a few cycles and then good perspective to get on the show

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
since we've.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.840
Yeah.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Yeah.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.840
Yeah.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.480
And then Zach wrote in with a, with another followup to the Ubuntu situation.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.880
Zach wrote, Hey, Chris and Matt, I have a few comments regarding the most recent Linux

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
Unplugged.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.880
Great show, by the way.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
He says he likes the format.

05:42.880 --> 05:48.920
He went to the big show first regarding Noah's email about young Padawan learning about Linux.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.960
I would recommend probably not right now, but sometime in the future when he gets a

05:51.960 --> 05:54.760
little more Linux under his belt, taking a look at Linux from scratch.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.160
Yes, it's hardcore and pretty damn hard, especially for a newbie.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.240
But between Linux from scratch and Gentoo, I learned so Goran much about Linux and how

06:02.240 --> 06:03.240
it works.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.520
When I first started out, see now he's mixing Star Wars and Firefly references.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.120
I was going to say there's some Firefly.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
Yeah.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.760
I obviously wouldn't use it as a daily driver, but for learning and experiment, it's a great

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
tool.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.720
If you could pass that along as a just name or mention the show, that would be awesome.

06:16.720 --> 06:23.040
Second, Christopher, regarding your recent cock up with your KDE configs, why aren't

06:23.040 --> 06:25.480
you using get to keep revisions of your dot files?

06:25.480 --> 06:29.640
It's such a great tool and it's a great way to keep track of any text based configs, which

06:29.640 --> 06:30.920
they all should be.

06:30.920 --> 06:35.140
Make a get folder at the base of home and then make a get dot ignore that filters out

06:35.140 --> 06:38.040
everything that you don't explicitly allow.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.040
That's a good tip.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.320
That's an excellent idea, actually.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.320
Yeah.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.560
I think that get dot ignore is an example and he includes it and he says you can also

06:45.560 --> 06:48.160
use the syncing tool to keep the same config files between your machines.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
Just some thoughts.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.440
Thanks for making the awesome shows and keep up the good work.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.840
May the force be with you.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.240
I did kind of admit that I probably should have been doing a better job of backing up

06:57.240 --> 06:58.400
my KDE config.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.200
I admit to that, but I'm happy with my gnome now.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
Exactly.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.520
It's almost a mood issue.

07:04.520 --> 07:09.440
I would also go so far as to say it's not a matter of not, I mean obviously know how,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.840
but it's also a matter of you have X number of hours in the day.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.700
You have X number of tasks to be done in that day and where are you spending that time and

07:15.700 --> 07:19.500
honestly I don't know if setting that up really would have crossed your mind with as much

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
as you got going on.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.500
Yeah.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.640
I suppose it didn't because I did know it was technically possible.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.640
Sure.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.840
It also seems like one of those things that you could probably, if you just had some time

07:28.840 --> 07:31.520
on a weekend to set it up once, you'd probably be good for a while.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.520
It's a cool tip though.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.960
I mean I got to give props for it.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.880
It's really, really a creative idea.

07:35.880 --> 07:36.880
I like it.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.880
Yeah.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.880
It's an interesting use of get too.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.480
It's an interesting use of get and that's just another one.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.480
Okay.

07:42.480 --> 07:48.040
So now we're going to kind of shift gears and get into some of the stuff that I think

07:48.040 --> 07:50.840
is probably our jumping off point for our talk about the big picture around Linux this

07:50.840 --> 07:51.840
week.

07:51.840 --> 07:57.840
Danny wrote in and Danny said, please continue to beat the canonical drum beat.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.160
You in this case are not wrong.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.920
The issue here is greater than a simple feature that can be easily turned off.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.920
The issue is a canonical trend.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.280
I think Shuttleworth's vision is extraordinary.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.880
I think he's right on with convergence, but canonical at present is incapable of delivering

08:11.880 --> 08:12.880
on its promise.

08:12.880 --> 08:19.100
Hubris then showed itself when instead of going and selling his vision to a hardware

08:19.100 --> 08:23.660
partner capable of fulfilling it, instead he goes to the carriers and to interweb financing

08:23.660 --> 08:25.640
to complete his vision.

08:25.640 --> 08:30.480
This is when we meet the underwhelming and self-congratulatory execution.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.240
The sad ballot has played itself out over and over again.

08:33.240 --> 08:38.760
The Dash, Ubuntu TV, Unity Desktop, Upstart and Mir, the same sad song.

08:38.760 --> 08:43.520
I ask you, where is the shame in perfecting the desktop experience?

08:43.520 --> 08:46.880
Where is the pride in being the creator of the most popular Linux base?

08:46.880 --> 08:53.480
Where is the love for the open source community which Ubuntu is built on top of and made it

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
what it is today?

08:54.480 --> 08:57.800
So Chris, as long as the sad song plays, please continue to beat the drum.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.800
Get it out of here.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
Well, this is an issue.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.360
What do you think about it?

09:01.360 --> 09:05.880
Are we now seeing a history of sort of over promise, under delivering?

09:05.880 --> 09:07.400
I think it's important to report on it.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.120
I think it's important to maintain the discussion about it.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.400
Where I draw the line though, because I think this needs to be talked about and shared and

09:13.400 --> 09:17.040
whatnot, but I think where people need to draw the line is that if it's affecting you

09:17.040 --> 09:21.560
on your personal desktop to the point where you draw the line in the sand and say no more,

09:21.560 --> 09:26.440
move on to something that's not creating problems for you and then continue the discussion in

09:26.440 --> 09:29.640
a rational adult way like what we're doing on the show.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.520
I think that's an important way to handle it.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.720
I think it's a healthy way to handle it.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.560
That's basically the summary of it, yeah.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.280
Yeah, I completely agree with you.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.480
Now, I think Danny could have a point here.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.040
We are starting to see a bit of a trend.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.000
Unity was sold to us as the ultimate touch interface for all and then we realized, okay,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.480
we got to rewrite it a whole bunch of time.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.960
Ubuntu TV was sold to us like three CESs ago and here we are, it's still not there.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.040
I don't know if I necessarily agree with upstart and mirror.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.600
I think the jury is still out on upstart.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.360
It was out before system D. It solved a problem and a need and it's continued to function

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
well.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.040
Some people would say swapping out something like that's a big change.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.680
Mirror obviously not looking great at the moment, but it's already playing out okay

10:12.680 --> 10:15.180
on mobile and I think it makes some sense there.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.180
So we'll see.

10:16.180 --> 10:20.040
On the desktop, I'm not convinced, but I'm willing to give it a little more time, a little

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
more time on mirror.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.920
See, for me, I think that I would need to see it accomplish a specific task or some

10:25.920 --> 10:27.400
sort of a purpose.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.840
Perhaps it's providing an experience with steam that maybe I'm not getting with another

10:30.840 --> 10:32.720
distro, which at this time it's not.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.520
Let's say that does in fact happen over time.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.520
It solves a problem for you.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.080
Yeah, it solves some sort of problem that I've got to identify.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
Then okay, fine.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.400
I might stick with Ubuntu.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.320
Right now, I'm using it on this other desktop simply because it's installed, it works, it's

10:44.320 --> 10:46.200
fine, it's doing what it needs to.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
It's okay.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
I don't care.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.920
I just don't get too excited about that because the fact Linux has so many choices, I choose

10:52.920 --> 10:58.760
not to get all excited and butthurt over Ubuntu's decisions and the team that develops that.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.240
If they want to do something stupid, hey, more power to you.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
Go ahead.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.240
Yeah.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.200
What we are witnessing is not necessarily an Ubuntu problem.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.800
I think this is going to happen over and over again.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.760
I think if you look back at the history of Linux, this already has happened just in different

11:12.760 --> 11:14.260
iterations.

11:14.260 --> 11:17.280
This is where we get into the big picture aspect of Linux and why Linux is stronger

11:17.280 --> 11:22.080
than any one distribution and why that actually really matters and why I actually think that

11:22.080 --> 11:25.160
Linux users today are not taking advantage of that fact.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.200
But before we get to that, before we kind of shift gears into our main topic today,

11:28.200 --> 11:31.480
I want to thank our sponsor, Ting.com.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.860
Ting is mobile that makes sense, my friends, and my mobile service provider and Matt's

11:34.860 --> 11:35.860
mobile service provider.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.860
That's right.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.000
They got the new Note 3 out now, Matt.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.040
I'm just putting that out there, just letting you know.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.040
Oh, yeah.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.840
Now, one of the things that I think is absolutely fantastic about Ting is how they do their

11:44.840 --> 11:45.840
rates.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.920
You don't have to pay into a big plan that you only use.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.240
Say your cell phone bill is like 60 bucks a month.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.600
Well, how do you know if you're only getting $30 of value of that?

11:53.600 --> 11:58.240
Ting separates out your voice, your megabytes, and your messages into individual buckets

11:58.240 --> 12:00.300
and you just pay for what you use at the end of the month.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.740
That way, if you're not a heavy voice user one month, you don't end up paying a whole

12:02.740 --> 12:04.840
bunch of money into a voice line that you don't need.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.800
On top of that, it's contract free.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
That's right.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.160
No contract, no early termination fees.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.560
You only pay for what you use.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.400
It's a flat rate of $6 a month.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.760
You can have as many phones on that line as you want, sharing the pooled minutes, and

12:16.760 --> 12:18.240
then you buy your phone.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.280
When you buy that phone, it's contract free.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.040
You own that phone.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.500
That's probably the top five things I love about Ting, but it gets even better from there.

12:26.500 --> 12:33.060
If you go over to linux.ting.com, you'll save $25 off your first month or $25 off a first

12:33.060 --> 12:37.040
device if you are not bringing a device, and they're doing something that's kind of fun.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.480
It only goes on until the end of October.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.040
October 31st, they're getting a little Willy Wonka up in here.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.880
Ting has these new really cool pouches that they're shipping out devices in, and they're

12:47.880 --> 12:48.880
reusable.

12:48.880 --> 12:53.120
You could actually just use it to carry your recharging stuff for the car or whatever.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.440
They're really nice devices or cases, and in these cases, they have golden tickets.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.440
No kidding.

12:59.440 --> 13:03.200
There's going to be three tickets that go in the cases that get sent out, and there's

13:03.200 --> 13:05.120
going to be three digital tickets.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.380
When you buy a device from Ting between now and October 31st, there could be a golden

13:09.380 --> 13:13.840
ticket, and that golden ticket will get you a year of Ting service for free.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.780
If you're already considering switching to Ting, why not do it now?

13:16.780 --> 13:20.220
You could potentially end up with a year of service for free if you order between now

13:20.220 --> 13:24.340
and October 31st, but those of you who are considering ordering online may be bringing

13:24.340 --> 13:28.580
your own device, and don't worry, my friends, Ting has stashed three tickets aside for you

13:28.580 --> 13:29.580
as well.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.760
They'll also be giving out three tickets to anybody who does a digital order.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.760
There's going to be digital tickets, and they'll be given to random people who go through the

13:35.760 --> 13:38.980
bring your own device process before October 31st.

13:38.980 --> 13:43.000
Pretty fun, pretty cool, and it's another neat way that Ting sort of makes it even more

13:43.000 --> 13:46.760
fun to switch, and right now, I think it's better time than ever because there's a good

13:46.760 --> 13:48.720
chance you could get a year of Ting for free.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.240
When you combine that with the fact that they have early termination relief program, you

13:52.240 --> 13:54.280
can get up to $75 per line off.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.200
You just buy your phone, port your number, then submit your claim, and they'll give you

13:57.200 --> 14:01.500
up to $75 for the early termination and the fact that you're going to get $25 off your

14:01.500 --> 14:06.020
first device or your first month if you bring a device when you go to linux.ting.com.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.480
My friends, it has literally never been a better time to switch to Ting.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
Start saving right now.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.440
Go use that calculator right there to calculate your savings.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.840
I think you'll be pretty impressed.

14:15.840 --> 14:20.200
If you ever have any problems, anything you ever need sorted out, just give them a call.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
1-855-846-4389.

14:21.200 --> 14:26.440
A real personal answer to the phone and a real personal take care of your problem.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.760
They claim responsibility and they own that for you.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
They really get it solved.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.640
I really appreciate that.

14:31.640 --> 14:35.720
That's so awesome, and I love the fact that for the golden ticket program, it doesn't

14:35.720 --> 14:37.240
matter how you come into the program.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.060
Whether or not you're bringing your own device, you can go digital, or if you actually are

14:40.060 --> 14:42.980
purchasing a device through them, then you get a real ticket.

14:42.980 --> 14:43.980
That's awesome.

14:43.980 --> 14:44.980
Everybody wins.

14:44.980 --> 14:50.200
So go over to linux.ting.com, tell Ting, thanks for supporting Linux Unplugged, and then go

14:50.200 --> 14:53.800
get yourself some great service and a fantastic phone.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.940
Linux.ting.com, and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.800
They get a winner bell for being awesome supporters.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.600
All right Matt, so I wanted to continue in the vein of digging through some follow-up

15:06.600 --> 15:09.040
which will bring us to our main topic this week.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.120
We had a really good post in the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com this week from

15:15.120 --> 15:23.840
raccoon1215, and the post was titled, I use old, crusty Debian Stable, and I love it.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.440
This is such a great post, I want to just read a couple of highlights to kind of kick

15:26.440 --> 15:27.440
us off here.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.000
He said, I was inspired by the recent discussion on Linux Unplugged and I thought I would talk

15:31.000 --> 15:37.360
about my desktop and server distro of choice, Debian Stable, technically CrunchBang, and

15:37.360 --> 15:41.600
why I prefer it to, say, the way of Arch doing things, i.e. bleeding edge.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.200
You kids and your fancy new shiny gooys and your Unity and your Cinnamon with your Gnome

15:45.200 --> 15:49.480
and your KDE, my desktop was bland, gray, and that's the way I like it.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.800
And for reference, here's my default settings of my desktop.

15:51.800 --> 15:56.360
It's a very nice looking, very clean looking desktop, minimal for sure.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.800
He says it is bland, it is gray, and here's another example of it with like Conkey and

15:59.800 --> 16:00.800
doing some awesome stuff.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.800
Oh yeah.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
I mean, it looks really nice.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.860
It is definitely a very good looking desktop.

16:05.860 --> 16:09.620
He goes on to say, on a separate point, I don't want my desktop and Window Manager to

16:09.620 --> 16:10.620
change on me.

16:10.620 --> 16:14.120
Chris brought up the example of running a system update and having Gnome update from

16:14.120 --> 16:16.320
3.8 to 3.10.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.480
If such a drastic change happened to me, I would panic.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.520
I don't want that to happen.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.400
To quote RMS, get it out of here, which is right there.

16:26.400 --> 16:30.620
He goes on to say, yes, packages are old and they don't and won't ever get updated until

16:30.620 --> 16:32.760
the next version of Debian, but that's a good thing.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.080
I don't want some program I use every day to suddenly change its behavior.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
It should be predictable.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.680
I don't want the init system to suddenly change to systemd, even if it does look awesome,

16:40.680 --> 16:42.240
until the next release cycle.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.340
In addition to that, sometimes old packages are just better than newer ones.

16:45.340 --> 16:49.240
Sometimes newer versions of things lose functionality.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.820
In conclusion, if I had to sum it all up, it would be this, unplanned change is bad

16:54.820 --> 16:57.440
and Debian understands this.

16:57.440 --> 17:02.560
Well, I think he's finding something that works well for him and he's someone that

17:02.560 --> 17:07.640
probably likes, well, not probably, he definitely likes his experience predictable.

17:07.640 --> 17:11.600
He wants to wake up and know that even after an update and everything that's going on,

17:11.600 --> 17:13.380
everything is going to look and feel as it did.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.000
Everything is going to operate the way he expects it to.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I think that's awesome for him.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
I guess so.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I totally see that.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.720
To me, it smacks a little bit of being afraid of upstream.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.600
People I think, I don't know.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.280
I'm like him to a lesser degree.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.480
Yeah, and I can see that.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
I can see that.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.920
I'm not near as extreme.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.000
There are some things I just really want a hell of a lot.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.640
I want to get the arch into the arch repos and see some of the latest, greatest stuff.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.640
I do.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.320
So, I think I called it, there's an old school way.

17:41.320 --> 17:46.360
This was Earthy Pornstar, I just read the nick, Earthy Pornstar.

17:46.360 --> 17:52.420
Earthy Pornstar commented that I called it the old school way or people who haven't gone

17:52.420 --> 17:56.440
rolling haven't tried it in years, I believe were comments I recently made.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.440
He says it's not just about updates breaking stuff, it's about general stability, compatibility

18:00.440 --> 18:01.760
and functionality.

18:01.760 --> 18:06.600
He goes on, and I thought this was an interesting comment, I, like all Linux desktop users,

18:06.600 --> 18:11.040
am clearly downright insane for not using OS X as a daily driver desktop.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.240
Yeah, Apple Inc is evil and all of that, but if we look at this from a factual, architectural

18:15.240 --> 18:17.800
and even practical viewpoint, there is no comparison.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.640
All the best parts of Macintosh plus BSD Unix, all highly polished, highly stable workstation

18:22.640 --> 18:26.920
quality because obviously OS X only runs on Macs, therefore Apple can write close to 100%

18:26.920 --> 18:28.960
of the drivers.

18:28.960 --> 18:34.840
He goes on to say the Linux, he says, oh actually I wanted to point this out, he says, a resulting

18:34.840 --> 18:38.960
in old school workstation stability that is downright perfection to be honest, I don't

18:38.960 --> 18:39.960
know if I agree with that.

18:39.960 --> 18:44.240
I wouldn't say perfection, I would say an expected experience would probably be the

18:44.240 --> 18:45.240
kindest I could say.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.240
Yeah, okay, good way to put it, right?

18:46.240 --> 18:48.880
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

18:48.880 --> 18:56.200
His point here is that OS X has apps and it has this Unix architecture, but I think that

18:56.200 --> 19:00.220
is true to an extent and I think we have to, even as Linux fans, have to acknowledge that

19:00.220 --> 19:03.760
there is a really good compelling solution on the Mac side, right?

19:03.760 --> 19:08.400
But it comes at not only a premium price that not everyone's willing to pay, but it also

19:08.400 --> 19:10.360
comes at a limited set of options.

19:10.360 --> 19:14.200
Basically on the Mac side, you can either do it or you can't do it, right?

19:14.200 --> 19:20.200
True, yeah, I would say that's true because I mean in the past on my wife's Mac for example,

19:20.200 --> 19:24.600
the adventures of trying to get HP printers to work or not work or will this update break

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
it?

19:25.600 --> 19:26.600
That's not perfection.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.920
I quite honestly get greater stability out of any one of my Linux computers than we see

19:30.920 --> 19:33.200
on the OS X, quite honestly.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.040
That being said, that's with drivers.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.340
I would also say it's very boring.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.520
It's extraordinarily boring.

19:38.520 --> 19:42.100
You really can't do a whole ton of tweaking with it.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.540
The only reason that I ever find myself in front of one is if I need something software

19:46.540 --> 19:49.760
specific that I'm not getting on Linux and that would be it.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.320
I'll always use that over using Windows because I really can't stand it.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.120
Here's the point and this is funny because it shows you there's several different ways

19:57.120 --> 20:01.320
to think about this because I take his last point here and I see it a completely different

20:01.320 --> 20:02.320
way.

20:02.320 --> 20:07.360
He says, the Linux desktop is easily still a good five years behind Windows and OS X.

20:07.360 --> 20:12.160
Without LTS, Linux wouldn't even be in the ballpark.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.960
So let's take the five-year thing and really look at this logically.

20:14.960 --> 20:19.840
Factually speaking, when Windows 7 first came out and I had my mom's ton of peripherals that

20:19.840 --> 20:24.040
I wanted to see what would work, 80 to 85% of them would not work because there were

20:24.040 --> 20:25.760
not compatible drivers.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.760
Fact.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.360
Linux, all of them worked.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.040
No, I wasn't running Linux on our computer.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.360
Another thing, we look at wireless drivers.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.840
Drivers specifically would be a big thing there.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.660
Also just overall stability.

20:37.660 --> 20:43.280
Even in Windows 8, it's more stable than it is in the past but it's not that awesome.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.840
I think you're right in terms of drivers and kernel stability.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.600
I think what he's talking about is because I think in this context, he's talking about

20:51.600 --> 20:57.800
certain applications perhaps like Final Cut and Photoshop and things like that that are

20:57.800 --> 21:01.120
just way ahead that are only available for Mac or Windows.

21:01.120 --> 21:06.120
That's factually true but that should be stated as such, not that the platform is five years

21:06.120 --> 21:11.000
behind but the fact that the companies that produce software for those platforms, it's

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
just non-existent.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
That's fair.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.720
Here's where I see the disconnect is because his argument is that the LTS Linux is out

21:18.720 --> 21:24.980
there and LTS is canonical term but Red Hat Enterprise, SUSE Enterprise, all of these enterprise

21:24.980 --> 21:29.320
grade distros, they are a picture of time.

21:29.320 --> 21:34.000
They're like when we look out into space and we see planets come back into us, the reflection

21:34.000 --> 21:37.420
of light from millions of years ago.

21:37.420 --> 21:41.120
It does not represent the true state of the Linux desktop.

21:41.120 --> 21:47.220
In a sense, in a way, you could argue that LTS also holds Linux back because as we are

21:47.220 --> 21:52.360
rapidly evolving at a pace that is way beyond what commercial software evolves at, as we

21:52.360 --> 21:57.640
are rapidly evolving, that is lost by these LTS snapshots.

21:57.640 --> 22:02.860
That is a benefit in the enterprise and that is a benefit for folks that want Debian stable.

22:02.860 --> 22:07.620
That is a good thing but in terms of actually pushing the envelope forward, seeing where

22:07.620 --> 22:10.800
the innovation is in the Linux desktop, you lose it a little bit.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.760
You lose it in the forest because you can't see it.

22:13.760 --> 22:20.040
I think in a sense, LTS is actually doing the opposite of what his argument is.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.180
It has a role.

22:21.180 --> 22:27.120
It obviously has a role but I actually think for desktop users that are savvy enough, people

22:27.120 --> 22:34.280
who are comfortable with Linux, I think using an LTS is shortchanging yourself.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
I don't agree with that.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.440
I think that it basically comes down to two happy mediums.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.800
I would not want to be in a world where we only had an LTS because I think that would

22:40.800 --> 22:44.480
be incredibly limiting nor would I want to be in a world where we only had rolling releases

22:44.480 --> 22:45.680
and bleeding edge stuff either.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.480
I think you need both because honestly, if I'm going to put one of my family members

22:49.480 --> 22:54.640
on a Linux distro, it's going to be something long term and something I have to screw with,

22:54.640 --> 22:55.640
quite frankly.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.160
I don't want to roll updates for them.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.600
I don't want them doing anything to it other than letting me manage it when I have time

23:01.600 --> 23:02.920
and that's a long term release.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.560
For myself, I'll probably take a bleeding edge option.

23:05.560 --> 23:11.960
Okay, so let me jump from there and then we'll roll into mumble folks here in a sec too.

23:11.960 --> 23:17.320
For you and I who are hardy enough and of course millions of other people who are hardy

23:17.320 --> 23:22.840
enough to sort of tuck and roll when something happens in our rolling distribution, I think

23:22.840 --> 23:27.200
we are benefiting Linux more so in the long run.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.200
If we zoom out and we look at what's happening to Ubuntu, there could be an argument at least

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
on the desktop side.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.720
Maybe they're about to be a shooting star on mobile or whatever the future of these

23:36.720 --> 23:41.780
converged devices, maybe they'll come out on top as like a shooting star of that category.

23:41.780 --> 23:46.760
That maybe is yet to be seen, but if we accept that a lot more people these days are less

23:46.760 --> 23:51.680
satisfied with the Ubuntu desktop and that in some regards is in a decline, watching

23:51.680 --> 23:55.880
the events around Ubuntu unfold, I believe once again is teaching us that something who

23:55.880 --> 24:00.700
anyone who has watched Linux for a long time has probably noticed and like myself refuses

24:00.700 --> 24:06.680
to probably fully accept that maybe all of them, at least not most of them in the grand

24:06.680 --> 24:12.280
scheme of things, most distros die or change for the worse and yet many Linux users are

24:12.280 --> 24:17.200
still they remain afraid of the raw Linux experience without the protection of their

24:17.200 --> 24:18.200
distro masters.

24:18.200 --> 24:23.440
They fear total system havoc without some bearded gatekeeper at the repo preventing

24:23.440 --> 24:26.680
mass chaos from entering their system via a system update and they believe that only

24:26.680 --> 24:31.000
the distros can protect them from this, the great distro masters, you know, and the thing

24:31.000 --> 24:37.180
is Matt is four months now into the arch experiment using arch as my daily driver in production

24:37.180 --> 24:41.340
and play and yeah, we just had Skype crash on us on an arch rig.

24:41.340 --> 24:42.340
Is that because of arch?

24:42.340 --> 24:43.340
I don't think so.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.340
I think it's because Skype is crap.

24:44.340 --> 24:47.960
Skype hasn't updated in months, but using it as my daily driver, it's taught me a really

24:47.960 --> 24:52.640
big lesson and it's not about how elite arch is and it's not about how wikis can actually

24:52.640 --> 24:53.640
not suck.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.320
Those are lessons I did learn, but that's not what I'm talking about.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.160
What I did learn is that upstream is amazing.

25:00.160 --> 25:04.360
The near real time work that is being done is inspiring and encouraging me as the host

25:04.360 --> 25:06.080
of the Linux action show to push on.

25:06.080 --> 25:12.200
It is fun to watch and a joy to use and all of that is lost when you live inside this

25:12.200 --> 25:17.320
distro box and I think there could be a case to be made that if you like me enjoy toying

25:17.320 --> 25:22.080
with your computer more than actually playing video games and perhaps using a rolling Linux

25:22.080 --> 25:26.880
distro, it's better for Linux and it's better for all that upstream code, it's in everyone's

25:26.880 --> 25:31.040
best interest if we all live outside the box and we live a little closer to upstream.

25:31.040 --> 25:36.160
If we can bear it, if we can be exposed to the bumps that come along with that.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
I would agree with that.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.280
Yeah, I think the more people that are living on the bleeding edge, the better because that

25:40.280 --> 25:43.920
just of course as bug reports come out and things like that, it's making a better experience

25:43.920 --> 25:47.780
so that when the next long term release comes along on another distro or whatever that is,

25:47.780 --> 25:48.780
it's better for everybody.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.480
It's a great ecosystem to live in.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.680
I think that's awesome and it's something that we miss in a Windows or OS X world.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.320
You're talking about very limited testers and what not.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.320
I think you lose it just kind of even just living in the distro box.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.780
I'll give you two examples that applied to me this week.

26:03.780 --> 26:07.940
Two new apps that have rolled out, both covered by OMG Ubuntu which is ironic because you

26:07.940 --> 26:10.800
can't really use either one of them in Ubuntu.

26:10.800 --> 26:15.800
First is Corebird, it is a really, really, really nice Twitter client that is completely

26:15.800 --> 26:22.000
designed for GNOME 3, minimal, does exactly what you need, has great features, has notification

26:22.000 --> 26:25.560
support, but if you want to install it on Ubuntu, you're kind of out of luck if you're

26:25.560 --> 26:28.560
on 13.04 because it requires GNOME 3.10.

26:28.560 --> 26:34.240
If you want to install it on Ubuntu 13.10, then you got to go get the GNOME 3.10 PPAs,

26:34.240 --> 26:39.200
install those first and then break your Unity installation and then install Corebird, right?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.200
That's one app.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.040
That's one new app that's coming out that is really interesting to follow.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.960
That new app that's coming out, Polari, an awesome new IRC app for GNOME which again

26:47.960 --> 26:54.080
is like IRC, totally follows the GNOME design, looks absolutely, incredibly amazing.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.840
I have it installed right now on my Archbox, can't get it on Ubuntu.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.840
Right, exactly.

26:57.840 --> 27:03.600
And this is what I'm talking about where I enjoy watching these new stars be born and

27:03.600 --> 27:08.280
as soon as I see a news article on it on my rolling distro, I go get it and I have it

27:08.280 --> 27:10.900
installed and now I get to play with it.

27:10.900 --> 27:15.040
And I think that – and see, you're the type of person that really values that experience.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
Right.

27:16.040 --> 27:19.120
But there are a lot of people out there that don't and a lot of people there that do.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.960
And so I think there's going to be a balance there.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.260
I think that as the people that really want that leading edge experience, they'll test

27:24.260 --> 27:26.920
these apps and they'll just get better and better and better and by the time they do

27:26.920 --> 27:32.400
roll down to an Ubuntu type distribution, the people that are wanting to remain in that

27:32.400 --> 27:35.040
space will also be able to enjoy it.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.960
It's kind of like paying for cable and getting your TV now versus waiting for it to end up

27:38.960 --> 27:39.960
on Netflix.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.960
Yeah.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
It really is.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
There's no right answer.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.440
It's just I think everybody's kind of got their –

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
Yeah, it's interesting.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.440
It's a good analogy.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.440
Or it's like –

27:47.440 --> 27:48.440
Yeah.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.440
You know, it's funny.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.840
It's like on Usenet Blu-ray movies of stuff like two months not even released yet will

27:51.840 --> 27:52.840
show up on Usenet.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.840
It's like, wow, really?

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
It's like you could get it –

27:54.840 --> 27:55.840
Yeah.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
Handycam.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Yeah.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
And I don't know.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
I mean, maybe I'm wrong here.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
And we can ask.

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
I'm totally up to mumble room.

28:01.840 --> 28:02.840
Chime in.

28:02.840 --> 28:07.480
But I feel like if Polari and Corebird have more users using them, then those apps get

28:07.480 --> 28:11.600
better and then we have a better chance of fighting the proprietary commercial desktops.

28:11.600 --> 28:16.000
But when we live inside these cages where our bearded masters make sure everything's

28:16.000 --> 28:20.340
perfect for us, we don't really push the envelope forward as fast as we could.

28:20.340 --> 28:22.340
Your thoughts, mumble room?

28:22.340 --> 28:23.340
Okay.

28:23.340 --> 28:30.440
See, the thing is, since I guess I'm the only one talking here, the thing is it depends

28:30.440 --> 28:34.800
on what your situation is, what context you're using Linux in.

28:34.800 --> 28:40.640
If you want to take the risk of only upstream packages or you want a more stable solution

28:40.640 --> 28:41.640
for it.

28:41.640 --> 28:49.000
So while the upstream philosophy and the arch philosophy applies to some people, it may

28:49.000 --> 28:51.080
not apply to other people.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.160
So again, you have to look at your situation.

28:53.160 --> 28:59.800
It does not actually matter what philosophy you drive your Linux box with.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.800
It matters what that box does for you.

29:03.800 --> 29:08.440
Finally, there are still risks to getting upstream.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.960
And so you have to make a choice whether you want the latest and greatest and whether you

29:11.960 --> 29:17.760
want just another, a new IRC client, or are you happy with your old one and you can take

29:17.760 --> 29:21.160
the safe option of not breaking your desktop.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
Right.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
I agree.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.160
And so I think what I'm talking about is the category of people that listen to this show.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.960
The people who are a little more savvy, a little more comfortable.

29:28.960 --> 29:34.960
And I would say like how many, haven't all of us seen the scenario where you have a problem

29:34.960 --> 29:39.760
with like say X chat and you submit a bug and then it gets marked as it's not our problem,

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
it's downstream.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
Invalid.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
Yeah.

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
Yeah.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
We've all seen this.

29:44.760 --> 29:49.840
I guess if I wanted to type in and say something, when I was distro hopping, I was fine with

29:49.840 --> 29:52.160
getting the latest and greatest on a distro.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.040
But now anymore, I just want to install something and let it sit.

29:55.040 --> 30:00.440
If I want a newer package of a software, I will usually go search for that Debian file

30:00.440 --> 30:06.920
or that RPM file and get it myself rather than relying on the distributions or a repository.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.960
That only gets you so far though, because pretty soon you run into some sort of like

30:09.960 --> 30:14.640
Gnome 3.10 dependency or you know, you eventually require your underlying system to be current

30:14.640 --> 30:16.920
to take advantage of the new apps.

30:16.920 --> 30:21.360
Eventually, but I do upgrade often enough to where that shouldn't be a problem.

30:21.360 --> 30:24.040
Like once every maybe six to eight months.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.040
Yeah, okay.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.040
Yeah.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.640
Those distro snapshots in a way are a figment of our Slackware past.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.120
Yeah, they are, I think.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.080
I think that's exactly what it is.

30:33.080 --> 30:40.200
Like we have security updates and functionality updates, but it's not exactly how today is

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
best utilized.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.200
That's what I'm thinking.

30:42.200 --> 30:48.160
And if I wanted to, I could on my laptop switch to the tumble read repository and get the

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
latest packages.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.160
Right.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.160
Oh yeah.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
I run tumble read and I run rawhide.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
Right.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.160
It doesn't have to be Arch.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.160
It doesn't have to be Arch.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.160
It could be rawhide.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.160
Yeah.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.160
It could be tumble read for sure.

30:58.160 --> 31:03.880
I do daily Ubuntu, like for the, before you guys done your Ubuntu review, I was running

31:03.880 --> 31:11.560
daily for a week just to make sure that I knew exactly what I was trying to get to.

31:11.560 --> 31:16.320
I guess part of my argument might be though is when you look at distros, there's some

31:16.320 --> 31:21.320
distros that patch kind of heavily and there's some distros that don't patch very heavily.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.360
And that's where you starting to get into the blame game is when you have a distribution

31:24.360 --> 31:25.360
who patches a lot.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.480
Maybe they changed the way their whole notification system works.

31:27.480 --> 31:31.360
And so every app that wants to use the notification system has to have some sort of tweak applied.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.360
Right.

31:32.360 --> 31:36.120
That's the only, that's the only thing where I kind of, I guess, I guess what I wanted

31:36.120 --> 31:43.400
to, the point I wanted to get across is I feel like I was a person who I for a long

31:43.400 --> 31:49.960
time believed that if we couldn't make a Ubuntu a success, it wasn't possible for Linux to

31:49.960 --> 31:54.720
be a success, not because it wasn't good enough, but because you needed to have a corporation

31:54.720 --> 31:58.320
behind it with a little bit of money that, you know, a company like valve could call

31:58.320 --> 31:59.320
up.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.320
You needed to have a community organized around it.

32:01.320 --> 32:05.400
You needed to have a good, you needed to have a good established base with a good reputation.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.760
And I thought, you know, there's really not another distro while there's other really

32:08.760 --> 32:13.440
good distros and even better distros like they, none of them have all of that stuff

32:13.440 --> 32:16.600
and are also targeted at the desktop and cloud, et cetera, et cetera.

32:16.600 --> 32:24.080
And, and what I realized over the last four months is like Arch isn't really a distro.

32:24.080 --> 32:28.720
It is just straight upstream with a bunch of great scripts and, and some, and some shuffling

32:28.720 --> 32:29.720
around it.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.720
Yeah.

32:30.720 --> 32:31.720
It feels almost like a roll your own.

32:31.720 --> 32:32.720
For sure.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.720
All right.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
All the other distros.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
Yeah.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
Right.

32:36.720 --> 32:41.600
But what that has shown me is like just what the community itself is producing is pretty

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
great.

32:42.600 --> 32:48.560
Well, the distros, all the other ones with corporate backing are pretty much server or

32:48.560 --> 32:53.880
corporate desktop based distros like Novell and Red Hat.

32:53.880 --> 32:58.520
Ubuntu is the only desktop, you know, distro, but the reality is they actually make their

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
money on cloud.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
You're right.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.520
Yeah.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.640
Now, when you, now I was thinking when you back, back when you said notification, that's

33:05.640 --> 33:10.320
why I stick to like the standard desktop environment, like KDE or even the GNOME 3.10.

33:10.320 --> 33:17.200
I don't go towards Cinnamon or towards a Unity just because, you know, they're the biggest

33:17.200 --> 33:23.280
ones out there, GNOME and KDE, or even XFCE out there, then they tend to use the standard

33:23.280 --> 33:25.840
components for notifications and such.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.840
Right.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.840
libnotify.

33:27.840 --> 33:28.840
Yeah.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.840
Yeah.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.840
See, the thing I was saying about Ubuntu is that there are still disadvantages to having

33:34.840 --> 33:42.560
a super popular Linux distribution because there was a post in the Linux subreddit where

33:42.560 --> 33:48.340
a man said Microsoft Word deserves to die because it captured the market.

33:48.340 --> 33:53.920
So what I'm saying is that you need what Ubuntu has established is a monopoly.

33:53.920 --> 34:01.680
And so that has its own disadvantages that may not be looked at in several places, meaning

34:01.680 --> 34:08.840
if Ubuntu is, if you have one OS that is the king and it has 80 percent market share or

34:08.840 --> 34:15.640
70 percent market share, then everybody, regardless of the OS's flaws and merits, has to develop

34:15.640 --> 34:16.640
for that.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.640
Right.

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
And so that restricts them.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
That restricts the market.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.640
I don't know if they've reached that.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.640
I don't know if they have reached that.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.960
And I think the thing that kind of made me think that was, and I could be, I could be

34:24.960 --> 34:29.420
way off the mark on this, but to me the thing that kind of brought that home to me was if

34:29.420 --> 34:34.040
Ubuntu had reached that monopoly point where you must write for Ubuntu, kind of like the

34:34.040 --> 34:37.080
reason I put our videos on YouTube is because if you don't put them on YouTube then there's

34:37.080 --> 34:40.760
thousands of people who won't see them and I hate it, but that's where I put them.

34:40.760 --> 34:45.240
And there are a lot of advantages to being on YouTube, even if I have to fight them constantly.

34:45.240 --> 34:52.160
I think that when Valve chose to create Steam OS, that was Valve making a vote of no confidence

34:52.160 --> 34:55.200
in the long-term viability of Ubuntu on the desktop.

34:55.200 --> 35:00.320
And the reason I say that is because if you're going to hyper-focus on making the best thing

35:00.320 --> 35:03.920
possible, you don't really need the baggage of creating your own OS, right?

35:03.920 --> 35:08.600
I mean, they never had to have Steam OS when Windows was around and the Mac was around.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.520
And then it was like, I think maybe Gabe was sitting back, smoking a cigar and thinking,

35:12.520 --> 35:15.920
man, am I going to bet the whole farm on this canonical clown show?

35:15.920 --> 35:20.440
Or am I going to just take the great work they've done so far and create my own, you

35:20.440 --> 35:21.440
know, direction?

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
Right.

35:22.440 --> 35:27.880
And I believe that them going with Steam OS proves that they do not hold that monopoly.

35:27.880 --> 35:33.880
Yeah, but certainly, I was thinking this whole time, like, okay, what if the canonical patch

35:33.880 --> 35:39.600
is a kernel so much that it eventually ends up like, let's say, Android?

35:39.600 --> 35:48.000
I think that Valve did Steam OS just because of the brand, because most people don't even

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
know about Linux.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah, you could be right.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
It's the same about Chromebooks.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.240
Chromebooks are because Chrome is so popular and people know about it.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
I agree.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.200
Though I do think, though, if we just had a world where maybe, you know, Ubuntu's market

36:02.200 --> 36:06.240
dominance was so clearly established that they might just say, well, they've got that

36:06.240 --> 36:07.440
part taken care of.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.320
See, it might be, though.

36:09.320 --> 36:16.040
See, the thing is, Steam not putting confidence into Ubuntu might not just indicate that Ubuntu

36:16.040 --> 36:17.720
is not as popular.

36:17.720 --> 36:23.120
It might just indicate that Canonical is very much a clown show and they have no idea where

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
they're going.

36:24.120 --> 36:30.640
It does not reflect, I think, on their popularity and dominance on the Linux desktop environment.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.920
I disagree with that a little.

36:33.920 --> 36:45.160
I would say that the whole thing of them taking on Steam OS might be because Ubuntu is focusing

36:45.160 --> 36:46.160
on mobile.

36:46.160 --> 36:51.960
They're focusing on the tablet and they're not focusing on the desktop as much.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.600
Well, Steam, they want to focus on the desktop because that makes sense where mobile makes

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
no sense to Valve.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.600
No, that's what I'm saying, actually.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.600
I don't know.

36:59.600 --> 37:04.600
I believe I heard somewhere where Valve wants to get into the mobile market.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, I'm still surprised they haven't.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.080
Yeah, but see, the thing is that-

37:10.080 --> 37:11.080
They're going to get into mobile.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.080
They're going to go into that little thing.

37:12.080 --> 37:16.680
I say you've got the NVIDIA shield and that, so there's definitely a gaming market for

37:16.680 --> 37:17.680
mobile devices.

37:17.680 --> 37:18.680
And that's Android.

37:18.680 --> 37:26.440
Well, if they wanted to do Linux, choosing Ubuntu is not exactly choosing Linux any longer

37:26.440 --> 37:31.640
because Ubuntu doesn't patch upstream like all the other distributions do.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.060
They are Ubuntu and are siloed as themselves.

37:35.060 --> 37:40.440
They can't benefit or give back to the other rest of the community.

37:40.440 --> 37:44.000
So if they chose Ubuntu, then they would be kind of locked into Ubuntu.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.040
But they did choose Ubuntu.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.440
They're just tripping off the top layer.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.440
Exactly.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.360
See, the thing is that does not mean Ubuntu is not popular.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.000
It just says there are other factors.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.120
I'm saying unless you're using something like Unity, I don't think you're locked into Ubuntu

37:58.120 --> 37:59.120
just yet.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.720
But again, like I said, the whole lock into Unity, Ubuntu thing with Unity, that's why

38:02.720 --> 38:07.000
I use KDE because that's pretty universal across whatever distro I use.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.520
Well, they're even saying screw Kubuntu, screw Zubuntu, screw Ubuntu, they're themselves.

38:11.520 --> 38:16.920
They don't want to help them with their other derivatives.

38:16.920 --> 38:22.520
What Ubuntu does quite well is it takes Debian testing and freezes it.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.960
So it gives you a fairly up-to-date platform to work with.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.160
No, Debian is old.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.160
It's stable.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.160
It rocks.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.160
No, that's what Ubuntu does.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.960
It takes Debian testing, freezes it for six months, and then you can work on it.

38:36.960 --> 38:42.400
So you get quite an up-to-date platform that's stable.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.120
Debian's testing is also stable, too.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.120
It's not like a bleeding heads distro.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
But it's constantly changing.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
All right.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
Okay.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.840
So I want to change the conversation for a second.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.440
I want to play a mental exercise, and I'm going to toss it to Matt first, and then I'll

38:53.440 --> 38:57.440
toss it to the mumble room.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
I'm not saying it's going to happen.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.000
I mean, Ubuntu still could pull it out.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
You never know.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.080
But let's say, well, fast forward three years down the road, SteamOS has been shipped for

39:05.080 --> 39:10.440
a year, all the other distros have gotten better at what they do, and Ubuntu has continued

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
to decline.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.160
Who is the new dominant distro?

39:13.160 --> 39:14.160
What do you think, Matt?

39:14.160 --> 39:17.400
What is the distro that pulls ahead, and why?

39:17.400 --> 39:20.840
As much as I hate to admit it, and as much as I want to say, oh, it's going to be Fedora,

39:20.840 --> 39:21.840
or, oh, it's going to be OpenSUSE.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.440
Oh, I thought you would say Fedora, actually.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.440
No, I can't.

39:24.440 --> 39:30.480
I mean, realistically, if I'm looking at Ubuntu's targeting of new users, I hate to admit it,

39:30.480 --> 39:34.540
and yes, I'm not a fan, but I'm going to say Linux Mint, because they do have their

39:34.540 --> 39:37.520
Debian stuff on the back burner for just such an occasion.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.840
If Ubuntu does a poo-poo, they're going to go with their Debian release, and that's what

39:41.840 --> 39:42.840
they're going to do.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.340
And I think that they have enough stuff going on internalized that they could make that

39:46.340 --> 39:47.340
switch work.

39:47.340 --> 39:48.800
They're not ready yet.

39:48.800 --> 39:54.280
Would it be better for everybody, though, if it was like Mangero or Antegros, like somebody

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
that...

39:55.280 --> 39:58.040
Oh, it would be awesome, but I think that we...

39:58.040 --> 40:03.000
People have to remember, part of why Linux works is because it is not, the kernel is

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
not a democracy.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.440
What about elementary OS?

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
What about elementary OS?

40:07.440 --> 40:14.660
Elementary OS, again, you got these community-based distributions, that's great, but they come

40:14.660 --> 40:15.840
and go, quite honestly.

40:15.840 --> 40:20.600
I've seen a lot of community distros come and go, and at least with a corporate-backed

40:20.600 --> 40:25.860
distribution, as much as I don't like a lot of them, you have something identifiable.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.920
You can spot, okay, it looks like they're going to go downhill, or it looks like they're

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
going to pull the plug.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.880
Okay, all right, but could the problem with Mint be, as much as I have respect for Clem

40:32.880 --> 40:37.120
and all that he's done and all he continues to do, if Clem gets really super burned out,

40:37.120 --> 40:38.120
what happens to Mint?

40:38.120 --> 40:42.640
I mean, you've got one guy, right, whereas OpenSUSE is an entire company, there's an

40:42.640 --> 40:46.560
entire team, you know, people come and go, right, and Fedora has got the backing of Red

40:46.560 --> 40:47.560
Hat.

40:47.560 --> 40:51.320
You've got these, Mint and elementary OS, they all suffer from a very, very short bench.

40:51.320 --> 40:55.480
No, that's true, but here's the problem, though, is that you have to look at...

40:55.480 --> 40:59.440
Fedora doesn't target users in any universe.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.920
OpenSUSE, again, great distribution for the enterprise, not for the new user.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.920
It's just not.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.520
The tools provided are not targeting grandma.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.520
Linux Mint is.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.520
That does not mean in its current state that they don't still have some of those community

41:12.520 --> 41:18.720
issues, but I see enough interest, resources, and I mean financial resources being dumped

41:18.720 --> 41:23.480
in their general direction to where I think at some point, if Ubuntu did go south, I could

41:23.480 --> 41:28.560
see some sort of a structure stepping in or perhaps even being formed around it.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.560
I think that...

41:29.560 --> 41:33.360
Okay, Mumble Room, let me ask you this question and whoever wants to chime in, answer it.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.920
So I think there's a couple of ways we could take this.

41:36.920 --> 41:40.880
I want to ask you guys, is it possible we could have a three or four year, three years

41:40.880 --> 41:44.480
down the road, three years down the road, Manjaro continues to evolve and they've really

41:44.480 --> 41:50.080
got something where they've got a good combination of up-to-date packages, but certain snapshotting

41:50.080 --> 41:51.960
of key components to make things stable.

41:51.960 --> 41:58.000
Could Manjaro pull ahead as a lead distro candidate?

41:58.000 --> 42:04.960
I don't think Manjaro has the corporate backing or the money behind them to make that happen.

42:04.960 --> 42:11.960
It's completely community and granted Mint is completely community too, but I mean their

42:11.960 --> 42:14.360
sponsorship is up the wazoo.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.360
It is.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
Yeah.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.360
That's almost better, isn't it?

42:17.360 --> 42:18.360
Yeah.

42:18.360 --> 42:22.640
Well, the thing with Ubuntu, Ubuntu isn't brilliant, but what Ubuntu is extremely good

42:22.640 --> 42:23.640
at is marketing.

42:23.640 --> 42:31.520
I don't think there's another distro that is as good at marketing as Ubuntu is.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.480
Elementary got close with their countdown, but I agree.

42:34.480 --> 42:38.280
When you search for past stuff, Canonical can capture the headlines, especially for

42:38.280 --> 42:40.080
the Edge campaign, they captured the headlines.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.080
Yeah.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.080
Yeah.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.080
They're a PR machine.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.640
They can do marketing like no one else.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.120
They're really good at it.

42:47.120 --> 42:52.720
I was thinking, Mint I think would probably pull out front, but I got a funny feeling

42:52.720 --> 42:56.800
that Kubuntu might do quite well because that's got quite a lot of backing.

42:56.800 --> 42:57.800
That I like.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.800
Yeah.

42:58.800 --> 42:59.800
That I would like.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Yeah.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
I see.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.800
I can see that.

43:02.800 --> 43:03.800
What is... Kubuntu has a new backing.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.800
Yeah.

43:04.800 --> 43:05.800
They have a corporate sponsor now.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
Yeah.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.800
Kubuntu's got blue systems.

43:07.800 --> 43:08.800
Yeah.

43:08.800 --> 43:09.800
That's a big deal.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.800
It's a completely separate operating system now.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.360
I know it's still based on Ubuntu, but the KDE fellows have very little...

43:13.360 --> 43:14.360
Right.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.360
There's some heat there as well.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.160
They're leveraging the... Kubuntu will continue to leverage the big advances we're going to

43:19.160 --> 43:23.200
see in QT and the big adoption we're going to see in QT because of mobile.

43:23.200 --> 43:28.280
That's the other thing about... That could play a big part in three years is as mobile

43:28.280 --> 43:32.560
continues to influence the direction of Linux, QT is going to continue to become a more and

43:32.560 --> 43:34.640
more dominant framework that people use.

43:34.640 --> 43:39.520
I wouldn't be surprised if KDE distros do pull ahead because of that, right?

43:39.520 --> 43:40.520
Yeah.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
One thing-

43:41.520 --> 43:43.840
Didn't that say that the default is king?

43:43.840 --> 43:44.840
Right.

43:44.840 --> 43:45.840
Yeah.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.840
How is Kubuntu default?

43:46.840 --> 43:47.840
Yeah.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.640
It may be.

43:49.640 --> 43:53.920
Well, they have a huge corporate sponsor in blue systems, but for blue systems, I think

43:53.920 --> 43:59.040
that's a means to an end because their goal is for Netrunner, which is a derivative of

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
Kubuntu.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.680
They live and die with Kubuntu.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.960
If anything, my choice would be SUSE.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.160
Because it's got a good mix of corporate backing and community or what?

44:09.160 --> 44:12.920
Yes, and they can PR the hell out of themselves.

44:12.920 --> 44:13.920
Yeah.

44:13.920 --> 44:14.920
You know what?

44:14.920 --> 44:17.640
The SUSE camp is really good at PR outreach.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.400
They've got support, but they're not up to the snuff yet.

44:20.400 --> 44:24.680
Well, I mean, think about it like Matt, before a SUSE release, you and I usually get an email

44:24.680 --> 44:28.640
from somebody at the team who tells us what's new.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.720
They usually send us pre-release ISO links for us to download so that way we can get

44:31.720 --> 44:35.600
it before the mirrors get smashed and they'll give us a chance for our review.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.600
That stuff's-

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
And the other thing-

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
But for their audience, I would say so.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.200
But for the people that have Ubuntu targets, not even close.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.200
No, I agree.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.200
Yeah.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.200
For us, oh yeah.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.200
For geeks, they're awesome.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.200
God, they're great.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.200
They're all over the place.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200
Absolutely.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.560
It's about not just a single thing.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.120
It's going to be a combination of things.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.960
It's going to be good PR.

44:53.960 --> 44:57.200
It's going to be low barrier to entry, like do you need to know anything about Linux to

44:57.200 --> 45:00.400
get into it?

45:00.400 --> 45:07.560
Your grandmas, your lifetime Windows users and things like that, if it isn't simple for

45:07.560 --> 45:11.480
them to just pop in a disk, install it, and then it's easy for them to understand.

45:11.480 --> 45:17.600
I think OpenSUSE, maybe not all of us like it, but OpenSUSE has Yast, and when you're

45:17.600 --> 45:20.800
a Windows user, you want the control panel.

45:20.800 --> 45:24.680
You want to be able to bring up the control panel and go add, remove software, detect

45:24.680 --> 45:25.680
your hardware.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.120
Well, I mean, that's what Yast does.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.560
And I'm not saying that SUSE couldn't pull it off.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.720
I'm not saying that at all.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.040
I'm just saying we're focusing on, well, it's this, we'll know it's this, we'll know it's

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
this.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.640
And it's really just a combination of things.

45:39.640 --> 45:42.500
Right now Ubuntu just has a stranglehold on that.

45:42.500 --> 45:44.080
But SUSE has all the combinations.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.120
They have the corporate backing.

45:45.120 --> 45:49.500
They have the build service, which is bringing in a whole bunch of new software.

45:49.500 --> 45:54.040
They have the gallery and ladies and gentlemen, probably the number one thing for me right

45:54.040 --> 45:56.320
now, they have Tumbleweed.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.640
So you can also be rolling, right?

45:57.640 --> 46:01.360
I mean, it seems to me like OpenSUSE has got a pretty good collection of a lot of the things

46:01.360 --> 46:02.360
I like.

46:02.360 --> 46:09.800
But the problem is at the end of the day, I can't imagine using Linux now without Pacman.

46:09.800 --> 46:10.800
Yeah.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.800
So that's my thing.

46:11.800 --> 46:12.800
But OpenSUSE is definitely my fallback.

46:12.800 --> 46:13.800
Yeah, but that's going to be your advanced users.

46:13.800 --> 46:14.800
Yeah.

46:14.800 --> 46:15.800
They have Greg.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.360
He's straight up next in line to Linus.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.880
He's a straight up kernel.

46:19.880 --> 46:20.880
He's our kernel master.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
Oh yeah.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.880
And he's at SUSE.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
Oh yeah.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
Oh yeah, for sure.

46:24.880 --> 46:25.880
They can support the hell out of SUSE for the user if need be.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.880
I'm going to use the M word here.

46:28.880 --> 46:33.400
But one thing SUSE has backing it too is an agreement with Microsoft.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.880
Oh yeah, they do.

46:34.880 --> 46:35.880
Yeah.

46:35.880 --> 46:36.880
Yeah.

46:36.880 --> 46:37.880
In fact, they're OpenSUSE.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.960
They have an OpenSUSE week or they have like a SUSE week coming up, you know, like a conference

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
and Microsoft's one of the top sponsors.

46:42.960 --> 46:46.680
I completely forgot about their enterprise desktop.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
Right.

46:47.680 --> 46:52.840
And I have to say one of my favorite things about OpenSUSE would be the build service

46:52.840 --> 46:55.440
that people could set their software on.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.440
Right.

46:56.440 --> 46:59.720
I'm going to chuck something out there.

46:59.720 --> 47:03.400
How about an Android Chrome OS hybrid?

47:03.400 --> 47:07.680
I mean, if Google actually ends up sort of producing that where you can run Android apps.

47:07.680 --> 47:13.440
I feel like Google has too much skin in the game to be a trusted platform provider like

47:13.440 --> 47:15.120
that.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.760
My system controlled by Java.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.080
I don't think they're going to do that.

47:19.080 --> 47:20.080
It's Java script.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.080
It's different.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
No, but Android is Java.

47:23.080 --> 47:28.560
It would succeed because of Google, but it wouldn't be good.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
Hm.

47:29.560 --> 47:35.680
Well, I mean, if we're talking a hybrid that works the same way that Ubuntu's, quote,

47:35.680 --> 47:40.600
convergence would, the Android part would still be Java, but the Chrome OS part would

47:40.600 --> 47:41.600
not.

47:41.600 --> 47:42.600
There has to be no Android Java.

47:42.600 --> 47:43.600
It's not Java.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.600
It's JavaScript.

47:44.600 --> 47:45.600
Like car is like...

47:45.600 --> 47:46.600
Chrome OS is JavaScript.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
It's too complicated.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.600
Android is Java.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.600
Yep.

47:49.600 --> 47:50.600
Yes.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.600
All right.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.600
Well, now we're going down the Android path.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.600
We're going to close out, but I just leave you with this.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.840
I wanted to make the case that if you have the stomach for it, and there's no judgment

48:00.840 --> 48:03.860
if you don't have the stomach for it, but if you have the stomach for it, maybe consider

48:03.860 --> 48:07.680
going with one of the rolling releases from whichever distro provides it just to kind

48:07.680 --> 48:09.960
of...

48:09.960 --> 48:13.520
It is really exciting to be on the edge and see things that are coming out that like core

48:13.520 --> 48:17.840
Bird and Polari that are so cool and to play with them and you know how great it is to

48:17.840 --> 48:18.840
get Gnome 3.10.

48:18.840 --> 48:25.160
I mean, the Gnome project, let's be honest, it has been really, really hard to use Gnome

48:25.160 --> 48:29.400
for a while and with Gnome 3.8, it got there and Gnome 3.10, they made it even better and

48:29.400 --> 48:32.440
Gnome 3.10.1 is really looking good.

48:32.440 --> 48:35.200
I look at this and I go, this is it.

48:35.200 --> 48:40.480
We're getting there again and KDE 4 series, man, they are just...

48:40.480 --> 48:45.280
I love their plan to make KDE 4 just rock solid where they work on 5.

48:45.280 --> 48:50.300
Both Gnome 3 and KDE 4, I feel like, are once again getting to that point we were before

48:50.300 --> 48:54.200
we had the big upset, before we killed Gnome 2 and moved to Gnome 3.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.920
I feel like we're getting back to that...

48:56.920 --> 49:01.080
We're not there just yet, but we are probably within one or two releases to being back to

49:01.080 --> 49:08.120
that level of awesomeness and it's got nothing to do with any particular distribution and

49:08.120 --> 49:09.720
that's what's so awesome about it.

49:09.720 --> 49:11.200
There you go.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.200
All right.

49:12.200 --> 49:18.440
So again, I think at the end of the day, it's about what suits you best.

49:18.440 --> 49:22.840
But yes, Ars does have a very good advantage on this, but again, what suits you best?

49:22.840 --> 49:29.160
Because Gnome and all the other upstream packages are working, they're in beta, they're in alpha

49:29.160 --> 49:30.900
and they're still working.

49:30.900 --> 49:36.320
If they break, then that's where the trouble starts and they don't, which is a good thing,

49:36.320 --> 49:38.840
but if they do, then you have to deal with it.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.120
That's the cost you pay.

49:41.120 --> 49:48.960
But I feel like it's helping because I fully figure that if that happens, then I'll submit

49:48.960 --> 49:54.200
the bug thing, I'll watch the bug report and I'll participate in that part because that's

49:54.200 --> 49:55.200
what I can do, right?

49:55.200 --> 49:58.480
I can either donate money, but I'm too broke to do that, so I'm going to donate my time

49:58.480 --> 50:01.800
to submit bug reports and then plus for me, it also works out, I can talk about it on

50:01.800 --> 50:07.280
the show and stuff like that, but I think it's an interesting position for us to be

50:07.280 --> 50:11.520
in to maybe not have a direct influence on the future of our desktop, but at least help

50:11.520 --> 50:16.680
push it in the right direction as a user, which is way more, which is just so more empowering

50:16.680 --> 50:20.720
than you get on Windows and Mac and when we go back to that email where you said, well,

50:20.720 --> 50:25.680
the Mac is great for this and that, it's like these number one things, being tuned into

50:25.680 --> 50:29.000
the open source community, being able to have an impact on the desktop, being able to choose

50:29.000 --> 50:33.560
these things where we can move around, those are indispensable features for me that only

50:33.560 --> 50:38.360
Linux provides, the Mac can, no matter what Apple ships in the next version of Mac OS

50:38.360 --> 50:41.280
10, they will never be able to ship that, they can't, right?

50:41.280 --> 50:46.800
That's true, although Apple is a master of copying various Ubuntu features and I could

50:46.800 --> 50:49.560
make a list for the person to send in the email if they'd like that.

50:49.560 --> 50:54.400
Yeah, I think the copying goes both ways in some cases, but yeah.

50:54.400 --> 50:59.560
But it's very visual up front, front and center experiences that they copy, not back in.

50:59.560 --> 51:03.840
Now they just need to copy the App Store a little more and they'll really have something.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.720
All right, Mumble Room, well thanks guys, you guys were great today and I'm gonna wrap

51:07.720 --> 51:11.960
it up with an email from G H, he wanted to write in in defense of KDE.

51:11.960 --> 51:16.280
He says, Chris and Matt, how contradictory is it for people to leave Windows or Apple

51:16.280 --> 51:19.820
because they're tired of their intrinsic limitations?

51:19.820 --> 51:23.040
Only then to move to Linux and choose the most limiting working environments like GNOME

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
or Unity.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.920
Wouldn't it be more logical to move to an environment, say, KDE, that gives you the

51:27.920 --> 51:30.720
most options to configure in any way you want?

51:30.720 --> 51:32.680
Spock would nod in agreement.

51:32.680 --> 51:37.320
For me, choosing between GNOME and Unity and say the others versus KDE is like choosing

51:37.320 --> 51:43.160
for the same price of zero dollars between an F-150 and a sovereign class enterprise.

51:43.160 --> 51:47.340
And guys, you're choosing the truck because you find the spaceship too complicated to

51:47.340 --> 51:52.760
use and it has too many options and the truck can still take you places and has technology

51:52.760 --> 51:54.960
I can understand and use without too much effort.

51:54.960 --> 51:58.800
I assure you that if an option to choose was real, you'd pick the enterprise even if it

51:58.800 --> 52:00.800
took you the rest of your life to figure it out.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.000
Your friend, G H.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.200
Well, I heard from Mavura and she was very clear in saying, Captain, the communications

52:06.200 --> 52:10.120
are not working because false audio doesn't play well with the KDE sound system.

52:10.120 --> 52:14.800
So once I get my communications up on the Starship, but the radio in my truck seems

52:14.800 --> 52:15.800
to work pretty well.

52:15.800 --> 52:21.680
I also would point out, I would also point out that Gene Roddenberry went to great pains

52:21.680 --> 52:25.660
to work with his designers to make sure that the enterprise was clean and streamlined because

52:25.660 --> 52:31.240
Gene believed that technology had become so perfected that to truly enhance human life,

52:31.240 --> 52:34.400
it would be natural and comfortable to use.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.840
I'm just pointing that out.

52:35.840 --> 52:39.960
So however that is natural and comfortable for you is how you should use it, right Matt?

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
That's right.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.200
Who needs to hear anything with headphones?

52:44.200 --> 52:45.200
That's so GNOME.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.840
Yeah, that's for GNOME users, whatever, whatever.

52:48.840 --> 52:52.760
I guess if I want to have a modern sound experience, I do need false audio.

52:52.760 --> 52:57.680
I don't want some antiquated poppy back and forth crap that every other, yeah, no.

52:57.680 --> 53:01.960
Matt, I have in my hot little hand, right here, my Synology box that arrived, the Disk

53:01.960 --> 53:06.920
Station Synology, and as experienced, running Linux, supports iSCSI file servers, backup,

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
surveillance cams.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
It's the DS412+.

53:08.920 --> 53:12.800
I think we'll do a review this Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

53:12.800 --> 53:13.800
Oh, nice.

53:13.800 --> 53:16.520
It has four, four terabyte drives in it, running Linux.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.360
All right everyone, well thank you for joining us for Linux Unplugged.

53:19.360 --> 53:22.560

53:25.160 --> 53:27.920
Also check out our subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.640
All right everyone, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

53:30.640 --> 53:31.920
Hey Matt, I'll see you on Sunday.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.920
Sounds good, see you then.

53:32.920 --> 53:46.800
All right everyone, thank you, and we'll see you right back here on Tuesday.
