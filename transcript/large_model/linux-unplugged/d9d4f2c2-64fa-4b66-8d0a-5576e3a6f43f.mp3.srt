1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
This can be one of those interesting episodes where we are gonna have people bailing from the mumble room and then joining back during the

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,840
Show because right now as we record red hat summit is happening and Carl you're manning a booth virtually right now

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,260
Yes, sir, the fedora in centOS chat room slash booth slash whatever you want to call it. That's awesome

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,360
And are you getting decent attendance? Oh, yeah on-demand created a fedora badge, which is like a little

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,200
little gamification thing that they do in the fedora community for attending and you just show up in there and let them know what

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,880
Your fedora account system username is and they'll give you the badge. Oh great. I was just about to ask, you know virtual booth

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,720
We need virtual swag. I was thinking the same thing. You know, this is like a different kind of summit, isn't it Neil?

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm just glad it's happening at all because like I've been I've been kind of depressed with all the events that have been canceling throughout

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,600
The season and it's been nice to like at least get in listen to see what people are doing and and and chat with folks

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,480
In there and hey, this is the first summit where I technically maybe gave a talk. So that's cool

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah, and this year the concrete would be real bad and you're not gonna get that so that's a positive too. Oh, yeah

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,220
I'm gonna look forward to not being basically bedridden for a month again. Like I was last year. I gave it a go

13
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,640
I logged in I found it a little confusing but kind of like you I was just glad it was happening and I thought to myself

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,560
I really appreciate

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,240
The real Red Hat summit because when you go to the actual Red Hat summit

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,740
You really get an appreciation for how dialed in Red Hat has that game?

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:45,340
I've been to a lot of corporate events and they really have their summit game dialed in the virtual version. It's a little rough

18
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,820
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, mr. Payne quite the show

19
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,020
We have for 351 packed too much. We never do it. Just right. We can't help ourselves because we have

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,140
So much to cover with a brand new fedora release and of course

21
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,540
There's things to follow up on the new Ubuntu 2004 releases

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,820
Well, we've had a little extra time with that

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,100
but as we said

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,180
We also gave the fedora 32 release a full try who could resist and I am happy to report that

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,820
Just after the show last week actually during the show. They attempted to deliver my system 76 limmer Pro

26
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,460
But they didn't really ring the doorbell

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,480
You I think they like dropped it off on the porch and like I don't want the kovat and ran off and didn't even try

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,500
But the next day I was like camped up by the door

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,100
There's a window in the studio living room where I can see the entryway. And so there I was with my phone in hand

30
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,700
Watching and they you know, sure enough knock knock on the door get the box

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,740
I open it up tried it out for a little bit and then the next day had to put fedora 32 on it

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,860
And I'll give you my impressions of what it's like in the next week

33
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
We'll have the review

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,140
But before we get into that before we get into the review of fedora 32 the follow-up of Ubuntu 2004 the community news

35
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,580
I have to say

36
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:16,780
Time appropriate greetings to that mumble room. Hello virtual lug whenever you guys do that

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,580
I always watch it from a waveform perspective and it's very impressive visually I have to say hello everybody

38
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,620
It's a great showing in there

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,500
I know some of you may have to come and go as the summits going but

40
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,080
Special hello to Matt DM Matt from fedora is back. Hello Matthews. Good to have you on the show

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,280
Good to be here. Very glad you're here on fedora release day. Your timing is perfect sir

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,580
And mr. Martin whimpers glad to have you back sir. Hello. Hello. Happy release to you as well

43
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,380
Thank you very much. Good to be here

44
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:51,620
Well, so why don't we start with you wimpy because there was a tweet from your fingers on April 24th saying there's new

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,840
Features in the Ubuntu desktop that no one is talking about and I thought well, let's talk about them

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,180
And the one that I thought maybe we could start with but I'd love to just go anywhere with you on this

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,180
but the one I'd like to start with is

48
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,060
It appears that with 2004 you can get a Ubuntu certified device right away

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,820
Like we're not there's not this typical leg of months before OEM is certifying it. Is that true? It's not quite that

50
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,780
So the way that it works now is that in the past the only way you could get a certified device experience

51
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,660
which means the correct power endurance profiles the correct firmware for

52
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:37,580
Auxiliary devices the right drivers by default all that sort of thing was via the factory image that came pre-loaded

53
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,180
So what we've changed now is that when you do an install of the GA release of Ubuntu

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,740
2004 it can identify if it's on a certified device and

55
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,880
Automatically pull in all of that stuff that would have been in the pre-loaded factory image into the standard install

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,680
So if you've got a certified device, maybe you bought it pre-installed with Windows

57
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,080
And you want to dual boot Ubuntu alongside it or maybe you've decided to make the switch to Ubuntu

58
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
You'll get the factory

59
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
experience

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Just from the GA ISO. That is so cool

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,800
Now there's a bunch of other things in here

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
We should talk about because one of the areas we didn't jump into was like the fingerprint stuff and I'm curious if there's other

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,120
Areas you feel like need a little more attention too. There are I mean the fingerprint stuff is interesting

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,440
That was another OEM request and that's more around the support of new biometrics devices, which

65
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,280
Mostly proprietary these days because they don't want people having sight of how the internals of those devices work

66
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,300
So we needed a way to bring those devices into you know, the Ubuntu desktop and the wider Linux desktop ecosystem

67
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,460
So we did some work with the three

68
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,060
Largest suppliers of those biometric devices to find a way where those can be enabled on the Linux desktop

69
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,620
so that was done in collaboration with the

70
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
LibFprint project and

71
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,900
Then also with the upstream GNOME design team who've got a new design

72
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,060
To improve the way you enroll your fingerprints and then do fingerprint unlock

73
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,860
So we don't have those new designs implemented in 2004, but they will land before

74
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,980
2004.1. That is very exciting and also just impressive the amount of sort of backroom dealings

75
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,420
You know working out arrangements and has to go on to actually make these user visible features happen

76
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:40,420
So what we've done is we've created a LibFprint compatible protocol shim that sits in front of these

77
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,100
proprietary drivers and translates the proprietary driver

78
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,220
Implementation into a LibFprint compatible protocol clever

79
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,220
Before we get to the the Scuttlebot. I've already seen over 2010

80
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,180
What else was missed in the coverage of 2004?

81
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,780
So I think it was subtle stuff that was more like a distro level rather than you know

82
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,740
actual features of the desktop itself and some of this work was work that you know, I

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,180
Was interested in doing a community level and it's stuff that predated

84
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,900
You know me coming back to the Ubuntu desktop team

85
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,780
But it's things like making sure that FFmpeg is NVENC and VAPI and OpenCL

86
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,780
Accelerated in the distro so that things like

87
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,940
OBS studio and the video editors and all the rest of it can exploit all of those

88
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Acceleration for scrubbing through timelines using acceleration and doing you know hardware accelerated video encode and all the rest of it

89
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,180
Oh, that sounds great for folks who are you know new

90
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,540
I mean, I know how to compile those things in but that's a big blocker if you're just trying to make some content

91
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,500
Yeah, indeed and it was there in 1804

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,940
albeit with the older way that NVENC was exposed via FFmpeg and then because of changes in the FFmpeg project it

93
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,100
Fell away in subsequent releases and we wanted to bring that back

94
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,660
So, you know, it's stuff like that and you know uplifting Steam

95
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,820
So that all of the current crop of VR devices and controllers all work out of the box when you install Steam

96
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,420
You know a whole raft of work around improving quality of life for people that want to make videos or want to

97
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,980
livestream or want to play games and

98
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
That also extends to

99
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,620
Including ferals game mode Daemon. Yeah, this is interesting

100
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,900
It's something that I don't recall being super easy to actually get running during the beta

101
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
So I was surprised to see it in

102
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,100
2004 final maybe I was wrong about that

103
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,940
But I seem to recall early on in the process having some trouble actually getting game mode for 2004, right? So this was

104
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,720
The last feature we landed in Ubuntu desktop 2004. Okay

105
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,100
It landed release week. I think it landed on the Monday and we released on the Thursday

106
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,460
So it was very late coming but it was something if you look at the bug

107
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Report for it. I think I started that process as like I think it's the first thing

108
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:11,060
I did when I took over from Will was actually start that process and it sat and it sounds like a trivial thing

109
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,580
Well game modes just a bit of software and it's just a package so that you just include it in the distro

110
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,820
but for everything that is in the Ubuntu desktop, it has to be in the main archive and

111
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,500
the main archive is traditionally the archive that gets all of the security support and

112
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,420
You know proactive security maintenance

113
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,220
So in order to get into that archive the security team have to conduct a manual security review and audit all of the code

114
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,180
Of course, and we also have to do packaging checks to make sure that you know, the upstream is active

115
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,280
They have the appropriate security reporting mechanisms

116
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,700
The health of the packaging of the software is correct its standards compliant and a whole bunch of things. So

117
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,660
we've gone through that process and again, if you look at the bug there, you will see references to the

118
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,780
the work that the security team did and the upstream conversations they had in

119
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,880
Ferals github around the security review that we did so, you know

120
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,460
There was a number of you know changes and updates that happened in order for it to land in main

121
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,060
Which I think happened a week before release and then subsequently get included in the image

122
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,780
So yeah, it wasn't in the beta but it's in the final release. Well while we're talking about gaming

123
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:36,100
there is one new touch that I didn't and I still haven't regretfully had a chance to try yet and that is if

124
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,920
People out there have hybrid graphics or like myself. I have an external eGPU that I've talked about before on this show

125
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,460
Well now you can right-click on an icon in the launcher, you know

126
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,660
Where you normally have like new window or add to favorites what you know the options you normally have in gnome shell

127
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,580
There's an option in there to launch using the dedicated graphics card. How the hell does this work?

128
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,860
How is this possible and and do all I have to do is just plug in my eGPU and this just shows up in

129
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,140
Gnome shell. Well, first of all, let's start the very beginning. This is an upstream gnome feature

130
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,240
It was first introduced in gnome

131
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,060
334 but it only worked with Intel and AMD drivers and what was added in

132
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,580
336 was support for Nvidia. If you've got an Nvidia Intel hybrid system

133
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,700
you need to be running the Nvidia proprietary drivers and

134
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,900
The Nvidia proprietary drivers need to be in on-demand mode

135
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:39,580
So you're choosing that mode where the Intel IGP is in use and is rendering the desktop and the Nvidia

136
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,780
GPU is in this low power state waiting to be used and

137
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,260
Although this is a feature that I think it's integrated in

138
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,520
GLib, I may be wrong about that, but I think it's in GLib

139
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,640
But essentially in order to run a process on a dedicated GPU

140
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,760
It's just the case of setting a few environment variables prior to launching the process

141
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,040
So what's happening behind the scenes is a few environment variables get inserted into the execution context

142
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,640
for the application that you've chosen to run when you right-click and say launch on dedicated GPU and

143
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,000
it puts the appropriate environment variables in there for if you're using an AMD graphics card or an Nvidia graphics card and then

144
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,080
Subsequently that process is now running with the full capability of that GPU

145
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,560
I've been doing that manually, you know on the terminal now for a while, but this is just such a level of

146
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,140
Finesse that it feels it feels special

147
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,660
It feels like something maybe just you'd normally see on the commercial operating systems

148
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,780
I mean, I have to say that GNOME 3.36 has just just just been a load of stuff

149
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,660
That's landed all at once that just makes it an outstanding version of GNOME

150
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,420
You know

151
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,300
there was lots of design refinement that I think was originally scoped out by the GNOME design team in

152
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,920
2017 and they've been slowly working towards and then loads of it landed in this cycle

153
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,840
So it's perfect time for you know us to be releasing an LTS because without doubt

154
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,540
This is the best GNOME shell ever very well said and that is going to echo in my fedora 32 review as well

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,740
It is the culmination of years of work that are landing in this version. What a what a perfect release for an LTS

156
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah, it really is. I mean, yeah, it's a fantastic GNOME shell release, you know without question

157
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,020
I'm curious if you have any other bits or thoughts on like the ZFS stuff or any early information on how that's going

158
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,300
It's too early to look at the adoption rate on that just yet, but it's stronger than 1910

159
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,540
So it'll be interesting to see how many people are opting into ZFS

160
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,700
but the big change there is the introduction of

161
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Zsys, which is our integration layer that sits between

162
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:06,600
ZFS and Vuntu and so that's responsible for doing event driven snapshots and that's

163
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,620
mostly around if you do

164
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,100
large package installs or upgrades

165
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,980
Then snapshots ZFS snapshots are taken prior to those transactions being committed

166
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,300
So if an update goes bad restore points are automatically exposed in the grub boot venue

167
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,700
So you can simply choose to you know, boot into the point before that upgrade took place

168
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,640
And it really does work. That's what's so great. Is it really works? I it saved my bacon a couple of times during the beta

169
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,240
Fantastic. I'm glad to hear that's working for you. And this this lays the foundations for

170
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,920
more backup restore capabilities that we're going to be building

171
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,840
On top of that as we work towards 2204 wire guard

172
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,300
obviously it has been back ported to the 5.4 kernel in 2004, but you were mentioning on the pre pre show that

173
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,300
1804 users if they're sticking with 1804 eventually, they're gonna get wire guard back ported as well. That's right. So

174
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,960
As you'll be familiar we do point releases for the LTS is and the next

175
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,760
1804 point release will have another or a newer

176
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,640
Hardware enablement stack which will include effectively. What is the 5.4 kernel from

177
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,400
2004 and therefore by way of that you will get wire guard in

178
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,900
1804 so for those people that are wanting to use 1804 for the long term

179
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,720
Then you'll soon have wire guard built straight into the kernel. No DKMS modules

180
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:44,560
In fact, that's an interesting point because we're not using DKMS modules for things like wire guard or the Nvidia drivers even these days

181
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
So the Nvidia drivers are

182
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Distributors late-linked binaries that are signed so you can leave secure boot enabled

183
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Without you know, even with Nvidia drivers and wire guard turned on

184
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh, it's just so nice every time you update, you know not having to worry about DKMS

185
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,760
The one disappointing part there is now what am I gonna do to you know, pressure people to move on to 1804

186
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I can't hold wire guard over their head

187
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,640
Yeah, this is that Gnome 3.6 goodness. Gnome 3.6. Well any other spots you wanted to mention or bits of attention?

188
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,920
You wanted to shine a light on that's a pretty good list. The thing that I

189
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,160
Love above all other things about this release is the Yuru theme. It was

190
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,240
Absolutely fantastic getting together with the the four guys

191
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,040
Who are the sort of the core Yuru team?

192
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,880
we had them in the canonical offices in London in January and we had members of the

193
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,180
Ubuntu design team and desktop team and then hangers-on like me and poppy, you know cheering from the sidelines

194
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,120
and we had this week-long sprint and

195
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,280
completely changed the face of Ubuntu for this LTS and I have to say I'm very proud of

196
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,220
Their accomplishments and I love the new bold look

197
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,700
Even though it's unmistakably Ubuntu. It's it's you know, quite a change of direction. I absolutely love it

198
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:14,380
I think it's my favorite default theme so far and we were having a conversation in the Jupiter broadcasting telegram group

199
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,380
That a lot of us are loading it on other distros, too

200
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,540
and it is fairly straightforward to do that and it just looks so great and

201
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:28,540
I like the combination with the appearance setting in gnome settings where I can just go and it's one click and everything's dark

202
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,620
And it looks really nice. The reason it's easy to install on other distros is no mistake

203
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,660
that was actually a product of the design sprint based on feedback that we had from

204
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,380
Gwadek and the Linux applications summit, which is there are obviously developers who are using

205
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,220
Distributions that are not Ubuntu and they want to make sure that their applications look correct on

206
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,980
You know other distributions and the criticism is well, I don't use Ubuntu

207
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,980
So how can I check to see if my apps work fine on Ubuntu?

208
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,980
So we've made sure that the Yuru theme is packaged and available everywhere

209
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,300
It needs to be available so you can you know use that theme elsewhere to make sure everything's working, right?

210
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,240
Well, it is great. Congratulations to you the team and of course all the upstream developers it all came together

211
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,220
It's a great LTS. Thank you very much. I shall pass those words on please

212
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,480
Pass on a thank you to whoever is making the Raspberry Pi 4 support

213
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
so rocking awesome because

214
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,380
I've been running

215
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,700
2004 on my Raspberry Pi for a couple of weeks since before release upgraded right?

216
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,980
No problem to the final version now and because of the version of kernel that's on 2004

217
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,700
I can boot now from USB devices and my Raspberry Pi 4 feels like a real computer and

218
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,460
I'm running an LTS on there at the same time and it's a distribution that I understand and trust

219
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm going all-in. I think I'm even gonna enroll them in landscape

220
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:00,700
So that way I can just basically manage them without having to really think about it. That'd be a solid idea really Dave Jones

221
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,980
Who has been in and around the Raspberry Pi community for years?

222
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,300
Was hired by canonical about 18 months ago, and he's been leading that effort to really

223
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,500
Deliver a first-class experience on the Raspberry Pi and I'm delighted to say we're in the middle of our product strategy planning sprint

224
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,940
For this, you know this week for what will become

225
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,340
2010 which is going to be the groovy gorilla and

226
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,580
We had our talk about

227
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,220
Raspberry Pi and I'm looking forward to everything to come in 2010

228
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:38,540
For Raspberry Pi users. Oh, man, you're gonna get me upgrading now on my pie. Jeez Louise. Well, it's a good problem to have

229
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,020
Well, great. Thank you for coming on and and covering some of that stuff and I hope you get some downtime now

230
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,380
I hope you're gonna be able to catch your breath soon. Yeah, I'm gonna hang up my boots for a week and you know

231
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,180
Go and sit in the garden and drink some champagne. Maybe well-deserved before we go

232
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,380
Mini Mac has one question for you, and I'm kind of interested to hear it. So go ahead Mini Mac. Let's get that in

233
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah, thank you. Wimpy on my 1804 Ubuntu box

234
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,100
I have signed into the canonical life patch service to get the kernel patches live patched in

235
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,300
But from time to time I had to reboot now I read that you did some work on that

236
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Can you be a little bit more specific on that?

237
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,460
So livepatch is actually built on an upstream kernel implementation. So it's not our own thing

238
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,780
It's just leveraging what's upstream and all we've done is contribute to that upstream effort to improve it

239
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,900
But yes, livepatch is available in you know, limited numbers. I think it's like three or five machines

240
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,220
I think if you're an Ubuntu member

241
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,620
It's for 50 machines an Ubuntu member being somebody who is in the Ubuntu community

242
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,260
And has been recognized as somebody making a sustained commitment to the Ubuntu project

243
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,060
Then you get 50 activations. So, you know you all your home servers and your laptops

244
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,960
But it's basically like high and critical

245
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,900
CVEs in the kernel that you will get patched via livepatch where you don't require a reboot in order for them to take

246
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,460
How lucky are we to have both Wimpy and and Matt here today incredible Matt?

247
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,780
Congratulations on the announcement that there were soon will be ThinkPads shipping with Fedora

248
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,180
This is huge and people have been talking about it since the moment this announcement landed and it looks like we're getting several models

249
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,700
Off the bat. Yeah, what the ThinkPad p1 p53 and x1. Oh, yeah the x1. Yes

250
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,580
Yes, now I think this isn't too surprising if everyone listening remembers

251
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,620
Not too long ago. We announced that Lenovo was joining the Linux vendor firmware service

252
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,220
And I think a lot of us went well, I know there's a lot of Linux users that use them already

253
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,420
But I wonder if this is going somewhere bigger and I think maybe we're here

254
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,660
So this is a big moment for the project Matt and it's fantastic that it's ThinkPads from Lenovo

255
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,140
I am super super excited and Lenovo has been amazing to work with

256
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,020
They're really interested in doing things the open source way being part of the community not, you know

257
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,220
Not stepping on things and they really were interested in shipping

258
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,500
Yeah, the stock Fedora image without any modifications

259
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,740
Which is very exciting for us as well because we obviously work so hard to make that image good

260
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,900
Talk to me about their comfort level with the cadence of Fedora because it sounds like maybe that that stock image aspect of it would

261
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,540
Make it maybe fairly straightforward to just keep current on whatever the latest

262
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,580
So in 33 ships, for example, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what they're planning to do

263
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,100
They're already on a six-month cadence for Windows updates

264
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,580
So it's basically the same thing with all of their processes. So they were not really concerned with that at all

265
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,260
I'm surprised to hear that actually that's that's I didn't know they would be on that frequent of a cadence with Windows

266
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,180
But you know, it is the Windows 10 era. Well as we've been talking about right now Red Hat Summit's going on and

267
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,380
Mark P from Lenovo was in the Fedora and Centos community area and he said that right now

268
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,460
They've got these three platforms as a pilot, but he says that if things were say to go well

269
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,740
He could see it expanding to other platforms including desktops

270
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,300
Although I won't say the numbers I talked to them about you know

271
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,460
The number of sales that they want to make to feel like this was a success and it wasn't a crazy number

272
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,740
So I'm very optimistic that they're going to hit those targets and see this as success and we'll see more

273
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
Well, let me ask you a question

274
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,460
I mean would it be possible that going forward when Red Hat employees?

275
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,340
Maybe they get hired or it's time to replace their rig and they just get issued a machine

276
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,740
Could it potentially be now one of these could that count towards that sale number? Yeah, I assume so

277
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,920
We've been talking to our IT people about that. We Red Hat already has standardized on Lenovo laptops for their models

278
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,580
So we are going to be ordering these particular SKUs in the future

279
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,620
There may need to be some other models because like you said there are

280
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,420
These three select models and there may be use cases that Red Hat has that doesn't fit those SKUs

281
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
So we may order some other ones as well

282
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,540
But yeah that that should be it and I guess they have some other large customers that were interested in Fedora

283
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,220
It's where they're gonna demand for this came from their side that I hopefully will fill out a lot more of them as well

284
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,820
But of course all of you and all of your listeners, you know, please help out next time you have a laptop to buy

285
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,300
This is definitely a choice that you can make that will help

286
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah

287
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,300
I mean

288
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,640
I think a lot of people have been waiting for a long time for current ThinkPads that would just be preloaded with Linux and there's

289
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,660
Been various ways to get them over the years

290
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:43,220
But the nice thing about the sort of focus channel approach is that it's much easier for people who are kind of just in that

291
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,340
Shopping mode to kind of identify what they're getting, you know

292
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,580
I've noted for years now and that's pretty impressive to be able to actually meet that but for years

293
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,260
I've noted that the upgrade cycles on Fedora have been very painless. In fact, I

294
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,540
think I had a machine that

295
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,020
Had been upgrading from 22 and I brought it all the way up to 31

296
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,700
Before I finally gave up and said alright, it's working. I don't need to keep trying this

297
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,460
Do you think that has started to set in in the user base of Linux are people starting to get that that?

298
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,940
That you don't necessarily have to have a long-term support. You don't necessarily have to have rolling

299
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,100
There's a spot right here in the middle. I hope so. We've been focusing on that for a while

300
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,980
We're kind of going to give the give the benefits of the newer software that people get with the rolling release

301
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,580
but with a little more

302
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,420
predictability and the ability for us to do solid QA on it to make sure that each release is something that we feel proud to

303
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,420
Put our name on right, you know, I had a couple people tell me. Oh, I upgraded over lunch

304
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,100
Think it's kind of a sweet spot and I think we're doing a good job of hitting it

305
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,960
That along with having our actual release cycles be more predictable and making sure that you know

306
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,300
We can have the the Mother's Day Halloween releases every year and you can basically

307
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,000
You know plan around that happening and it's such a kind of a different world now for software availability

308
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,940
Availability both from from video driver standpoint for both AMD and video and Intel

309
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,840
but also just from a lot of the

310
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,480
applications where you use these universal package formats and they just sort of stick around and work just between upgrades so it also kind of

311
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,560
Abstracts that layer out. Alright, so I I gotta go back to the laptop and I got to ask a question that I think everybody listening

312
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,860
Is wondering do you have any insight on when these things are actually going to be able to be purchased?

313
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:32,780
Well, as I said on reddit, I know but I can't tell you and it's not because of lawyers

314
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,200
It's because of the marketing people who would like to have their big splash and I would not like to ruin that sure

315
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,820
And there's always there's some last things that they're going through to make sure all their regulatory

316
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,740
Compliance and everything is all signed off on and so it's possible there'll be delays or something

317
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,540
So I don't want to promise a date that isn't doesn't come true

318
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,960
But it really shouldn't be that long now sounds reasonable sounds like we don't have to wait too much longer

319
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,800
And there'll be news on it in the near future. It sounds like yeah, exactly

320
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,180
I bet this is great news, you know made me think of folks who maybe not don't have a lot of laptop choice

321
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,920
They're working for a larger IT organization and that organization wants to see this support from the manufacturer

322
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,160
So sure you could get a bunch of on Dell's but now there's a whole new world of options

323
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,720
Yeah, I know definitely when we joined Linux Academy, you know

324
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,760
They were looking at just a couple laptop options like system 76 and the XPS 13

325
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,720
Because if they were gonna if they were going to issue Linux laptops to employees

326
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,280
They wanted it to be supported by the OEM exactly

327
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,560
even if it meant that IT actually provides all of the support it just from almost like a

328
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,480
Not a due diligence standpoint, but from like a responsibility of purchasing if you're gonna spend

329
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,560
$1,800 to two grand on a machine you want it to be a supported configuration and have someone to yell at if it doesn't work

330
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
That's always nice

331
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,560
A lot of these laptops I someone on hacker news. Their first complaint was well

332
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,360
I was promised they'd have Ubuntu available and I can't buy it

333
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,980
and the fact is

334
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:05,040
Lenovo does ship Ubuntu and certified rail configurations on a number of their workstation class systems already

335
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,840
But they're not available to you unless you go through a very complicated

336
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,400
Channel process and are buying a whole bunch of them and you know

337
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,600
There's a lot of paperwork involved. And so this is very exciting because this will just be like when you go to buy one of these

338
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
Laptops, it'll be a drop down in the OS configurator

339
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,520
You'll be able to you know pick through our workstation right next to whatever version of Windows you could choose instead

340
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,400
I mean, I'm sure it's still having some scuttlebutt in discussion

341
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,660
But I think if Red Hat summit was in person right now and this news had just dropped it would be

342
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,380
One of the points of conversation amongst the attendees is this is this deal?

343
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,900
Yeah, we were hoping to have the Lenovo people there at the fedora booth with us

344
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,420
Obviously, I think the whole news cycles been just kind of disrupted and even your Red Hat summit not just going virtual

345
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,900
But it's kind of the tone of announcements and news and press. It's like this is not the time

346
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,420
So things are a lot more subdued. Yeah, on the other hand we had this in the works and we weren't gonna hide it

347
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,340
So I think people have noticed though. I think at least in our circles people have noticed

348
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,420
It's been getting a lot of conversation in our community channels

349
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,500
I think job done is probably not the perfect time to make that kind of announcement, but I think you got pretty close

350
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,260
Well, thank you Matt stick around we're gonna talk about fedora 32 here in a little bit. But first

351
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,500
Little housekeeping to do is as we do

352
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,660
If you know that we're doing this live, but you don't know when did you know that we have a solution West?

353
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,580
Did you do thanks to the magic of the Internet? Yeah, this is something that was brand new

354
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,940
So I don't blame you for never knowing about it. We've never mentioned it before on the show ever

355
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,220
It's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar. Oh wait, what was that? Oh, hold on West

356
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,180
I'm getting I'm getting a note here from the been there for almost eight years. Oh, yeah

357
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,780
Well Jupiter broadcast and maybe I I probably I probably don't need to mention it Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

358
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:59,800
I just realized how fast I say that Jupiter broadcasting comm Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

359
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
Calendar. Yeah, there you go

360
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,700
RSS feed for this show is that Linux unplug comm slash subscribe where you can get the feeds and put it in any pod catcher

361
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,420
You'll like if you'd like to join us in the telegram community. It's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash telegram and please do yes

362
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,460
And if you are an ACG subscriber a cloud guru has launched the cloud playgrounds for business customers

363
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,940
In the in the biz that term is called B to B

364
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,500
B to C is business to customer and B to B is business to business

365
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,660
The more you know, yeah, well you think about it you get into a place you need to skill up

366
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,940
It's actually a very very handy thing. Yeah, having good, you know training right there available from your employer

367
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Hey hard to beat I am

368
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,220
Thrilled to say that we had another luck log on Sunday

369
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,800
Wes and I made it and cheesy was there and a whole bunch of folks in the mumble room were there

370
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,760
Neil was neck deep in a v-bolt and

371
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,100
instance and

372
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,260
Just ready to go and we talked about as the pine devices a little bit

373
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,460
We really got into some really cool his history stuff, too

374
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,740
We were really kind of talking about old Linux and just a great chat

375
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,580
I hung out for a couple hours then I don't know how long did anybody know how long it went after I left

376
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,880
About three hours after you left. Yeah, so that's fantastic. It's noon Pacific

377
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,580
Which is the same time we do this show on Tuesdays?

378
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,180
So we just take the Tuesday time and we put it on a Sunday. You see what we did there

379
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,260
It's very clever wasn't my idea keep it simple because otherwise I don't think you would remember when to show up

380
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,340
No, and you know what's weird about it is

381
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,540
the

382
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,620
Timing because that was when I recorded land on Sundays

383
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,060
And then the weekend that I would have been doing land

384
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,740
But I no longer had land the mumble was meeting and it was like, I don't know

385
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,900
I just like step from one to the other it was really deep your groove and now you got more community

386
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,780
Yeah, it's pretty great

387
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,900
And so we hang out and I turn on the loudspeaker so my wife can listen in too and and have a chuckle

388
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,580
I'm sure Sheila it was pretty great. So if you want to join us, there's an IRC room

389
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,100
It's IRC geek shed net pound lup lug and then we just hang out on our mumble room

390
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,380
Which it's kind of great because it gives you maybe a chance to try out mumble

391
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,900
Try out your mic before Tuesdays and then you got everything set up. You could just join us the same spot

392
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,780
Yeah, low-pressure fun casual hangout. Yeah, it's pretty great. We'd love to see you. So

393
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,220
Join us on Sundays

394
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,500
Love plug actually went all the way to 10 p.m. Pacific

395
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,220
Holy, so just spend your whole Sunday there

396
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,300
Grab a pizza grab a couple of beverages

397
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Put your feet up

398
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,700
All right, well today fedora 32 is

399
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,040
Officially released you may recall a few episodes ago episode

400
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,260
Dig a D. I put it lower down in the dog. He did 348

401
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,340
348 that was a really fun episode. So Linux unplug calm slash 348

402
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,340
we we took one of the big features of

403
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,660
fedora 32 and just sort of zoomed in on that and that is the early out of memory killer and

404
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:05,580
It's fascinating the difference it makes so check that out because that's a big part of what makes fedora 32 on the desktop experience

405
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,340
A little bit different but along with that is your standard updates to things like gnome

406
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,740
You have gnome 3.36 in here, which includes that new

407
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,460
beautiful

408
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
beautiful login and

409
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,700
Unlock screen. I mean, I've been using it for a while, but every time I like wake my computer up. It's just a treat

410
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,140
That's just such a great example. Like wimpy was intimating earlier that work was started in 2017

411
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,060
At a hack fest in London and now it's landed here in 2020

412
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,140
It's a special thing that is you got it. You got to actually use it to see it

413
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,300
It feels beautiful full stop. Yeah, it really it feels elegant

414
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,500
So along with early out of memory manager enabled by default

415
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,140
which helps improve the desktop experience and then the fixes that have landed in gnome 3.36 that have helped improve

416
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,780
experience in

417
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,180
IO load so that's something that a lot of work went into with this release of gnome where these bug fixes landed is

418
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,740
rooting out what caused gnome shell to stall during heavy IO load situations and

419
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
tons of those fixes have landed

420
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,580
Fedora 32 sort of doubles down on that by including that early out of memory killer

421
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,220
but also by doing things like enabling trim by default on the SSDs and

422
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,420
Twitching firewall D defaults to using NF tables fedora. You're so modern. So tell us about this West

423
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,100
This is kind of a neat little trick. Yeah, I mean NF tables has been around since 2013

424
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,740
I think and that's been a long time. But as usual no major distros

425
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,900
I've gotten around to really adopting it or adding it in places. Sure. You could use it yourself

426
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,940
It's been in the kernel and really that's sort of what you know

427
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,140
Folks upstream in the kernel have been working on been in the kernel since kernel 3.13

428
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,620
That's how long it feels like a long time ago, but you know, nobody's used it. Like you said

429
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:03,060
So this is this is kind of I guess the quote-unquote new packet filtering engine if you could call it that

430
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,700
But why why well as always when you upgrade things you just get you know

431
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Get rid of some of the cruft from the past

432
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,260
There's a lot of code duplication and inconsistencies in the current IP tables world in particular

433
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,220
there's a lot of protocol specific extensions that are hacked in there to make it work for an individual protocol and

434
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,060
Nothing that would let you match on packet fields or do that in a more elegant way

435
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,540
So instead of having to add in all this custom work, that's just handled for you

436
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,500
There's also a lot better handling if you've got a dual stack set up

437
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,060
So IP v4 and IP v6 at the same time

438
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,300
If anyone's used IP tables for that and had to use both IP tables and IP 6 tables

439
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,180
It's just kind of a confusing mess and that's a lot better handled in NF tables

440
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,820
That's nice and something that I haven't yet played with but seems like one of those things would be worth just dorking around with

441
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:55,500
There's also the adoption of sysusers.d format, which I also don't really quite understand or even really appreciate what this is

442
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,420
Can you help me understand this one? Well, so if you think about it, a lot of packages are out there installing users, right?

443
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,380
Yeah, but that's not always super introspectable

444
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,700
Especially if it's just in some you know

445
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Like post install script where they run the actual commands just install the user

446
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:15,820
So this change uses the sysusers.d format add some hooks into the packaging system so that you can do this in a declarative way

447
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,660
And there's kind of a theme and a lot of these changes around being more declarative

448
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,140
So yeah, you just look at the packaging and see like oh it needs this user

449
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,220
And then you'll know that that'll actually get handled in the right way

450
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:32,260
So instead of like hashing together some sort of bash script that like checks to see if that you ID and G ID exist and all

451
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,860
Of that it's just sort of like a handoff to say hey OS. I want this thing done. Yeah, exactly

452
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,220
There's also maybe some changes in the future to integrate with system D sysusers now that's not happening now

453
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,980
But this change makes a future switch like that easier. You can just stub it out

454
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,860
There's other small tweaks like DNF getting a little bit faster at counting a few things

455
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,100
Although I think we're about to realize the benefits of that in the next release

456
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,740
Also the ability to restart services at the end of an RPM transaction has been changed

457
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,100
So that's another one of those declarative changes where yeah, you could do that yourself

458
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,020
But you might have complicated dependencies between different services and you need to get that right

459
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,500
So now again, you can see what needs to be restarted

460
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,540
You can register that with the package system so that all those things get started at once and you avoid some of those nasty race

461
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,340
Conditions. This is what I love about a fedora release is

462
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,940
On the surface. It's like oh, it's it's a new gnome shell. Okay, right

463
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,220
but when you actually go below the surface and

464
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,540
You see what they're doing here

465
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,020
You see like there's so much stuff that we've been talking about for months now that is landing like kernel 5 6 which has wire guard

466
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,420
Python 3.8

467
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,660
LLVM 10 but also

468
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,560
GCC 10 which is a big deal and

469
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,700
system D

470
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,740
245 so the big deal about system D 245 version

471
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:54,540
245 if you can believe that is the first release that includes the new system D home D stuff. Oh

472
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,460
Change in the world once again, nothing's really being done with it at this time, but it's there now

473
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,100
Yeah, you've got home CTL right on your command line already after you install you can start setting things up

474
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,260
I tried it a little bit and didn't quite get it working before the show

475
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,500
But I've also never used it before and it will definitely be something I'm playing with. I just seems that seems like a big deal

476
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,580
I don't know. That's like a big one

477
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,020
And then the other thing that we've been watching for what feels like a hundred years

478
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,440
But has seen some significant improvements in this release is pipe wire

479
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,900
Some early work on I'm kind of making pipe wire sort of fit and finish stuff is now getting laid down

480
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,540
but more importantly this release they say has

481
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:40,460
Basically full-on jack compatibility and full jack support. So now pipe wire can fully integrate with jack on both ends and

482
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,540
They did something I can't remember because I just read this this morning

483
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,700
But essentially they've changed the way they do like a direct frame buffer copy

484
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:54,100
For for streaming the desktop and they've made it much more efficient now to like capture the desktop and put that into a video stream

485
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,020
And send that to an application. That's how to rework as well

486
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,740
Oh darn sounds like we're gonna have to reinstall the studio after the show. Yeah, right

487
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,540
Right, right. Hey also retiring Python 2. Uh-huh. That's another sign of those changes where they it has to happen

488
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,300
It's been a long time fedora isn't afraid to push ahead

489
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,820
There's some performance benchmarks if you like those kinds of things that we have linked in the show notes. Michael arable did the whole

490
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,260
fedora 32 versus 2004 with versus

491
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:28,860
x11 versus Wayland on and then also one that I always love is the cross desktop benchmarks

492
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,940
right gnome shell versus LX see versus

493
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,220
Plasma and all the others

494
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,580
That's all linked in there essentially the takeaway is it depends?

495
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,580
Which is what always happens with these reviews on like all these sort of similar releases

496
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,860
You know as I've been playing with the beta up till you know up till the release today

497
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,700
I will say if it order 32 has been a dream to virtualize even just you know using Wayland

498
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,560
No issues whatsoever. I kind of forgot I was using it in a virtual machine for a while

499
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,980
So I put this on the limo pro from system 76 it feels so wicked

500
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,480
Fast that it's been one of those where like I show it to people. I'm like try this try this

501
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,880
both 2004 and fedora 32 part of the boot experience now is so smooth because they're using the OEM

502
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,320
UEFI load yeah, right exactly hands-off from the bootloader very nicely and so

503
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,200
It boots about as long as it used to take a PC to just post

504
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,320
That's literally how long it takes a little more pro with fedora 32 to boot like wouldn't you know when you beep and then you?

505
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,440
Get a memory count and then it would flip over to the next screen and it's all your PCI devices

506
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,760
And then you would go to your bootloader, and then your OS boots

507
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:41,040
With this it's it's vendor logo, then there's a flash of the vendor logo, and then there's a flash in your on

508
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,720
It's not even really a flash. It's more of a transition and you're at GDM

509
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,900
I mean you almost can't tell like was this just hibernated or suspended or did I do a full boot yeah?

510
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,240
I'd say it's it's just a few shakes slower than waking from sleep if sleep

511
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,620
Waking wasn't so dang fast now like if it was like what used to be back when you stuff of like a disk spin up

512
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:02,560
Or something yeah, it's really really fast, and it's smooth the the theme is

513
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
clean very clean and

514
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,520
The gnome experience is also very clean because there's not a lot of tweaks some of the things I got to admit

515
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,320
I do like that canonical tweaks is like the appearance tab. I've learned to kind of like my

516
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,960
Favorites to a dock thing so there's just extensions

517
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,200
I go turn on but it's even easier to manage that now because there's a dedicated extensions app

518
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,520
That's like officially upstream supported

519
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,320
And so it's even easier now to manage your extensions and toggle ones that aren't working and toggle them on and off

520
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,400
And I love all that right. I don't know about you, but it's great experience

521
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,540
I had on 2004 I think fedora 32 is feeling faster the performance does seem a little bit a little bit

522
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,160
It's been super snappy. I did a clean install last night

523
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,640
of the ISO image and it was

524
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,300
Within seconds I had everything up-to-date the the software experience is really smooth for installing both firmware packages

525
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,920
But also the OS upgrades no kidding and then that you know that nice little pop-up asking if you want to

526
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Turn on third-party repos is clean and just simple if you'd show me this like even let's say three three years ago

527
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,420
I don't know. I would believe it was desktop Linux. It really is pretty great. So what was the bacon take well?

528
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,960
I mean there were a few things again. I just looked at it with my bacon eyes. I suppose you're cheesy bacon eyes

529
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,980
I do like the wallpapers that they've put in there's some some pretty stylish ones that they've created for themselves

530
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,400
Especially the 3d printed one because I'm a nerd like that and I've been 3d printing everything as of late

531
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,320
I thought you might like that one and honestly it just looks really sharp

532
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,840
You know the nice depth of field in there exactly exactly and so that's my default wallpaper at the moment

533
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,680
And one thing that I really liked about your first initial

534
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:51,480
Impression of fedora was the fact that especially for new users you have the the help comes up right there

535
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,200
But they've also added these nice little video clips just to show you how to navigate

536
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,800
The genome system itself. So how to switch workspaces

537
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,520
How to quickly open up the applications menu and I think that those are nice little touches

538
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,320
especially for someone that you know might be getting a

539
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,760
Lenovo

540
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,520
Laptop preloaded with fedora and have never used Linux before so this might you know

541
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,780
Really help those types of users out and I thought another really interesting feature was

542
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
Once you initially installed the system

543
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,360
The updates were done in the background for you on that first boot and then applied for you on the reboot

544
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,280
So similar to how you would have a progress bar

545
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,400
With Windows or Mac OS or something like that letting you know that updates are being installed

546
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,480
I thought that that was a really clean way to handle that initial

547
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,440
First boot and I think that kind of goes back to you know

548
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,880
These additional little features like the videos and helping new users kind of get a feel for it and understand the system

549
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
There were a couple of dislikes

550
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,120
You know things that I think could be worked on. I think the partitioning is still a little awkward

551
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,600
Especially if you are a new user and you're coming over

552
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,280
It's it's definitely not as clean in my opinion as say Ubuntu is on

553
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Partitioning and knowing what you're going to do a couple of things like telegram wasn't available for me in the default store

554
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,840
So I had to go to flat hub and pull that down

555
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,520
you know, you guys would probably know more about this, but I

556
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,840
Don't know if flat hub is integrated into the software store

557
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,040
The software store. Well when you go to flat hub and you do the quick setup

558
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,960
After that point it will be it's just added as one of the repositories flat pack itself is pre-installed. Yes

559
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeah, just a flat hub repo is not added. But thankfully it's like a one-line command. You don't even have to pseudo for it

560
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,260
Again fractional scaling, you know while built in it wasn't in the UI

561
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,600
So not really a big deal for me on my on my test machine

562
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,520
But when I'm pushing, you know something on my 4k monitor, I would like to see that available there

563
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,560
And I thought it was kind of weird that there were two image viewers. So you had photos and then images as well

564
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,040
Photos I assume is a fedora project while images is a gnome project

565
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,320
well

566
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:18,680
I think it's photos is like to manage and organize a photo library similar to photos on Mac OS and iOS and then

567
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,720
Image viewer or viewer whatever it's called is for like viewing JPEGs in your downloads folder or PDFs and things like that

568
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,720
It doesn't have the same sort of like albums or favorites or that's right

569
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,560
So got you and that's and that's kind of what I thought would be the case, right?

570
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,760
It would be more for managing photos as opposed to images

571
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,760
You know, I noticed that you could crop and rotate and do a couple editing features in there as well

572
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,000
But I didn't take a deep dive into either one of those applications to be honest, but I think overall it's a great release

573
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,400
I mean, I enjoyed it. I liked the the little nuanced features that they added for the new user, you know the theming

574
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,800
I think you know, they've just used the stock gnome theme

575
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,460
I think that's something they could work toward in the future is maybe dialing that in a little bit and and maybe

576
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Enabling the yard routine by default

577
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,560
Careful, you could be touching the third rail there on that one

578
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,280
Do you know how contentious that whole thing thing gets I think all of us

579
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,200
Are looking forward to maybe I'll bring Madden on this point is I believe in the next release of fedora

580
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,720
There is going to be a transition for DNF that will improve performance fairly considerably

581
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,160
Is that did I read that right Matt that that's being worked on for the next release. They're working on it

582
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,840
I don't know how much of it's going to land in the next release because

583
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,220
When you're looking at the update system

584
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,960
It's fairly sensitive. So you want to make sure any changes like that are

585
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,960
safe

586
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah better to take it slow and steady with that

587
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,060
so I was sitting here thinking fedora in a very special way represents the

588
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,940
collective works of so many upstream projects some of which Red Hat incubates and others outside of that and I

589
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:03,920
Wonder if you've noticed something that has stood out to Wes and I Matt and that is as we dug into this for research for the show

590
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,740
We realized there was significantly more in this release than what is in the written press right now

591
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,520
Not to like take away from what they've done because it's great that it's getting coverage

592
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,600
but it seems like fedora has a bit and I hate to be cliche, but it has a bit of an iceberg scenario where

593
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Some of the big features like the new desktop release or out-of-memory killer or some package transition those are visible

594
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,960
But then below the surface

595
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,520
there's so many more things about this release of fedora that we didn't realize and still we started doing our research and I wonder if

596
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,640
You feel like that stuff isn't properly getting exposure if you've noticed this too. Oh, yeah

597
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,580
absolutely, and there are thousands of packages in fedora with a

598
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,080
huge rate of change and

599
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,080
We used to a couple years ago have a couple people on our docs team who are really dedicated to making sure we had release

600
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,920
notes that had a

601
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,760
Broad coverage of a lot of that change and that's kind of fallen off just as people moved on to other things

602
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,180
It would be awesome to have some people focusing on that again. So that's an area we could use some help

603
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,320
So this is maybe maybe a call to help join the fedora docs team and see what you can do around release notes

604
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,280
It's an easy way to make things better. What a great way to contribute and in the announcements

605
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,280
We kind of you know, try to pick a few highlights

606
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,320
But even there I kind of rely on people to tell me hey

607
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:27,300
This is an interesting thing I did and then I kind of talk together with our marketing people and a PR people and say okay

608
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,840
What are the things we should kind of put up the front here so that you know

609
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,880
They get get the attention this time around

610
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,940
I try to rotate those things a little bit so it's not always like new version of GCC every time or whatever

611
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,560
Whatever piece of software new GNOME new core OS things so there's a little bit of different attention

612
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,580
But yeah, there's just there's so much it can't all get the all get the attention

613
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,960
It deserves there really is and you would think you would think I was just it's a small release

614
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,380
But there's so much in there and then there's so many packages that have such

615
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,280
Huge things still changing and we just go along and upgrade and it all just works typically always

616
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,600
I think what we want is the nerd report all the all the nitty-gritty Colonel newbies, but for fedora. Yeah, really that'd be great

617
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,160
Somebody get on that get in contact with Matt. I don't know. I know Maddie

618
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,560
What's the best way for people to get ahold of you if they actually did want to maybe help out with that?

619
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,880
You can join our fedora mailing lists

620
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,680
Matt DM on Twitter Matt DM fedora and read it

621
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:29,720
Those are probably the best places you can email me. I am generally available IRC. I'm around

622
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,720
Well, I got to say

623
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,800
This release with the improvements to GNOME shell and whatnot feels wicked fast

624
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,120
it really is pretty impressive at being a longtime desktop Linux user and

625
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,840
Seeing this level of improvement

626
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,080
Continually over the years, you know, I think it's something that we take for granted

627
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,680
It could have gone very much the other way it could be getting slower and more and more

628
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,600
Right loaded and we've we've gotten the exact opposite

629
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,160
Is there anything that's in this 32 release that you don't think is getting a lot of attention right now that you want to?

630
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,560
Shed a little light on yeah, a couple of interesting things

631
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,240
One of them is finally the fedora core OS

632
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,720
We are getting to our different streams of having a next and updates and a stable stream and fedora core OS

633
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,380
Which is an important step of making that actually something

634
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,960
I really want to recommend people to use to install their compute clusters and things on top of

635
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
another neat thing the

636
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,280
computational neuroscience SIG in fedora special interest group put together a spin of

637
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,680
The desktop you basically install a live CD that has all this neuroscience stuff on it

638
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:44,800
So that people in the neuroscience community can get their brain imaging and all the software open source software that does that in one nice

639
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,240
easy slick place and I really love this because

640
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,800
You know, obviously that's a niche

641
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,560
But I really want fedora to be a place where people who have niche interests can come and you know

642
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,920
Make a solution for their particular users and groups another one that's in the works. We've had a fedora jam

643
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,480
audio

644
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,000
focused version of fedora for a while and

645
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Someone has picked that up again. And I think especially with the pipewire stuff you're talking about really want to have fedora

646
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,600
Be a premier system for doing audio production. I think that'll be that'll be pretty neat

647
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I noticed that image. I'm like mental note gonna check that out in a bit. I also noticed a

648
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,800
Gaming ISO what's the gaming image that one hasn't been updated for a little while?

649
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,160
But it's kind of an idea about show sort of showcasing open source games

650
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,200
So it's not so focused on you can you know?

651
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,200
The big news of course now is you know proton and steam on Linux and kind of proprietary games

652
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,120
Yeah, but it is nice to remind ourselves like there's some really great free games, too

653
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,160
Yeah, and that's kind of what that is meant to show off in general

654
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,080
I would love for anybody who has you know, kind of a special interest and thinks that there would be a particular

655
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,560
You know focus they could put on the operating system that would would showcase something for their users

656
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,440
I mean another one I often give as an example is the Python classroom lab

657
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,760
Which is meant to you know for teachers teaching how to program in Python

658
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:18,480
It's gonna have an environment you can boot into and there you go. Everything's all ready for you that kind of thing

659
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,160
32 just continues this feeling that I've had for I think really since like 28 or 29 and that is

660
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,920
That fedora is such a great DevOps showcase Linux workstation OS

661
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,920
You know like the same thing I felt for 24

662
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,920
It's like we're so fortunate to have all this great work from all these different projects kind of coming together and land yes

663
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,840
and

664
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,120
I think it's pretty cool that you guys went ahead and pulled the trigger on the early out of memory killer stuff too like that's

665
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Something else a lot of people aren't moving on

666
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,920
Were you involved in any of the conversations or they maybe pros and con debates on actually doing something?

667
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,320
That's kind of aggressive like that that one. I watched go by like the conversation was was was going okay

668
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:05,320
So, you know, there's there sometimes some of these development conversations feel like they are going off the rails or need some intervention

669
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,320
But I think a lot of times the process just kind of works

670
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,320
There was another example of that that I thought was pretty awesome in this distribution

671
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:19,320
If you're looking through those for Onyx performance results, you'll see that Python in particular is a lot faster

672
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,320
And this is because someone had a suggestion that

673
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Python would be a lot faster if it were compiled statically rather than dynamic linking

674
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,320
For some technical reasons related to Python blah blah blah, which is cool

675
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,320
But there's a lot of downsides to static linking Python

676
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:42,320
So kind of the community discussing together came up with an idea of a particular compiler flag

677
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,320
Which gives a lot of the benefits with much smaller downsides

678
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,320
You actually can't LD preload things into Python anymore the way we're building it

679
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,320
But as a result, we get like a 20 percent performance increase on Python

680
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Wow, that really does feel like a great developers workstation

681
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,320
I just always notice like Kexec already installed a ton of the tools that I have to install on other distributions

682
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Fedora has them right out of the box

683
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Also, I have to give honorable mention I didn't really do much with it this time around

684
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:17,320
But Fedora Toolbox, I believe, has been transitioned from like a bash project to a go project

685
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
And there's some story around that, too

686
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Well, the bash was always kind of a prototype

687
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:30,320
And, you know, once as a sysadmin, you know, once your bash scripts gets to be more than, you know, fits in one screen of your text editor

688
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,320
It's probably time for it to stop being a bash script

689
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,320
Oh, I think Wimpy might disagree

690
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
You should see some of his bash scripts

691
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,320
It had exceeded that by quite a bit in complexity

692
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,320
So it was time for it to move on to something else

693
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,320
And just a lot of the tooling, you know, Podman and container tooling is written in Go

694
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,320
So Go is a natural ecosystem choice for that

695
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,320
We really should make our pick that bash, was that bash top? Is that what it was called?

696
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
That monstrosity bash script

697
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
There's a bonus app pick for everybody

698
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Go check out bash top

699
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Well, yeah, and, you know, Fedora Toolbox is very, very handy

700
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
So I've talked about it before on the show

701
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:12,320
But it's just such a quick way to get like an environment where it feels very much like you're on the same box

702
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,320
You're in the same, you can share resources

703
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,320
But you also are able to play in a way that's isolated from the rest of the operating system

704
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,320
And you can recreate them and spin them up very fast

705
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
And I just loved it

706
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,320
But I didn't really give it a go this time around because I got the concept

707
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,320
But I appreciate that the work's continuing and the investment's continuing there

708
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,320
It was designed for running on Core OS and on Silverblue where you have an immutable base OS

709
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,320
On those systems, it's basically vital because you kind of need to have some environment to mess with

710
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,320
So this gives you that

711
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,320
But it's also really useful just on a standard Fedora workstation desktop

712
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:52,320
To give you kind of that sandbox space where it's safe to mess it up

713
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,320
And then you can destroy it and create a new one or whatever

714
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Well, especially if you're a bozo like me who's installing 30 different apps a week

715
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
So he can talk about them on his podcast

716
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,320
You know, eventually your system starts to pay for that

717
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,320
So that's what I, when I was running Fedora as my main workstation, I really found that pretty useful

718
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
I wonder if I can get Fedora Toolbox on Manjaro right now

719
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,320
I bet you can

720
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Yeah, something tells me

721
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
Yeah, something tells me

722
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Well, cool man

723
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,320
I mean, I just, I gotta say congratulations to you and the entire team

724
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Another great release

725
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,320
And our team installed it and pretty much universally liked it

726
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,320
And we were, you know, messaging, telegramming each other back and forth

727
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Like, did you see this? What about that? Yeah, it's very fast

728
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
And I'm running on this, I'm running on this

729
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,320
Okay, I have it in this VM

730
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,320
And I very much concur with Wes

731
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,320
It was pretty, pretty performant in all of those situations

732
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,320
It feels, it feels like this is the fastest Linux we've ever had

733
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
And I know there's some benchmarks that suggest otherwise

734
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,320
But I don't know man, when you put everything together

735
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,320
When you put the gnome shell improvements together

736
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,320
You put, even having trim on the SSDs

737
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
You put an early out of memory manager on there

738
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,320
Plus the improvements like with Python and whatnot

739
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,320
Like it all really comes together to a fantastic release of Fedora

740
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Well, thank you

741
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Well, thank you actually

742
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
Don't thank me, I'm thanking you guys

743
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Please thank the whole team

744
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,320
I will

745
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,320
So, would it be outrageous for me to ask you

746
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,320
What the not so distant future might hold for Fedora

747
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,320
As far as you're concerned?

748
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
More of the same, I think

749
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Continuous releases on a cadence

750
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,320
I'm excited about more of the IoT stuff

751
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,320
Hopefully we'll get some more devices

752
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
We've always had some trouble with, you know

753
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,320
Everybody's favorite Raspberry Pi

754
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,320
With, you know, upstream support and things like that

755
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
And, you know, Fedora really

756
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,320
We really like to keep everything

757
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,320
So that we have one operating system

758
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,320
That installs on all devices

759
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Not a separate kernel

760
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
Not these kind of things

761
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
And so that's been a long road

762
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,320
I think that as the ARM device world matures

763
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,320
We'll have more things that Fedora will work out of the box on

764
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,320
And I think there's some neat stuff in Fedora IoT

765
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
That's coming up

766
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,320
I hope to see some cool stuff around that with Fedora 33

767
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I agree on those points

768
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
I do hope to see some more maturing there

769
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Maybe Wes and I will talk about our RockPro experiments

770
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
In the post show

771
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
Yeah, in particular, actually

772
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,320
The RockChip stuff has a lot of new support in Fedora 32

773
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
So hopefully that should go more smoothly for you

774
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
I'm hoping so

775
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
We'll find out

776
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Wes Payne will be back with the results in a moment

777
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
But before we get there

778
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
I just wanted to say thanks

779
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
Thanks for coming by, Matt

780
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
You know, I know it's probably a super busy time

781
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
You know, probably if you have a little downtime

782
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
The last thing you really want to do is jump on the computer

783
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
And chat with people about it

784
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,320
You'd probably love to just be kicking back and relaxing

785
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Having a beer right now

786
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
So I appreciate you making the time

787
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,320
I'm going to be back to the Red Hat Summit now

788
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Right, of course

789
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,320
Enjoy

790
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
No downtime for you at Summit time

791
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,320
I forgot, of course

792
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
Well, thanks for making the time

793
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
I really appreciate it

794
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Be glad to

795
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
Bye

796
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
And congratulations again

797
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
And Wimpy, congratulations again to your team on the release

798
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
Thank you for stopping by

799
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,320
And a big plug for the Ubuntu podcast

800
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,320
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast at UbuntuPodcast.org

801
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,320
Season 13 is in full swing

802
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
Thank you very much

803
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
No, thank you

804
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,320
And those look like some tasty potatoes

805
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
We do make good potatoes

806
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
You guys are making me hungry

807
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
Oh, yeah

808
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
I'm not done podcasting yet

809
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
We have a whole post-show still

810
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Well, we will see about that actually

811
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
We're getting long

812
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
We'll see

813
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Before we go, I want to mention that this show actually has a Twitter account

814
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
If you want to be following

815
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
I don't know

816
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,320
Maybe you want to be up to date on like new releases

817
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Maybe you want to know when things are live

818
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
I don't know

819
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
I don't know what you want

820
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
It's Linux Unplugged, right?

821
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
Just at Linux Unplugged?

822
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,320
Is that what it is?

823
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,320
At Linux Unplugged

824
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
That's what it is

825
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,320
You say it like that so I believe you think that's what it is

826
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,320
But I know you're double checking just in case it's not that right now

827
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,320
You got to do your due diligence

828
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
And I'm right

829
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,320
All right

830
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,320
We'll be live again next Tuesday at noon Pacific

831
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,320
And links for everything we talked about at Linux Unplugged slash 351

832
00:59:47,320 --> 01:00:00,320
See you next Tuesday

833
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:28,320
You and I were doing kind of concurrent projects before the show started

834
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
Because our mumble server was down

835
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
And so I was kind of keeping the live stream up to date

836
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:38,320
And chatting with the mumble admins who are wonderful people

837
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
Amazing

838
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,320
Volunteers that are truly just the best people on the earth

839
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,320
That took care of a little outage we had right before the show

840
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Which clearly our virtual log is such a huge part of this podcast

841
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
So the fact that we were possibly going to be without mumble

842
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,320
I was slightly panicked so Mitt Fried jumped in on it

843
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,320
And got the system back up and running and we were able to keep going

844
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
Saved the show

845
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,320
While we were kind of doing all of that

846
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,320
You were out in the server room aka studio garage

847
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,320
And you were messing around with the Rock Pro 64 we have out there

848
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,320
And Fedora images

849
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,320
And the thing is I didn't get a chance to see if it actually ended up working or not

850
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,320
So how far did you get with Fedora 32 on the Rock Pro?

851
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Not quite

852
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,320
We're still learning our way around that thing that's for sure

853
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,320
And it seems like occasionally when we reboot it

854
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,320
It needs a little cool down period before it's ready to try booting up again

855
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
Like fully unplugged

856
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,320
Yeah

857
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
And that's something that I'm not sure if other people experience

858
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,320
But we have to kind of leave it unplugged or else it won't post again properly it seems

859
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,320
Only after a failed boot

860
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,320
We can reboot it from the command line and it comes right back up

861
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,320
So that's not a problem

862
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Yeah

863
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,320
So based on my limited knowledge and deciphering

864
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,320
While the Manjaro image that we used as a test booted up just fine

865
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,320
Neither of the two Fedora images I found were able to do so

866
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Okay

867
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,320
And that's just from the SD card

868
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Yeah and these are just the ones you know put out on the alternative downloads page from today

869
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,320
So I don't know that they've been optimized for anything but you know the processors

870
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,320
And so there may need to be some bootloader work etc done to actually get it loaded and working

871
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,320
As they say in your Zoom meetings we're going to circle back on that topic and put a pin in it

872
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:20,320
And see if we can't sink on a solution and then maybe bring some other stakeholders in and verify the results

873
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:39,320
Oh my God Chris
