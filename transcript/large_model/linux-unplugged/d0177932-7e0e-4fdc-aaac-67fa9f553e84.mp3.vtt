WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Very impressed that they've got Linux running on the iPad Air, too.

00:02.880 --> 00:03.840
You knew it would happen, right?

00:03.840 --> 00:05.600
But this is Linux 518.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.400
So this is like the most recent version.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.760
And another group then built on that work and got

00:13.440 --> 00:17.320
Linux booting on the iPhone 5S.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.040
That's so crazy. It is really great.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.280
When you start seeing things like from the GNOME project, like that

00:22.280 --> 00:23.960
they're working on mobile.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.120
My first reaction when I saw this is like, oh, here we go again.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.320
GNOME's focused on mobile again.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.520
Well, we all know how this is going to go.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.600
But then I thought, you know, for a tablet, which Google's about

00:35.600 --> 00:38.720
to make a big push into tablets again, they announced that at Google I.O.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.240
And on an iPad, if I could get Linux 518 and then eventually they could get

00:45.200 --> 00:48.520
a graphical interface working based on the work the Asahi project is doing,

00:48.520 --> 00:52.480
who they just got their first triangle rendered on the M1 platform.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.360
I don't know, maybe there's going to be a day where I'm running GNOME on an Apple

00:56.360 --> 00:57.720
device.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.880
Yeah, but OK, I support this, obviously, because I like it seeing Linux

01:01.880 --> 01:03.640
run really wherever it can. Yeah.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.680
But what are you doing on that tablet?

01:05.680 --> 01:07.200
I mean, I don't know.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.280
Browsing the web? I don't know.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.320
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.720
And my name is Brent.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.200
Hello, gentlemen.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.320
It's been quite the week.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.480
Each one of us is bringing our own topic.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.360
Brent's been battling the lizards all weekend.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.960
We'll find out how his tumbleweed box may have gone sideways.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.400
Wes has been cramming Nixos into places that I didn't think

01:42.400 --> 01:43.440
it'd be able to go.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.480
We'll find out where and why.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.280
And then I am reversing course on an executive decision

01:48.280 --> 01:50.640
I made about a year and a half ago.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.040
And I'll tell you why that is.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.240
Then we'll round it all out with some boosts, some picks and a lot more.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.480
So before I go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings

01:58.480 --> 02:00.120
to our virtual lug.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.800
Hello, Mumble Room, everybody.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.160
Hello. Hello, Chris and Wes.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.560
And hello, Brent.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.920
Hello.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.320
Thank you for making it. Nice to see everybody there.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.480
This is an interesting trend.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.120
We've got a lot of people in quiet listening again these days.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.560
I love it. Thank you for making it there, too.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.560
We are live on Jupiter.2.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.800
Oh, oh.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.320
More about that later in the show, because up first,

02:24.320 --> 02:27.200
I want to take a moment and just put the word out there

02:27.720 --> 02:30.800
that if you are planning to attend the London meetup,

02:30.800 --> 02:34.840
there is some things in flux that they need to know about.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.760
Right, Brent?

02:35.760 --> 02:38.480
Yeah, I just learned that the date has changed.

02:38.480 --> 02:43.320
So instead of August 6th, Alex, I guess, has shifted things slightly.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.480
That's why he's planning so far in advance to August 5th.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.920
And that's six p.m. GMT.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.080
Don't be showing up at like Pacific time or anything,

02:52.080 --> 02:54.480
because that's how meetup.com tends to show it.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.200
I did also notice that there are more than 70 people who have RSVP.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.440
So I think last week we were at 40.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.800
That's almost double, which is kind of impressive.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.640
The location, therefore, is to be determined.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.080
But I think we'll figure that out in the next little bit.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.600
Yeah. And this is unfortunate, but it's doable.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.400
I think it was going to be on a Friday.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.200
Now it's going to be on a Saturday or something like that.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.320
Alex is still figuring it out.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.280
He got contacted by his airline.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.280
And for his convenience, they're rebooking his flight.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.480
For his convenience.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.080
Who would have thought that, you know, planning a cross-country meetup

03:26.480 --> 03:27.880
might have some details to figure out here?

03:27.880 --> 03:29.960
Who would a cross-continent meetup?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.760
Really? Indeed. That's pretty cool.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.800
I'm I'm bummed we couldn't make it even speak the same language over there.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.680
No, they speak English. Yeah.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.240
You know, I realized, too, they actually say HDMI right

03:42.760 --> 03:45.920
because they're pronouncing the sound the H makes.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.440
We say HDMI.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.160
I mean, I'm used to saying a all the time, so it's fine when you say.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.480
But how do you say HDMI?

03:53.480 --> 03:56.200
Do you say HDMI or do you say H?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.720
No, I'm with you. HDMI.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.120
But, you know, they invented the thing.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.760
So I don't know, Jeff Giff, RGA.

04:04.400 --> 04:09.040
I don't know. Anyways, I'm just saying it's not all bad over there.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.400
Now, if they just didn't smell so bad, except for Pope, he smells great.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.080
But yeah, so keep an eye at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.680
That's unfortunate, but that is the state of the airline industry right now.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.760
And we'll just keep it up to date over there.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.040
So let's start with my reversal.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.360
This will be pretty quick.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.280
So I think this is probably a good place to start.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.280
I surprised a lot of the hosts last week here at Jupiter Broadcasting

04:35.280 --> 04:39.520
when I announced that Jupiter Broadcasting was getting back into PeerTube.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.440
PeerTube is a YouTube in a box replacement that is based around WebTorrent

04:45.440 --> 04:48.960
technology to do peer to peer streaming of the video to offload

04:49.280 --> 04:52.520
the most expensive part about live streaming, which is the bandwidth.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.280
And it's something we've talked about before on the show.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.320
We're a big fan of where they're going with it.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.320
It participates in the activity pub Federation Network.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.320
So you can actually you can actually there's this beautiful world

05:03.320 --> 05:06.360
where mastodon and PeerTube can actually communicate and cross

05:06.640 --> 05:08.760
pollinate each other. It's it's really cool.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.080
We shut it down due to some limitations at the time that didn't

05:13.360 --> 05:14.840
just didn't really work for us.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.720
Yeah, right. We had an old PeerTube and it was fun to try, but it didn't.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.360
It just seemed like it wasn't, you know, the place where we were at

05:20.360 --> 05:23.280
and wanted to do and its stage of development.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.720
Yeah, we were kind of at the time, we were kind of thinking of it

05:26.720 --> 05:28.720
as a full YouTube replacement.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.720
So we would post all of our stuff there. Right.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.320
Yeah. Be another like the archive of J.P. stuff. Right.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.240
And maybe we would create a channel for each one of the shows.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.600
You could subscribe to the Coder Radio channel and the Linux Unplugged channel.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.640
And don't listen to the guys on Linux Action News.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.000
They're crazy. Don't know what they're talking about.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.840
No. So you could pick and choose.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.800
But this time around, I've decided to do just sort of a live version,

05:49.880 --> 05:51.960
a limited archive of our live shows.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.560
And we're trying to do video where we can for those to make it,

05:55.160 --> 05:57.280
you know, a little more enjoyable. I get all of that.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.520
The idea really came to me, though, when I thought, well,

05:59.520 --> 06:01.640
we've gotten a decentralized community with Matrix.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.200
And that's been going really well.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.160
We've been working on a decentralized value system with Boose.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.240
That's building out. It's early days, but it's building out.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.640
But we don't really have a decentralized media solution.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.480
And that really got me thinking about PeerTube again,

06:14.480 --> 06:18.000
because I think it really brings everything we've been talking about in 2022 together.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.320
We don't really need another project,

06:20.320 --> 06:24.520
but I think we can do something here that completes a picture of decentralized media.

06:24.520 --> 06:28.920
So everything from the distribution to the funding to the community interaction,

06:28.920 --> 06:31.000
it can all be decentralized.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.800
We've never really been at this place before.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.480
This is a new era in technology that you can actually host yourself

06:36.480 --> 06:37.800
on your own infrastructure.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.040
Still early, but it seems, you know, just based on some of what you say,

06:41.040 --> 06:45.920
I read some of the other results like seems like something worth continuing to explore and invest in.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.200
And the whole stack is free.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.120
It's all free software right from the OBS machine that we're using to stream right now

06:52.720 --> 06:53.880
all the way up to restream.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.560
And if you're watching on a Linux box to all the way down to your system,

06:56.720 --> 06:58.960
that's why you want Linux on your tablet.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.040
There you go.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.520
And, you know, this is the advantage of things like no takedown bots.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.160
But here's the idea is I thought, well, we'll have livestream recordings up there.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.960
It'll be archived for a period of time.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.680
We'll stream special events like Apple's WWDC.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.040
I'm going to do it like a Mystery Science Theater WWDC stream tomorrow.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.120
Yeah, I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to try it.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.760
And we can go live earlier over there because we don't have to worry about copyright violations.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.640
So you can kind of get the pre pre show over there.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.520
And the number one question I got is why not make this a members only thing?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.320
You know, now that you've added video.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.080
I like that that somehow the audience is suggesting this.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys to not you specifically, but a lot of the team did.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.680
But also it was like that when I in Matrix, I was asking people their opinions and, you know, trying it out last week.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.200
And a lot of people said, well, why not just do a members only thing?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.480
Well, so the members only feeds not going away.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.120
It's an audio feed with the show notes and we publish it like almost immediately after the show.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.640
That remains the source feed for that audio is better quality.

07:56.640 --> 08:03.280
It includes some processing in Jack and it doesn't include like all the dead air on the livestream when we're bringing the streams up.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.440
And it's just a standby screen and all of that kind of stuff.

08:05.440 --> 08:10.160
And we don't go back and prune the archive like we're going to do on PeerTube to keep storage costs down.

08:10.440 --> 08:15.520
And we're not going to be posting the livestream video version to anything like YouTube or anything like that.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.160
Or so with the with the member feed, you get the convenience, right?

08:18.160 --> 08:20.000
You can just it's like any other podcast, etc.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.360
This is a something a little different.

08:21.360 --> 08:25.600
Yeah. And to dip our toe into something which is bigger that I'll talk about here in a moment.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.920
But another reason it was an audience first reason is work from home.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.680
You know, we hear from people that they just don't commute as much now.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.880
And I'm honestly humbled that so many of you have figured out new ways to work us into your routines.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.480
And we don't take that for granted at all.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.600
And we're going to work hard every single week to try to make that decision worth it.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.600
But also, I just hear from people out there that they're at their desk more when they listen.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.120
So this might be something you could you know, when you're at your desk, you go up to Jupiter tube and watch it on there potentially.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.480
Also, it's just a minimal overhead.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.840
We're not making these video shows.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.640
These are still audio multitrack recordings and have an audio editor.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.760
We're just adding some cameras because of the low key nature of it.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.080
It actually probably looks worse than we did 10 years ago.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.120
But I just don't care. Right.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.080
I'm not taking it seriously.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.800
YouTube is a fool's game.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.040
I don't much respect anybody wants to try it.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.480
So it does work for some people.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.000
But I hate what it incentivizes as a platform.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.200
So we have no interest in that.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.880
And the overhead is pretty minimal.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.520
I've done live switching for a decade.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.480
So for me, it's pretty natural to to live switch while I'm talking.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.400
Just didn't know. Whoa, whoa.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.560
So that's no big deal.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.760
So that's no big deal, but the other bigger reason kind of looking out the podcasting

09:33.760 --> 09:37.920
to community is working on live stream support inside the podcast app.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.440
Now, this is where this is going.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.320
Tell me more about this.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.320
So you got your favorite podcast app and you pull up your podcast.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
And when Linux Unplugged is live on a Sunday,

09:47.520 --> 09:52.160
we'll just show up as another entry in the list of your podcast with a little badge or however

09:52.160 --> 09:54.880
the developer implements it that says this is a live show.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.160
And then you can tap that and in your existing podcast player,

09:58.160 --> 10:01.120
you can just listen to the live stream like like with all your podcast controls.

10:01.120 --> 10:01.840
That is neat.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.480
Yeah, we've needed that for a long time.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.280
Yeah, because otherwise we have to direct people like a whole separate setup, right?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.280
And there's a lot of URLs to figure out.

10:09.280 --> 10:13.040
And yeah, and some apps will let you some of those like Podverse,

10:13.040 --> 10:15.600
some of the podcasting to do apps already support this.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.240
They'll let you opt in for notifications when the show goes live.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.800
If you want inside the app, you manage it inside the app.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
Just say, yeah, notify me or by default, it doesn't.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.240
So that I'm looking forward to.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.640
But right now it's primarily audio that's in these apps.

10:26.640 --> 10:32.000
But there are members in the podcasting to community who are working on making this

10:32.000 --> 10:34.560
also a video and audio option.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.040
So you would pick when you tap on if you want to watch the video or the audio.

10:37.840 --> 10:43.920
And the awesome thing about that is they're doing this based around PeerTube

10:43.920 --> 10:45.840
as the origination point for the video.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.360
So the podcasting to folks are going to basically kind of encourage PeerTube

10:49.360 --> 10:51.120
adoption for people who want to stream their video.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.440
And one of the developers working on this is Alex Gates.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.200
He's one of the podcasting to community members working on a bunch of awesome projects.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.280
But he's working on this video stuff using PeerTube.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.600
And he said, this was this morning in a conversation I had with him.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.240
He said, the goal is to get PeerTube live stream support, either upstream or via a

11:08.240 --> 11:13.200
series of plugins, which live notifications go through Podping on a federated live chat

11:13.200 --> 11:17.200
via XMPP in a curated RSS feed out of the box.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.280
Now, this is a lot of jargon.

11:19.280 --> 11:23.280
But what he's saying is they're going to leverage a bunch of open standards like

11:23.280 --> 11:27.200
ActivityPub and XMPP to do this back end work.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.480
And he's going to create an example spec for people to follow that can then implement it

11:32.480 --> 11:34.400
in the app or implement it as a podcaster.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.480
And he says, I also want to provide the capability for apps to choose to participate

11:38.480 --> 11:42.080
in a web torrent bandwidth sharing or just stream it directly to so you could also help

11:42.080 --> 11:42.720
with that.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.440
That'd be nice.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.480
All from the podcasting app.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.800
So that's another reason we're doing it.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.280
Right.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.560
So that's another reason we're doing it, we're just going to kind of start experimenting

11:50.560 --> 11:51.120
with that stuff.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.960
And the PeerTube project is such a great piece of free software as well.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.560
So I just wanted to experiment with it again.

11:57.120 --> 12:01.040
And I've gotten some community members who have offered to help us do some of the admin

12:01.040 --> 12:03.760
side so we can kind of take over some of that.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.360
And I'll do my first experiment, which our YouTube I was just looking.

12:07.360 --> 12:12.400
Our YouTube channel has been in trouble since November 20th, 2020, when I did a mystery

12:12.400 --> 12:16.800
science theater Apple stream and they gave us one of those like, if you screw up again,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.000
you can't live stream anymore.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.640
And it's been on our account since November of 2020.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.960
So I just got to try it now.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.760
You know, like next week, I'm just going to give it a go on Monday and see what happens

12:28.400 --> 12:29.440
to do all of that.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.320
We ended up deploying this instance of Jupiter tube on NixOS.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.120
Yeah, we did.

12:35.120 --> 12:40.160
And we deployed NixOS on Linode, which is not one of their default images.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.800
No, no.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.720
We have we had a little bit of fun with that.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.640
Yeah, we learned a few things along the way.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.000
And I don't know what you think would maybe be the most helpful thing to relate to people

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
that want to try this as well, because I know what we figured out was there's some label

12:52.000 --> 12:54.160
stuff with the disks and that kind of thing.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.480
Yeah, you know, you kind of you got to learn the particulars of the hosting platform that

12:58.480 --> 12:59.840
you're using.

12:59.840 --> 13:04.720
And so I'd play with it on like a couple other hosts that I already had set up when I first

13:04.720 --> 13:06.880
started dabbling for the NixOS challenge.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.480
But we hadn't actually deployed anything like on the JB stuff, really, except playing around

13:10.480 --> 13:11.360
with VMs.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.520
Yeah, locally, nothing up on Linode.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.960
So it's fun.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.560
I liked it because it was just like you and I sort of like pair installing NixOS.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.760
And I'd never like walked through, you know, we've installed other like we've done Arch

13:21.760 --> 13:22.560
before and that kind of thing.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.000
But it was it was neat.

13:24.000 --> 13:24.720
It was.

13:24.720 --> 13:30.720
It was fun because we were tempted to follow a guide, but also wanted to do it on our own.

13:30.720 --> 13:35.680
So we kind of just like a mix of both, which did lead us to make one little mistake with

13:35.680 --> 13:39.040
I guess how the Nix installer finds the drives to set up for boot.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.880
Yeah, so one of the particulars that we had to take into account was just sort of the

13:42.880 --> 13:44.720
nature of the virtualization and the setup.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.560
And so instead of having, you know, like a partition table set up on the disk by default,

13:48.560 --> 13:54.080
you get just like the whole disk and Linode has a fancy setup where they'll run grub and

13:54.080 --> 13:58.480
then that'll find your, you know, find your boot drive and load your kernel and that kind

13:58.480 --> 13:59.200
of thing.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.280
But NixOS is so neat that you just kind of enable a couple command line options, right?

14:03.280 --> 14:07.760
You say, oh, yeah, well, I'm choosing BIOS boot or EFI and enable grub for me, please.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.440
Then you don't really have to do much else.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.480
And that was the first time we got into a situation where it's like, I know how to fix

14:12.480 --> 14:16.240
like regular grub things, but, you know, or the ArchWiki's guide to install grub or whatever.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.400
But here we're kind of just seeing this failure and it's saying like, oh, this mode, you have

14:20.400 --> 14:22.640
to install in this mode, but you can't actually use, you know.

14:22.640 --> 14:26.320
Yeah, not supported and yeah, and it just airs out when it's trying to do the bootloader stuff.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.200
Yeah, exactly.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.560
And you could go the other way.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.160
You could obviously repartition things.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.080
So we thought about taking that path, but we found some resources that suggested that

14:34.080 --> 14:38.080
can break some of Linode's, you know, they've got functionality and there's reasons, obviously,

14:38.080 --> 14:40.960
they've chosen that, you know, the default setup that they have.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.480
And if you want to keep things like, have it be able to, you know, fix your root password

14:44.480 --> 14:47.920
for you or something like that, you probably shouldn't vary that.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.800
That's where they also suggested, I guess Linode suggests don't use UUIDs for your disks,

14:52.800 --> 14:54.080
go by label, at least.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.480
I don't know if that's still relevant, but at least at one time that was the suggestion.

14:56.480 --> 14:56.800
Oh, okay.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.040
I thought that was our secret sauce because it seemed like when we started going by label,

15:01.040 --> 15:03.200
then the bootloader finished installing.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.840
Well, so then we also found out how, you know, learn more about how the grub setup works

15:07.840 --> 15:12.560
in NixOS to go ask it, still write all the config files because we wanted those, but

15:12.560 --> 15:15.600
just don't bother with the part where you go, you know, write the grub magic onto the

15:15.600 --> 15:16.480
physical part of the disk.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.480
And that was the part that was failing.

15:18.480 --> 15:24.160
So then, like, you know, there was no, once we got that little config change, it just

15:24.160 --> 15:24.480
worked.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.640
So that's pretty easy.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.040
They do have a guide, which we could have followed.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.120
But yeah, we did it the painful way.

15:31.120 --> 15:35.520
So instead of doing what we did, we'll have some links in the show notes that will sort

15:35.520 --> 15:39.760
of lay this out if you want to copy it, because I mean, once we figured that out, even though

15:39.760 --> 15:44.240
we kind of we did it a couple of times, we debated like, to be clear, this was like after

15:44.240 --> 15:45.600
the show last weekend.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.800
And so we're kind of just like, how quickly can we get PeerTube back up and going?

15:48.800 --> 15:49.280
Yeah.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.080
Trying to like hazily like remember the last time because we just played with it, right?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.440
We threw the old one away.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.560
We didn't think we needed it again.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.200
Now we were done.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.880
Never going to use that again.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.760
But it was nice because we went down and then we decided, oh, no, let's like start again,

15:59.760 --> 16:00.320
reinstall.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.880
Now we found some like better directions for how we're going to do this.

16:02.880 --> 16:08.720
And since we just had our same configuration.nix file, it was no big deal.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.600
Yeah, that was what was so great is to put that another way is when we were trying to

16:13.600 --> 16:17.440
go through all of this and it didn't work and we were just about like, ah, screw it.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.240
We'll just go, you know, we'll go deploy 2204 or whatever.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.120
It'll be fine.

16:21.120 --> 16:25.760
When we right at that moment, we're like, actually, yeah, if we just grab that configuration

16:25.760 --> 16:28.800
file and we just start over and do it the right way.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.640
Well, all the work was really filling out the config.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.680
It'll just rebuild.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.000
And that is such a great moment with Nix.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.920
It's it's so nice.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.760
And to that end, right after we went through all that manual process of installing it,

16:39.760 --> 16:44.160
like the next day or something, two days later, the new version of Nix came out with a graphical

16:44.160 --> 16:45.440
installer, ironically.

16:46.160 --> 16:50.320
So we tried it out for the Linux Action News and I put it on my ThinkPad that we were doing

16:50.320 --> 16:52.400
the BcashFS testing on a couple of weeks ago.

16:53.440 --> 16:58.560
And I left it on there and I started using it over the weekend, just kind of filling

16:58.560 --> 16:59.920
out that configuration file.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.160
And it's the same thing as a test over the weekend.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.440
I just blew the whole thing away.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.800
I dropped the configuration file back on there and rebuilt the whole system.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.560
And it's amazing.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.880
And I have everything in that file I need to work on my applications, my Flatpak support,

17:12.880 --> 17:15.040
my tail scale stuff, everything.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.240
And I like having it in one file.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.480
I know I could do includes.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.520
I don't want to.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.240
I don't want to, Wes.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.600
I like having it all in one file.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.960
I love it that way.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.440
And I wasn't really sure when we took the Nix challenge a bit ago how Nix would be on

17:27.440 --> 17:27.840
the desktop.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.280
I was solely focused on the server.

17:29.280 --> 17:29.840
Totally.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.400
Oh, oh, it's so good on the desktop.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.480
It turns out for a certain kind of like, I just want this thing to always work.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.960
Like on my ThinkPad, I want to raise the screen and get to work.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.200
Maybe it's not you're like tinkering, constantly fiddling with your setup or something, but

17:45.200 --> 17:45.680
on a machine.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.080
Yeah, right.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.640
You're just like, I want a few plugins installed.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.680
I want to configure a couple of things and then just be playing.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.360
You can even declare the Nome extensions you want a little plain with fire in case there's

17:55.360 --> 17:57.440
a Nome update, but I think that's pretty great.

17:57.440 --> 18:02.480
And then last but not least, and I'm sure this is true with Silverblue as well, what

18:02.480 --> 18:08.000
really seals the deal and bridges the gap from like a 90% solution to a 100% solution

18:08.000 --> 18:08.800
for me is Flatpak.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.440
So when you have Flatpak on NixOS, I've declared like all of my core system in the configuration

18:15.440 --> 18:18.320
file and that's incredibly powerful.

18:18.320 --> 18:22.000
But then like, if I want to just rando try something, there's almost always a Flatpak

18:22.000 --> 18:26.480
of it now and I can just throw it on my system with Flatpak and that also works.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.680
But between Flatpak and more, you know, the server world of containers, obviously Flatpak

18:31.680 --> 18:32.880
uses the same sort of primitives.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.240
Yeah, right.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.320
We've got we've got these nice escape hatches now that you really can have a really locked

18:38.320 --> 18:42.320
down set up sort of base system and then put some stuff on as you see fit.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.160
So if you haven't heard the news, if you haven't listened to Linux action is from last week,

18:47.120 --> 18:54.480
the latest version of NixOS with the either the Gnome or the Plasma ISOs has the was

18:54.480 --> 18:56.480
it Climaris, is that how we say it?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.480
Colomaris, I don't know.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.840
But it's a really well known distro agnostic installer.

19:01.840 --> 19:06.960
If you've used Manjaro or Endeavor OS or lots of distros out there, you've actually used

19:06.960 --> 19:13.200
this installer before and we we were both really impressed with the implementation.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.200
We weren't sure how that would port to something like Nix.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.680
No, you know, just because here's a sure it's set up to be multi distro and have plugins

19:19.680 --> 19:23.200
and have some extensibility built in, but even when you're supporting multiple distros,

19:23.200 --> 19:26.960
like how many of those distros are set up like NixOS, you know, it's kind of a unique

19:26.960 --> 19:26.960
set up.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.880
So can can you work with that framework to actually marry those two things?

19:30.880 --> 19:33.920
Because there's a bunch of different, you know, the process and the set up is different.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.360
You got to hook into the next system.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.880
But what's so neat about that is like once you've learned a little bit about Nix enough

19:38.880 --> 19:43.440
to go like read some Nix slang files, you just go look at like you can just go look

19:43.440 --> 19:48.080
at the MR adding this feature and see exactly all the patches and what had to change and

19:48.080 --> 19:49.680
how the modules fit together.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.920
It's so cool.

19:53.920 --> 19:59.040
Linode.com slash unplugged go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and

19:59.040 --> 20:00.480
you go there to support this show.

20:01.360 --> 20:06.160
This show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsors offers and Linode is one that

20:06.160 --> 20:10.400
I am totally on board with endorsing because we have built so much of our infrastructure

20:10.400 --> 20:10.880
on Linode.

20:10.880 --> 20:16.080
It's one of these sponsors where I have just spent hours and hours and hours using their

20:16.080 --> 20:16.960
platform.

20:16.960 --> 20:22.160
I can tell in those hours that this is something that has been iterated and approved on for

20:22.160 --> 20:22.960
years.

20:22.960 --> 20:29.760
You know, Linode started nearly 19 years ago before AWS was a twinkle in Bezos's eye and

20:29.760 --> 20:32.160
their mission has remained unchanged since all of that.

20:33.360 --> 20:38.080
Even with all of these other crazy competitors coming on board jacked up with their VC funds,

20:38.080 --> 20:42.480
Linode has focused on making cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all.

20:42.480 --> 20:47.760
This has led to the best in class experience with performance, with configuration options

20:48.320 --> 20:49.280
and with support.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.880
Literally Linode can provide a level of support that the hyperscalers are just not designed

20:54.880 --> 20:55.680
for.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.200
And you can really see what I'm talking about when you go to Linode.com slash unplugged

20:59.200 --> 21:00.480
and you get that $100.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.800
And you know, they've got one click system.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.240
Say you want to deploy something just super quick and get up and going like a next cloud

21:06.240 --> 21:07.280
or a Jitsi or lots.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.840
I mean, there's those are the ones I always mentioned because those are the ones I have

21:09.840 --> 21:10.400
deployed.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.880
But there's so many in what they call their marketplace.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.600
But it's also really great for those of you who are cooking with gas.

21:18.400 --> 21:24.560
You know, maybe you use Terraform or Kubernetes and to that end, Linode has a free ebook

21:24.560 --> 21:28.480
they've put out Decorative Cloud Infrastructure Management with Terraform.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.520
It's a book that covers infrastructure as code, covers a lot about Terraform specifically

21:33.520 --> 21:41.440
and they talk about the unique aspects of Linode's Kubernetes engine and Terraform that

21:41.440 --> 21:46.320
let you import your existing infrastructure into Terraform and do things that are really

21:46.320 --> 21:47.120
next level.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.280
I've only really begun to understand the power of this, but now I really understand

21:51.280 --> 21:53.280
why some of you out there like this kind of stuff.

21:53.280 --> 21:54.400
Linode's all about it.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.640
Plus, they got 11 data centers around the world.

21:56.640 --> 22:01.840
They are their own ISP, S3 compatible object storage, which is just killer.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.280
DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper

22:07.280 --> 22:09.120
than those major cloud hyperscalers.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.120
It's pretty great and the best customer support in the business and it's a great

22:13.120 --> 22:14.560
way to support the show.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.360
Go build something.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.800

22:32.160 --> 22:35.520
Brent, you kind of surprised, I think, both Chris and myself this week when you let on

22:35.520 --> 22:39.600
that you've still been running Tumbleweed on your laptop.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.080
I kind of totally, unfortunately, I'll admit it here.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.600
It's my bad, but I kind of just forgot, you know, we engaged in the Tumbleweed world.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.440
I got very distracted by NixOS, but you, you kept on the path.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.480
He stuck with it and sounds like it kind of went sideways, maybe, at least most recently.

22:54.480 --> 23:00.800
I remember I think it was, well, it's actually Linux unplugged 4.3.2 when we did the Tumbleweed

23:00.800 --> 23:04.640
kind of the three of us tried a bunch of different ways of playing with it.

23:05.200 --> 23:09.520
And I remember distinctly making a promise in there, which was that I would

23:09.520 --> 23:12.720
continue using it and we would do an update at some point.

23:12.720 --> 23:19.120
Now, I did not plan for that to be this week, but it seemed like a natural, natural thing

23:19.120 --> 23:23.360
to do, considering I ran into a few little issues that I thought I would discuss.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.880
Uh oh.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.960
Yeah, it's like Tumbleweed tribulations.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.800
The weeds of Tumbleweed.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.560
Okay, let me give you a little context, I guess is fair.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.600
I have a laptop that I use, you know, every single day.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.760
It's not running Tumbleweed.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.240
It's running something else.

23:40.240 --> 23:47.040
But I do have a podcasting laptop that its sole purpose is just to make sure my voice

23:47.040 --> 23:51.280
sounds great and records everything and connects with you guys, you know, once, twice, three

23:51.280 --> 23:54.800
times a week, and it's kind of the podcasting appliance.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.640
And that one is running Tumbleweed.

23:56.640 --> 24:00.480
Ah, so you're putting the most risk over there.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.760
Yeah, okay.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.400
I know.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.960
Well, if you remember correctly, during that episode way back, I think it was November,

24:06.960 --> 24:11.120
actually did our episode recorded it on that laptop, even though it was the first time

24:11.120 --> 24:12.640
that we were kind of getting familiar with it.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.520
So it was a little risky.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.920
And, you know, I like risk.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.680
So I stayed with it.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.560
And it's been great.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.400
All right, now, that being said, it's been an appliance.

24:22.400 --> 24:27.440
So I haven't really treated it maybe the way I should treat a rolling release.

24:27.440 --> 24:32.800
Christ, I know in the past, you've got caught with this with with Arch, but I never updated

24:32.800 --> 24:33.920
it since November.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Brent.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.840
It's going to be quite a few months since November now.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.880
That's not how rolling distros are supposed to work, Brent.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.040
And I know better as well.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.680
But it ended up being kind of fun.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.720
It's going to be a new thing.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.760
And you were traveling too.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.400
I mean, there's all kinds of excuses you probably could come up with, I imagine.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.040
Yeah, I've got I got many of them that I'm telling myself.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.640
It started as a really simple thing, because this thing just runs and I never have any

24:58.640 --> 24:59.840
issues with it.

24:59.840 --> 25:04.800
But I tried to use it for a different purpose, which was I tried to use cheese, if you guys

25:04.800 --> 25:08.960
are familiar with cheese, just to do a little video with some audio of me playing the drums

25:08.960 --> 25:12.320
over here that are on my right and ran into like a small issue.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.400
And I was like, Oh, well, I'll just, you know, I'll just update and reboot and everything

25:16.400 --> 25:17.120
will be fine.

25:17.120 --> 25:21.120
I was like, Oh, yeah, I haven't updated this ever.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.960
And it turned out to be slightly problematic.

25:24.960 --> 25:33.040
So it wanted to do updates of like 2300 packages, which yeah, I guess makes sense.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.560
Like two gigs worth of stuff.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.120
Wow.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.600
Like a Brent's offended by this.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.480
Don't give me all these.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.600
Why so many packages?

25:40.480 --> 25:43.680
Geez, how dare you bring me to the current state?

25:43.680 --> 25:50.080
It was an interesting experiment, because I've, you know, run enter goes enter goes

25:50.080 --> 25:55.840
before, thanks to the, you know, the arch challenge, Chris, that you enabled way back.

25:57.120 --> 26:02.800
And I just got sort of cozy again with the rolling lifestyle.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.920
You know, every once in a while, something breaks, and you have to dig in and you can't

26:05.920 --> 26:10.560
really schedule this, you just kind of have to be okay with it and solve some issue and

26:10.560 --> 26:13.520
stay up later than you want to and learn a bunch along the way.

26:13.520 --> 26:20.640
And I think this time, really, what I learned was the power of zipper and how nice its interface

26:20.640 --> 26:21.280
is.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.040
At first, when I was solving this, and I was trying to play drums, I just wanted to quickly

26:25.040 --> 26:25.680
record something.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.800
I just use discover to try to do the updates.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.560
And it was, hmm, let's say problematic.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.720
So it threw like 20 errors, which I thought, no, that's not great.

26:36.720 --> 26:42.160
And some dependency resolution errors, which I don't think discover is built to solve.

26:42.160 --> 26:48.000
And then it started asking me for pseudo privileges for every single package thereafter that actually

26:48.000 --> 26:48.560
works.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
And there's 2000 packages, right?

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
I remember this in our chat.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.160
You're like, nope, this is where I'm out.

26:54.160 --> 26:54.720
I'm out.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.080
Shouldn't have chosen a really, really long secure password there, Brent.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.560
So using discover is not typically my way of doing upgrades.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.920
But I just forgot to remember zipper.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.800
It had been, you know, since November that we talked about it.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.160
So I dug into our show notes, and I remembered all of these things.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.440
And it turned out zipper was far more helpful, as you might imagine.

27:17.440 --> 27:22.240
It gave some really helpful tips, like it suggested, oh, wait, you got all these updates.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.960
But actually, you want to run a different command.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.680
So it said, consider canceling, right at the bottom.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.720
It said, consider canceling.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.960
You have to sort of use a different command to update the entire OS.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.480
I was like, oh, that's so helpful.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.440
It was really great.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.600
So it was like, no, no, run zipper, you know, disrupt, right?

27:39.600 --> 27:43.120
And I was like, oh, that is nice.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.640
So I decided to do that.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.080
And those 21 problems showed up with some helpful solutions and stuff.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.600
So I was able to get through those.

27:49.600 --> 27:55.840
They ended up being some like vendor change problems, which I think is sort of normal.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.400
I'm not sure.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.840
I'm not that familiar with it.

27:57.840 --> 28:02.160
I did install the like codecs, multimedia codecs.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.600
So I think it might have something to do with that.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.400
I did some research.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.040
Some people were talking about is really helpful.

28:07.040 --> 28:13.440
Like my research was very short because I was able to search for exactly the error errors

28:13.440 --> 28:14.800
and they came up right away.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.520
So it was really nice to see that the community was on top of this stuff pretty quickly.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.400
I did find Neil in there somewhere sharing comments as well about how things were working

28:24.400 --> 28:25.040
and not working.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.520
So it was nice to see some familiar faces.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.640
So thanks, Neil.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.640
So I got through all those errors pretty smoothly, which I thought was wonderful.

28:32.640 --> 28:38.400
And the process that Zipper offered to solve those was equally nice.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.040
So I stayed in a fairly good mood for that.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.840
So I was finally able to get through the upgrades.

28:43.840 --> 28:48.240
There was some stuff that stood out to me that I thought you guys might find was interesting.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.600
There were 20 vendor changes.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.240
Like I mentioned, two packages wanted to be downgraded, which I didn't expect.

28:54.880 --> 29:01.360
And two packages also wanted to change architecture, which I don't think is a good thing.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.920
Yeah, unless they're going from 32 to 64, possibly.

29:03.920 --> 29:08.640
It looks like in this case, it's going from being explicitly labeled x86-64 to no arch.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.160
So is it maybe just that those packages no longer have a strict requirement on that?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.000
Or there's just no 32 option anymore.

29:14.000 --> 29:14.720
Yeah.

29:14.720 --> 29:19.920
So that's where my mind went was either that's totally fine and I can just safely ignore it

29:19.920 --> 29:21.360
or it's going to be very bad.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.520
And I thought, this is great show content.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.880
So I'm just going to go for it.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.040
Fair enough.

29:27.040 --> 29:27.920
I like the way you think.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.520
Right.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.960
You've trained me well, sir.

29:30.960 --> 29:31.600
It went fine.

29:31.600 --> 29:35.520
I ended up with one last error that I haven't solved yet.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.200
And it's nice because they offer, you know, Zipper offers solutions.

29:39.200 --> 29:45.040
So I have some issue that I've described that I won't get into here.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.600
You know, it has like solution one, deinstall that package.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.760
Solution two, keep the obsolete package.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.440
Solution three, break it and ignore its dependencies.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.920
So it's at least nice it's trying to solve the room.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.680
I don't know which one of those is supposed to be good.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.360
I'm just going to ignore the whole thing.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.720
But it was super great.

30:02.720 --> 30:07.840
Zipper with its like extra verbose information was just fabulous.

30:07.840 --> 30:12.560
So and it color codes like the warnings that are like pretty critical seeming are red.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.720
And the ones that are like, well, these are just maybe warning.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.600
They're yellow.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.640
And it's just super nice.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.400
So if someone wants to try that, I think it was a pretty good time.

30:21.120 --> 30:27.920
But it brought me to remembering the whole rolling release lifestyle.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.680
Do you remember what that's like?

30:29.680 --> 30:32.080
I feel like you're describing a worse version.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.400
I mean, because the rolling lifestyle you update.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.160
You just pick your update time.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.480
You know, you have to have a little care about it.

30:40.480 --> 30:44.560
Yeah, you're kind of like the maniac at the right time.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.120
For sure.

30:45.120 --> 30:51.760
And but I do remember when I was, you know, more regularly using sort of a arch base as

30:51.760 --> 30:55.200
my everyday, you know, you get into, you know, an arch.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.480
I don't know how this happens.

30:56.480 --> 31:01.280
But then you end up wanting to, like, update five, six, 20 times a day.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.480
Feels good to type SYU.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.120
There's something about it.

31:03.120 --> 31:03.680
I've seen Alex.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.280
Every time he sits at his computer, he does that.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.160
It's crazy.

31:06.160 --> 31:10.080
It felt like these were the exact kind of problems I used to run into on a not daily

31:10.080 --> 31:12.080
basis, but you just randomly sort of run into them.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.160
So I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or or whatever.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.440
But it also has taught me a heck of a lot.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.920
You know, a lot of the skills that I've learned was trying to troubleshoot some of this stuff.

31:21.920 --> 31:27.600
So I think I've at least with these experiences that I've got under my belt, I've come to

31:27.600 --> 31:33.280
the conclusion that the rolling release lifestyle is great because you get the updated software.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.280
You get to play with new stuff like, you know, pipewire comes out pretty darn fast and all

31:37.280 --> 31:38.720
the new stuff you can play with.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.720
From that perspective, it's awesome.

31:40.720 --> 31:43.680
The community tends to be also quite great.

31:43.680 --> 31:48.320
You know, if you run into an issue typically within an hour or less, someone's already

31:48.320 --> 31:49.040
talking about it.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.040
That I found really great.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.320
Is there a but coming here?

31:52.320 --> 31:59.680
Well, it just gets me pondering because you also have lots of unplanned learning and maintenance.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.560
And I think maybe I'm at a point now where I don't really appreciate that.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.120
And I wondered how you guys feel about that.

32:07.120 --> 32:12.080
That's interesting because that was going to be my observation is you kind of have to

32:12.080 --> 32:15.040
be and it seems like you successfully did it, though, but you kind of have to be willing

32:15.040 --> 32:19.040
to convert a real pain in your butt into a learning opportunity.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.840
And you kind of have to keep your head about it and work your way through it.

32:21.840 --> 32:26.160
Because I know my initial reaction these days is when there's a whole bunch of package issues

32:26.160 --> 32:28.960
and I'm like, screw this, I'm out and I'll just wipe it.

32:28.960 --> 32:33.120
But with Seuss in particular, when we were trying tumbleweed, I stuck with it when I

32:33.120 --> 32:34.640
had an issue so that way I could try to learn it.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.720
And I do think it was beneficial, but you have to.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.680
It's a mindset thing.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.120
Well, I know it's true, right?

32:39.120 --> 32:40.480
There's that sort of trade off.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.800
You certainly you could switch back to, you know, LTS, Brent's LTS lifestyle.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.880
But then you what what kind of cadence do you want for upgrades and you kind of have

32:48.880 --> 32:54.720
to figure out you want the do you want lots of small changes or less frequent big changes?

32:54.720 --> 32:58.560
Because this could be a story of sort of like, oh, gosh, the new Ubuntu is really different

32:58.560 --> 33:00.480
now and I'm getting some pipeline or whatever.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.080
And then your whole system isn't working for the weekend as you refigure that out.

33:04.080 --> 33:04.560
Yeah.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.600
And there is leap.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.240
There is leap.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.200
That is true.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.160
That is true.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.440
Maybe that's worth considering.

33:09.440 --> 33:09.920
Hmm.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.000
Well, I think it's worth me sticking with this because then we can, you know,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.120
see where it goes in another six months.

33:18.080 --> 33:18.960
That's the real question.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.200
Yeah.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.600
I mean, you're connected today, so it must be working right now.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.320
I think it's working.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.840
It's working, right?

33:23.840 --> 33:25.280
As far as I can tell, yeah.

33:25.280 --> 33:29.680
You know, at the back of my mind the whole time, I was remembering that ButterFS is just

33:29.680 --> 33:34.720
baked in by default and that I can just roll back if I totally went down the wrong path

33:34.720 --> 33:35.520
and try something else.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.680
So I think you're going to have to try that for the show.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.160
Yeah.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.920
Maybe I should try harder to screw it up.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.680
But that insurance was really nice, too.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.840
So that's one of the things that can mitigate, right, the unplanned nature.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.800
Because if you're sort of like, oh, I wanted to do an upgrade, but I'm also about to go

33:48.800 --> 33:49.280
traveling.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.000
I don't have time to fix this because I needed to go download my podcast for the flight

33:52.000 --> 33:52.880
or whatever, right?

33:52.880 --> 33:54.640
And you can just be like, nope, old one.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.920
I'll deal with this later.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.720
Very good point.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.440
I did notice in OpenSUSE's news section, they had a community annual survey that came out,

34:01.440 --> 34:02.720
I guess, a few months ago now.

34:03.360 --> 34:09.040
And they did mention that most people who took the survey recommend OpenSUSE distributions

34:09.040 --> 34:10.240
for advanced users.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.760
And they least recommended for new users.

34:13.760 --> 34:18.800
So at least users are thoughtful in how they're recommending these things.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.840
That's interesting.

34:19.840 --> 34:24.560
That's interesting because don't you think YAS is sort of trying to appeal to a new user?

34:24.560 --> 34:26.240
I mean, I do think I kind of agree.

34:26.960 --> 34:31.760
But when I think of SUSE, I think of a distribution that's trying to cater to people that have

34:31.760 --> 34:33.840
never had to configure a Linux machine, too.

34:33.840 --> 34:34.320
Yeah, it's true.

34:34.320 --> 34:38.640
But I wonder if that's not necessarily new user and it's like differently competent computer

34:38.640 --> 34:39.200
user.

34:39.200 --> 34:43.040
Because I feel like you'd need to also understand how to configure, say, Windows for that to

34:43.040 --> 34:44.320
be super useful out of the gate.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.320
And probably the same people who aren't into configuring computers at all.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.840
It's not like YAS is suddenly going to be.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.920
I mean, it is better than figuring out the command line, perhaps.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.520
But it's still a complicated system if you don't understand the basic of how your system

34:55.520 --> 34:56.000
works.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.640
Yeah, that's probably where I was when I first started trying it.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.040
And I was used to managing a Windows system.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.800
Yeah, one of the quotes from the survey results I thought packed it up pretty nicely.

35:04.800 --> 35:10.400
It said the distribution was easy to use and were held in high regard, especially for the

35:10.400 --> 35:15.280
core uses of the server with web hosting, databases, containers and virtualization.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.480
So I think if you're in the world already, go try it.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.200
You're going to be fine.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.880
But if you don't really know what Linux is and you're just getting into it, this is not

35:22.880 --> 35:23.760
the place for you.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.040
So you're going to stick with it, though?

35:25.040 --> 35:25.680
Yeah, I don't know.

35:25.680 --> 35:26.560
This seems exciting.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.400
Otherwise, it's been totally fine and very fun to use.

35:30.400 --> 35:35.920
So yeah, unless someone has a better idea for me to go down some rabbit hole, I'm willing

35:35.920 --> 35:36.560
to hear about it.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.360
Linux subplug dot com slash contact.

35:39.360 --> 35:39.760
I like it.

35:39.760 --> 35:43.360
You know, we kind of had to give up the whole Arch updates on the air, but now we can rent

35:43.360 --> 35:44.080
us as Dumbleweed.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.160
Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

35:50.160 --> 35:54.480
Go get started for free at Bitwarden dot com slash Linux for an individual user or start

35:54.480 --> 35:56.320
a trial for your team or enterprise.

35:56.320 --> 36:02.160
Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses and individuals to store, share and sync sensitive

36:02.160 --> 36:02.880
data.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.920
It's fully customizable.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.800
You can turn off features in your enterprise with policies you don't want.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.920
It's built on open source.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.360
So, you know, I love it and trust it.

36:09.360 --> 36:14.080
And it has a huge community around it, including a big self-hosting community.

36:14.080 --> 36:18.320
It's what Wes and I use to manage all of our passwords, our two factor code tokens and

36:18.320 --> 36:20.480
other sensitive data like recovery keys.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.160
Some apps these days require things beyond just a password to recover, get back into

36:24.160 --> 36:24.320
them.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.600
And one of the things that I really like is how they keep iterating the experience and

36:27.600 --> 36:28.480
making it better and better.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.000
You guys know I'm all about that.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
It's like do something, do it really well and then just focus on that and make it better.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.320
And that's why when they added username generators, I was like, heck, yes.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.600
But now, now it's even better.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.920
Now, when you use Bitwarden to generate your username and a password, it'll also tie in

36:45.920 --> 36:50.640
with simple login or a non Addy or something like Firefox Relay.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.800
You enter your API key for one of those services and how it'll generate an email address.

36:54.800 --> 37:00.720
So you're getting a username, password and email address that is unique just to that

37:00.720 --> 37:03.040
account, just to that service, just there.

37:03.040 --> 37:03.440
Right.

37:03.440 --> 37:08.560
So if something happens, if the worst thing happens and their passwords get leaked, you're

37:08.560 --> 37:09.040
good.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.600
They didn't even get your email address.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.960
This is brilliant.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.640
And this is what I'm talking about is a Bitwarden user.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.560
I've noticed it just keeps getting better and better.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.600
I've been a user for a couple of years and it's just great.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.160
On Android, they've just now added quick account switching.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.520
When you're at the password fill out screen, you just tap your user icon, switch over to

37:25.520 --> 37:27.600
your other account, maybe like, you know, for your business stuff.

37:28.560 --> 37:32.400
They're adding features all the time to that are great for businesses and individuals who

37:32.400 --> 37:34.240
like to just self-sovereign it.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.760
You know, like, I appreciate that, that they can walk that line and they do it so well

37:37.760 --> 37:39.680
and they contribute back upstream to make it possible.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.320
It's easy to get started with Bitwarden, too.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.040
That's the best thing.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.920
You might even import your existing password database.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.960
It did mine.

37:46.960 --> 37:51.520
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux, try it out for yourself, for your business, or more

37:51.520 --> 37:55.600
than likely, maybe you have a friend or a family member or a colleague that needs to

37:55.600 --> 37:57.520
just do a little bit better with their passwords.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.320
I legit can't tell you how many people I've seen to store their passwords on a sticky

38:02.320 --> 38:03.680
note under the keyboard.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.880
If that's you or you know somebody that's doing that, stop right now and go to bitwarden.com

38:08.880 --> 38:09.760
slash Linux.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.840
Support the show and try it out for free.

38:11.840 --> 38:17.280
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.760
As usual, we got some great boosts this week.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.720
They just seem to be getting better and better all the time.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.600
And now it is time for the boost.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.320
Silver Koala wrote in four days ago with 5000 sats.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.560
First time trying the Breeze app.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.760
Simple, easy to use.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.440
First impressions are that it's easier and less buggy than Fountain.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.080
Nice.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.520
So Breeze is a lightning storefront in your phone, basically.

38:43.520 --> 38:49.840
It's a lightning wallet that runs a lightning node, so you are all 100% self-contained,

38:49.840 --> 38:53.520
and it can connect to our podcast feed and you can send a boost in without having to

38:53.520 --> 38:54.480
switch podcast apps.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.680
Convenient.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.880
Double boost.

38:58.240 --> 39:02.320
Silver Koala also wrote in again four days ago with 5000 sats.

39:02.320 --> 39:06.000
I've noticed that Breeze app also has limited notes like Fountain.

39:06.000 --> 39:06.880
Yeah, I like this.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.320
I like you can send a little note in there.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.720
I think it's like 300 characters or something like that.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.400
Just fine by me.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.560
See, I interpreted that to mean limited notes, i.e. not our full show notes show up.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.040
Remember?

39:17.040 --> 39:18.160
Oh, you're right.

39:18.160 --> 39:22.080
This sounds like an issue tracker kind of boost to me.

39:22.080 --> 39:22.880
Okay, all right.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.520
We can add that.

39:23.520 --> 39:27.440
I think I wouldn't count on Breeze having all the notes, though, you know, but Fountain,

39:27.440 --> 39:28.560
we got to get on that.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.360
It's all part of figuring things out in the relationship.

39:31.360 --> 39:36.160
Yeah, well, speaking of 412 Linux boosted in five days ago with 500 sats with some

39:36.160 --> 39:40.480
feedback on, you know, the whole members feed stuff and video live.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.360
We asked for that.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.400
So let's have it.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.920
Well, 412 Linux has been listening to the live feed since its availability.

39:45.920 --> 39:46.800
Hey, that's awesome.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.920
Really enjoys it.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.040
Multitask while listening.

39:49.040 --> 39:52.800
So video is not that important, but it is nice occasionally to, you know, pop in and

39:52.800 --> 39:54.640
watch the video or for special occasion.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.920
Something you mentioned there, Chris.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.320
Mm hmm.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.040
Part two.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.160
I do like when you include small bits about the sponsors in the live feed.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.760
I like that I don't have to listen to the whole ad, but I get to know the sponsor in

40:03.760 --> 40:04.960
special deals or info.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.160
Thanks for the show.

40:06.160 --> 40:06.800
You know what?

40:06.800 --> 40:07.920
We have the best members ever.

40:07.920 --> 40:12.080
I mean, so 412, thank you for being a member and then for boosting on top of that.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.320
You are you are great.

40:14.320 --> 40:21.760
So thank you very much for that user 609 to six days ago, boosted in with 5000 sats.

40:21.760 --> 40:27.200
Yes, this one was about the Intel software defined CPU that we covered.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.760
And a lot of people had thoughts on that.

40:29.760 --> 40:35.600
And user 609 wrote, is Intel underestimating the risk of geeks managing to crack their

40:35.600 --> 40:36.400
processors?

40:36.400 --> 40:41.360
I'm not condoning or promoting this, but surely buying a processor for 100 bucks and

40:41.360 --> 40:46.000
ending up with an equivalent $400 model is very tempting.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.920
And I could see disgruntled Linux users giving some direct feedback on what they think of

40:49.920 --> 40:51.520
this business model.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.520
Do you guys think you think it's possible people could figure out ways to hack this?

40:55.520 --> 40:58.560
You know, I'm sure Intel has tried not to make that happen.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.080
And you got to get past some of the crypto stuff.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.240
But probably the most, you know, realistic way is like all these things, right?

41:04.240 --> 41:05.120
There's a mistake somewhere.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.480
You can take advantage of it.

41:06.480 --> 41:10.960
That said, I imagine that's somewhat less of a concern if like perhaps the enterprise

41:10.960 --> 41:14.800
or data center market or some of the things there is more where they're thinking for this.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.720
I don't know that us, you know, retail consumers are really going to be the people paying to

41:18.720 --> 41:19.680
enable the features.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.480
Maybe it'll go that way.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.280
I hope not.

41:21.280 --> 41:25.280
We were speculating in the pre show that this could be years away.

41:25.280 --> 41:30.080
Like if Intel is trying to get it upstream into 518 now, it might be years before we

41:30.080 --> 41:34.400
see a product that uses this because perhaps they want to get it into something like REL.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.480
So that way, when they do ship an enterprise product that uses the software to find features.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.960
Distributions like REL and Debian already have the feature set.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.840
And if that's the case, we're looking at years of not knowing.

41:45.840 --> 41:49.840
But one of the things I'm trying to figure out, and we talked about how this mechanism

41:49.840 --> 41:54.880
works, I'm trying to figure out how the mechanism is going to verify that you're going to

41:54.880 --> 41:58.880
verify that your authorization files, your licenses to do this, to activate these features.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.280
How does it figure out it's valid?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.320
There's two mechanisms.

42:02.320 --> 42:06.720
There's a feature that gets enabled and there's a file that's the license to enable that feature.

42:07.280 --> 42:11.440
And what prevents me from taking that license file off of my file system and giving it to

42:11.440 --> 42:15.200
Wes and him putting on his file system and having that feature?

42:15.200 --> 42:16.560
Maybe there is something I'm missing.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.320
Maybe it's more complicated than that.

42:18.320 --> 42:22.400
Or maybe there's some sort of cloud activation aspect to this as well that we haven't heard

42:22.400 --> 42:25.040
about yet that wouldn't be revealed in their code to the kernel.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.000
Yeah, right.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.520
We just kind of know about the interface, not necessarily what user space thing is going

42:29.520 --> 42:33.920
to be talking to the kernel and loading these various things into the capabilities.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.000
Boost.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.080
Marcel wrote in six days ago with 1969 SATs.

42:40.640 --> 42:45.200
Chris, have you figured out if there's anything, any special meaning to that number?

42:45.200 --> 42:46.640
That feels like a birthday.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.160
Or just a really great year?

42:48.160 --> 42:49.680
Yeah, feels like a year to me.

42:49.680 --> 42:50.720
1969.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.440
That's how I read it.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.520
Good music that year, I think, if I remember.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.400
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

42:55.040 --> 42:55.840
They're right.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.320
I'm very anti-SDSI.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.200
But let's remember Intel is responsible here, not Linux.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.400
Why should the kernel get flack for implementing this feature?

43:04.400 --> 43:04.960
You're right.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.320
Linux is about freedom.

43:06.320 --> 43:11.600
With this feature, you're free to use the horrible model of Intel's, which you couldn't

43:11.600 --> 43:12.160
before.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.600
Linux is not restricting you.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.720
Intel is.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.920
They didn't support it.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.760
I think it wouldn't change anything.

43:17.760 --> 43:23.200
We just have kernel patches rolling around, and it would be worse for everyone involved.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.800
Vote with your wallet.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.160
Yeah, point there.

43:26.160 --> 43:29.280
Yeah, I think the kernel community has kind of learned that people are going to do it

43:29.280 --> 43:29.760
anyway.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.040
So maybe this helps.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.000
No, Marcel's right.

43:32.720 --> 43:38.560
Last week, I was just saying, should we, as a community, try to act as a last line of

43:38.560 --> 43:39.440
defense for this?

43:39.440 --> 43:40.960
And it would start with the kernel community.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.320
But Marcel's right.

43:42.320 --> 43:47.040
It's like, OK, if you do it for Intel, then you've got to do it for so many other hardware

43:47.040 --> 43:48.000
devices.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.120
Where do we draw the line?

43:49.120 --> 43:53.680
You know, it does occur to me 1969 was right before the start of the old Unix epoch.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.560
That could be it.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.600
Let us know, Marcel.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.200
That could be it.

43:57.200 --> 44:03.440
Mage also wrote in via the feedback at linuxunplug.com slash contact on the same topic.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.920
They write CPU as a service.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.160
Say hello to the next generation from ransomware.

44:08.160 --> 44:14.000
That's a nice compute slash virtualization cluster slash database CRP you've got there.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.960
Would be a shame if virtualization and extra CPU cores were disabled until you paid us.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.240
That would be a shame.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.400
That's the enterprise use case I'm thinking of.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.320
It's funny to kind of pitch it as ransomware.

44:24.320 --> 44:27.920
Like you have something on your computer, but you can't unlock it until you pay us.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.800
There is like there is a little bit of that.

44:30.800 --> 44:36.800
All right, I'll take this next one because this was a special triple boost by the Golden

44:36.800 --> 44:37.120
Dragon.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.640
I didn't know that was even possible.

44:38.640 --> 44:44.640
Totally in 2000 sats, Golden Dragon was boosting along as they listened in the pre-show.

44:45.280 --> 44:51.520
They speculated that this system D stuff may play out fairly interesting to observe and

44:51.520 --> 44:54.000
wondered if it would work well on a system like Arch.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.120
And the system D feature they're talking about is building in the AB system updating mechanism

44:59.120 --> 45:03.600
into system D. And you know, you hear what Brent just went through, maybe.

45:03.600 --> 45:08.800
Because right now, SUSE is accomplishing that with file system technology and things like

45:08.800 --> 45:10.160
Snapper sitting on top of that.

45:10.160 --> 45:14.320
But wouldn't it be interesting if system D could manage some of that AB system switching

45:14.320 --> 45:14.800
for them?

45:14.800 --> 45:17.840
I could see that being nice and the sort of unification factor is a few, you know, more

45:17.840 --> 45:21.040
distros have have that functionality and it worked similarly across them.

45:21.040 --> 45:21.760
That could be neat.

45:22.640 --> 45:29.360
Keeping up with the triple boost in B-O-O-S-T on SDSI, I'm mostly an opponent of DRM.

45:29.360 --> 45:34.080
So this seems like an anti-consumer move, locking parts of the experience behind a paywall

45:34.080 --> 45:39.200
just reads the same as when the gaming industry went to full downloadable content and day

45:39.200 --> 45:40.080
one patches.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.960
Yeah, I remember that world.

45:42.960 --> 45:48.160
Who knows what the lengths Intel is willing to go to on this want to overclock pay us

45:48.160 --> 45:54.160
virtualization pay us virtualization would be really, you know, like these low end consumer

45:54.160 --> 45:55.840
devices that just can't do the same thing.

45:55.840 --> 46:00.160
And it would just suck to from the Linux perspective of, you know, like we're so used to assuming

46:00.160 --> 46:03.360
that, like you get this OS and you get all the you get all these things, you know, maybe

46:03.360 --> 46:07.440
it's not the most performant version or whatever, but like you can do it more limitations would

46:07.440 --> 46:08.000
be lame.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.480
A lot of people wrote in this is a common thread on Matrix two about the resale market.

46:13.520 --> 46:17.920
How is this going to mess with the resale market, especially if Westpain buys the features

46:17.920 --> 46:19.200
it's licensed to Westpain's Intel account.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.040
Yeah, it's licensed to me or the chip or.

46:21.040 --> 46:21.600
Yeah.

46:21.600 --> 46:26.080
And does it make the resale market just totally screwed like you got a you had an $800 value

46:26.080 --> 46:31.120
computer, but when you sell it and the features get deactivated, now it's only a $600 computer

46:31.120 --> 46:32.480
because the CPU doesn't do it.

46:32.480 --> 46:35.760
But that's why it makes sense to have an ongoing subscription cost that way.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.080
You know, that's why when you're done with it, you don't have to keep paying for it.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.320
Just make it part of your Intel plus subscription.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
Oh, man, I hope not.

46:43.840 --> 46:44.800
Oh, geez.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.520
I think the resale market was the aspect I didn't think of the most.

46:47.520 --> 46:53.040
During the show that we got the most feedback on to here's the last boost that came in from

46:53.040 --> 46:54.800
the Golden Dragon, although they said quad.

46:54.800 --> 46:58.880
I saw three boosts, but they invoked the cone of silence for this one.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.160
So this is private.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.280
The cone of silence.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.400
That's just for us.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.200
Come on in here.

47:07.200 --> 47:07.600
They're right.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.200
I might have a slight boost addiction.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.320
So let's just try to move right past this.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.000
The cone of silence.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.080
He writes, I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show and I'm glad to be able to help out

47:18.080 --> 47:18.800
this way.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.240
I streamed some stats and I got my two cents in all in a cool new way.

47:22.240 --> 47:22.720
F yeah.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.720
Boost to grams and F yeah.

47:24.720 --> 47:25.440
Go, JB.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.040
Oh, that's great.

47:27.040 --> 47:31.760
We got a thank you boost from user eight eight nine to did a mic test for 2100 sats.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.040
Test, test, test.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.240
And this is I think we'll do one more week now of our splits.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.280
So we're going to do a mic test for 2100 sats.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.480
Test, test, test.

47:40.480 --> 47:43.760
And this is I think we'll do one more week now of our splits.

47:43.760 --> 47:48.080
So when you boost in a split, I think we're doing 10, 15%.

47:48.080 --> 47:48.800
Maybe I can't remember.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.320
I think it's maybe 15.

47:50.320 --> 47:55.760
We're giving 15% of the splits to open sats, which is a charity that donates 100% of the

47:55.760 --> 47:58.720
funds they receive to free software projects.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.840
So yours, your boosts are going to help open source as well.

48:01.840 --> 48:06.560
If you'd like to send a boost, go grab a new podcast app at new podcast apps.com,

48:06.560 --> 48:13.040
or keep your podcast app and you can just use breeze B R E E Z dot technology.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.280
Something special for our picks this week.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.080
We don't ever do this ever.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.400
I don't think we've never picked a subscription.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.800
We've never picked anything really that's not software for the most part,

48:24.800 --> 48:26.400
except for with a very few exceptions.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.360
But this week's a, is an exception week.

48:29.360 --> 48:35.680
Our buddy, Michael Larable over at Ferronix has launched a special edition of the

48:35.680 --> 48:39.760
subscription price for the 18th birthday of Ferronix.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.040
Yep.

48:41.040 --> 48:42.400
Happy birthday to Ferronix.

48:42.400 --> 48:42.880
Freaking.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.840
Hey man, that is very impressive.

48:46.400 --> 48:52.800
June 5th, 2022 marks the 18th birthday for Ferronix.com for Ferronix.

48:52.800 --> 48:56.160
It's kind of hard to say fast, but I got it to mark the occasion.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.080
There's a premium special.

48:58.080 --> 49:03.440
If you'd like to go all ad free and I'm going to say this, you know, the reality is guys,

49:03.440 --> 49:10.560
um, even if you're not a big Ferronix reader on the daily, uh, Wes and I are super tuned

49:10.560 --> 49:13.680
in to like all the news in the Linux world for Linux action news.

49:13.680 --> 49:19.040
And a lot of our stories for Linux action news start with a Ferronix article that then

49:19.040 --> 49:21.360
sends us down a rabbit hole for coverage in the show.

49:21.360 --> 49:30.720
And there is only a very, very small handful of original content creators in this space

49:30.720 --> 49:34.080
that are not just taking something somebody else is reporting and repeating it.

49:34.080 --> 49:38.640
Doing the hard work of following, you know, the day to day ins outs of the work going

49:38.640 --> 49:42.720
on in these projects and then knowing enough, understanding enough, having paid attention

49:42.720 --> 49:46.400
for years to give the context to know like what things the rest of the community should

49:46.400 --> 49:46.880
know about.

49:46.880 --> 49:47.520
Yeah, that's just it.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.280
And every year he gets better at doing what he's doing.

49:49.280 --> 49:53.200
Uh, and you know, he's testing the hardware when new hardware comes out and doing the

49:53.200 --> 49:54.000
benchmarks as well.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.120
Finding kernel regressions.

49:55.120 --> 49:55.600
Yeah.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.960
Yeah, that's a great point.

49:56.960 --> 50:01.360
I mean, I think he probably is most known for the benchmarks, but a lot of what Michael

50:01.360 --> 50:03.840
does is dig through kernel development stuff.

50:03.840 --> 50:07.840
And yeah, there was a regression, a performance regression that we talked about in Linux action

50:07.840 --> 50:08.640
news in 518.

50:08.640 --> 50:13.200
And you know, sure enough, you start digging into it and Michael's one of the first people

50:13.200 --> 50:14.480
talking about it in public.

50:14.480 --> 50:17.920
And the kernel developers knew behind the scenes, they weren't saying anything.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.200
They were submitting the patches.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.760
But Michael, you know, brings light to this kind of stuff.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.120
And he does a lot of the original reporting in the Linux community.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.840
A lot of other people are based on the reporting off of what he does.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.320
So I just wanted to give him a plug.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.280
He didn't ask us to.

50:31.280 --> 50:36.320
In fact, a year or so ago when I invited him on the show, I invited him to plug his membership

50:36.320 --> 50:37.280
and he declined.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.400
He's very humble about it.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.840
He doesn't ask very often.

50:39.840 --> 50:43.680
So, you know, 25 bucks for a year or 140 for a lifetime.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.160
It's a steal.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.480
Yeah, it's it's it's for Onyx's birthday.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.280
It's pretty great to see.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.080
It reminds me I need to get my subscription.

50:50.080 --> 50:50.560
I need to renew mine.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.040
Yeah.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.880
Oh, jeez.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.680
You know, I think I might have a bonus pick here.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.960
It's actually a software piece, too.

51:00.080 --> 51:00.960
Brent sneaking in.

51:01.520 --> 51:06.960
Well, audience member JJ wrote in with a really great tool that they wrote in Rust.

51:06.960 --> 51:07.360
I'm sorry.

51:07.360 --> 51:08.000
What'd you say?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.240
Oh, I said, I think the tool was written in Rust.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.140
Huh?

51:13.680 --> 51:14.320
Rust you say?

51:14.320 --> 51:18.080
And they got inspired by episode 448 of Linux and plug.

51:18.080 --> 51:21.840
Do you remember when we did that encrypted show notes episode where we didn't have any

51:21.840 --> 51:24.160
idea what we were talking about to each other?

51:24.160 --> 51:28.080
That was our first of each one of us brings a topic, which is what inspired this episode.

51:28.080 --> 51:28.640
That's right.

51:28.640 --> 51:34.080
And Chris, you touched on some steganography that you hid a bunch of hidden messages in

51:34.080 --> 51:35.840
a cute little Levi photo.

51:36.800 --> 51:44.240
Well, JJ wrote a little Rust program called a steganosaurus that does a lot of cool things

51:44.240 --> 51:46.480
in the steganography world.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.680
So check it out.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.640
Well done, JJ.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.200
That's great.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.040
We'll put a link to that in the show notes.

51:51.040 --> 51:51.920
I love it.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.120
What a great project, too.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.880
He writes in there and helped him ignore some exams, which he did get through.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.480
He did finish the exams, which that also is important.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.760
Just remember that we get together every single Sunday to do the show live.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.800
We started usually around noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

52:06.800 --> 52:12.160
Eastern, usually a little bit earlier over at Jupiter Tube, Jupiter Dot Tube.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.840
And don't miss Linux action news.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.640
No, do not.

52:14.640 --> 52:15.920
Companion piece.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.400
Stuff going on every week in the world of Linux and open source.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.120
You know where it goes?

52:19.920 --> 52:20.880
LinuxActionNews.com.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.000
Yeah, exactly.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.240
I think, you know, there's an RSS feed you can use, too.

52:24.240 --> 52:24.560
Huh?

52:24.560 --> 52:26.400
Yeah, one of those newfangled technologies.

52:26.400 --> 52:27.760
Sorry, sorry about the XML.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.280
There's a JSON one, too.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.520
You know, you could build some stuff on top of that RSS.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.240
You know, if you think about it, you could build some stuff.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.040
See you next week.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.840
Same bad time, same bad station.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.280
And of course, links to what we talked about today are over at our website,

52:41.280 --> 52:44.320
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 461, right?

52:44.320 --> 52:44.960
That's right.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.640
How that happened, I don't know.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.360
Does that mean we're now closer to 500?

52:49.920 --> 52:52.640
That can't be, because we just did the beer thing.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.760
So that can't be right.

52:53.760 --> 52:54.560
That can't be right.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.080
We're going to have to brew a cider this time?

52:56.080 --> 52:57.040
That's not bad, Wes.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.720
We should just be doing that anyways.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.400
I'm surprised we're not brewing a cider right now.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.320
That's how we get Brent to come back to the studio.

53:03.680 --> 53:03.920
All right.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.440
Well, thanks so much for joining us this week.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.000
Yeah, I'm only going to take some if it's a hoppy cider.

53:08.000 --> 53:08.640
All right.

53:08.640 --> 53:08.960
All right.

53:08.960 --> 53:09.760
We can make one of those.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.480
Be sure to join us next week at LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe for the feed.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.280
Thanks so much.

53:15.280 --> 53:45.040
And see you then.

53:45.280 --> 53:59.200
So we got some propane for the grillskis.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.000
What?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.160
So and I got some Costco beef dogs.

54:02.160 --> 54:02.480
That's...

54:03.280 --> 54:04.240
You're inspired, sir.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.120
Mm-hmm.

54:05.120 --> 54:05.600
Mm-hmm.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.440
You going to take care of yourself after this, Brent?

54:07.440 --> 54:08.320
I always do.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.680
You got some work to do over there.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.880
More zipper updates to fix.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.680
I feel like things are slowly falling apart, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.280
We'll fix them all.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.560
I think it'll be OK.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.200
That's better, right?

54:17.200 --> 54:19.360
That's better than things quickly falling apart.

54:19.360 --> 54:19.840
Yeah, you're right.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.480
You can at least see it happening and you can do something about it.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.640
Pretend that you can do something about it.

54:24.640 --> 54:27.120
At least you have some hope that you might someday finish all of them.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.000
Right, right.

54:28.000 --> 54:28.480
Yeah.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.360
I feel like you just had a...

54:29.360 --> 54:33.120
You just made like a really deep metaphor for life when you were talking about his laptop

54:33.120 --> 54:33.600
updates.

54:33.600 --> 54:34.100
That's...

54:34.800 --> 54:35.520
That's deep, Wes.

54:35.520 --> 54:36.640
That's why we run Linux, right?

54:36.640 --> 54:44.320
Yeah, that's the Wes way.
