1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
No one can fully replace the Fedora Project.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,840
Absolutely not, exactly.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,800
Don't worry, Ian, it'll be just a pale comparison,

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,360
but you know what?

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,880
Rumor has it you have some experience with Fedora Atomic,

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,840
which is kind of topic irrelevant right now.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,920
Relevant, not irrelevant, so I think it's gonna slide.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,240
Absolutely, and Dusty does even more than I do,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,080
so that'll be great.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,920
All right, there we go.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,800
All right, gentlemen, well, let's start the show.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:40,560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 255 for June 26, 2018.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,160
that's deploying containers with cockpit like a madman.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,080
My name is Chris.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,000
And my name is Brent.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,520
Hello, Brent.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,880
Yeah, Wes is out on vacay this week.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,920
I think he's on some kind of road trip.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Who even knows, but we'll get into that.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,740
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program,

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,240
we have many community announcements to make for you,

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,180
including some great news for the Blender Project,

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,240
a little bit of a background Skunk Works project

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
that I'm working on, a Flatpak history,

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
and then a couple, perhaps three, maybe two gentlemen

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,080
from the Fedora Project.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
It's all still getting ironed out.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
We'll be joining us to talk about Fedora Core OS

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,200
and many other things that are happening

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,680
in the Fedora community.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,960
Plus, GTK 3's got a big update.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,920
Neon's going for the 1804 push and looking for testing.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,040
But be careful before you make the plunge.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,520
Firefox is back.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,320
And they've got a lot of attention.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,880
And they think, perhaps, local processing, not

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,160
cloud processing, might be the future of their success.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,320
And are you ready to replace MP3 at least for your podcasts?

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,920
We'll tell you about a new, yes, a new open source codec.

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,020
It's not Opus.

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,160
It's not Theora.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,040
It's a brand.

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
It's not Vorbis.

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,920
It's a brand new codec called Codec 2.

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,760
And it's designed to fit an entire,

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,880
a long arse podcast on a floppy disk.

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
Yeah, I said a floppy disk.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,880
I'll tell you about that.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,920
Plus, we've got a new release of GitLab.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,280
And I got a small, sweet, but really kind of to the point

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,240
interview with the GitLab CEO about what the hell

53
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,320
auto DevOps is and why it's landing in GitLab.11.

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,840
But Brent, let's not go any further

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,680
without addressing the elephant in the room.

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,600
You're not Wes.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,680
I think I sound a little different.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,160
He's probably the Seattle version of me.

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,880
I wasn't going to.

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,200
Or maybe I'm the Northern Ontario version of him.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
I wasn't going to say it.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,880
I wasn't.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,000
But that is so true.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,440
So I'm really glad you said it.

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,980
Because you guys are like, if I ever travel to Ontario,

66
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,920
you're my guy, Brent.

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,040
You're like my guy.

68
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,200
And if anybody ever travels to Seattle,

69
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,680
Wes should be their guy, not me, but Wes.

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,720
But he's out driving around the Pacific Northwest right now.

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,520
And you hit me up and you said, hey, I'd

72
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,720
love to join you on the show.

73
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,520
And it was just the timing worked out perfectly.

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,100
And the audience might remember Brent

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,880
because he was on the show ages ago during Linux Fest Northwest

76
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,520
talking about his photography workflow on Linux.

77
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,640
And Brent, since you've done that episode,

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
I've probably gotten an email a week asking,

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
how can I make that switch?

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,280
So it seems to be an area, pro photography,

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,880
where we're picking up a lot of users on the Linux side.

82
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,600
Is that all still?

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,920
You're still rocking Linux to do all your pro photography,

84
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,760
still using Darktable and all that goodness?

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,280
Absolutely.

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't see that changing anytime soon.

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
And the software is just getting better and better and better.

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
So no looking back.

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Yeah, I'm surprised that so many people are giving it a go.

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
I'd really love to get more insights into that.

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,960
In fact, if you're a pro photographer,

92
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,480
photographer that has switched, I'd love to hear why.

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

94
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
But before we go any further, Brent,

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,760
we've got to bring in that virtual lug.

96
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,160
Hello.

98
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,000
What's up?

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Hello.

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,920
So in the Mumble Room right now, we have Dusty joining us.

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
Dusty, are you with technically Red Hat,

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,040
or do you consider yourself with the Fedora project?

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,680
What's your delineation there?

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
Both.

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, well, that's not confusing.

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,600
No, I work for Red Hat, but a lot of what I do

107
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
is related to the Fedora project.

108
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,560
And if I were to leave Red Hat, I

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,760
imagine I would try to still stay involved.

110
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,080
So nothing that I do there is really tied or specific

111
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,760
to Red Hat.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,360
Specifically, I mean, I could do that job for another company

113
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,160
if I wanted to.

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,760
Fascinating.

115
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,520
And Ian was going to be joining us too,

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
but it looks like he just stepped out for a moment.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,080
He might come back.

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
I'll keep an eye out for him.

119
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,200
Where are you, Ian?

120
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Where are you?

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,640
Oh, yeah, there you are.

122
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,320
Jeez, I'm sorry.

123
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,720
I'm sorry.

124
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
The screen's across.

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Ian, you're also over, again, same question to you.

126
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,440
Do you consider yourself Red Hat?

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you consider yourself primarily Fedora?

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
Explain that to me.

129
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,600
I thought Dusty gave a great answer.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
All right.

131
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,000
I think a lot of people in Red Hat would say the same thing.

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,760
We can shift hats, sometimes strategically,

133
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,680
depending on what we're trying to argue for.

134
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,180
Nice.

135
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,520
So you can chew and walk at the same time of that bubble gum.

136
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I like it.

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, guys, we're going to get to the big news surrounding

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,120
the Fedora project here in just a little bit.

139
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320
But I wanted to start with an update around Blender,

140
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,800
because this is personally extremely interesting to me.

141
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,200
As you recall from last week's episode,

142
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,240
YouTube had blocked all of the Blender videos, the Blender

143
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,520
Projects videos, the open source Blender Projects

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,640
videos worldwide.

145
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,200
Now, on Thursday after the show, YouTube

146
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,440
turned their channel back on, with the exception of one

147
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,560
video from Andrew Price, which is still blocked in the USA.

148
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,280
And apparently, they are requesting

149
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,400
that the Blender Project signs a new monetization

150
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,800
agreement, which sounds really bad just in general.

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,200
I mean, Brent, is there no longer a space just

152
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
for uploading your stuff for free

153
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,160
and sharing it with people?

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,440
Isn't that still something that's worth pursuing?

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,480
Well, maybe it just means you don't do it on these platforms.

156
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,200
Yeah.

157
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah, maybe it does, doesn't it?

158
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,080
Maybe it means we need things like PeerTube.

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
PeerTube is what Blender turned to when

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
YouTube shut down their channel.

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,480
And we covered it a little bit last week,

162
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,920
and I'm really happy to say this week,

163
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,160
that they were undergoing a fundraiser

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
and they reached their goal.

165
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,920
In fact, they've exceeded their goal by just a bit.

166
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
They still have nine days left to go,

167
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
and I think maybe it'd be worth kind of pushing this

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
just a little bit further.

169
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,480
Right now, they've raised 23,000 euros,

170
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,160
and their goal was 20,000.

171
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,920
With nine days left to go, they've reached 118% of funding.

172
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,480
But there's still work to be done.

173
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,740
They talk about their next milestone.

174
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,280
They say there are important features

175
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,000
that they want to get in version 1,

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,760
and those are video redundancies.

177
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,500
You can share bandwidth between instances

178
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,400
or as a fallback of the original instance if it goes down,

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,920
and the ability to subscribe to users and channels

180
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
throughout the entire federation of PeerTube.

181
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,760
So for those of you that maybe aren't familiar with PeerTube,

182
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,400
I did a little deep dive this week.

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I loaded up on a Fedora 28 cloud instance using Cockpit,

184
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,200
and as you know, I love it.

185
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
And you just go right into Cockpit

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
when you have all the Docker stuff installed,

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,220
and you go to containers, and you just search in there,

188
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,240
and it will search the entire Docker hub,

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
and it will pull down PeerTube.

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
And you can get started with PeerTube in five minutes

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,940
using Fedora 28 and Cockpit.

192
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,080
It's great, and I have that running on top of a DO droplet.

193
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,520
And I gave it a go, and it's a little rough at this point,

194
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,780
but holy crap, if this doesn't have some potential.

195
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,000
As you probably guessed, it's using BitTorrent

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,320
as the backend with a web seed.

197
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,020
So when you're the first person to watch it,

198
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,040
you get a web seed, and it plays pretty fast.

199
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,840
But when you're the second person to watch it,

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,280
you get the web seed, and you start streaming it

201
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,540
from the other person watching it.

202
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,600
And I think this has massive potential

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
for Jupyter broadcasting content.

204
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,560
So I wanted to load it up and give it a go.

205
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,420
And you know, it's early days, it's early days.

206
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,560
But like, when do you decide to make a jump

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
to something like this?

208
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,720
Like, take you, Brent.

209
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,880
When did you say, all right, I can make a jump

210
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,500
to a totally different technology stack,

211
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,040
even if it doesn't have 100% everything I need?

212
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,640
How do you make that decision,

213
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,440
especially when it's like a creative endeavor?

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Yeah, I mean, it's most certainly gonna be a personal choice

215
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
as far as how much risk you're willing to take.

216
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah, exactly.

217
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,000
But for me personally, at least in the photography sphere,

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
it was keeping an eye on the tools

219
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,540
and knowing that, okay, they're in their infancy.

220
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,040
Maybe six months from now, they're gonna have

221
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,420
the very basic of the tool set that I need.

222
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,600
So for my transition, it was like, okay,

223
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
this has 70% of what I use on a daily basis.

224
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
Is that enough?

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,660
And for me at the time, yeah, okay, 70% is enough.

226
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,540
And maybe I can fill in with that extra, you know,

227
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,120
that remainder with some of the other proprietary tools

228
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,720
for the moment as the open source

229
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,340
or the alternative tools develop further.

230
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,840
Yeah, so what I like about PeerTube right now

231
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
is that I could self-host it.

232
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,800
And then when I upload a video

233
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,260
to my own little lonely self-hosted instance,

234
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,760
it's in development, it's kind of working now.

235
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,920
It has an announcement feature where it can announce it

236
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
to the rest of the PeerTube network,

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,860
which are a bunch of federated servers.

238
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,560
And so you could be a member of one server

239
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
and if you have everything turned on right

240
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
and that server has everything enabled,

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
you can cross-pollinate the content options,

242
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,800
which sort of addresses this issue

243
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,240
when you go self-hosted about discoverability.

244
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
That's one of the things that's really driven GitHub

245
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
is that when you move to GitHub,

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,660
you automatically get discoverability.

247
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,120
People can search and find you in one central location.

248
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,160
And when you switch to GitLab or your own self-hosted repo,

249
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
you kind of go off the grid a little bit.

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
And that's why Jupyter Broadcasting

251
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,280
has always published to YouTube and to Google Play

252
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,760
and to iTunes and Stitcher and all of the other ones,

253
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,720
because you gotta go where the audience is.

254
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,960
But this sort of squares those two things.

255
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,280
PeerTube is letting you self-host

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,580
while also spreading the word

257
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,380
when you have new content available.

258
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,080
And I'm kind of all in.

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,000
I kind of, I'm thinking about ways

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,360
maybe I can contribute to the project financially.

261
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,480
Jupyter Broadcasting is a company, I mean, not me personally.

262
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,860
And I've played around on a container

263
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,920
and it is at a stage right now

264
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,120
where it needs more of my attention

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
than I have time to give it.

266
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,920
It's a little rough and it's gonna have more updates.

267
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,960
But I will say this,

268
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,000
if somebody in the community wants to reach out

269
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,780
and work with me to set up a PeerTube hosted solution,

270
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,160
I would be more than on board

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,600
with importing all of our YouTube catalog

272
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,680
and setting up PeerTube as an option

273
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,080
for the Jupyter Broadcasting audience to consume our content.

274
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
100% would be on board with that.

275
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,840
I would even consider starting doing the main embeds

276
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,620
on the JB website using PeerTube

277
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,540
if the experience is 70% there,

278
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,720
because I think the audience would be with me too.

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,440
So if this sounds appealing to you,

280
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,800
setting up a PeerTube server on a DigitalOcean Droplet

281
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,740
or something like that and working with me over Telegram,

282
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,840
I put this out there to the community right here right now.

283
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,480
Let's be early adopters, Jupyter Broadcasting.

284
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,440
Let's be early adopters of PeerTube.

285
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,960
Let's push this forward.

286
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,460
Let's help collapse the YouTube monopoly on online video.

287
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,680
And let's do it with, in my opinion,

288
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,560
some of the best Linux and open source content out there.

289
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,860
And if you wanna work with me,

290
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,260
contact me on Telegram at ChrisLAS.

291
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
Let's set it up,

292
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,680
because I think this could be a great opportunity.

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,040
It's so close, I would almost do it all myself.

294
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,560
It just needs a bit more babysitting

295
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,640
than I have time to give and I recognize that fact

296
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,900
and I want it to be successful.

297
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,800
So I want somebody in the community to work with me,

298
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,820
but this is the solution.

299
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,580
It'll be this and a million other things.

300
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,600
Instagram has just recently launched IGTV.

301
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
Facebook has their YouTube competitor,

302
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
but I feel like PeerTube, for our audience,

303
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,120
could be the future.

304
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,020
It won't necessarily replace YouTube,

305
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
but it could be, one day,

306
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,320
the predominant way people watch

307
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,640
Jupyter Broadcasting videos.

308
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm pretty excited about it, Brent.

309
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,880
Do you think it would isolate anyone at all?

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,720
I don't know.

311
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,080
I mean, I like their federation spreading the information.

312
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,880
It definitely is not gonna reach people

313
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,320
on the proprietary commercial platforms.

314
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,280
And so I feel like, for a period of time,

315
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm gonna have to publish in both locations.

316
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,160
You know what I mean?

317
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Like a transition period?

318
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,120
Yeah, yeah, like a transition period

319
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,980
and then once people know about it

320
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,960
and the word of mouth is starting to spread,

321
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,000
kind of make it our primary platform.

322
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,360
And how awesome would it be if I could self-host that stuff

323
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,080
and use BitTorrent to absorb the primary bulk

324
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
of the bandwidth?

325
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,740
Isn't that great?

326
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,200
Fabulous, yeah, yeah, fabulous.

327
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,920
It makes me wanna do all the things over torrent.

328
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,960
I've always wanted to.

329
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
I was ready to use BitTorrent Sync

330
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,560
as a way to distribute shows,

331
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,080
but that didn't work out either.

332
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
So we'll see.

333
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,040
We'll see where that goes.

334
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Do you think torrent can handle the bandwidth?

335
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
You know, if we get like, you know,

336
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,520
thousands of these servers going,

337
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,720
can it do all that?

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,020
I think it gets even better.

339
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,640
That's the thing.

340
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,980
You know, have you ever used any of those apps

341
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,640
like Popcorn Hour or whatever it was

342
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,900
that would live stream torrent files?

343
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,620
No.

344
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,240
It works because if you think about it,

345
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
you do segmented downloads.

346
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
And if you synchronize the download with the player,

347
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,520
like if the download mechanism is aware

348
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,620
of the player position in the video,

349
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,820
it can start trying to chunk up the section

350
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,280
of the video you're watching.

351
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,080
And so it actually lends itself pretty well

352
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,960
to video streaming.

353
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,640
It's a little bit slower in some cases,

354
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,160
but the nature of BitTorrent where it can download

355
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,120
different chunks of the file at different times

356
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,240
from different locations happens to fit pretty well

357
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,560
with the nature of video streaming.

358
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,820
So I actually think it could be a pretty good experience.

359
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,040
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

360
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,680
In some ways it seems like a meant to be transition, right?

361
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,960
It's just about time that this comes along, isn't it?

362
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,880
I hope so.

363
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,140
I really hope so because I've had many concerns

364
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,960
about YouTube now for quite a while.

365
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,520
Let's shift gears for a moment.

366
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,120
And there was some great progress that came out of London.

367
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Over on the Ubuntu blog, there is a report from Will Cook

368
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
about the GNOME software design sprint.

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,940
And he writes, a couple of weeks ago,

370
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,720
representatives from across Canonical met in London

371
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,200
to talk about ideas to improve the user experience

372
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,380
of GNOME software.

373
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,440
We had people from the store team, Snap Advocacy,

374
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,240
Snap D, design, and the desktop team.

375
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,880
But we also were fortunate enough to be joined

376
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,440
by Richard Hughes, representing Upstream GNOME software.

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
Now Richard's name may ring a bell

378
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,160
when we've talked about the Upstream firmware project

379
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,400
that I'm a huge fan of.

380
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,680
And Will writes, we started off this week

381
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,280
by making a very quick, a.k.a. long, list of features

382
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,120
or improvements we'd like to see in GNOME software.

383
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,500
They broke it all down, did a big whiteboard session.

384
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,240
And some of the things they talked about

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,360
were adding a verified publisher's identity

386
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,280
to GNOME software to show where a publisher has undergone

387
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,280
some kind of formal checking so you can be assured that they

388
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,920
are who they say they are.

389
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
Also, they thought about adding a way

390
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,480
to report problems within applications

391
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,060
right there in GNOME software.

392
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,100
Maybe it's a link to submit a bug to their bug tracker,

393
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,160
something like that.

394
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Or maybe it goes back to some central repository

395
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,660
and then gets sorted out from there.

396
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,680
They also had whiteboarded some better layouts and the ability

397
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
for publishers to add extra theming and artwork

398
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,540
to their application page.

399
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,240
So you could have, for example, FileZilla

400
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,880
could have some slick branding when you click on the FileZilla

401
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,640
icon.

402
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,140
Also, they worked on a refreshed home screen for GNOME software

403
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,660
to surface new applications, application add-ons that

404
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,960
are related to things you already have installed,

405
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,440
and news and updates for your favorite applications

406
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,820
from the software developers.

407
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,400
Their initial designs are going to be

408
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,720
added to GNOME's community design pages on the GitLab

409
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
just to get feedback and things like that.

410
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
And then hopefully, they'll begin engineering work,

411
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,320
and it'll be done to a branch that's

412
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,520
upstream of GNOME software and be proposed

413
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,140
for upstream and general inclusion

414
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,000
if all agreed seem to like it.

415
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,280
Interesting that these sprints are still going on now

416
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,760
that we're done with 17.10 and 18.04.

417
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
It's an interesting thing that happens is different commercial

418
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,440
interests, in this case, Canonical,

419
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,960
who has a pretty wide interest in GNOME software,

420
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,240
will bring folks in to sort of forward the things

421
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,060
that they see are critical.

422
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,440
And then it's kind of up to the rest of the community

423
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,800
to adopt their changes.

424
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,200
And this is sort of the groundwork where forks begin.

425
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Not necessarily where forks happen,

426
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,720
but this is sort of the groundwork

427
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,160
where forks could begin.

428
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,360
Say Canonical really gets invested

429
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,000
in some of these changes, like publisher verification, which

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,600
is a pretty good one, especially after the Snap Store

431
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,520
stuff and the Docker Hub stuff we've talked about recently.

432
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,240
That's a pretty good one.

433
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,680
But maybe for some reason, let's say

434
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
GNOME upstream doesn't like it.

435
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Now Canonical will have a decision on their hands.

436
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,400
Do we fork our version of GNOME software,

437
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,440
which will be superior?

438
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,080
Or do we go with upstream, stay upstream, keep it simple,

439
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,320
but lack the features we want?

440
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,120
It's kind of a interesting semi-uncomfortable situation

441
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,880
that crops up in open source development.

442
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,680
You agree, Brent?

443
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,200
I do.

444
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,640
But in a way, it also allows us a whole bunch

445
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,720
of different options, right?

446
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,200
If there's two camps that are in this stuff every single day

447
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,840
who feel differently about a project,

448
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,640
certainly there are other users out in the world who do as well.

449
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,320
So to have two options sometimes is the best.

450
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,560
It is sort of an organic way to let things work out,

451
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,680
sort of an evolution versus intelligent design, if you will.

452
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
And whichever one's stronger in the marketplace

453
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,720
sort of wins out.

454
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
I know myself, I want to see continued improvements

455
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,560
in the way I can ingest flat packs and flat pack

456
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,840
repositories and snaps.

457
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,920
They've done a lot of work there.

458
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,920
But just recently, I was trying to add,

459
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,040
I can't remember if it was Atom or Visual Studio code,

460
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,840
but there was a flat pack repo for it.

461
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,000
And within step two, I'm at the command line.

462
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm adding repos.

463
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm then installing software.

464
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,280
And honestly, I just wish I could click a link in my browser

465
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,840
and have it launch GNOME software

466
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,280
and do all of the work for me, maybe

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,360
prompt for my password once.

468
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,520
And we're just not there yet.

469
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
So that's what I'd like to see is improvements

470
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,520
with these universal package formats.

471
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,840
Speaking of flat pack, it's been almost four years

472
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,960
since we started talking about it.

473
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,080
Can you believe that?

474
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
You might not actually think that's true,

475
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
because when we first started talking about flat pack,

476
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,200
we were talking about XdgApp.

477
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,240
You might remember your humble host here talking about XggApp

478
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,800
and how I was excited about it being a universal installation

479
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
format.

480
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,160
It used osstree, XggApp, and used the osstree

481
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,560
to store and deduplicate applications.

482
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,880
It used kernel namespaces via a helper called XggAppHelper

483
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,520
to do unprivileged containers.

484
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,060
It had a split between applications and runtimes.

485
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,800
It was very much like what we see flat pack today.

486
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,000
But there was a great renaming for flat pack

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,040
from XggApp to flat pack.

488
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,320
And that's when, in this show, we

489
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,720
could tell things were going to the next level.

490
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,680
And flat pack, the name itself, has a great history

491
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,560
that goes back way, way, way, way, way back

492
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,680
to the ancient Egyptians.

493
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,480
I'll link to the post in the show notes

494
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,240
that explains that at linuxunplug.com slash 255.

495
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
Go check that out.

496
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,080
So in 2016, we got the new name of flat pack.

497
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,600
That was version 0.6.0.

498
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,680
Version 0.80 was released in December of 2016.

499
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,840
And that was the first long-term stable edition

500
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,940
that landed in Debian Stretch and RHEL 7.

501
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,580
And we've had another stable release since then, version 0.10x.

502
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,240
It's always been a decentralized system

503
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,000
that anyone could host their own applications.

504
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,840
But since then, they've realized it is kind of beneficial

505
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
to have a centralized hub called Flathub.

506
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
So the Flathub project was launched

507
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,440
where you can find most applications these days that

508
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,040
are available in Flathub and flat pack.

509
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,480
But it's not finished.

510
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,440
And it's not necessarily bug-free either.

511
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,540
In fact, Alexander writes in his blog

512
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,920
that they have a lot of things on the list for flat pack 1.0.

513
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,780
And there's a few core things they

514
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,240
want to have done before they announce flat pack.1.0.

515
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,800
So if you keep your eye out, in this next week,

516
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,200
you'll probably see the first release candidate

517
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,040
for flat pack 1.0 called 0.99.1.

518
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,920
It'll probably be later on, as you're

519
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,160
hearing this episode, a couple of days afterwards.

520
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,600
And then later this summer, we're

521
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,280
going to finally get version 1.0 of flat pack.

522
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,720
So we've got Snap and flat pack 1.0's.

523
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
And actually, Snap is further along.

524
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,640
And they did a little bit, I won't say much faster,

525
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,160
but noticeably faster development pace there.

526
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,640
But flat pack, since XGD app, since 2016,

527
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
has been really kind of progressing

528
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,760
in this nice, orderly fashion.

529
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,740
And the summer is going to be the summer of flat pack.

530
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,000
This is going to be a big summer for both of these formats.

531
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
And it's just a couple of months away.

532
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,840
And soon, some of your favorite applications

533
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,960
will be packaged up, if they haven't already.

534
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,800
As I wrote these notes for the show,

535
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,200
I realized I was using a Snap of Telegram.

536
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm using a flat pack of my editor.

537
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,820
I can't remember when I even installed that.

538
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm using an app image of Etcher.

539
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,040
Like, I have all of these different applications

540
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,740
I use on a daily basis that are installed using

541
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,500
these universal package formats.

542
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,200
And what we've ended up with is like three instead of one.

543
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Really, it's three, because you've got to include app image

544
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,080
in this conversation.

545
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,160
Is three manageable, Brent?

546
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,280
What do you think?

547
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,320
Is that too much?

548
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,120
Or is three, if we just landed on three solids

549
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,400
for application delivery, is that good enough?

550
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,080
I guess let me throw a question right back at you.

551
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
Do you see anyone pulling ahead?

552
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,480
Or is it kind of everyone's keeping the same?

553
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
I kind of feel like it's different use cases

554
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
are emerging.

555
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,900
So you're answering your own question.

556
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,640
Like, snaps are emerging as a great solution

557
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,760
for complicated commercial applications,

558
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,480
or applications where you really want

559
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,080
to have a high availability of discovery.

560
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,120
Flat packs have been extremely useful for, like, for example,

561
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,980
I run, on some systems, a development build of GKedit.

562
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,840
And I use a flat pack to do that.

563
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,720
That's really nice.

564
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,960
It's like flat packs, to me, are in a way what

565
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
PPA should have been all along.

566
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,140
Like, Canonical tried out PPAs, and it kind of sucked,

567
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,480
as far as I was concerned.

568
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,600
It was great for a lot of users.

569
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,640
I didn't like it a lot.

570
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,840
Whereas flat pack is, like, the perfect PPA.

571
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,120
If I could have had PPA as this, I'd

572
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,720
have been a lot happier with it.

573
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,440
Whereas snaps feel like XYZ vendor

574
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,720
has just released an application for Linux,

575
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,160
and now it's available.

576
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,060
And JJ, you're pointing out, like, a lot of these,

577
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,440
both flat pack and snaps, also have, like, this wine

578
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
compatibility layer now.

579
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,560
Yeah, and it's pretty interesting.

580
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,240
I actually got to test out the GOG Galaxy app on my system,

581
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,920
and it works relatively well, although there

582
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,360
seems to be some focus issues online, particular system

583
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,800
that I don't know if anybody else is having with regards

584
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,320
to if I go away from the game that's currently playing,

585
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,920
I cannot put my mouse inside of the game again.

586
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,840
So that's a bug that I might need to report.

587
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,000
But it sort of is interesting, because I

588
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,080
wouldn't need to have any sort of complicated setup of wine

589
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,000
in order to run all these applications.

590
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,280
And it sort of gives me a little bit of hope for Linux,

591
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,560
for users such as myself who have infrastructure

592
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,760
slash universities that refuse to, quote unquote,

593
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
officially support Linux.

594
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I agree.

595
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah, it's been nice.

596
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,800
And the bundling of, like, a compatibility layer,

597
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,680
in the case of Skype, one day it's

598
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,200
going to be to fix audio issues.

599
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,520
In the case of some others, it's to load a wine library.

600
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,400
It's very useful.

601
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,720
And I've also seen CM2 in the chat room

602
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
is saying that it's a good way to have

603
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,840
GNOME stuff, the newest GNOME stuff, in CentOS 7.

604
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,720
So you can have, like, a rel stable base,

605
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,640
but you can have the newest user land applications.

606
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,280
That obviously appeals to me too.

607
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
Maybe beta software as well.

608
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I think Firefox beta is also available in these package

609
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,320
formats.

610
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,840
Yes.

611
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,480
And Tenbit, you're pointing out that it

612
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,960
is getting easier for folks that like to use these GUI

613
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,600
installers, like the GNOME Software Center or KD Discover.

614
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,080
Yeah?

615
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, it seems to me like if you're on the desktop anyway,

616
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,120
you've got some options for not really caring

617
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,320
which one you're using.

618
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,800
It makes it way simpler, doesn't it,

619
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
when you don't do it by the command line

620
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,880
and you just use, like, Discover or GNOME software?

621
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,840
Yeah, I think so.

622
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,680
Yeah.

623
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,520
Now, I want to talk about Fedora Core OS.

624
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, I said Fedora Core OS.

625
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,600
Matthew Miller on June 20 posted over at fedoramagazine.org,

626
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,880
welcome to Fedora Core OS.

627
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,360
Everything you know is changing.

628
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,760
Now it's time for us to figure out

629
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,120
how we can welcome and include container Linux

630
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,400
into the circle of Fedora friends.

631
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,240
The Fedora editions strategy intentionally

632
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,640
makes space for exploring emerging areas in operating

633
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,920
system distributions.

634
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,440
Core OS will help us push even further

635
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,240
and bring new ways of doing things as a project.

636
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,040
Now, Fedora Core OS is going to be built from Fedora content

637
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,320
rather than the way it's made now.

638
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,280
It won't necessarily be made the same way

639
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,640
we make Fedora OS deliverables today, though.

640
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,360
No matter what, we absolutely want

641
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,120
Core OS's user experience of container cluster host OS

642
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,280
that keeps itself up to date and you just

643
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,520
don't have to worry about it.

644
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
That's the experience they're going for.

645
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,080
Fedora being a community-driven project,

646
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,400
community-driven project, though obviously this

647
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,120
is your chance to get involved.

648
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,400
Now, I read that.

649
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
I just quoted you word for word.

650
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,360
I just read it from Matt's post.

651
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,480
And it barely makes any sense to me, barely, barely

652
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,160
makes any sense.

653
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,600
From what I grok, Fedora is becoming

654
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,880
something completely different, but it

655
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
sounds like it's something that's even more awesome

656
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,680
than it currently is.

657
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,480
So I've invited Dusty and Ian on the show

658
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,160
here to help me sort this out.

659
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,960
They're both involved in the Fedora project,

660
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,120
involved with Red Hat, and they have a better insight into this

661
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,920
than your humble host here does.

662
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,600
So guys, welcome into the show.

663
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,520
And Dusty, because you were here first, I'll start with you.

664
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,560
Where do you want to begin the conversation

665
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,240
around Fedora Core OS?

666
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,160
Are we talking about sort of a refactoring of Fedora here?

667
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,440
Are we talking about a new Fedora in a sense?

668
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,480
I think what we're talking about here

669
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,720
is kind of taking the use cases that Container Linux

670
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,120
and Atomic Host have been targeting

671
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,200
and trying to bring the best of both of those worlds,

672
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
so the best from Container Linux and the best

673
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
from Atomic Host, and to also try

674
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,560
to bring those two communities.

675
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,840
Obviously, Container Linux has a large user base,

676
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,200
and Atomic Host has a very engaged community.

677
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,840
Trying to bring those two together and make something

678
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,400
better, more focused, if we combine our efforts,

679
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,920
hopefully it'll be better and it'll be more rock solid.

680
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,320
Now, Ian, you kind of come at this

681
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,440
from the atomic side of the house.

682
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,800
And I got to ask you, is this kind

683
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,160
of where the puck was going to skate regardless

684
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,640
of the Core OS merger?

685
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,360
Because to me, I've always kind of wanted

686
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,840
Fedora to go more atomic.

687
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Yeah, well, I think it's funny to me

688
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,640
to hear you say that that almost makes sense to you.

689
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,600
Because I saw Matt shared that announcement with me,

690
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
and I saw it go out.

691
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
And I thought, oh, yes, this is exactly what I wanted to say.

692
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,160
There's something that occurs to me when you did say that.

693
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,000
I think a realization that we came to,

694
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,560
if you've been in the Fedora project for a long time,

695
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,040
I've always thought of it as something

696
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,760
that was very nimble and very quick.

697
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,280
And certainly, as someone in Red Hat who's also

698
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,800
trying to manage an OS that we want to have a 3, 5, 10-year

699
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,080
lifecycle, it seems extremely nimble.

700
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,480
But some of what Fedora does now seems a little bit less nimble

701
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,400
than, for example, something like Container Linux

702
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,160
was able to do.

703
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,120
So I think a big element of what Matt was trying to get across

704
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,760
in that announcement is that we're

705
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,200
going to be open to slightly different ways of perhaps

706
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,040
constructing this subset or this sub-distribution of Fedora

707
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,520
that maybe we weren't necessarily

708
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,800
before we actually talked about marrying up

709
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,480
with the Container Linux community.

710
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,800
Because looking at some of the ways that they do things,

711
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,920
how they put stuff together, the rolling update model

712
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,240
and things like that, it is really quite nimble.

713
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,880
And it's something that I think we aspire to do more of as we

714
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,560
merge those two upstreams.

715
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,060
I see.

716
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,560
I see.

717
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,160
So in your perspective, this isn't necessarily

718
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,360
a huge shift for Fedora, the main project itself,

719
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,520
but maybe for one of the additions of Fedora.

720
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,320
Am I tracking?

721
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,360
Yeah, and I think Matthew also used this concept.

722
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
We've had a concept in Fedora called Spins, which

723
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,800
is meant to be another place where people perhaps

724
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
experimented a little bit more with the way

725
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,640
that the distribution was composed.

726
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,880
Again, it doesn't mean that we're

727
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,240
going to go completely off piste, as it were,

728
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,840
and start pulling in content that comes from nowhere else.

729
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,680
But we do have a fairly, and Fedora's very,

730
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,920
this is one of the things that makes Fedora great,

731
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,600
as a full-fledged distribution that's

732
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,680
released every six months or so, have a very rigorous process

733
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,400
for composing the entire thing together at something

734
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,840
like 20,000 source RPMs.

735
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,080
They experiment with all sorts of different ways

736
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,880
to do interactive installs, all sorts

737
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,840
of different combinations of install configurations.

738
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,040
And they do that quite well.

739
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,440
But we don't necessarily need to be constrained by that

740
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,600
when we release an update of our minimal container host that's

741
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,200
meant to support an entirely different use case, right?

742
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
So these are the kind of things that we're

743
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,520
hoping to create a little bit more space for now

744
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
that we've created Fedora Core OS

745
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,880
and have sort of announced some of the guardrails

746
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,000
for that community.

747
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,600
I see.

748
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,120
So if I today am a Fedora Atomic user,

749
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,440
and I'm just a minimal installation,

750
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,680
but I found it to be a pretty competitive, pretty great

751
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,800
server OS, what should I expect now as a Fedora Atomic user?

752
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
Long term, what kind of shift should I expect here?

753
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,340
Because it sounds like Core OS and Fedora Atomic

754
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,200
had a lot of the same goals in mind.

755
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,960
So as a user, essentially what I'm

756
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,380
trying to get out of the project sounds

757
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,460
like it's staying the same.

758
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,200
Some of the technical implementations might be shifting.

759
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,760
This is where I get to sign Dusty up for whatever I want,

760
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,640
since I told you what to expect on that one.

761
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,120
I love it.

762
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,200
Dusty will give him.

763
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm going to give him a second to try and compose

764
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,760
an answer to that, too, before I write my wish list.

765
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,720
Yeah, what do you think?

766
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,520
As a Fedora Atomic user, should I be a little concerned

767
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,280
that the thing I've just started to fall in love with

768
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,480
is about to change from what I come to expect?

769
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
I don't think so.

770
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,940
I guess it depends on how you look at it.

771
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,920
But like I said earlier, we're trying

772
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,600
to take some of the best technology from both.

773
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,600
So one thing that Container Linux users really liked

774
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,760
is Ignition, which is kind of like an early bootstrapping

775
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,400
tool that runs in the init remfs.

776
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,600
So if you've ever tried to add a new system d

777
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,480
unit to your cloud instance using CloudInit,

778
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,600
you realize that adding a system d unit via another system d

779
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,480
unit is actually pretty, it gets pretty hairy pretty quick.

780
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,360
So running and modifying the system in the init remfs

781
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,600
before you switch the root is actually pretty powerful.

782
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,480
So that's one thing that we're kind of carrying forward.

783
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Another thing is some of the update technology

784
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,680
behind Container Linux was forked off of Chrome OS.

785
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,840
And it's something that had not been maintained very well.

786
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,160
And it was kind of something that

787
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,240
was a little more scary for some of the Container Linux

788
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,160
maintainers.

789
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,760
However, RPM OS3 and OS3, we have

790
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,320
some of the core developers for that technology

791
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,800
in-house at Red Hat.

792
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,280
So if there are things that we need from those technologies

793
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,000
and the future new features or whatnot,

794
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,840
we can easily add them because we have the people,

795
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,560
the expertise there.

796
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,520
So as far as Fedora Atomic goes, it will actually continue.

797
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,360
There will be a Fedora 29 release of Fedora Atomic.

798
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,440
After that, Fedora Core OS will take over.

799
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,680
But in the long run, it's not going

800
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,200
to be much, much different than what you have today

801
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,880
as far as if you know RPM OS3 already.

802
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm going to put Dusty on the spot here and say,

803
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,040
Dusty, would you anticipate that there's

804
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,920
going to be a continuous upgrade path between, say,

805
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,680
Fedora 29 Atomic Host and whatever

806
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,120
comes out of Fedora Core OS?

807
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,680
Is that already something we're thinking of as a goal?

808
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,880
I think it might be possible.

809
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
I just don't want to commit to that.

810
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Interesting.

811
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,400
Very clever.

812
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,520
Yeah.

813
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,160
Probably a good move.

814
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,960
Yeah.

815
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,520
What we're doing as part of this merging of the two communities

816
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,840
as well is looking at it as an opportunity

817
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,040
to get rid of bad design decisions

818
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,480
that we may have had early on.

819
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,920
And if we get to a point where we decide,

820
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,800
hey, there's this change that we want

821
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,480
to make that means that we couldn't in place

822
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,960
upgrade Fedora Atomic Host to Fedora Core OS,

823
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,200
now's the best time to do it.

824
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,080
So it's very early days in the development of Fedora Core OS.

825
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,880
But we're building off of pretty stable technologies.

826
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
Obviously, there's a community behind Container Linux

827
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,120
and a community behind Fedora Atomic Host today.

828
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,680
Those technologies work.

829
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,600
So we're starting from a good position.

830
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,240
We're kind of throwing everything in the middle there

831
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,440
and then coming out with something better, I believe.

832
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,400
Yeah, you get to pick from the best, really,

833
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
in this situation.

834
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,800
It's sort of you have more good things to pick from

835
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,520
than you can really kind of make sense of.

836
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,720
It kind of sounds like an ideal situation in a way.

837
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,640
Now, all right, so that's all fine and good.

838
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,360
But as a Fedora user, I've got to wonder,

839
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,000
eventually, does this become main Fedora?

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Is it too soon to even say that?

841
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,800
But it seems like, to me, this would really

842
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,560
be a standout differentiator for Fedora

843
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,360
if this wasn't just like one of the additions of Fedora,

844
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,640
if this was Fedora.

845
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,000
Right, so I think, at least the way I think about it.

846
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,560
So for example, we have Fedora Atomic Host, right?

847
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,160
We have Fedora Workstation.

848
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,400
We have a new Fedora IoT edition.

849
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,520
We have Fedora Server.

850
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,280
The technology behind Atomic Host

851
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,680
and the technology behind upcoming Fedora Core OS

852
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,800
is already starting to branch out

853
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,080
into some of those other additions, right?

854
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,080
So for example, Atomic Workstation,

855
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,840
which was rebranded as Fedora Silverblue,

856
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,920
uses RPMOS tree and OS tree in the background.

857
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,200
So you've got your get for your operating system

858
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,080
like approach with the transactional updates.

859
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,520
But it's just a different package set, right?

860
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,600
So to answer your question, is Fedora Core OS

861
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,920
the future of Fedora?

862
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,720
I mean, I think Fedora Core OS is more or less

863
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
an addition of Fedora.

864
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,720
But the tooling behind it, the tooling behind it,

865
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,360
the tooling behind it, what we were doing with Atomic Host

866
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,520
and what we're doing with Silverblue today

867
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,400
is possibly the answer to your question,

868
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,080
is that the future of Fedora, right?

869
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,480
Because it could Fedora Core OS be the future of Fedora?

870
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,400
Well, there's a lot of users that use Fedora

871
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,360
as a workstation and Fedora Core OS,

872
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,480
we're not including GNOME, right?

873
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,080
So that's kind of hard to answer that question,

874
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,040
unless you look at it,

875
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,560
is the underlying technology the future?

876
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,440
I think that is an open question and that is,

877
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
it will be interesting to see what happens there.

878
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah, that's kind of where I was going, exactly,

879
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,800
is it seems like that fundamental technology

880
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,480
that's making this such a great option

881
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,080
would be just as useful on the workstation.

882
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,560
Because I guess I think about this and I think,

883
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
this is kind of confusing to the average user,

884
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,360
there's a lot going on here.

885
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,080
It's not like open SUSE levels of confusing yet,

886
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,800
but we're like getting there.

887
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,960
And I wonder, this is kind of a nebulous question,

888
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
I don't know if it's better for Ian or for Dusty,

889
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,840
but how much do you guys give thinking

890
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,600
to the messaging around all of this

891
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,720
and the end user's ability to track this?

892
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,320
Seems like it's pushing it.

893
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,160
You know what I mean?

894
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,080
Well, so I think the messaging initially on this

895
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,880
is that this is a continuation of the interest groups

896
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,080
that grew around Container Linux

897
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,880
and the Fedora Atomic Host, right?

898
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,520
So the focus of this is very much that use case.

899
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,280
I would reiterate Dusty's point,

900
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,600
is that the idea of having a largely immutable host

901
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,480
with this sort of atomic update

902
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,840
has at least two other major applications

903
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,080
that people are able to experiment with within Fedora,

904
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,040
what's now called Silverblue and some initial work on IoT.

905
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,680
And I think that's a very natural way

906
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,440
for it to be allowed to develop sort of in parallel

907
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,480
with contributions coming across where there's commonality,

908
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
like again, at the OS tree or our PMOS tree level.

909
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
But if you're a Fedora user and you're confused by this,

910
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,320
but you haven't been involved in the Atomic Host project

911
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,880
and are not interested in containers,

912
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,440
it's probably not an area

913
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,880
that you need to be looking at right now.

914
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,240
But if you were part of the communities

915
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,160
that were interested in container technologies,

916
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,280
if you're interested in container orchestration,

917
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
or if you were actually part of the Atomic Host community

918
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,200
or Container Linux on the CoreOS side,

919
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,600
then I hope you're not confused by Matthew's announcement.

920
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,800
And get involved, right?

921
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,160
Yes, yes, please.

922
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Yeah, that's what I like the most

923
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,960
about what you guys are doing really,

924
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,880
is because in a way, and my co-host on Linux Action

925
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,280
has pointed this out to me, it was obvious,

926
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,400
but I hadn't thought about it.

927
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,320
This could trickle upstream to RHEL eventually,

928
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,480
what you guys do here, yeah?

929
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,600
So it's in a way, it's a way for the community

930
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,560
to impact RHEL, which is one of the largest commercial

931
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,880
and open source products in the world.

932
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,400
Yeah, and we'd like, I mean, I would say that that's true

933
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
of many things in Fedora, and that's quite explicit, so.

934
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,560
Yeah, fair enough.

935
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,480
Okay, so I don't know if this is a Dustin or Ian question.

936
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,280
Dusty, maybe this is more towards you,

937
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,120
but can somebody explain to me what the difference

938
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,900
between a Fedora project leader is

939
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,760
and a Fedora program manager?

940
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,160
Because you guys just got yourself

941
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,280
a program manager over at Fedora.

942
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
It looks like it's Ben Cotton,

943
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,040
and he is pretty excited to take the new role on,

944
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,520
but what is a program manager, and what's that all about?

945
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
I'm not sure exactly.

946
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,920
I imagine the Fedora project leader

947
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,440
is more of a community facing, you know,

948
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,840
let's kind of organize and get people inspired

949
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,640
to, you know, contribute and collaborate.

950
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,240
And the program manager is probably more, you know,

951
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,060
looking at what's coming down the pipeline.

952
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,480
Do we have people working on these things?

953
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,740
Are we gonna be able to, you know,

954
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,000
get this feature into Fedora 29, that type of thing.

955
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
Yeah, so very much sort of like a,

956
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,480
sort of herding the cats role,

957
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
which can be a absolutely full-time position.

958
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,600
In fact, it can be one of the most arduous positions, so.

959
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,500
Herding cats in the community, fun.

960
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh, I can imagine, let me tell you, Dusty.

961
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I can imagine, and it is a pain in the arse, let me tell you.

962
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,500
It is the hardest thing I do for 12 years,

963
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,480
maybe 13 years now of podcasting.

964
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,200
It is the hardest thing I do.

965
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,160
So it does take some serious dedication.

966
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,640
Well, guys, is there anything else around this

967
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,680
that we should talk about?

968
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,960
Anything else you think the audience

969
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,840
would probably walk away with knowing

970
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,200
about the recent announcements,

971
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,400
the merger of Fedora and CoreOS?

972
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,720
Is there kind of like a takeaway

973
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,960
that you want to make sure you hit on?

974
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,640
I would say that we're deadly serious

975
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,920
about the ability for people

976
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
who want to get involved in the community

977
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,680
or are already involved in either of these two communities

978
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,420
to come on board in the sort of early requirements

979
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,480
gathering phase of this.

980
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,120
We're absolutely, we have a number of, I think,

981
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,240
interesting avenues of exploration right now

982
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,080
that we're going down,

983
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,960
and we would love to have people come on board.

984
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,760
Yep, and I believe we'll have

985
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,860
our first community meeting tomorrow.

986
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,680
I think we're going to try to have the same time slot

987
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,320
as what we were doing for the Atomic Community Meeting,

988
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,320
which is Wednesdays at 1630 UTC,

989
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,080
but we'll see.

990
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,040
We should have our first one tomorrow.

991
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,080
So if I wanted to get kind of in the ground floor level,

992
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,120
wanted to maybe influence some of the decisions,

993
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,840
is that sort of the first thing I should start attending,

994
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,620
is that Wednesday meeting and start contributing there?

995
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,920
Yep, that's a good place to start,

996
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,880
but if you're not able to come there,

997
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,960
we have a mailing list,

998
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,880
we have a discourse set up for discussions.

999
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,140
Really, there's a lot of different ways to get involved.

1000
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,640
We have an IRC channel.

1001
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,420
If you have any questions and want to get involved,

1002
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,900
drop by our IRC channel,

1003
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,840
and we can point you in the right direction too.

1004
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,680
Awesome.

1005
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,360
Guys, here's what I love about what's going on.

1006
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,880
First of all, it really is something where

1007
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Joe, sysadmin, or Joe developer can get involved

1008
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,360
and push the direction of this thing,

1009
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,280
which eventually will trickle upstream

1010
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,400
to Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

1011
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,760
which is, that's remarkable, if you think about it.

1012
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,140
That right there itself is remarkable,

1013
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,320
but the other thing I really like about it is

1014
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,820
this is about as transparent as it can get.

1015
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,720
I mean, I appreciate and understand

1016
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,120
there was some business sales and behind the scenes stuff

1017
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,960
that had to happen,

1018
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,520
but really, even before this thing is completely formed,

1019
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,840
you guys, two of you, Ian and Dusty, are on the show.

1020
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,280
Matt was gonna make it, but he couldn't.

1021
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,920
Three of you were gonna be on the show to talk about this.

1022
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,160
The blog posts are out there.

1023
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,720
The weekly community meetings are happening.

1024
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,680
This is about as transparent as it gets

1025
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,520
with something like this,

1026
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,320
and the reason why I think it's worth underscoring

1027
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,960
that a couple of times is

1028
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,560
this really will affect the industry.

1029
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,340
It goes from Fedora and it trickles down

1030
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,840
to so many systems, so many enterprise-grade systems,

1031
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,240
the things that people in our audience

1032
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,400
make their living off of.

1033
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,920
So I really appreciate you guys taking the time

1034
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,560
to come on the show and helping me wrap my brain around it

1035
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,960
because it's part of that transparency.

1036
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,200
So thank you, Ian and Dusty.

1037
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,080
You guys are totally welcome to hang out with us.

1038
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,040
We're gonna keep going.

1039
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,120
All right, thanks for having us.

1040
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,040
Thank you, Chris.

1041
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,180
Yeah, so let's talk about GTK 3 for a moment

1042
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,320
because it hasn't gotten a lot of attention for a while.

1043
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,440
GTK 4 has sort of been the new big promise,

1044
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,720
and we've all kind of been holding our breath,

1045
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,440
but it's taking a little bit longer than initially thought.

1046
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,700
So over on the GTK Plus development blog,

1047
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,280
we have ourselves a post from Mr. MC Lason,

1048
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,240
and he talks about GTK 4 being just a little bit out.

1049
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,120
So in the meantime, we're gonna see ourselves a GTK 3.24,

1050
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,800
and it's gonna be a maintenance release

1051
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,620
that has some nice new features,

1052
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,000
including, Brent, I know your favorite feature,

1053
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,240
new emoji support, yeah?

1054
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
I mean, that's gotta feel good.

1055
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,080
How did you know?

1056
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,360
I don't know, because I feel like you and I

1057
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,200
could have a conversation in emojis, you and I.

1058
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,040
You had this very special emoji that you sent me.

1059
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,840
It might have been someone with a beard.

1060
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,160
Those are stickers.

1061
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,400
Do not confuse the emojis with the stickers.

1062
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
I do love my Putin stickers.

1063
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,520
Yeah, I got Kim Jong-un stickers,

1064
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
and I got Vladimir Putin stickers,

1065
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,640
and I'll use them all the time.

1066
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,200
So the long and short of this is really

1067
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,480
kind of a practical acknowledgment

1068
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,480
by the GTK community that GTK 4 is taking a little bit longer.

1069
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,460
So we're gonna, I know we've been telling you

1070
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,880
that you could just plan on GTK 3.22 being final,

1071
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,320
and it was just gonna stick around,

1072
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,900
but we're gonna make some changes.

1073
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,760
But it's not just emojis that they're including.

1074
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,680
There's gonna be support for new open type font features

1075
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,500
and other nice things and bug fixes, so keep an eye out.

1076
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,280
The GTK 3 cycle is still alive,

1077
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,240
and I wanted to give you just a heads up about that.

1078
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,980
Another bit of community news for those of you

1079
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,680
that are running KDE Neon.

1080
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,480
If you are crazy, you can now update to 18.04.

1081
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,220
KDE Neon is sort of this promise of an LTS Ubuntu release

1082
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,960
with a rolling KDE release.

1083
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,440
They can come within hours of the new hotness

1084
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,560
because the developers are using Neon themselves.

1085
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,900
And this, since the project's inception,

1086
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,480
is the first time they're hopping LTSs.

1087
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,940
They're going from 16.04 to 18.04,

1088
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,520
but it hasn't been done before.

1089
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,600
So they're looking for your help to test,

1090
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,380
and I underscore test.

1091
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,200
It is not recommended for production systems.

1092
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,240
But if you are a lunatic and a masochist,

1093
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,360
you can go try it out.

1094
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,760
I'll have a link in the show notes and help them test it.

1095
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,780
I myself will be doing this upgrade

1096
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,840
after enough of you throw yourselves on the sword

1097
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,680
testing this.

1098
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,480
I'm not going to try this one myself.

1099
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,400
I don't need to break the last remaining Neon systems I have.

1100
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,520
And in their post on community.kd.org,

1101
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,660
they say it's likely to break your system right now.

1102
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,760
And it's gotten better over the last few days.

1103
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,920
I've been following the Telegram conversation around this.

1104
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,940
It's a full-fledged upgrade.

1105
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,680
And I advise caution.

1106
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,640
But if you're willing to try it so that way I don't have to,

1107
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,360
it's available for you.

1108
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,640
Brian, what desktop environment are you on over there?

1109
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,960
Are you a gnome guy?

1110
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, no.

1111
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,840
KDE.

1112
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,800
Really?

1113
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,480
And that's actually a recent thing for me.

1114
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400
I was on, and don't hold me against this

1115
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,240
if you feel strongly about it, but I

1116
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,600
was doing Cinnamon for a long time

1117
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,280
and suggesting that to a lot of people.

1118
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,880
But I've had my eye on KDE since forever, maybe 10 years,

1119
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,560
and just sort of tracking what they were doing.

1120
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,480
And I felt like, OK, I'm going to jump.

1121
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,040
So about a year ago, sure enough, did that.

1122
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,400
And like you are discovering now, there's no looking back.

1123
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,160
I'm really enjoying it.

1124
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,300
It's just super slick.

1125
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,880
It does exactly what I need.

1126
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,040
It does a lot more, but it just gets out of the way.

1127
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,360
And so that's me.

1128
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,120
I, for some reason, did not know that.

1129
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,160
Last time I talked, I don't know if that came up.

1130
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,960
But that's interesting to hear.

1131
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,000
Because you were using, let's see, when you were here at JB,

1132
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,680
you did use a KDE desktop to do the photo stuff, as I recall.

1133
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,280
Right at home.

1134
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,320
Yeah.

1135
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,640
I hadn't even thought about it.

1136
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
That's why I didn't complain about it.

1137
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,720
Yeah, it's funny you didn't.

1138
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,960
You just got right to work, actually.

1139
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,480
I got a link in the show notes for you guys to check out.

1140
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,160
It's just worth mentioning.

1141
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,160
There's not really a lot to it, but Google

1142
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,320
has completely ignored Windows in their release of a VR video

1143
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,160
editor, a virtual reality video editor.

1144
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,920
It's mostly for 180 perspective video.

1145
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,920
But they released it for Linux and Mac, but not

1146
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,880
Windows for a VR video editor.

1147
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,360
Now, what does that mean?

1148
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Maybe nothing.

1149
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,960
Maybe nothing.

1150
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,560
But I thought it was worth mentioning.

1151
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,480
And if you're interested in grabbing a VR editor,

1152
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,200
maybe like Wimpy might be, go check the show notes.

1153
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,680
I'll have a link there.

1154
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,160
But Brent, you sent me this link to DigitalOcean's post

1155
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,760
about cracking the Enigma encryption in 13 minutes

1156
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,580
using 2,000 droplets.

1157
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,640
How great is this post?

1158
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,040
How great is this post, Brent?

1159
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,600
This entire post, and I have to say I came to it

1160
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,920
not directly from DigitalOcean, but a roundabout way.

1161
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,920
And when I saw that it was a DigitalOcean post,

1162
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
I thought, jeez, it's even better.

1163
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,920
And so this is an article that is wonderfully placed

1164
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,800
between the tech lover and everything DigitalOcean

1165
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,560
is capable of and more.

1166
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,480
It sounds like they pushed the boundaries here,

1167
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,080
but also some really neat historical challenges.

1168
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,400
Yeah.

1169
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,520
Of course, you guys are, when I say the Enigma machine,

1170
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,080
I bet you that everybody in the audience

1171
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,280
knows what I'm talking about.

1172
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,440
It was a complicated encryption system during World War II.

1173
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,200
The apparatus consisted of a keyboard, a set of rotors,

1174
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,240
an alphabet ring, and plug connections,

1175
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,240
all configurable by the operator.

1176
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,400
For the message to be both encrypted and decrypted,

1177
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,880
both operators had to know the two sets of codes.

1178
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,080
A daily base code changed every 24 hours,

1179
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,440
which was published monthly by the Germans.

1180
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,400
Then each operator created an individual setting

1181
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,240
used only for that message.

1182
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,360
The key to the individual code was

1183
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,040
sent in the first character of the message in a coded,

1184
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,080
and it was coded in the base.

1185
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,520
That then created over 53 billion possible combinations

1186
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,360
that changed every 24 hours.

1187
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,600
Because of this, the machine was widely

1188
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,160
considered unbreakable.

1189
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,040
Now, as you know, we did eventually crack it.

1190
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,600
Now, it still makes for a great challenge,

1191
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,640
especially when you're trying to get AI to crack it.

1192
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,240
So Lucas Kunzowicz, which I'm not sure

1193
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,780
on the pronunciation there, but he

1194
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,380
is the head of a data science division.

1195
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,400
He's Polish, and he was working on this problem.

1196
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,360
And he decided to recreate the most complicated version

1197
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,280
of the Enigma machine, the Nazi's Navy

1198
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,360
version of the machine, which was the most sophisticated

1199
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,340
iteration.

1200
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,720
His team started by recreating the machine's rotors and plugs

1201
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,080
in Python.

1202
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,440
In Python.

1203
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,840
Let's just take a moment and appreciate now

1204
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,560
that one of the most famous encryption machines

1205
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,400
from World War II has been recreated in Python.

1206
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,840
A moment here, if we will.

1207
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,400
And he recreated all of these functionalities in Python.

1208
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,160
Initially, they tried to teach their AI

1209
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
to decode the Enigma code itself,

1210
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,800
but it just didn't work.

1211
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,240
And they also tried to spin up lambda functions from Amazon

1212
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,400
to do the computation.

1213
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,080
But the problem was, lambda functions were not very quick.

1214
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,840
And some of the limits around execution time

1215
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,680
bit them in the arse.

1216
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,280
So they decided to keep pushing forward.

1217
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,040
They started blogging about this.

1218
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,800
And somebody at DigitalOcean noticed that this was a thing,

1219
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,000
contacted them, and quickly agreed

1220
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
to provide what they call their ML one-click droplets,

1221
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,200
their machine learning one-click droplets.

1222
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,400
It's like, you know, this is by one of their R&D engineers

1223
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,240
who noticed this.

1224
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,520
It's like, this is kind of what we do, guys.

1225
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,800
We're kind of like super focused on developers.

1226
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,380
You guys are developing code to do this.

1227
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,920
Just come over here.

1228
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,720
We'll consider this a marketing thing.

1229
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,760
So they worked with their R&D engineer.

1230
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,640
He set up these machine learning droplets.

1231
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,920
And they contacted DigitalOcean's help desk

1232
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,840
and said, hey, can you spin us up 1,000 droplets,

1233
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,960
1,000 droplets, 1,000 droplets.

1234
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,680
And they did it.

1235
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,420
They spun up 1,000 droplets for them in a day.

1236
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,380
And they call it, they have a cute name for it.

1237
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,600
They call it, they hydrated.

1238
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,760
They hydrated these droplets in one day.

1239
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,040
They hydrated 1,000 droplets.

1240
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,280
So it took the team about two weeks

1241
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,240
to train the machines to create the Python code.

1242
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,860
And then it took another couple of weeks

1243
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,560
before they had their first success.

1244
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,980
The way they train the machine learning, though, to read

1245
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,680
German is kind of weird.

1246
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,640
They fed the machine learning children's stories

1247
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,560
and a few military telegraphs and things like that.

1248
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,840
But fairy tales written in simple language,

1249
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,040
like Rumpelstiltskin, Cinderella, Grimm's Fairy

1250
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,320
Tales, Hansel and Gretzel, those plus 200 others

1251
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,540
were the data set.

1252
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,080
They fed the machine learning algorithms

1253
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,840
to pattern match German language.

1254
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,540
Really, it came down to simple language.

1255
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,520
Because these messages were generally short and very simple,

1256
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,000
it actually worked to train them on children's books.

1257
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,560
And really interestingly, at the end of the day,

1258
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,320
the German language wasn't understandable by the AI

1259
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,220
in any shape or form, but it could pattern match.

1260
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,280
It could pattern match.

1261
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,480
And so it didn't need to learn to speak German.

1262
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,120
It could pattern match.

1263
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,960
So they did that for two weeks.

1264
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,360
And they ran the Enigma code through 1,000 droplets.

1265
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,120
And after they trained it how to read German, or pattern match,

1266
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,800
I guess.

1267
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,200
And they threw 1,000 droplets at it.

1268
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,720
After 24 hours, they broke the Enigma code.

1269
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,960
And they were able to read the message.

1270
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,520
And that was interesting.

1271
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,160
That's not bad.

1272
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,120
But what if we threw another 1,000 droplets at it?

1273
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,520
What if we had 2,000 droplets to break this code?

1274
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,960
Once they threw 2,000 droplets, they

1275
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,520
were able to crack the code in 13 minutes, 13 minutes.

1276
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,800
But if you think about it, and this is the author.

1277
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,880
He says, you really have to accept the fact

1278
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,200
that even if you have 2,000 droplets,

1279
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,040
you still have billions of combinations to be checked.

1280
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,720
And the neural network that we used

1281
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,600
is really only good at spotting German language patterns.

1282
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,200
It's not a speed demon.

1283
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,440
And because it uses recurrence, which

1284
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,160
gives us a boost when dealing with languages,

1285
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,120
but you pay with calculation time.

1286
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,960
So for the AI to shine, we actually had to use 2,000

1287
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,000
droplets to do all the tedious work.

1288
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,240
Everybody praises AI.

1289
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,560
But it was actually the droplets that did 99% of the work.

1290
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,120
Like, right?

1291
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,840
We wrote one minion in Python.

1292
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,000
And then DigitalOcean has a very nice API for storing images.

1293
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,280
So you create one minion.

1294
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,600
And then you tell DigitalOcean, create this as an image.

1295
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,420
And then please, go create 2,000 copies of this image.

1296
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,560
And it's off.

1297
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,320
The code simply just runs.

1298
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,380
But because we could add more systems,

1299
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,040
it meant there was no state.

1300
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,840
They were not coordinated in any way.

1301
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,620
Each minion doesn't know anything about the others.

1302
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,980
They're fully autonomous.

1303
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,240
And that's great.

1304
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,600
Because it means we can have 200.

1305
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,200
We can have 2,000.

1306
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,680
We can even have 20,000 of them.

1307
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,800
The more we have, the less time that it

1308
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,600
takes to break the Enigma code.

1309
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,360
Wow.

1310
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,720
And the hard numbers here?

1311
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,600
The 2,000 virtual servers ran through 41 million combinations

1312
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,560
per second.

1313
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,000
It took them 13 minutes for the minions to do the work.

1314
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,240
That's a lot of Python.

1315
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,280
That's a good one, Brent.

1316
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,520
I love how they call the servers minions.

1317
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,640
Yeah, that's good.

1318
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,280
That's good.

1319
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,600
And it really shows you how easily

1320
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,120
that these things are going to be cracked in the future.

1321
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,120
When you can just deploy 2,000 droplets,

1322
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,560
it's just a whole other game.

1323
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,920
It's really a whole other game.

1324
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Why don't we mention DigitalOcean right here,

1325
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,440

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,220
do.co slash unplugged.

1329
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,440
Now, DigitalOcean is an easier way to deploy servers.

1330
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,120
It's a way to get infrastructure on demand.

1331
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,280
Now, I could tell you that.

1332
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,560
But why not have the professionals

1333
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,760
with great voices tell you?

1334
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,040
DigitalOcean's cloud computing platform

1335
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,400

It's true.

1358
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,320
My favorite rig is $0.03 an hour.

1359
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,320
They've got these flexible droplets now,

1360

They have a great setup with a fantastic dashboard.

1362
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,160
Also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean

1363
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,200
for sponsoring the Unplugged program now for years.

1364
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,960
And while I'm giving out thanks, let me thank Linux Academy,

1365
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,860

is going to get way more valuable.

1373
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,020
In July, they're launching 150 new challenges and content

1374
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,120
and courses.

1375
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
And some of the new topics they're launching

1376
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,520
are going to get your attention.

1377
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,800
I know you've been thinking about security a lot lately.

1378
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,080
So have I, and so has Linux Academy.

1379
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,000
And they're stepping up.

1380
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,040
They're also helping you get a salt stack certification

1381
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,360
and the Red Hat certification of expertise

1382
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,480
in virtualization and architect full support.

1383
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,560
They also have an AWS security specialist certification

1384
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,480
courseware now and, speaking of Lambda, a Lambda deep dive.

1385
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,800
And that's like four things out of over 150 new things

1386
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,880
that are launching at Linux Academy.

1387
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,760
They're going crazy.

1388
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,440
They're going nuts.

1389
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,840
Linux Academy is blowing out the doors.

1390
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,680
Crazy Linux Academy is going to give away a seven-day free trial

1391
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,560
when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1392
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,520
Now, they're doing a live stream to celebrate the big giveaway.

1393
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,280
And I just am super nervous about this.

1394
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,080
In fact, I'm going to fly down to Linux Academy.

1395
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,320
They're going to pay for it.

1396
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,780
But I'm going to fly down there to help

1397
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,820
make sure the stream goes well because it's all on Linux.

1398
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,960
It's the whole new OBS setup that I did for them.

1399
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,460
And now they're going to do this big content

1400
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,960
launch on the OBS system.

1401
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,380
I'm a little nervous, but I'm also crazy, crazy excited

1402
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,700
because I've heard what they're working on.

1403
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,200
I saw the effort.

1404
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,440
And I'm going to go down there because they're not

1405
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,520
paying me to do it other than paying for my flight

1406
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,200
because I just really am excited about what they're doing.

1407
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,660
I think it's great.

1408
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,440
And it's going to bring even more people

1409
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,940
into Linux and open source.

1410
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,840
So linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

1411
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,320
where you go to get started.

1412
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,160
And then you can also read over on their blog

1413
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,240
about all of the new stuff that's coming.

1414
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,760
It's a big, big deal.

1415
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,880
And I'm going to be there to help them announce it all

1416
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,440
and grok it all.

1417
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,920
So if you're in the Texas area, I'm

1418
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,920
going to be there again in about a week or two, about two weeks.

1419
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,920
Because the big announcement, the big live stream

1420
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,720
is on July 10.

1421
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,800
And I'm going to get down there around the 8th or so

1422
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,880
in the Dallas area.

1423
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,880
And I'm going to need to have dinner on the 9th.

1424
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,680
So if you're in the area and want to get dinner July 9th,

1425
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,280
let me know.

1426
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,820
I'll be in the Dallas Keller area, Fort Worth, really.

1427
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,400
Let's do it.

1428
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,800
Because I'm going down there again

1429
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,920
to make sure this thing's a success.

1430
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,600
Because damn if I'm not going to switch a company to Linux

1431
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,680
and then not back it up.

1432
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,380
So I hope you tune in live to watch how it all goes.

1433
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,800
And if you're a Linux Academy subscriber or if you're not one

1434
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,480
yet, go check it out, linuxacademy.com

1435
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,640
slash unplugged.

1436
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,800
Also, a huge thank you to Ting for making my entire road trip

1437
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,640
to Texas and back possible.

1438
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,960
I'm in Seattle again.

1439
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,100
And the month that I was away doing shows on the road

1440
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,280
was powered by Ting.

1441
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,220
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

1442
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,800
And damn if I didn't leverage the hell out of that.

1443
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,040
It's $6 a month for what you want, just one line.

1444
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,640
Boom, $6 a month.

1445
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,680
Then you just pay for your usage on top

1446
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,720
of that, your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1447
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,320
However much you talk, text, and data you use, you pay for.

1448
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,700
It's a fair price regardless.

1449
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,160
And they have nationwide coverage.

1450
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,860
And like I said, they've got two networks.

1451
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,320
So there's a lot of devices you can bring.

1452
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,020
Check their BYOD page.

1453
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,720
There's no contracts, no service agreements,

1454
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,160
or no weird loopholes where they try to get you

1455
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,400
for a couple of years.

1456
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,200
And they've got the best control panel

1457
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,040
in the business for mobile.

1458
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,520
So check it out by going to linux.ting.com.

1459
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,880
That'll take $25 off your first device.

1460
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,800
Oh, and it'll give you $25 in service credit

1461
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,760
if you bring a device.

1462
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,280
And they've got a lot of compatible devices.

1463
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,800
I'm just saying.

1464
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,420
Now every now and then, Crazy Ting has a crazy deal.

1465
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,000
And they're blowing out the doors right now with $1 SIM

1466
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,720
cards.

1467
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,480
I'm serious.

1468
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,040
This is it.

1469
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,280
This is what no one I tell you about all the time.

1470
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,200
Go buy 10 of them.

1471
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,280
Seriously, go buy 10 of them.

1472
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,560
Why not?

1473
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,680
They're a dollar a SIM card.

1474
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,880
And they don't even charge you until you activate them.

1475
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,200
And then when you do activate them, they're $6.

1476
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,280
So both Noah and I load up on these suckers.

1477
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,680
I just bought five of them.

1478
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,720
Go buy 10 of them.

1479
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,600
Seriously.

1480
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,360
I bought five of them because I'm poor.

1481
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,940
But if you can afford 10 bucks, go buy 10 of them.

1482
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,480
Because you can put them in your bag.

1483
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,520
You can hand them out to people.

1484
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,400
You're in an event.

1485
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,100
Nothing says a baller like you're handing out data.

1486
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,540
So go get the GSM SIM.

1487
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,480
Go get the CDMA SIM, whatever you're about.

1488
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,320
I don't care.

1489
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,760
But the $1 deal on the Ting SIMs is about once a year.

1490
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,520
And hallelujah, it is here.

1491
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,720
So go grab it.

1492
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,040
But first, start by going to linux.ting.com.

1493
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,280
linux.ting.com.

1494
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,000
So a big thank you to DigitalOcean,

1495
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,760
a big thank you to Linux Academy,

1496
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,920
and a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com,

1497
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,280
for sponsoring this here episode of your unplugged program,

1498
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,120
linux.ting.com.

1499
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,080
All right, back to the news we go.

1500
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,440
Brent, have you noticed the uptick in positive coverage

1501
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,960
around Firefox OS?

1502
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,200
I have in the show notes a link to a New York Times article.

1503
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,960
Headline, Firefox is back.

1504
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,560
It's time to give it a try.

1505
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,520
In the freaking New York Times, Brent.

1506
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,680
How about that?

1507
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,040
You sent me this article, and I didn't think it was real.

1508
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,640
But I love it.

1509
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,120
I love it.

1510
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,960
It's great.

1511
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,320
That's a funny way to put it.

1512
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,120
Yeah, when I first saw it, too, I was like,

1513
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,640
that's not the New York Times.

1514
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,160
That's something else.

1515
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,120
Yeah, and they make the case.

1516
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,480
They talk about how the web has become a dumpster fire.

1517
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,920
Of course, they have a bit of an interest

1518
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,760
there as an advertising-based company.

1519
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,780
But they say Mozilla recently hit the reset button

1520
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,200
on Firefox about two years ago.

1521
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,800
Again, this is the freaking gray lady here.

1522
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,440
About two years ago, six Mozilla employees

1523
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,940
were huddled around a bonfire one night

1524
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,280
in Santa Cruz, California, when they

1525
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,800
begun discussing the state of web browsers.

1526
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,560
Eventually, they concluded there was a crisis of confidence

1527
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,880
in the web.

1528
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,040
They write, if they don't trust the web,

1529
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,360
they won't use the web.

1530
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,780
That was Mozilla's chief product officer.

1531
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,120
They just felt to us like, actually, it

1532
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,080
might be the direction we're going, that people

1533
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,280
might stop using the web.

1534
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,040
So we started to think about tools and architectures that

1535
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,280
brought a different approach.

1536
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,960
Now Firefox is back there, right?

1537
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,760
Mozilla released a new version late last year,

1538
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,840
codenamed Quantum.

1539
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,080
It's sleekly designed and fast.

1540
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,120
Mozilla said the revamped Firefox

1541
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,840
consumes less memory than the competition,

1542
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,440
meaning you can fire up lots of tabs,

1543
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,160
and browsing will still feel butterly smooth.

1544
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,680
That's about as positive as it could possibly

1545
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,440
get when you got the old gray lady writing about a web

1546
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,760
browser, don't you think, Brent?

1547
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,840
That doesn't get any better.

1548
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,080
It feels to me like it's not actually the New York

1549
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,200
Times that wrote that.

1550
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
And they just write it.

1551
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,480
It feels like, oh, yeah, oh, this is easy content,

1552
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,480
feels really good.

1553
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,200
And we're getting an audience that we don't typically get.

1554
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,040
So maybe it's a win for everyone.

1555
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,680
The Verge has got a podcast.

1556
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,400
And in their podcast, they had an interview

1557
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,720
with the Pocket CEO.

1558
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,360
Pocket, as everybody knows, is baked into Firefox now.

1559
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,360
So Nate Wiener went on the new Verge podcast, the Converge

1560
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,600
podcast, and he said that they're

1561
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,720
going to try something radical, something new, something

1562
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,760
unheard of in the industry.

1563
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,000
They're going to process your local data

1564
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,760
to figure out what you like.

1565
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,680
What?

1566
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,720
By analyzing the articles and videos people save into Pocket,

1567
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Wiener believes the company can show people

1568
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,080
the best of the web in a personalized way

1569
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,120
without building an all-knowing Facebook-style profile

1570
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,200
of the user.

1571
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,980
They call it a personalization system within Firefox.

1572
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,380
And I grabbed a clip from that interview in the Verge

1573
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,200
podcast.

1574
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,120
Yeah, we're testing this really cool personalization system

1575
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,480
within Firefox, where it uses your browser history

1576
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,760
to target, like, personalize, but none of that data

1577
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,280
actually comes back to Pocket or Mozilla.

1578
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,440
It all happens on the client inside the browser itself.

1579
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Because there is this notion today, I feel like, that,

1580
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,960
and I feel like you saw it in the Zuckerberg hearings.

1581
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,760
It was like, oh, users, they will give us

1582
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,960
their data in return for a better experience.

1583
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,040
And there's like, that's the premise, right?

1584
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,440
But I feel like, yes, you could do that,

1585
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,720
but we don't feel like that is the required premise,

1586
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,640
that there are ways to build these things where

1587
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,240
you don't have to trade your life profile in order

1588
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,760
to actually get a good experience.

1589
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,360
Oh, if that isn't music to my ears.

1590
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,640
So they can use what people are saving

1591
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,600
to Pocket and your local browsing history

1592
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,760
and do the computation on device, which he goes on

1593
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,920
to say later in the interview is how they're doing it.

1594
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,880
They're looking at your web browsing history

1595
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,560
on your device, all local.

1596
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,400
None of it's being sent to Mozilla and comparing that

1597
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,240
with what people are sharing in Pocket,

1598
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,200
or saving, I should say, in Pocket.

1599
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,760
And without ever having to build a huge online profile of you,

1600
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,240
they're able to determine what you might be interested in.

1601
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,320
I love this.

1602
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,320
I know Pocket is controversial, Brent, but I love this.

1603
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,360
It sounds almost like they're pushing in the right directions.

1604
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,760
It's a nice mix of features that they're offering the user,

1605
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,680
but also some privacy consciousness that

1606
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,240
is refreshing, really.

1607
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,040
Yeah.

1608
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,680
Yeah.

1609
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,640
It shouldn't be.

1610
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,880
You know what I mean?

1611
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,600
At this point.

1612
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
It should be the standard, right?

1613
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,120
Yeah.

1614
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,720
It should be.

1615
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,520
But it does feel refreshing.

1616
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,040
That's a good way to put it.

1617
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,200
Speaking of refreshing, Debian has been refreshed.

1618
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,320
There is an update out there for those of you

1619
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,640
still using Debian 8, Jesse.

1620
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,440
Now, this is the last release.

1621
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,040
It's the end of the line for Jesse.

1622
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,320
So this is your public service announcement right here

1623
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,200
on the show.

1624
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,440
I know.

1625
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,320
I know it's working fine for you, and you love it.

1626
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,160
But look, your buddy Chris is just the messenger.

1627
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,640
It's time to move on.

1628
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,720
Why not upgrade to Debian 9, perhaps?

1629
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,440
Now, the 8.11 release has a number

1630
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,680
of bug fixes and security issues,

1631
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,160
and it's shipping a new Nvidia graphics driver.

1632
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,520
So you get some life out of it, but it's the end of the line.

1633
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,720
It's really time for those of you still running Debian Jesse

1634
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,280
to upgrade to version 9.

1635
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,680
Because really, in terms of Debian,

1636
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,880
10 is just around the corner.

1637
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,480
Buster is kind of tentatively scheduled for a release

1638
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,920
from a year from now.

1639
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,120
So it's time to upgrade on the Debian scale of things.

1640
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,620
Now, I don't think there's much wrong with MP3 these days.

1641
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,760
Now that the patents have expired,

1642
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,280
I'm more of a fan of MP3 than I ever have been.

1643
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,840
You combine that with the crazy industry support from services

1644
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,440
to hardware that MP3 seems to enjoy,

1645
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,920
it's never going to be replaced.

1646
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,600
Even when something better comes along, perhaps like Opus.

1647
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,240
However, there is still a gap in the market for audiobooks

1648
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,120
or really long podcasts, two, three, four-hour podcasts,

1649
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,420
or longer.

1650
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,920
There's not a good codec for that.

1651
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,760
Opus isn't great for it either.

1652
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,800
And our friends over at Alphonic,

1653
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,040
which I'm going to tell you more about here in a moment,

1654
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,800
you can find it at A-U-P-H-O-N-I-C.com.

1655
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,120
Alphonic, it's German.

1656
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,560
They have an idea called Codec 2.

1657
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,840
Codec 2 is an open source designed for speech,

1658
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,640
and it aims for compression rates between 700 bits

1659
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,400
per second all the way up to 3,200 bits per second.

1660
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,160
So it's really, really low bandwidth.

1661
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,700
The man behind it is David Rowe.

1662
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,600
He's an electronics engineer currently

1663
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,280
living in South Australia.

1664
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,060
He started the project in September of 2009,

1665
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:50,120
with the main aim of improving low cost radio

1666
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:54,040
communications for people living in remote areas of the world.

1667
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,520
With this in mind, he set out to develop

1668
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,840
a codec that would significantly reduce

1669
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,440
file sizes and bandwidth required when streaming.

1670
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,080
Let's check in some boxes.

1671
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,740
Rowe's perceived applications included VoIP trunking,

1672
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:14,280
voiceover low bandwidth, HF and VHF digital radios,

1673
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,880
as well as worldwide remote area communications,

1674
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,040
including military, police, and emergency services.

1675
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,480
But Alphonic believes that it could

1676
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,920
be used for long podcasts, presentations,

1677
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,440
like talks at events, and audio books,

1678
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,480
allowing for low storage and minimizing the effect

1679
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,680
of bad network connections.

1680
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,120
I think this is great, and I want

1681
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
to tell you why I'm giving this so much credence.

1682
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
It's from Alphonic.

1683
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,080
And these guys, they really know audio.

1684
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,960
They know audio so well that at the beginning of this year,

1685
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,680
I switched out the entire Jupiter broadcasting backend

1686
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,900
encoding system to Alphonic.

1687
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,240
You probably noticed this maybe if you have a really tuned ear.

1688
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,320
Our compression has sounded better recently

1689
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,840
in the last three or four months.

1690
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,760
You've also probably noticed chapter markers

1691
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,040
in our podcasts, like this very here podcast.

1692
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,520
Chapter markers and those features.

1693
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,720
Also, the new YouTube videos that YouTubers don't really

1694
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,720
like, but the ones that are automatically generated

1695
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,980
with our album art that get published to YouTube

1696
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,160
automatically from the main edited podcast file.

1697
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,200
All of that is powered by Alphonic,

1698
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,400
the service we are using now.

1699
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,280
And that was the final piece that made us 100% Linux, too,

1700
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,140
by the way.

1701
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,640
I do plan to document all of this

1702
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,840
at some point for the studio.

1703
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,640
But the last bit, when we converted the entire studio

1704
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,680
over to Linux, was we still had a Mac in the role of editing

1705
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,600
and encoding for commercial software purposes for editing

1706
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,280
and encoding purposes for software

1707
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,480
that could add chapter markers.

1708
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,520
We were able to convert the editing,

1709
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,760
and now we have been able to convert

1710
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,480
the encoding using Alphonic.

1711
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,640
And I can tell you, as somebody who's been encoding podcasts

1712
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:03,000
for 13 years, these guys have a great algorithm.

1713
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,360
They have a great sound.

1714
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,680
They have a great system.

1715
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,320
It's a super good service that does way more than just

1716
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,760
encode and upload video.

1717
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,240
It does way more than that.

1718
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,960
And if you're a podcaster, and you're

1719
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,160
struggling with chapter markers, and you're

1720
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,180
struggling with audio encoding, and you

1721
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,320
want to publish to YouTube and SFTP and other services

1722
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:28,520
like Libsyn, check out Alphonic, A-U-P-H-O-N-I-C.com.

1723
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,560
Not open source, but the back end runs on Linux,

1724
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,840
and they make it possible for us Linux podcasters

1725
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,600
to do a complete 100% Linux solution.

1726
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,520
And now they're throwing their weight

1727
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,480
behind Codec 2, the podcast on a floppy disk codec.

1728
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,560
I'm all about it.

1729
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,000
I love Opus.

1730
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,380
I love MP3.

1731
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,960
I even think AAC is great.

1732
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,760
But there is room for that audio book length

1733
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,360
podcast or audio book that is just super long, four

1734
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,600
plus hours.

1735
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,320
That's where our current codecs just kind of fall down.

1736
01:10:59,320 --> 01:10:59,920
What do you think, Brent?

1737
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,040
Am I crazy, or is this something you've run into yourself?

1738
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,800
Well, some thoughts I had around that

1739
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,440
was building giant libraries for ourselves.

1740
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,720
If we're collecting content, especially audio books

1741
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,920
are getting everywhere these days.

1742
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,400
And sometimes that's the limit on some of these devices

1743
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,840
that we own is space.

1744
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,680
And so if you're able to hold, let's say,

1745
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,120
a whole year's library worth of books,

1746
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,320
audio books, on the devices that you take on a plane

1747
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,720
or something like that, then all of a sudden you

1748
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,400
don't need to buy devices as often,

1749
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,120
perhaps, if that's your main limitation.

1750
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,840
I know a lot of standard everyday users.

1751
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,320
Fair enough, fair enough, yeah.

1752
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,640
Yeah, you just want to have your own big library of,

1753
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,280
I probably own 300 Audible books.

1754
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,880
And it's not lost on me that they're all wrapped up

1755
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,800
in the Audible DRM.

1756
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,560
If there was a solution that wasn't Windows based

1757
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,960
to rip that DRM out, I'd probably rip it out and just

1758
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,880
store them somewhere.

1759
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,320
And if I had a codec that was better for keeping them

1760
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,520
long term, I absolutely would use it.

1761
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,840
So that's a great point.

1762
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,680
We're almost done.

1763
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,600
Just one last story for the day.

1764
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,440
I wanted to talk about GitLab because after Microsoft's

1765
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,520
purchase of GitHub, it's been a huge, huge topic

1766
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,840
of conversation.

1767
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,160
And without missing a beat this week,

1768
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,800
GitLab announced that they're moving off of Azure

1769
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,320
and they're switching to Google Cloud, which

1770
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,280
I think makes a lot of sense.

1771
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,280
But they've also released their auto DevOps management system.

1772
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,680
Now, that sounds fancy, right?

1773
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,560
Auto DevOps?

1774
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,920
I didn't know what it meant.

1775
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,080
So I had an opportunity in last week's Coda Radio,

1776
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,360
episode 313, to ask the GitLab CEO what

1777
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,080
is auto DevOps in our interview with him.

1778
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,360
And here's what he had to say.

1779
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,920
Now, a little birdie tells me, speaking

1780
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,800
of some of those features, that there's

1781
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,840
something called auto DevOps that's coming along.

1782
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,240
And I was wondering if you could share little details

1783
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,960
about auto DevOps.

1784
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,960
Yeah, so we're really, really bullish on auto DevOps.

1785
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,560
On a week from now, June 22, we'll release GitLab 11.0.

1786
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,800
And auto DevOps will be generally available.

1787
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,160
And what you do is you just push your code

1788
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,720
and GitLab does the rest.

1789
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,880
It will build your code, run your tests, check the quality,

1790
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,640
do static application security testing, dependency scanning,

1791
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,040
license management, container scanning.

1792
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,560
It will boot up a review app, kind

1793
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,440
of like a staging environment, per merge request,

1794
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,240
dynamic application security testing, and deploy it.

1795
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,120
It will do browser performance testing,

1796
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,840
and it will do monitoring of all the vital metrics.

1797
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,480
So all of that just by pushing your code,

1798
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,280
nothing to configure.

1799
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,120
We think that is the future, and we're

1800
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,360
really excited about having it out to the world.

1801
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,800
Doesn't that sound fascinating?

1802
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,400
They're just hustling.

1803
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,120
It was a great interview we had with the GitLab CEO.

1804
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,720
Go check out coder.show slash 313

1805
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,360
if you'd like to get the entire thing.

1806
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,760
Sid is really sharp.

1807
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:59,000
He talks about how 100% of the GitLab staff are remote.

1808
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,400
And of course, because it would be negligent if I didn't,

1809
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,560
I asked him what his thoughts were on the whole Microsoft

1810
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,860
purchasing GitHub thing and how that is going

1811
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,760
to affect GitLab long term.

1812
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,080
So again, go check that out, coder.show slash 313

1813
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,520
if you want to hear that full interview.

1814
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,600
Brent, man, thank you for making it today.

1815
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,740
I don't know what your availability looks like,

1816
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,360
but if you are around next Tuesday,

1817
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,720
I would more than be happy to have you join us again.

1818
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,000
I don't see any reason not to hang out

1819
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,920
with everybody on Tuesdays.

1820
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,420
Atta boy.

1821
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:27,920
You know what?

1822
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,080
Everybody, everybody, everybody should have that philosophy.

1823
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,400
In fact, you could.

1824
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,080
If you go over to our IRC room, you can get the secret details.

1825
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,560
But if you just Google Jupiter colony mumble,

1826
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,800
you'll probably find it.

1827
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,560
But if you're in our IRC room, irc.geekshed.net pound

1828
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,960
hashtag Jupiter broadcasting, you can chat during the show,

1829
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,240
and you can also do bang mumble and get the mumble info.

1830
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,040
And then you can join our virtual lug,

1831
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,760
just like many folks did, like Ian and Dusty and many others.

1832
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,040
You can find out all of that at the Jupiter colony site

1833
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,280
or in our IRC chat room.

1834
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,480
We do this show live on a Tuesday.

1835
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,280
You're more than welcome to join us.

1836
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,840
Get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com

1837
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,720
slash calendar.

1838
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,600
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode.

1839
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,640
Links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com,

1840
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,920
as well as our subscribe links.

1841
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,880
Thanks for being here.

1842
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,680
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1843
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:49,040
Bye.

1844
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:56,480
Oh, there we go, Brent.

1845
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:01,000
We're officially in over, or not overtime, in post-show.

1846
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Overtime's for something else.

1847
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,840
Thank you, sir, for making it.

1848
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,840
Appreciate it.

1849
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,440
Now we need everybody to go to JBtitles.com and vote their heart out, because there's

1850
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,680
a lot of good titles, 36 titles over there.

1851
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,680
There's some good ones.

1852
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,480
Fedora to the core, at a drop of a hat, contained in a pocket.

1853
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,000
Get your pocket, quantum is a sign of the times.

1854
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,320
Oh, get it?

1855
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,320
Do you get it?

1856
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
That's good, right?

1857
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,880
That's so good.

1858
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,840
I got to make good, I want to do on the show, because there's so many web apps we use these

1859
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:40,640
days that I never, ever, ever have talked about Netafire, and it is a wrong that I must

1860
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,240
write right now.

1861
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:46,740
It's NPM, so you got to have all the NPM stuff installed, which is pretty straightforward

1862
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,300
these days, on any given Linux distro.

1863
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,720
But it's called Netafire, and it does exactly what you're probably guessing, is it takes

1864
01:16:53,720 --> 01:17:01,520
like a web application and makes it a standalone, like Node.js style, Electron app.

1865
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,520
Catch your breath.

1866
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:08,380
So take for example, you want to take Google Docs, or in my case, IRC Cloud, or something

1867
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:13,440
else that you always have to use in the damn browser, and you'd like to just have it as

1868
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,560
a standalone application on your desktop that gets its own taskbar entry.

1869
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,560
That's where Netafire comes in, and it's just NPM installed, Netafire-G, I'll have a link

1870
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,200
in the show notes, it's solid.

1871
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,160
I've been using it now for months to run IRC Cloud, to run Source Connect, to run a whole

1872
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,440
bunch of other stuff.

1873
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,760
I just want to give it a plug right now, Netafire, if you're stuck using web applications that

1874
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,320
you really would rather have their own damn desktop entry, check out Netafire.

1875
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,640
I think it's pretty good stuff.
