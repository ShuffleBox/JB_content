1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,160
This is great that the WikiLeaks just sent out that one the this one tweet from the OSB projects

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, yeah, OSB projects y'all. This is from the CIA's own documents. You know we got all the dankest Trojans

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,180
No, I didn't see that. That's amazing. Oh there it is. Yeah, I've ever read the dankest Trojans Wow

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,340
You know we got all the dankest Trojans

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,340
Oh

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,100
My god, I'm gonna work for the CIA now. Yeah, well, maybe maybe that's why they got some good hackers

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,340
They're actually fun on the inside. I mean sure on the outside. They're all about killing and droning but on the inside

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,340
They got the dankest Trojans

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:49,820
You got the dankest Trojans. This is Linux Unplugged episode 187 for March 7th, 2017

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,540
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's very well traveled this week with stories from all about my name is Chris

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,060
My name is Wes. Hello there Wes. You look very dapper today, sir. Thank you. It is a big show

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,460
Oh, yeah, so much stuff

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,780
We of course as has been tradition for now three weeks in a row are gonna start with some wolf blitzer style breaking news

14
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,300
We're gonna get all blitzer up in here cover some big news and how it applies to Linux

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,940
Everybody's talking about it this week. Then. Mr. Brian Lunduke will stop by the show. He's actually secret spoiler already here

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,980
I'm gonna talk a little bit about the last the final

17
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,420
Linux sucks

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,380
It's an end of an era. We'll get the inside scoop on what's going on. I suspect

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,460
It's all about his hairdo now later on in the show. We're gonna hear from mr. Wimpy and mr

20
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,700
Popey about their trip to mobile world Congress and then if that's not enough if that's not enough like, you know

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,020
We got a little scale in there a little mobile world Congress. We're gonna get you amped up about odd camp 17 what?

22
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,820
Then we're gonna work back to scale

23
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,940
We're gonna go to the gnome booth and talk to the gnome guys about some of the stuff

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:11,060
They've been working on why they like endless OS the new endless OS PC. I think it's called the mission

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,420
Yeah, so Noah got to see it. He got to talk to the guys at the booth

26
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,900
We're gonna play an interview from that and then at the end of the show

27
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,040
New piece of hardware touting elementary OS by default. However, the elementary OS project

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,100
Super silent on the issue kind of like they don't want any attention on it and the hardware

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,780
It looks like it might be a bit of a scam not sure exactly what's going on

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,160
But producer Michaels been following the story from the very beginning

31
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,360
Asking questions getting the inside scoop. So we'll dig into that and talk about the light or I'm sorry the little light

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,300
I think it's called the light book which is a $250 Linux laptop. Is it too good to be true a

33
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,500
$250 Linux laptop preloaded with elementary OS but before we can get into any of that

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,760
We must say hello to our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,540
So everyone it is a big news day today and it's if you've been following any of the news have any of news outlets

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,380
I mean, they're all just I'm sure just talking about in great detail. Well, maybe a little bit of detail

37
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,860
Maybe maybe not as much detail. Yeah, so it's up to us then it's up to us

38
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,420
It is it is our duty to go wolf blitzer on this

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,720
We're gonna do a little breaking news right here on the show

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,500
So this morning a little earlier than expected Richard Stallman was once again proven, correct

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,780
In fact, this isn't even I don't have to point this out WikiLeaks tweeted this DNU founder Richard Stallman its famous quote

42
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,640
resonates today at WikiLeaks publication

43
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,540
with software

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,100
There are only two possibilities either the users control the program or the program controls the users if the program controls the users

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,540
And the developer controls the program then the program is an instrument of unjust power

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,580
Now I this is this is sort of a pungent. Is that the right word a pungent smells a little bad

47
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,180
It's really no you never like to hear this because you know

48
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,020
Everybody has well except for I I want to be able to play games or well except for I want to be able to record

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Video and ProRes or except I want to be able to make phone calls on my iPhone

50
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,800
Everybody has these these little accepts where they don't want to give on this particular quote and then something happens

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,900
It seems like every cup every couple of months and this quote comes back up

52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,740
And it's more right and more true and more correct than ever and it just stings

53
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,080
It just tastes bad a little bit cuz like damn it. Damn it. He's right

54
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,380
He might eat toe jam, but he is right today WikiLeaks revealed vault 7 a

55
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,620
Whole batch of CIA crap. Yeah, like almost 8,000. Yeah. Yeah over 8,000 over

56
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
8,000 documents Wes and

57
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,520
And it has it has been dubbed the year of zero

58
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,160
Yeah, you're zero which is I probably in reference to all of the zero-day exploits that are contained in this

59
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,860
So there is actually something in here. That's a little applicable to Linux. I'm gonna save the most you know most of this for

60
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,100
Unfilter or tech snapper wherever wherever it may lie as we go through it

61
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,860
but one thing I thought was interesting and it just came out today is the CIA has malware that

62
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,840
It's pretty sweet because it can target Windows OS 10

63
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,720
Linux or some hardware routers

64
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,700
It's called hive and it's a multi-platform

65
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,300
Automated malware attack and control system. Oh also Solaire's shouldn't I shouldn't forget Solaire's and

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,940
It it's also related to the cutthroat and swindle tools

67
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Wow first of all I love the names cutthroat swindle hive totally love the name

68
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,460
I think all of this is great, and it goes into more detail in fact

69
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,620
They have and I have these linked in the show notes

70
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Guides on how to use this

71
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,020
Developer guides end-user guy nice documentation really good information about how I see MP

72
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,180
Pings and air ICMP errors work, and which ISPs might reject them quite fascinating actually they've done some good work here

73
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,120
It's it's remarkable to read through this and go okay, so everything you kind of suspected is

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,600
Probably true that conspiracy that you thought was totally out there and crazy now

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,160
It looks like it's more and more true every day there was software there

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,080
They have supposedly tools in here that help them target computer systems in cars. Oh, yeah, totally

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
That's something a lot of people have suspected before

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,260
Mr.. Lundic you and I were talking about this before the show anything about anything in the vault 7 leaks Brian jump out at you

79
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,200
is either preposterous or

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,280
Fascinating in the context of Linux or just worth noting

81
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,720
There's only really one thing that's worth noting in all of this and that is that the CIA has the dankest Trojan yes

82
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah, I

83
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,940
Love that that is that is true, and you can't deny it now

84
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,680
I mean if they didn't they would they be doing their job they make the NSA look like a bunch of middle schoolers

85
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,520
Right they do come on CIA is like we want our own exploits

86
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
We're not going through those guys giving them our operational deets

87
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,960
This is how the CIA talks because they're soups hip they're soups hip so they go out there

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Go what a totes get our own zero days, and they're gonna be the dankest zero days

89
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,800
They're kind of talking like Trump a little bit. It's a little Trump Ian in the way. There's down

90
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,840
This is all all new relevant stuff to

91
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
from

92
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
2013 to

93
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,280
2016 is wait a minute wait a minute Chris Christopher Fisher

94
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,880
I got to call you out for a second here go for it now

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm not the biggest Trump fan in the world

96
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,440
But I don't believe I've ever heard Donald Trump get up on stage and say damn that is dank all

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,600
I would like that, but I don't believe he's done that so I'm gonna call Shanann can we wait and hope I mean

98
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,980
Maybe it's only just started. We totally it's the first hundred days man. It's the first hundred days, so you never know

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,480
That's the new distraction so yeah 2013 to 2016 is where this documents are from

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
It sounds like they got it

101
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,320
essentially because people were passing this stuff loosey-goosey around the government at this point and so people inside the government got it over to

102
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,280
WikiLeaks

103
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,200
They've been sitting on it for a little bit. There was some discussion in the last few weeks. I think it was even just

104
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,760
Last week Julian Assange, so they would get it really sometime this year

105
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:24,100
But they were going through it they were redacting not just names and some dates now, but they're also redacting portions of code

106
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Which is an interesting thing they have to do

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Avoid easily weaponizing the information at least this is part one of this was obtained recently in covers through

108
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,080
2016 details on the other parts will be available later on and then in there

109
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,080
This is amazing, so they're not just creating malware for Linux

110
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,360
But they're also using Linux to hack Macs and they have a guide on how you can use Ubuntu or mint

111
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
Whichever you prefer

112
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,320
Users choice CIA hackers choice you meant or Ubuntu, but at least let's be honest at least

113
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,800
It's gonna something that supports snap packages like a gentleman and they say in here. You can configure

114
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,560
If the Linux or Ubuntu mint install to hack the UEFI

115
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,560
firmware on a Mac

116
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,440
That's actually pretty neat. Yeah, and they have they have apparently they have their own internal repos

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,560
And they even look they even have instructions on using hit this covers using GCC

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,880
This is this is the CIA's documentation on using GCC to build hacking tools on Linux

119
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Or the UEFI driver wizard. Yeah, yeah, this is this is what it is here

120
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,760
Huh, it's a long page like this is pretty legit documentation

121
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,480
That's really kind of a mess look at this. They even have a little gooey like a look at that

122
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
It's with the with the screenshots with the default Ubuntu theme there

123
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,000
Ubuntu is everywhere now. Oh yeah, yeah, it's really popular

124
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,040
Well when you're hacking at home when you're hacking at the office you want to be on the same platform

125
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah, that's true right it makes it much easier when you're building in and also they talk about using

126
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,840
Public VPS's for the command and control servers to make it even more confusing they talk about tools that intentionally leave quote-unquote

127
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,360
Fingerprints that look Russian or whatever else they want

128
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,120
This is really it's a really big treasure trove of stuff

129
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,280
But the one thing that I thought was interesting was this hive thing just in context of this show

130
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,440
It's a multi-platform malware suite and control software the project provides customizable implants for Windows Solaris micro tech routers and

131
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,960
And Linux platforms. Yeah, yeah, it also has a listening post which is what they call the command and control infrastructure to communicate with these

132
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,520
Implants is what they call the the Trojan is an implant the implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,160
With a web server on the domain that they've chosen which is usually like a cover domain of some kind and each operating

134
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,720
Each each operation utilizing these implants has separate cover domains and infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains

135
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,200
So you can have one server for the command and control but appear to be hundreds of domains on one VPS

136
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,240
If you want it to be each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is associated with a commercial

137
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Commercial VPS provider and the public facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a blot not a bot

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,560
But a blot server that handles actual connection requests from its clients

139
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,040
I don't know why it's blot not bot

140
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,340
But apparently it's this little server that sits there and handles the incoming connections

141
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,580
Manages it it's set up for optional SSL if you want if the client has a valid cert it can do that

142
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,500
And it says it's forwarded to a honeycomb tool server that communicates with the implant

143
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
How about these words here, huh?

144
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:32,700
If a valid certificate is missing the traffic is forwarded to a cover server then delivers it via an unsuspicious looking website

145
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,100
The honeycomb tool server receives

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Exfiltrated information from the implant and an operator can also also task an implant to execute jobs on the target computer

147
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,360
So the tool server acts as a command and control server for the implant as well

148
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,060
Now there is a bit of a downside if you manage to infect a Windows box at the time of this

149
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,780
Writeup didn't support automatic client update on Windows

150
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:08,220
Yeah, however Linux rig can totally remotely update the implant totally good to go. Haha. It's got a cron job updates in the background

151
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,180
Yeah, it is

152
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,940
Yeah, that is Poby. Did you have I saw I saw you go by did you have something you wanted to jump in with?

153
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,380
No, I just thought you know the fact that using like Ubuntu or whatever Linux distribution is interesting

154
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
But I wondered if they'd used

155
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,820
Anything that uses the JSON license given that their license explicitly says the software should we use for good not evil

156
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,100
Hmm whether that would be a a way in which we could legally go after them for using the software

157
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,660
Well, you know

158
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,740
I was also reminded of the VMware lawsuit because there is some use of busy box in here

159
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,860
They you they bundle busy box with some of their tools which made me wonder if maybe they're violating the busy box license

160
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,900
And she's gone with VMware in trouble before wouldn't that be hilarious? It'd be like the Al Capone of the CIA

161
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,740
Yeah, it really would be the busy box like yeah

162
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,140
I saw some discussion of how like they couldn't some of the stuff isn't classified because because of the command and control nature for instance

163
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,780
If it was transmitted or put on a machine that wasn't couldn't have classified information

164
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,060
Oh Wow analysts could be fired or disciplined because it would be breaching the protocol for classified information

165
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,740
What a what an interesting catch-22 can't like you you know leaked classified. It wasn't classified Wow

166
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,740
I did not catch that part that is that is particularly interesting

167
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:27,060
It's been it's been really interesting also speaking of things that guess what are interesting reading Edward Snowden's Twitter feed today

168
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,180
I

169
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,140
Think he's right

170
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,460
And he says the big story is this is the first public evidence that the US government is secretly paying to keep US software unsafe

171
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:44,540
So they they discover they they even they have teams that discover these vulnerabilities or they buy the known vulnerability off of

172
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Someone or some trading site

173
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,380
They discover these things that are critical to devices that the American public has in use every day that they're doing

174
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,580
God knows what with and they're not disclosing it

175
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
They're leaving these flaws open

176
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,860
nothing preventing another foreign government from discovering or buying the same flaw and

177
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Taking advantage of it instead of working

178
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,780
The sort of the story that came out after the NSA leaks was well

179
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:20,380
We yeah, we hold on to those zero days for a while, and then we inform the Microsoft's and the Apple of the world about them

180
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh except for these really important ones, okay?

181
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,500
We don't tell them about those either

182
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,300
But otherwise we totally work with them and then Microsoft even came out with a statement saying we do have a program that works

183
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,220
With the NSA where they discover vulnerabilities, and we have included

184
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,700
Vulnerabilities they've informed us about in previous patch sets like they just talked about like it was the standard operating procedure

185
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,880
You're like okay. Well. This is just something that the private sector and the government have set up working together

186
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,860
Nothing wrong with that sure what could go wrong right probably no problem sure

187
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,600
Then you see this and you discover. Oh no no no they have a huge treasure trove of zero days

188
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
hundreds of them actually and

189
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,520
They just don't tell anyone and they just use them for their own benefit and just I guessed hope

190
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,580
They just kind of hope that nobody else figures out these vulnerabilities exist. They just kind of hope it's all gonna work out

191
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:12,500
it seems that way I mean I guess we were supposed to assume or trust that they are weighing that risk versus the

192
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,420
intelligence

193
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,300
Advantage of having these zero days, but is that really the case?

194
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,060
I don't know and that I guess that's something maybe we can analyze now that we have these documents

195
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,980
Is it also mean that people are more likely to start digging into what these are now that they know they're out there

196
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,460
Yeah, hopefully all right anyone in the mumble room have any closing thoughts on this story before we move on probably not it's not very interesting

197
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,060
No, no, okay. No all right well speaking of things that are interesting

198
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,020
Whoa whoa did you hear that voice right there? That was the that was the up-the-nose shot of one mr. Brian Lundu

199
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,940
It's a nice nose, and he is holding his final

200
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,300
The last there will be no other

201
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,540
Linux sucks talk. It's scale 15x this year and Brian

202
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,500
Yeah, I just want to say as somebody who's you know been around when these started

203
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,420
I think this was a long time ago

204
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,940
This was your best hairstyle out of any Linux sucks talks you've ever given I think you really nailed it this year

205
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Why thank you. I did a full and complete

206
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,660
retrospective of all of the various hairstyles because I felt like that was probably the most important thing to talk about that's why people would

207
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,500
Be tuning in sure yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah most definitely yeah most definitely

208
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,860
Yeah, most definitely yeah most definitely it was pretty fun. It was good. It was the last one

209
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm ever gonna do we did it on Thursday night at scale

210
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,660
Rad yeah, yeah, I was able to watch some of it

211
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,540
I was watching live because I didn't get to go to scale this year, and man was that live stream rough

212
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
That was that was rough. Yeah, that was pretty brutal

213
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,220
But you know it's it's conferences got the conference live streams and recordings always they always kind of suck like even the big ones

214
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm like the big festivals with like a tons of corporate backing. They're always pretty right to get right

215
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,860
So the number one question everybody asks now is so what's the deal does Linux no longer suck, or do you just get tired?

216
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,180
Of doing it. Oh, no, it still sucks

217
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,340
It's just the same thing every time you remember Chris remember remember when we first started doing those back in

218
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,100
What year was that 2000 2008 2009? Yeah, we started doing those remember the first three years

219
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,500
I did it it was like the same slides every friggin year

220
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,460
Yeah, like like it was the exact same slides and part of it is because I'm the laziest bastard on the planet

221
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,140
But part of it was that it was like the same stuff to complain about every year

222
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,060
I you know after after almost a decade of complaining about essentially the same things at one point

223
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,260
You got to just like wrap it all up put a bow on that and say there

224
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,820
Everyone just go reference that video until it's all fixed and then we can revisit

225
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,060
Yeah, it's all it's now enshrined here. It is. This is the final version fix these things

226
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,940
It's just that go do that right because that's worked so well since 2009. It's obviously

227
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,140
It's played out perfectly winning damn strategy my friend now

228
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,180
Did you find that it was there was trepidation early on trepidation?

229
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
I guess early on do people little

230
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,180
Larry of having somebody come out to their Linux event and talk about how Linux sucks because I could see some people not getting

231
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,800
The right, you know not getting the inside joke. Remember we when we did the first one

232
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,940
We did it up at Linux fest Northwest and we didn't call it Linux sucks

233
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,860
We called it Linux sucks and what we can do to fix it

234
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,820
Yeah, I made a very big deal about how this was a positive thing

235
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,300
It wasn't just about complaining and whining and then once once that kind of was successful

236
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
We were able to drop that whole

237
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,180
Charade off and just focus on the sucky stuff. No more couching. Yeah. Yeah

238
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,860
Yeah, I mean, I mean after I mean after the video start getting a million views. I mean people are like, oh, okay

239
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,220
Yeah, you can you can come here and give my conference a ridiculous amount of press. Yes, that's fine

240
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,460
Yeah, and it seems to always it always seems people see that, you know

241
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,580
And even if they haven't seen the video before you see it on the program. You're like what? What is this?

242
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,460
Who is this guy and what could he say? It's a you know, it's either you know about it or you're upset

243
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,660
You're like, yeah, the only thing I so there I feel like there's probably two possibilities

244
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,700
either you've thought of another way to get attention that's gonna be even better than saying Linux sucks or

245
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,540
You're rolling the dice and assuming you're just gonna figure one out. Which one is it a

246
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
little bit of both

247
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,940
There could be something in the works there might be and if there were I would choose to be very sneaky about it and not

248
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,180
Say anything until at least Linux fest Northwest rolls around. There you go. Yeah Linux. There's a good

249
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,500
There's a good plug too for Linux fest Northwest. So I will be there you'll be up there this year, right?

250
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,420
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nice. Hey, I'm gonna live there for a couple days, you know, you know

251
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,220
I've heard that you're good at using your words and talking perhaps you're gonna give it you're gonna give a speech

252
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,100
You're gonna give a session you're gonna get up in front of crowd this time at Linux fest maybe

253
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,260
You know, you know how much I hate crowds, you know me and you know me and

254
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,620
It would depend maybe if Wes could fill in for me at the booth for a bit. I'll tell you what I'll tell you what

255
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,060
What Chris I will do one with you. What would we do a talk about? What would we talk about?

256
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,260
I don't even fucking care we can get up there and talk about shoes for all I care

257
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,740
We'll get up you give me something good to talk about I'd do it

258
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,540
I mean, I just you know, I got nothing to talk about because I talk shoes. I talk way too much during the week

259
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,780
So what do I what else do I have to say, right?

260
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,060
So I feel like it's all in the shows

261
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,940
But if you gave me something new to riff on I could do it man. People would love it dude, right?

262
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,460
People would get a serious kick. I don't even care what it is

263
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,280
People in the mumble room and the audience of this show, whatever tell Chris what you would like me and Chris to riff on

264
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,380
Yeah, or one hour and we'll do it. Yeah, although I

265
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,060
There I think I think I think with this audience it could be kind of random. Yeah say potatoes good

266
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,020
Yeah, no, I see I did I did potatoes for like half an hour at the oh, yeah

267
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,500
So I gotta come up with something more esoteric than potatoes. Okay. Well, maybe we'll see we'll see what people say

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Let us know maybe something

269
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,020
Something great. Yeah gripping. We got it. We should do something technically the the call for papers is already closed

270
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,980
But I'm sure we could squeeze something in man. They'd get a kick out. We'll just go take over a room

271
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah, I mean if we walk in there with cameras and microphones and lights people are probably gonna get out of our way

272
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,180
So right they'll move either way. It's content

273
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,380
You could almost do the history of Linux fest Northwest

274
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,020
Could almost do that. I just don't really think that would be I

275
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:14,540
Don't know. You'd have to have I don't know. It's either nothing like years of no, that's boring. Yeah, come on, man

276
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,780
We gotta do something rad something gripping something that really grabs you by your cockles and just gives it a good yank

277
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,540
I think we can do it. We could how about let's do stop using Ubuntu

278
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,140
Well that that actually could get some attention stop using Ubuntu. It's a really not that much different than the Linux sucks

279
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,540
Honestly, that's pretty much the gist of it. So we'll have the the final Linux sucks talk. It's up. Yeah

280
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
Yeah, the fight the final one was out

281
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,140
Just got a couple days ago yesterday. Yeah yesterday. Yeah, yeah less less than 24 hours ago

282
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,940
All right

283
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,780
So we'll we'll see how that one does find that on Brian's channel also have that linked in the show notes if you guys want to

284
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Check it out. It's also in the subreddit

285
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,940
And and there is I don't know if you saw this Chris

286
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,140
But one of my favorite shots from any of the Linux action shows or any of the videos the one with the flag

287
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
The flag I saw that I did

288
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,540
God about that

289
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,100
Too I told was that from coding with Brian though. That was from coding with Brian

290
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,540
Oh, no, that was just that was just the Linux action show remember we recorded it and you remember the year

291
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,340
We went up to Linux fest and we had like a classroom. Yeah, we were gonna stream live from the whole time

292
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,260
Yeah, the Internet sucked. Yeah, the audio it was terrible

293
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,660
Yeah

294
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,460
And so we recorded a little intro with the American flag behind me where I was telling oh, no bad the audio

295
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
That wasn't even green screen

296
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,300
That was legit flag. No, no, no, that was green screen. Oh, okay. We green screen. Oh, we did green screen

297
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,620
Okay, right after we got that green screen. That's hilarious

298
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,020
We and we were like we were just like farting around with like try to like do stuff

299
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,300
So we also it's gaudiest American flag like, you know, how much better is that picture with that stash?

300
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,540
I don't think it would have the same. I don't think it would have the same landing if you didn't have that

301
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,820
I

302
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,940
Am just eating beef in that picture and I don't even have beef in that picture. It's amazing. I

303
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,340
Think it's the same jacket to no scarf anymore, but it's the same jacket. It was it was I realized that when I was up there

304
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,780
I grabbed the same blazer the same brown corduroy blazer

305
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,380
I had on and that was I don't know that was 2010 2011 something like that was forever ago, dude

306
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,100
Yeah, but you just now breaking it in

307
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, it's just starting to get soft. Fine. Yeah

308
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,580
Yeah, you know, this is a 40 year blazer here. You got it. It's just getting warmed up

309
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,300
particular category the 40 year blade

310
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,940
Alright, mr. Lundu. Well, I know you had to go around this time

311
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,300
So I do I I hate to jump in here be fantastical and Jared when I know my good friends

312
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,040
Popey and wimpy are in the crowd, but guys you're gonna you're gonna have to do something rad without me

313
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,420
You guys carry on do something somehow they will manage you'll manage I bet well

314
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,220
Thank you for stopping by and congrats on a long run of the Linux sucks talks the Linux sucks

315
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,060
Yeah, not not too damn shabby. Also. I was looking at it and if anyone wants to see early camera work from Chris fish

316
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
No, you don't. Oh my god

317
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Don't do it the first year or two. We had a tripod and then like the third year we did it

318
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
We were just like

319
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,460
Yeah, you know what? I don't understand is like how come we never got that dialed in like I mean even now you're still shooting

320
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Up your face right here. Oh

321
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:22,120
It's crazy. So this year right this year we had a sponsor for it. We had really good cameras set up for it

322
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:29,380
So we had four cameras set up. Whoa, two of them came out awful like it was nice DSLRs

323
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,980
They recorded it the image quality was good, but like the shots were just bad

324
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:40,400
Like it was just terrible the one great like good-looking one. It's just like this like webcam. That's like up my nose. Yeah

325
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,320
Yeah, we it's always always something. It's always something

326
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,680
I feel like that's the style of Linux sucks though

327
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,640
Like that's it's big like we had we recorded two completely separate years on those old and 900 camera phones

328
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Oh, yeah, and I know her phones. Yeah, just with some guy sitting in the audience really nice

329
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,160
I just think they're holding it or freaking out

330
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,420
And the and the battery didn't last very long on it

331
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,760
So we had to have an extension cable run so we could hold it there

332
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,420
So it was charging over USB while he was holding this cheap cheap little camera phone and then that

333
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Particular show goes on to get out like a million. Yeah, go figure right go figure. That's see that's how you do it

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,340
Chris you got it. You got to go cheap cameras. Yeah cheap microphone, right? Make sure it's as bad as possible

335
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,440
Okay, and then you get like a million views. Okay, I'm taking notes. I'm taking no

336
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,040
Yeah, I'm just you know a little bit schooling little bit schooling help you out a little thank you

337
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,920
I appreciate that I got it all I'm gonna get rid of this microphone. All right. All right. Hey guys. Hey guys look behind you what?

338
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Where'd he go?

339
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,840
Well, there you go. We'll have that all linked up in the show notes. And hey Brian, you're still here

340
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
What are you doing? Don't you know how to work mumble close that thing?

341
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,600
Get out of here. Come on. All right. So before we go on

342
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,660
Let's stop and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring this week's episode of the unplugged program so much more to get into Linux Academy

360
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,620
Linux Academy comm slash

361
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:23,280
Unplugged one of the things that I love about Linux Academy is they have a little breathing room now to engage with the community

362
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,140
And it's really exploding. I mean they have a great community on their own, but they're now engaging with the wider Linux community

363
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,420
They're going to a lot of these events. They were like scale. They're at scale

364
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,620
I'm hoping they go to Linux fest that way we can get a chance to hang out with them

365
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,700
It's a company in a really sweet spot of growth right now

366
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,040

367
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,380
But they're doubling down on their engagement with the community Linux Academy comm slash

368
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:54,660
Unplugged in a big. Thank you the Linux Academy for sponsoring this here Linux unplugged program this one this one right here

369
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,220
I want to give a I want to move on I want to talk about Mobile World Congress and

370
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,820
Odd camp, but maybe to slide us into that to prepare us to get our bodies ready

371
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,020
Let's talk a little bit about the story of Firefox OS

372
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,040
I thought this was an interesting piece and just this shot of the booth

373
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,140
It's really something it really is look at that look at that look at that investment

374
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,980
Just right there now. You know canonical is just at Mobile World Congress

375
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,780
Massive booth really a housebooger that crazy bigger this booth bigger than bigger than my house

376
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,980
Bigger than maybe as big as the studio. It was a big-ass

377
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:36,060
Big-ass big-ass booth, so I'd like to tell you this is the guy writing this from Firefox from boot to gecko all the way

378
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
up to the software project

379
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,740
Dying in 2016 and he writes out where they went wrong. It's an interesting write-up about Firefox OS

380
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,260
I don't know if we need to spend a lot of time going into it

381
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,100
But I thought I would point it out to the audience who's curious about these these free software

382
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,420
Operating systems for mobile devices and maybe where they've gone wrong now that these folks involved like this guy

383
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,920
Who was a product developer have a little hindsight? Yeah perspective you can look back at it and go well

384
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,380
Where did we go wrong? So that's it's interesting from that perspective now. I

385
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,580
Want to segue not so brilliantly into Mobile World Congress

386
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:17,340
Where popi and wimpy have just returned from this is this is a comparison that people will often make we'll look at canonical

387
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,800
They're investing so heavily in mobile

388
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,300
Which is kind of like how do you how do you know where they invest their money? How do you know?

389
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,620
What are you basing that on? What are you basing that? How do you know what returns they get from that?

390
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,860
But anyways, it's a common criticism that you hear lobbied at them quite a bit

391
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,700
And they did indeed have a big presence

392
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,780
So I kind of wanted to get a little perspective from a couple of the booth babes

393
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,540
I mean a couple of the guys that were there popi and wimpy what they thought of it all and and sort of walking away

394
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,100
From it. What is the reason canonicals there? And I don't know maybe if I was gonna go what should I expect?

395
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,780
So popi, I'd love to start with you. I know that I think following your Twitter feed

396
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,940
I saw I saw several different tweets about about the event about having fun. I'm guessing you must have had a great time

397
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,940
Yeah, it's my first time at MWC

398
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,020
I've never been there before and I kind of had to ask around in the company to find out what to expect but

399
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,180
overall it was an overwhelming experience and I

400
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,980
Like the size of the place I couldn't get over it. It was just humongous

401
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:21,620
So many halls that are the whole building buildings were built specifically for MWC

402
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,780
Wow, it's it's just gigantic and we had a sizable booth

403
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,020
I mean you look at other people's booths like the giant companies like Huawei and Nokia and and

404
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,860
Companies like that. They had really gigantic booths that were like the size of a town

405
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,360
Whereas ours was you know, pretty big for a free software development company

406
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,780
Part of the town

407
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,520
Yeah, it was comparable in size to LG who were opposite us on the on the strip

408
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,620
Keeping up with the Joneses

409
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,580
It wasn't it wasn't like we had a tiny little postage stamp size one compared to all the others

410
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,820
But what was really nice was like the diversity of stuff that was on the stand

411
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,560
It wasn't just here come and get an Ubuntu CD or here's a Ubuntu phone that you can't buy

412
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,100
You know, there was there's a there was a whole load of stuff and it wasn't just canonical

413
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,900
It wasn't just Ubuntu

414
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,460
There was a whole lot of their demoing stuff and I I know while we were standing there

415
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,100
Demoing our stuff that me and Martin were talking about there

416
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,180
there were just so many other things to see and do which was great because people spent ages on the stand and

417
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,740
Spent ages talking to us now

418
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Limpy I was curious from your perspective

419
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,520
This is a pretty big event where you're going and showing off some of the hard work of either yourself or teammates

420
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,260
Was it did you feel a bit on display? Was it was it like here's our hard work?

421
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,860
What do you think or was it was it a different vibe?

422
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,300
Yeah, it was to some extent it was here's what we've been working on

423
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:56,940
So specifically what Popey and I and our team with Eve and Jamie

424
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,980
We're we're showing was all our stuff to do with Ubuntu core and snaps

425
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,780
And we were introducing that to developers who are at MWC

426
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,820
hmm, and it was interesting because those conversations went very differently from the conversations that you have with

427
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,000
traditional open source projects so

428
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,920
Software developers who just want their software out there and they want to get it on as many devices as possible as easily as possible

429
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,040
the whole snaps and Ubuntu core story really resonated with them and

430
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
the feedback was

431
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,520
overwhelmingly positive

432
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,480
But then you're saying, you know Ubuntu has

433
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,960
From our you know from the discussions we've had here

434
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,520
The Ubuntu mobile story has been about the phone and the tablet in the past

435
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:51,760
But going into this what I've learned is just like the rest of the IT industry has embraced

436
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,720
virtualization and

437
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,560
containerization in order to

438
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:03,600
Get more value out of their servers and pack the most amount of functionality into the equipment that they've got deployed in places

439
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,640
The telecommunications sector are doing exactly the same thing

440
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:15,280
So they have been buying great big devices that have single purpose and single function and these are very expensive

441
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,280
bits of kit

442
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,880
but they are now moving to a software defined platform where they are rolling out their new era of

443
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,000
networks based on open stack and

444
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,040
software to define software defined radios software defined networks

445
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:40,400
virtual network function infrastructure, so it turns out that because Ubuntu is the dominant platform in the cloud and

446
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,480
supports

447
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
open stack Kubernetes and LexD

448
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:53,440
Transparently throughout the you know, the stack of offerings that Ubuntu has the telcos are queuing up to

449
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,920
rework their internal infrastructure on Ubuntu using those cloud technologies

450
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,200
You know Wes and I went to the open daylight summit that was put on by the Linux Foundation

451
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I bet you were yeah, because it was a lot of this was really was yeah exactly that a lot of

452
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Data centers that look like they're there multiple data centers that look like one flat network

453
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,320
That is all both spun up on-demand different connections are created by software defined networking

454
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Now they were hoping people would be using open daylight to manage it all or to I guess it's back to network. Yeah

455
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,380
Yeah, anyway, but hmm. This is you know, it's it's big. It's a big and it's a big

456
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,240
Infrastructure reorganization on the back end. That's totally transparent to consumers

457
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,680
Yeah, exactly and we don't exactly you don't even realize it's happened. I mean we hardly know and we're we wait

458
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,360
Yeah, we went to an event about it

459
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,680
We can hardly tell and it's you know

460
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,080
It's interesting to hear you echo that wimpy because it's that's that's exactly what we observed too

461
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,920
And the and the driver for the telcos is that they're they're losing sort of they're losing the fight against the big cloud

462
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,360
Providers and the data centers of the world

463
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,560
And they need to compete there

464
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,380
They need to be in that space and that's why they're going to be using many of the same

465
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,360
Technologies to offer much of the same capability

466
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,600
Interesting probably you were gonna say something

467
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,480
No, I was just it was interesting to me that the people who were coming by the booth

468
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,700
the way the MWC works on the first day you get these scouts come by the

469
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,360
By the booth and these are scouts from some of the like biggest companies you've heard of

470
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,160
Checking out what's on the booth and checking out the demos and they go away and then the next day on the Tuesday

471
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,880
they come back with their CEOs and CTOs and the execs to actually see the thing for themselves and

472
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,360
It was it was interesting to me to see these scouts going around and asking loads of questions and then coming back the very next

473
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Day with different people alongside them to demo

474
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,080
You know, whatever it is software-defined radio or Ubuntu core or OpenStack or whatever

475
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,040
And and seeing our salespeople talking to their people was was quite entertaining

476
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, a boy wouldn't that be wouldn't that just be one more perfect industry for Linux to completely take over?

477
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,640
Just and and not because not because the bunch not because they're like big Linux enthusiasts

478
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,400
But simply because it's solving a problem for the whole problem

479
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,000
and the reason why I like that is it it forces these companies to get involved in a way that is beneficial to their

480
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
long-term viability and

481
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Once they get all in on something like this

482
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,080
Linux and all of this technology stack becomes part of that

483
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,760
Well, we have to we have to get involved from a long-term viability standpoint and Wes and I talked from I think it was two

484
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
different people from AT&T

485
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
somebody from Ericsson

486
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,280
Where else I know we talked to we talked to a wide range of companies that were getting involved in open source simply because they're

487
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
now moving into this field

488
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,600
It becomes the toolset that they use and

489
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,800
the way to get the easiest way and the best way for them to get the things that they need changed or fixed or improved is

490
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,440
Contribute to upstream and the Linux Foundation is trying to figure out a way to you know

491
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,640
Kind of get in on this a little bit because they feel like well

492
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,120
We should be there setting the standard setting this, you know

493
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,760
so I and I don't know if they're getting I can't I don't have a good sense if they've

494
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,440
If they've got a lot of traction, did you guys see a lot about anything about open daylight or the Linux Foundation at mobile?

495
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,360
world congress

496
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Nope, no. Oh

497
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Yeah, that seems like the event should be at though

498
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,840
One thing that I did see like conversely the flip side of the the big wigs and the execs and the scouts on the Monday

499
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,040
Tuesday Thursday, they open the conference to local students who all come in. So it's a very different crowd

500
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,320
Wow, yeah, and we got rid of them lanyards and stickers that

501
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,240
Number of people who came by and told it like before we'd even talk to them about anything before we'd ask them any questions

502
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
They were like, yeah, I already use a bun to it's on my

503
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,920
It's like so many people every single day telling us how yeah, they they use a bun to they love it people telling us

504
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,580
They've got their Dell XPS in their bag and they carry it with them everywhere and stuff like that

505
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:09,080
That really made it worthwhile going and seeing like the real people and not and not just not just the students coming in

506
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,240
who are studying computer science, but at the

507
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,360
The food stands because obviously we were all in a bun to orange, you know

508
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:26,320
Full full brand regalia, huh? So we got we got four urban two shirts at the start of this event one clean shirt for every day

509
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,280
And when when you're at the food stands buying your food the number of people that were serving me said

510
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,200
I love a bun to or going into the conference, you know

511
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,680
The security guards and the people on the gate saying I use a bun to and people smiling at you from a distance as you're walking

512
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,680
along and then when you get there like ha, you know

513
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,060
I use a bun to or that is me walking around in your lunch break and people running up to you and tapping you on the

514
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,040
Shoulder you have a bun. Yeah, it was it was really great. Really great. That was particularly enjoyable

515
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,360
Wow

516
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:03,480
Yeah, really now rumor has it that there may be a new episode of the Ubuntu podcast

517
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,880
Soon to be released that may go into more details. Are these true rumors? Is this can you guys confirm this rumor?

518
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,800
No, we can confirm those rumors I was scared there

519
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,980
Yeah, okay, I tell you what I tell you what mark do you do you wanna do you want to explain what we've been doing this

520
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,120
evening

521
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,400
Well, we've been recording the Ubuntu podcast. Of course, very good. Probably talking a little bit about things that

522
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,340
You can hear it on on Thursday. Very nice. In fact mark you're here with a little more breaking news

523
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
in the

524
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,300
Unplugged program. I believe another rumor came out on the 26th of February. This is a breaking

525
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,620
It's just really late breaking news here that on cam 17 is on and a location has been chosen. Are these rumors true?

526
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,180
These rumors are extremely true not fake news

527
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,620
No, no, we don't do fake news over here or old facts. Yeah. Okay good one. Yeah, sure. So what's the details?

528
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,860
What do I what are the dirty details that I need to know if I might want to go to our camp?

529
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,780
So if you if you've not heard of our camp before our camp is what we call a free culture on conference

530
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,980
so it's a conference with

531
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,540
Not a lot of schedule but a lot of room for things if you want to come along and talk about your favorite thing

532
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:27,100
and it's happening this year after taking a year off on the 19th and

533
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,340
20th of August and it's happening in Canterbury in the UK. Okay

534
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
so we've got a

535
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:43,180
Building at the Canterbury Christ Church University and we've also got some accommodation at their student accommodation

536
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,220
We've got a deal with them. The details of that are on the website

537
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,860
I'll come to org and if you go to our camp to all you can also sign up for your ticket

538
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,920
And as we've have done in previous years, we're doing pay what you want tickets

539
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,180
So you can you can come for free or you can give us a bit of money if you want to nice

540
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,620
I think that's really cool on camp 17 glad to hear it's back and I've always heard it's a good event

541
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Oh one nice thing about the location actually this year is if you're in Europe

542
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,860
You can actually get the train

543
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,140
quite easily to Canterbury because you just get the Eurostar under the channel and

544
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,580
Then you either change in Ashford or London and then you can get straight to Canterbury from there

545
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,300
So it might be a bit more accessible than it has been when it's been up in the other end of the country

546
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:35,500
Yeah, that is really nice. Especially for oh, I'd love to go. Oh, I got a good ticket. I got a I got it

547
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,340
Well, hmm problem number one is I can't believe I'm in my mid-30s and I still don't have my passport

548
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,700
So that's a that's something is problem

549
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,540
It simply comes down to who has the time to do that

550
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,660
Who has the time to drive around to three different places or whatever?

551
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,740
It is get some stupid little picture and then get it put on another stool

552
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,300
I don't have that wait around or to come my daughter's had a passport since she was four years old

553
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,340
It should be ashamed. I am I literally only have the one really close neighbor and you don't need a pass, right?

554
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,660
That's the thing that is the thing that is I just go up to Canada with it

555
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,740
And in fact, if you take the boat, you don't even need the enhanced

556
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,900
Oh, I can't I don't know what that's true anymore, but you didn't use a long time. Yeah. Yeah

557
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,180
Just drop some inflatables to the RV. You'll be over in no time. I would oh if I could that'd be so great

558
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,860
I really got to do it. I got to do it

559
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,020
I just need a way I just this is why I need an assistant to have it

560
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,420
You know take a picture of me go go do these things now

561
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,980
If you want to hear more of these fine gentlemen, check out Ubuntu podcast org

562
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:35,380
So this is gonna be season 11. Is that what's starting off 10? Oh, so it's already up then

563
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,300
No, this is episode zero zero. Oh, it is

564
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,860
Oh you guys are so confusing with the zero zero, so I like it though. It looks good

565
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,100
It looks like just from a title that looks that looks good. Yeah

566
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,540
This is the one thing to regenerate the guy who the guy who emailed in season one saying that we were

567
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:01,980
We were sort of had ideas above our station for using a leading zero. This is the season that proves him wrong

568
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,860
awesome

569
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Not that you guys hold a grudge

570
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,940
We're gonna churn out 42 episodes just to prove him right

571
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,740
Well, that might have been in his best interest in the long term

572
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,780
I am boy I'm excited about our camp and even if I if I can't make it

573
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,500
I'd love to hear a report back here on the show about it because that does look like it's gonna be a lot of fun

574
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,780
You guys gonna record a live Ubuntu podcast there?

575
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,400
Quite possibly. Yeah, that might happen. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. Okay

576
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,900
Well, although we should we should also mention we are going to be recording a live podcast later in the year on June the 24th

577
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,100
in London

578
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,280
So fostalk live that happened last August organized by Joe Ressington from late night Linux

579
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,600
He's organizing another fostalk live this year and we are on the bill

580
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,000
To do that

581
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,360
So if you head to fostalklive.com when tickets get announced

582
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,440
You'll be able to find the details there and get a ticket for the event. They'll be in very short supply small venue

583
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,760
It's worth going for the laminated show notes alone. Oh, yes

584
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,320
Well, yes, and if you're lucky if you if you make friends with poppy and buy him a beer, he might sign them for you

585
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,520
Nice producing in Gobi in gobs as we used to call it

586
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,960
So, you know guys I'm just putting this out there

587
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,060
But if you actually stream the recording of the shows live some of us would tune in

588
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,300
Just saying there might be an audience out there for that. It's not hard. Maybe you can do it

589
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,480
You can do it. You don't even have to show your faces. You could just do an audio stream

590
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,300
It'd be really fun. I know I think one day this whole live stream thing is gonna take off

591
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,620
John I don't know. I've live streamed before. Yeah, okay

592
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,860
I think maybe now that we've got a big telegram channel we can we can pimp it to them

593
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,540
But before it was it was more effort than it was worth. Yeah. Yeah, I you know doing lie

594
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,500
I remember doing live streams before Twitter and the only real reason I was

595
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,440
Thankful Twitter kind of came along in some sense was because I had a way to let people know we were live

596
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,380
Really?

597
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,340
There was really no other mechanism and that makes me feel like an old man. All right, so we got to talk about scale

598
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,700
We got a warp back to scale. I got a great interview by Noah

599
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,180
With the gnome booth

600
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,060
But before we do that

601
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,940
I want to thank our good friends at ting for sponsoring this show linux dot ting calm linux dot ting calm you go there

602
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,260
Support the show and get $25 credit now this $25 credit can be applied to a device you buy from ting like a maniac

603
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,300
Direct from ting why not makes it nice and easy

604
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,940
They can even find a device for you or if you bring in device, they'll give you $25 in service credits

605
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
They like oh $25

606
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,620
Pay for the line

607
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,380
What are you stuck in some sort of duopoly quote-unquote agreement?

608
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:47,220
Ting ting is mobile. It's different. You only pay for what you use. It's a flat rate boom six dollars for the line

609
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,700
That's it. Six dollars six dollars six dollars guys for the line. Are you hearing that?

610
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,820
I mean I could say it one more time, but it's just crazy at that point and then you just pay for usage on top

611
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,260
of that

612
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
What it's that straightforward?

613
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,880
You got six dollars for the line. Oh, I did it again. Then you pay for what you use minutes messages megabytes

614
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,540
So if you don't use many messages, you don't pay for them. You don't make a lot of phone calls

615
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,540
You don't pay for it. You see how that works. It's simple

616
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,660
And then it's uncle Sam's touch right off the top. That's gonna depend on where you live, bro

617
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know. I can't put that don't put that on me. I don't know. That's what depends on you

618
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,580
Anyways, you find out you go to linux.com you click on what would you save you get a little chart?

619
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,980
It starts telling you about numbers you do the math you start realizing holy crap in two years

620
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,500
I could have bought an entirely new laptop. I'm like three and a half years into this

621
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,620
I got multiple lines a ton of laptops to I'm

622
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,700
I'm all up in the tank. I got it for myself

623
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,180
I got it for the business. It really makes a lot of sense and if I ever get stuck

624
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
Which is really nice when I'm on the road

625
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,380
Really good support really good really good so good

626
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,300
They they stayed on the phone longer than they should have I didn't need I did not I did not expect that to get fixed

627
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,180
I thought I was I legit was done like a half hour 40 minutes before they were I was like

628
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,260
This is unsolvable. This is unsolvable. I don't even I you know I've been in IT for 15 years

629
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
I can tell you this is unsolvable. You don't need to bother

630
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,900
They stuck with and got it fixed which was super thankful and through it

631
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,980
We was we were I was in Montana and through it was stopping by I was about to do

632
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,620
I can't remember what show I think it might have been code or it might have been this show

633
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,540
I was about to go live on the air my my fire died

634
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,300
I didn't know what was going on

635
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,140
I was parked in a gravel parking lot and ting save the day linux.com you go there

636
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,260
You get the best mobile company in the biz you bring a device. They don't honey badger. They just go crazy

637
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:43,340
They don't care. They're honey badger about it. You just use it however you want minutes messages megabytes, and you pay for it. It's simple also I

638
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,620
Really like this blog series

639
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,860
They've been doing if you go to linux.com and this is sort of applicable to any carrier

640
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,780
I suppose but the five capable smartphones under $100

641
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,300
Like we always talk about like you get like Wes over here with the pixel

642
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,220
That's right, although you did rock the Nexus 5 for like ever ages. Yeah, so you totally earned that pixel

643
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,220
Kind of you know you know if you're not ready to buy

644
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,900
You're not ready to blow seven hundred dollars on a smartphone or even a thousand dollars in some cases way

645
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,900
It's great about ting right whatever phone. You want whatever phone makes sense totally linux.com and a big

646
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,300
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unblocked program

647
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,300
So let's talk to and well let's talk let's talk no let's talk endless

648
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:31,540
Let's talk endless PC, and let's talk a little fedora. Oh, yes, that's right my friends. It's Noah at scale

649
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Walking around the scale floor we have to stop at Gnome anytime

650
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:48,540
We see him obviously one of the favorite desktop environments of anyone that uses Linux. How are we doing today pretty good?

651
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:54,780
How are you excellent so tell me a little bit about what the Gnome team is up to these days and also

652
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,300
I know that you work for endless

653
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,180
I would like to hear about endless the endless PC and the operating system that you've designed around no

654
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,740
Yeah, for sure, so this is actually good timing because Gnome 324 the new version of Gnome is gonna be out

655
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:15,740
In a couple of weeks. I think March 17th March 20th something like that and there are some pretty cool features

656
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:22,260
In a new version of Gnome including a night shift filter like you have for instance on your phone

657
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:28,900
That will tend to your screen with a natural light at night so that it doesn't strain your eyes as much

658
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,320
There's a lot of features also for developers

659
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,060
Gnome builder and flat back are two big pieces of our ecosystem

660
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,940
and they're receiving a lot of new features for 324 and

661
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,260
Christian is right here behind me busy writing code on ground builder right now

662
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:57,060
Excellent so I know that you work for endless PC and you guys have designed it a very interesting operating system

663
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,800
Around no might one might even say that it's like the anti cloud operating system it runs so offline, right? Yeah

664
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,620
Yeah, so that's that's actually one of our core tenants at endless we

665
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:15,340
we were the company was born a few years ago with the mission of bringing computers really to the whole world population to as

666
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,340
many people as possible and

667
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,140
There's really two barriers to doing that and one is the price of the hardware

668
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,500
And that's why you know you see here some of the computers that we've made. They're pretty affordable. They're nice

669
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:34,420
They're very compatible with Linux. They run very very well you turn them on and you know everything is ready for you the other

670
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:42,380
Barrier typical barrier is the access to internet so the cost of connectivity or the access to connectivity at all

671
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,140
So we bundled inside the OS a lot of features

672
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,660
for consumption of content offline

673
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:55,740
So we want to almost bring a lot of the value of internet into the box itself so when you buy it

674
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,740
You will come preloaded with

675
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,820
something like a hundred and fifty

676
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:06,980
Offline applications on a variety of topics that you normally would Google things for life such as farming

677
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,340
encyclopedia or

678
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,020
Math or physics or biology or all these things?

679
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,860
So it's a it's a really good value for for people that don't otherwise have access to that information

680
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,540
The same way that we do here

681
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,900
Excellent if people were interested in in endless. What is the what is the what is the?

682
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:32,100
compelling use for the operating system if I didn't have an endless PC can I just can I go get the operating system and

683
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,100
What kind of people here in the US where we do have an abundant internet? Where are those?

684
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,620
What is that? What is your target audience here if any?

685
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:46,940
Yeah, so that's a that's a that's a good question. We launched actually this hardware line specifically for the US market this year

686
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:53,340
You can buy this from our website endless OS comm and also you can download a free

687
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:59,900
The free operating system from there so you can download the exact OS that you would find inside the box

688
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,640
For free from our website here in the United States. You're right

689
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,580
Internet connection is much better

690
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:15,180
But it's not that's not true everywhere so even inside the United States. There's a lot of places where that is useful

691
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,780
And you know even in California

692
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,140
There's a lot of remote areas where internet just doesn't get there because there's not enough people

693
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,620
So if you live in one of those areas this could be useful for you another

694
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,500
Interesting use case that we really had not thought about before when when we when we designed this but it turns out

695
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
It's it's a pretty good match. It's actually

696
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,340
prisons so they

697
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,300
you know, there's there's a lot of people there to have time and they

698
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:48,420
Want to study they want to learn new things, but they cannot access internet as a matter of policy, of course, so

699
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,020
We're doing some pilots with prison systems in a few states in the u.s

700
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,100
To see if this is a good match for them outstanding and how is that working so far?

701
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,740
It's been working pretty well. Yeah, the feedback that we've that we've received is pretty good. There were some

702
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,740
Things like we were shipping for instance open arena, which is a slightly violent game. We had to remove it

703
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:16,380
So there's you know, you have to adjust things for specific for the use case, but it's been working well so far outstanding

704
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,100
And so and you're providing the machines the hardware the software

705
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,940
I mean, that's a story right in of itself that you guys are reaching out to these people that are you know

706
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:31,940
That are in some ways underprivileged and and and providing them with with with skills and abilities that they can use if and when

707
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,620
They ever leave the prison system

708
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,300
They can become functioning adults back into society and they will know how to use a computer system exactly exactly

709
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,200
Yeah, so yeah in some cases we've donated hardware in other cases

710
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,700
we've partnered with associations that were already working in the prison and

711
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,700
We installed it on the computers that they already had so endless is at the end of the day like another

712
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:02,420
Linux based OS is compatible with the whole variety of a hardware that you know other districts like Ubuntu or Fedora are compatible with

713
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:09,020
So you can run it on anywhere take a given that you also have a Fedora laptop is have you found that Fedora is a

714
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,580
Is a good operating system for exemplifying. No

715
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:18,820
Absolutely, I think Fedora is one of the distros that always strives to give the

716
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:26,460
Vanilla gnome user experience to the user and actually in Fedora 25, which is what we have on the laptop there

717
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,660
It's the first distro that I know of that ships with Wayland by default. So

718
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:38,620
You know, we've been waiting for this moment kind of for many many years the point where we stopped using X and it's it's there

719
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:45,540
And I have to be honest. I didn't even notice that I was using Wayland until maybe you know two weeks later

720
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:51,420
I saw some like minor bugs, but it is really really polished. It's a really great distro. That's fantastic

721
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,420
So you personally use Fedora on your computer?

722
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,980
Yeah, I have on my work computer. I use Endless, but my personal computer is Fedora

723
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:05,620
Nice, that's outstanding. And so is Endless a rolling release or is it a static build?

724
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,900
Are they static build? Endless is

725
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,900
It has a about a three-month release cycle. So we have

726
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,480
major quote-unquote updates every three cycles

727
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,160
So we go from version 3.1 to 3.2 to 3.3

728
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:27,580
And then we have point releases about every three weeks to a month depending on exactly why we need to make a point release

729
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,860
Sometimes there are critical bugs to be fixed though. We have to you know, make it quicker

730
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:37,060
But no, new features only get out every two or three months. It's not a rolling release

731
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,400
Now tell me what was the design thought behind this idea of on the screen here

732
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,140
We have you can see where like these icons are in the center

733
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,020
And if I if I click down, you know here there's like a traditional menu structure

734
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:53,300
But we have occupied the majority of the desktop space with application shortcuts and interestingly enough

735
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,860
You know

736
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:58,340
We started back in the 90s where we had a bunch of things cluttering the desktop and then we kind of went away from that

737
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,980
But the reality is now like a mino machine. It's just I just have a pretty picture

738
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,100
It's really wasted a desktop real estate and you've you've actually taken that up with useful shortcuts

739
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:13,780
Almost kind of like in between a dock. Tell me about that. Yeah, so the idea for the icon grid specifically

740
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:19,240
Is to be familiar for users that are used to smartphones and tablets

741
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,060
So that's actually how you know your Android launcher or your iOS

742
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,580
application list works so endless the desktop works

743
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,060
Similarly, you cannot put your files on the desktop

744
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:40,040
It's really the launching page for all of your apps. So we try to start with a minimal

745
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,740
number of apps on the desktop so that the user is

746
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,140
Invited to explore the App Center

747
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,700
Which is based on GNOME software where you can you know add more apps to your desktop or download more things

748
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,300
from the internet download more bundles and expand your

749
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,700
list of available apps basically outstanding if people were interested in more

750
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:10,020
Information about GNOME or endless. Where could they go? So endless OS comm is the endless website from there?

751
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,020
You can find everything. There's also

752
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,820
Forums and a slack community if you're interested in participating

753
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:24,060
for GNOME a GNOME org is our main website and you can also find us on IRC IRC.GNOME.org and

754
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,660
The GNOME Wiki has a lot of information about the release and you know

755
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,180
The whole release process if you are interested in contributing back

756
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:39,540
So wiki.GNOME.org but GNOME.org is the main homepage outstanding cosmo GNOME.org. Thank you so much for your time

757
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:49,540
We really appreciate having you. Thank you. Thank you

758
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,260
That endless PC is actually pretty interesting because they got this mission now

759
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:58,820
The mission one is a gorgeous Linux powered desktop. Yeah, it's like on a bamboo case

760
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,140
Which has always kind of pushed my buttons the wood PC cases have always kind of done it for me

761
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,300
And I haven't really tried out endless OS yet

762
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,860
But after that interview, I was a little more tempted to maybe go give the ISO a download. So the mission one is

763
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:20,060
$250 and you can either get it with 320 gigabytes of storage or 500 gigabytes of storage and

764
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,540
I don't remember

765
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,740
Oh, yeah, here it is

766
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:31,780
Yeah, it's an Intel Celeron N2807 in it. It's got two gigabytes of DDR3 RAM

767
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:38,620
So that's kind of your base performance metrics. Then it's got two USB 2.0 ports one USB 2.0 port

768
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,020
Hopefully one of those three

769
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:47,620
So three USB ports maybe or maybe one of those actually it's a typo and I meant to write USB 3.0 VGA HDMI out

770
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,340
headphone jack Ethernet

771
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,340
Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth I guess

772
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:00,720
You know for 250 bucks, that's that's not too bad that's not too bad and they really are

773
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,900
you know, you listen to that guy they really got an idea of philosophy behind this and

774
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,340
I kind of thought I'm not always a big fan of yet another derivative

775
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:13,740
No, but I don't know what I don't know how much they've I don't know how extended of nomad is I from what I did

776
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,580
I did a little reading a little research for the show

777
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,220
It looks like it's based on a slightly newer or I'm sorry slightly older version of gnome

778
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,060
I want to say 320, but I'm not positive. It was somewhere in that range interesting

779
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,560
So it's it's it's a fork or at least as a layer of extensions on top of gnome 3. I'm not quite sure

780
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,840
but it didn't look very usable so I

781
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,320
Might be I might be giving the endless the endless ISO download trying to think of like who in my life would would or could use

782
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
that

783
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,200
But I suppose if you're just really using web apps and you know

784
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:51,120
You don't want a big ugly weird box in your nicely decorated living room or computer room that it sits nicely on the desk

785
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,240
I guess I could see that. Yeah, I think yeah

786
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,920
I think if you had yeah, I could see a lot of family members that yeah

787
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,040
I could see a lot of people why we're talking about gnome see I'm give a little gnome love because are you still using plasma?

788
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,520
By the way, yep, I wish to talk about that

789
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,200
But there's also a write-up at fedora magazine org on getting more out of gnome notifications

790
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,600
Which is a thing no notifications, which are not bad not bad at all my friend and with a few tweaks

791
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,680
Maybe a few extensions or things like that you can get even more

792
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,240
Include including creating your own

793
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,300
Notifications like things on the command line so that's also linked in the show notes so Wes

794
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:29,300
Did you end up playing around with like controlling where the screens will go or your where your windows go on your screen based on?

795
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,180
Keyboard commands, I know that was something a little bit

796
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,020
I have a list of things to try that I have not gotten to so I started playing with that

797
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,420
I got a couple things set up, but there's a couple

798
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,340
Plugins and settings that have been recommended to me that I have not got around to trying yet

799
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,480
There's some stuff. That's a little more replicate replicate some of the stuff that I three or similar does

800
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:52,420
So I'm looking forward to extend it more or see if it can meet my needs because I'm really liking a lot of the other

801
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,740
Stuff the one thing that I keep messing up though

802
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,600
I'm used to like when I have the lock screen on gnome

803
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,060
I have to hit enter and then I type you don't have to but I'm just used to doing it

804
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,640
But if you do that on the plasma lock screen boom now. I have the time out

805
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,700
Yeah, I have to learn something so but I'm trying to I want to stick with it long enough that those things have all gone

806
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,940
Away, and I can give it really a better understanding of if it works for me

807
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,060
So I had two things this week with the with my adventures with plasma

808
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,860
And I thought they were both noteworthy for mentioning here on the show

809
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:25,060
I finally got a chance to getting around to play with KD connect because I'm back on

810
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,180
Android and back on my Nexus 6p, and so I just took advantage of I was like well

811
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:34,360
This is one more way. I can use the plasma desktop now. I really like that. I really do like it

812
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm not so sure if I want notifications that are showing up on my Android device show up in my desktop yet

813
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,940
I'm still like feeling that out, but just some of the basic functionality. It's it really feels like

814
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:51,760
2017 I mean it's nice and it's so much more practical than what I seemed to grok with the like that the iOS

815
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:58,460
Functionality, I guess maybe iOS I don't know if there's a way to like share your clipboard with the Mac desktop with where with their

816
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,660
Handoff stuff, but I know you can like open up like links and web pages

817
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:05,820
But it's it's not nearly as nice as like it is with Katie connect can a kitty connectors

818
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,820
It seems very thoughtfully made it's one of those things that would make me want to stay on Android mm-hmm

819
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:15,860
I'm also working on iOS support. Oh really well there you go. I wonder if it'll be nearly as functional

820
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,300
Yeah, that's something to watch yeah, because it's it's always running on the phone, right?

821
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,300
It's you can get it from the Play Store and

822
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,980
Then the other thing the other just sort of noteworthy

823
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:29,440
Adventures with plasma this week would be I decided to set up the Macbook Pro that we set up

824
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:34,300
Months ago on the show running arch I've switched that over to the plasma desktop from no hey

825
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:39,980
Yeah, and this was my first time setting up plasma desktop on a high DPI display where?

826
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Everything was high DPI by default. How did that go? I'm curious. I I it was great

827
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:52,840
I think I tweaked the mouse cursor a bit, but on all my previous installations of plasma on a high DPI display. I've always

828
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,840
My first instead right after install. It's everything's tiny

829
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,680
It's all really tiny and you got to go into the settings

830
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,580
And you got out you guys turn up the scale and turn up the font DPI and you got to change you know

831
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,140
Some of your window sizes

832
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:11,040
I did still have strange windows that like rendered way too small like it like the size of a 640 by 480

833
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,780
Resolution just tiny little window they have to resize to see the entire UI

834
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,900
but out of the box after I installed plasma desktop just

835
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,820
Logged out and logged into the plasma desktop and everything was high DPI. I didn't have to change a damn thing. That's awesome

836
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,820
It is it is really nice to see him going that direction

837
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:35,180
So I still so I guess my my take is I'm getting deeper into the plasma ecosystem now with KDE Kinect and

838
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,740
I've put plasma desktop on my main driver at home the the Macbook run an arch with now plasma

839
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,140
Yeah, I haven't really I haven't really felt the need to reinstall and go to like KD neon or yeah

840
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:54,820
Same thing yeah, yeah, and plasma 510 is just around the corner sure

841
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:58,660
Never hey, that's sure yeah sure all right. Let's talk about the light book

842
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,740
I think producer Michael's been following this one pretty closely

843
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,660
I'd like to get his his thoughts on it because it seems like a pretty good deal, but is it too good to be true

844
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,980
I'll tell you about something. That's great, and it is true

845
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,940

849
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,580
They use KVM for the virtualizer pal

850

You got Linux for the base operating system SSDs for all the disk i.o. 40 gigabit connections data centers all over the world in choice

851
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:49,660
Locations highly available block storage which you can attach up to 16 terabytes love it and an interface

852
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,340
The interface is beautiful. It's the best interface. It's huge. It's great

853
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,840
It is so well done

854
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:02,140
And it doesn't matter if you're a total noob like you barely even understand that web servers are a thing and you need a website

855
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:07,820
You could manage to use this to somebody who's been setting up virtual servers for literally their entire

856
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,380
Career will find this to be a great interface. How do they do it?

857
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:16,940
I think they're from the future. Yeah, I can't really I can't square it. Otherwise

858
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,100
Either that or they had this great API and they're like damn

859
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:27,060
This API is so dank that we need an interface that comes close to being as dank as our as our API

860
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:32,940
That's the only two things I can figure I can only it's either they're from the future or that dank API is so dank

861
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,900
They had to have a dank interface. That's the only thing I can figure so you got to check it out yourself

862
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,020

upload program

869
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:07,900
So the light book is it a scam is it a total scam is it from?

870
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,620
2014 for two hundred and forty nine dollars

871
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,460
they say you can get a 32 gigabyte msata drive or you can pay a little more and get up to 512 gigabytes of

872
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:25,100
Storage they say it's got Linux by default elementary OS at that a 1080p display 4 gigabytes of RAM and

873
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,620
an Intel Celeron quad-core

874
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,600
processor

875
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,400
Hmm

876
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,560
250 bucks it seems to be the new sweet spot right everybody's trying to hit 250 bucks and

877
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,880
The only the only thing that's weird about this outside from just things

878
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,720
I've noticed just looking at this all of the product images are totally gimped

879
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,960
There's no there's no real shots of the computer

880
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,560
But it looks like you can also find this exact image with like a video game

881
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,920
Gimped into it or you're probably in this case. It was photoshopped

882
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,400
Just probably I would assume running Windows just the exact same product shot just a different complete

883
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,920
Operating environment on the screen

884
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,560
Going back for years now. It's so that's a little weird

885
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:13,400
That's a little concerning, but but maybe but maybe but maybe what they're doing is they're taking something that's been around since 2014

886
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,820
They're rebranding it and because it's fairly old the margins are super low so they can sell for 250 bones

887
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
that's the reasonable take but

888
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,080
Producer Michael you've been sniffing around. What's your take you think it's a scam

889
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,040
Do you think there's something else going on here, or is this a legit rig?

890
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,580
I've no idea. It's it's more the thing of it looks really promising

891
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,760
But it feels a little sketchy with the photos with the fact that

892
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:45,640
There is no name associated to the company that there's no person's name when you go to their forum

893
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:51,040
It just says director as the person replying like there's absolutely no name. There's no photos

894
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,360
There's one video on YouTube where it shows a person's face because he's recording the lap the light book

895
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:04,160
With his phone and then the reflection of the of him is in the in the screen

896
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,320
so

897
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,520
It's just which is kind of feels weird, but like the photos thing

898
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,280
Every photo that's on their website except for the the software photos

899
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,780
But all the product photos are also on like Alibaba and stuff like that

900
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,780
I I it just seems odd that they're not being more

901
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:28,300
Transparent about the company structure, but I mean I found out they are supposedly

902
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:33,860
Located in Tampa, Florida, and that's where they ship from so there's no international shipping

903
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,700
for US people and

904
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:44,580
The price like I found out what the processor is it's a 3050 Celeron, which is a pretty good Celeron

905
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:51,820
It's better than a Chromebooks normal typical processor 31 50 right 31 50 I

906
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,540
Yeah, I think 31 50. I don't remember exactly number, but I'm pretty sure it's 31 50 and so it's a decent

907
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,940
Yeah, it's it's better than the average Chromebook

908
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,860
There's a couple things I tell you that and I think this came out via reddit posts

909
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:08,140
And they were applying to people's questions a couple of things that are odd

910
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:14,020
So they asked well is elementary OS getting a cut of the sales a pretty reasonable question for a laptop featuring elementary OS

911
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,400
And the quite the response at first was well

912
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:16,540
Yeah

913
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:22,260
About two to four dollars and then and then when people ask a little bit further it turns out well it kind of depends on

914
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:27,180
Bugs and we run into because we're actually doing this via the body source. Yeah

915
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:31,260
They're gonna do it via bug bounty the bounty source like okay, so I'm not getting a cut of each laptop

916
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,020
You're you're just gonna use their bug bounty system if you make some profits okay, all right, okay?

917
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:41,700
So then it turns out well is this really elementary OS or are you modifying this no no no we're not modifying it except for

918
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,220
Well, we have updated the kernel to kernel 48

919
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:50,540
We've pre-installed play on Linux also King soft office and Firefox is now the default web browser, but otherwise

920
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,260
It's stock elementary OS honestly

921
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,420
I didn't see them saying that they didn't modify it every time I someone asked someone asked a question about

922
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:01,460
Modifying it they say they give a list of everything. They've done. Oh, I was told they denied it at first, but okay

923
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:07,300
Yeah, there's also there's there's articles out that are reviewing it. They're acting like he deliberately ignored

924
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,300
No, he didn't it's in it's in another thread. Yeah, so you go through

925
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,280
There's a couple of them you go through and it's you know a lot of it is just odd stuff

926
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,700
Nothing that jumps out of you

927
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,420
it's just odd stuff and you the thing is that happens with something like this is is

928
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,900
You you really have to kind of I just think of all experienced like

929
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,340
The Kickstarter that's gone wrong or the gofundme or IndieGoGo that's gone wrong

930
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,020
It's everybody has to goes everybody has to go total skeptical mode when they see this stuff

931
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,240
So I'm not actually I don't I don't actually want to put them down too much

932
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,660
But it does seem to me like there if anything where we are okay, though

933
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,380
Like the stuff they keep saying like if you go to their forums though

934
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,580
The way they're doing it is sketchy their responses

935
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:52,980
They give a kind of promise and back get a best case what we what we have here is a 2014 laptop

936
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,540
That's been rebranded right and then they're they're just selling that with some support. I think it's probably

937
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,980
It was probably what's happening

938
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:06,300
I don't know if the laptop is like manufactured in 2014 or is it like that model was first released in 2015

939
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,340
I couldn't find information about that or not

940
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,120
That's just what one of the articles said was that 2014 is from there like well, yeah

941
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,120
But they could have just you know reiterated it

942
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,680
But I don't know that it's hard to tell on those will and all like Alibaba's

943
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,180
subscriptions because they're all like

944
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,700
buzzword heavy

945
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,060
So what was it that set off red lights for you then?

946
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:30,460
It wasn't it wasn't like it wasn't like a red light thing. It was just like all of this stuff together is sketchy

947
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,020
Like if it was one of these things I went out

948
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,640
It's like if it was just at the Alibaba thing

949
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,140
But they're like presenting it and marketing it very well and they have a lot of information about who's running it and all this other

950
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,260
Stuff I wouldn't care because you know

951
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,540
Rebranding things like people do that with clevo all the time

952
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,580
So it's not that big of a deal. So if if that's all they were doing

953
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,460
It's just like all of these things combined feel weird

954
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,300
so like they could have just said we don't have product photos that are really genuine yet because we don't have a

955
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:01,660
Photographer and we're not good all we have a camera phone and that's probably not a good way to present your products

956
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,860
You know that kind they could have done that

957
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,260
There's there's plenty of options. They could have done to make me feel

958
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,140
Not so iffy about the issue

959
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,820
But it's just like if you go to their YouTube channel, they have like weird videos that are weird

960
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,740
One of the videos is like vertical

961
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,340
Recording with the phone vertically and

962
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:29,940
Then also horizontally so like they started a video vertical realized it was vertical and then turned it horizontal yet

963
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:34,340
The video is still vertical. So it's really awkward. Love it. I love that. Yeah

964
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:37,100
It's just that kind of weirdness that makes me feel weird

965
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
But like if I could play with a laptop

966
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,420
I would definitely do that because if they had like, you know

967
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Yeah review units or something they could send that would be cool

968
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,020
But that would probably be that would be the real way to tell well, you know what?

969
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:52,160
I guess the other thing I would say Michael is it sort of

970
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:59,220
Sort of was an indication to me the total lack of enthusiasm or plugging or hype coming from

971
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,940
Elementary OS which would seem to suggest that they're not on board with this

972
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,300
Well, I mean they definitely aren't like involved in the situation

973
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,460
so I mean, I wouldn't try to promote it if they if I didn't know about it as much either but

974
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:16,000
They were aware that it was happening before it was announced. So

975
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,940
They weren't like they were just denying involvement. They're not denying what they're not

976
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,580
They don't have any assessment whether it's good or not. They're just basically staying out of the situation

977
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,660
And I understand yeah, I understand why they're doing it

978
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:32,740
But I also don't think it's a big deal that they are like it like a lot of companies aren't you know?

979
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,460
Ubuntu is not, you know advocating for specific

980
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,940
Products and stuff like that. They'll say they'll give you a list about what works and what what doesn't

981
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,980
You're right and from a licensing standpoint you're correct

982
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:53,820
I would think though that if any distribution out there is going to be hypersensitive to their product being

983
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:59,820
It's because look think about who's who really loses here is the customer and that sucks for elementary OS because

984
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,920
Who's gonna want something like this is gonna be an elementary OS enthusiast, but they're not actually getting elementary OS

985
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,700
They're getting something that ships a different kernel a different browser and other things that have been modified to it

986
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,500
So it's not something actually supported by the elementary OS project

987
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:17,780
So if they're if it's an elementary OS fan, they're actually they're getting it's a disservice and that's got to piss off

988
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:21,820
I would think Daniel I would think that well, I wouldn't be happy about that. It's a bit unusual

989
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,820
So there's been a few

990
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,520
Vendors that have shipped Ubuntu Marte on their laptops

991
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,920
most notably

992
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,240
Entroware, but a few others around Europe as well, and they've all had the courtesy to get in touch and

993
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,200
Express their intent to do this and just make sure it's okay now our

994
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Preferred Ubuntu Marte's preferred vendor is Entroware, but there are others. There's slimbooks and

995
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,680
Tuck something or other in Germany. I forget the name

996
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:00,700
and they're all selling Ubuntu Marte and they're adhering to the terms of the

997
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:08,960
Ubuntu trademark requirements, which is they ship the vanilla image. So I could understand why

998
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,480
Elementary would feel a bit put out by having a device

999
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:20,040
Probably piggybacking off of elementary's brand to ship a product

1000
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:28,360
Without actually involving them. Is this a Chinese vendor by any chance this white thing that I'm looking at on your YouTube?

1001
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,320
It sounds like it sounds like yeah, you saw there

1002
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,640
I'm sure is a Chinese company is okay. Yeah the builder

1003
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:41,880
But the the company who is selling it as the light book and they're also rebranding it because so I'm they must have a deal

1004
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,640
Because there is like, you know label like branding etched onto the laptop

1005
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,640
That's in one of the videos. You can see him says alpha on the back of it

1006
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,880
And that's the name of their company alpha light, but where are they based? They're in Tampa

1007
01:15:54,680 --> 01:16:00,320
Huh, Tampa, Florida, but they haven't like that's all I could find out because it says they ship from there

1008
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,520
but I haven't found like, you know a business address or anything like that, so it's

1009
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,320
It's weird. They have the elementary logo on the site, too

1010
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:15,480
Yeah, this just feels like the same the same kind of thing that you get from any like Alibaba a Chinese vendor who

1011
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,800
Just picks up a piece of software sticks it on a device and ships it out the door at the lowest possible

1012
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,120
Price, so this seems this is a lot different because in the reddit AMA they did

1013
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,240
people have asked a lot of different questions and every question they you know responded to was

1014
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:38,880
You know that the responses were very promising. For example, they asked about what processor was they gave the details

1015
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,920
They asked about if it's possible to get bigger RAM like pull notes. It's a you know, SD RAM type

1016
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,120
They were asking like is the battery replaceable as a hard drive placeable and like they were listing about how to replace the things

1017
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,720
Like it wasn't like they even get to the point where someone said well

1018
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:58,600
What if I want to have a different icon set like mocha and they said put it in your order and we'll add it before

1019
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
You so it's it they are

1020
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,800
Very attentive in the sense of the questions that are asked and if you go to the forum, they're also very attentive to that

1021
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Yeah, in fact, they say here in one of the in the AMA

1022
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:15,720
Somebody says did you make this laptop as the post claims or are you just reselling somebody else's machine with elementary OS pre-installed and

1023
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,440
Lightbook team who's been answering all the questions from lightbook says we are buying it at business to business

1024
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,280
Prices and then selling it with our logo engraved higher specs and on a modified version of elementary OS

1025
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:31,480
The majority of laptops made by smaller companies are just straight-up resales just like ours

1026
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,720
It's part of an OEM and then they talk about the Windows keyboard key. It's part of the OEM keyboard

1027
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,840
They'd have to order a certain amount from their supplier in order not to have the Windows key on there

1028
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,880
So it's yeah, it's kind of like exactly which I think they're speculating

1029
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,320
Yeah, and they also said that someone was like well, that's unfortunate

1030
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,400
You can't really code the key, but they said every laptop comes with a sticker of elementary OS on it

1031
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,640
So and in a way there is a

1032
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:58,520
So in a way there there they are addressing stuff

1033
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,320
It's just like their marketing needs work

1034
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,040
I would say that what would jump out at me?

1035
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,600
what jumps out at me as a

1036
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Systemic problem would be

1037
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,240
if your product

1038
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,960
Depends on elementary OS to sell

1039
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,800
It is in your best interest and longevity to work with elementary OS just like entryware works

1040
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,920
With wimpy because it's in their best interest for the project to know about you and like you

1041
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,760
Because they want to sell more products theoretically and so if you don't care

1042
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,240
We don't know if they contacted elementary and the elementary said no or not because yeah, you're right

1043
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,320
Although i'm pretty i'm pretty much

1044
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,880
I would be willing to make a bet that

1045
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,640
Yeah, I I mean I agree with I agree with your bet

1046
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,400
I'm just saying like we don't know for sure and it does feel sketchy

1047
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:52,200
But like the responses they keep making on reddit, they still continue to respond to reddit questions

1048
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:58,120
And on their forum you can go and leave a question and they'll you know, that's good. So that's a good answer really quickly

1049
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,280
like it's it's

1050
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,640
as far as like

1051
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:07,720
You know sales uh in customer service type approach. They're very good at responding and they're very

1052
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:12,520
Uh open and they're not trying to pretend about like different things. They're not trying to be like, you know

1053
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:19,480
A uh, a fake company like a fake chinese company using chinese products and just you know, pretending that it's a new thing

1054
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,880
They are admitting what they're doing

1055
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:28,360
It's just their mark the way their marketing feels really sketchy because there's like no one associated to it. There's no

1056
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:35,880
Like there's no original photos, but they do actually show the video in gray that the laptop engraved. So it is

1057
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:41,800
Like their claims are legitimate. They have proof of that, but it's just feels I don't know it still feels sketchy

1058
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,000
I if I had a spare 250, I totally would try it

1059
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,080
I think I also agree with the beard in the chat room

1060
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,040
He says, you know, the thing is is how much of a discount could they really be getting?

1061
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,640
With the expected amount of sales numbers they're going to get these are probably going to be under a thousand easily I would say

1062
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,640
But who knows but even let's just say it was five thousand. They're not going to get some sort of massive discount

1063
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,280
So where is the room for profit?

1064
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,160
So what that seems like they have like if you can get 150 with uh,

1065
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,920
You can get a laptop those laptops at a buying a quantity of 300 you can get them for 150

1066
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:18,680
So that's all there's another problem then because that's that's too easy. That's that's that's too easily accessible, too

1067
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,200
There's this is this is not a we don't know if that's actually what they're doing

1068
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,880
I just know I just saw that myself. They might actually be better for them. I don't know if they do it

1069
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,760
Yeah, they say, you know, they're saying they're buying they're saying they're you know

1070
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,360
They are buying business to business and getting some sort of bulk discount. That's all they've said

1071
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,760
Uh, I would be wager. I'd be willing to wager if I was going to be looking at this and it's something I'd be

1072
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,920
You know, this would be part of my calculus would be they're probably not going to sell tens of thousands of these things

1073
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:46,440
So they're probably not getting some astronomical discount and they don't seem to be directly working with elementary OS

1074
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,040
So they don't seem to have a clear path to profit and they don't seem to have a good relationship with the distribution

1075
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,040
They're shipping. They're also not

1076
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,160
As michael's talking about they're not really presenting a human face, right that you can become excited about yeah

1077
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,480
Understand the motivation, you know, we're left to speculate

1078
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,960
But here's something that I have learned over the years and this is where I kind of give them some room is

1079
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:11,000
When you are just setting up like I go back to the purism folks when you're just getting set up with this

1080
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:18,440
It is there is so many little things that you have to get just right for a product like this that it can take a company

1081
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,520
A few times of trying this before you can actually get it

1082
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,960
A few times of trying this before they really start to fire on all cylinders

1083
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:32,920
And this could be their first foray into this area. I I know lightbook is uh, I mean, I I guess it's available now

1084
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,400
Isn't it actually I think you can I think they say order now at least so I I guess they are shipping it

1085
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,480
So it is it's a it's a product. It's gonna get out there

1086
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:45,720
They'll have customer feedback and we'll see if they iterate on it. I I it's enough to pique my interest

1087
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:50,440
250 to 270 depending on your amount of storage

1088
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:55,720
That's it. You know, that's that's enough. That's enough to kind of pique my interest and go there might be something here

1089
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,440
that's worth to worth discussing but

1090
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,040
It oh you can get it in black. There you go. Wes. I know how you like everything

1091
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,120
Oh, really you got to get one of each got to get I mean if you're real patient

1092
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,440
there's a there's a white there's a black and there's a

1093
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:15,080
One that's got white base and black. I mean a red back of the led led screen

1094
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:15,960
This is pretty great

1095
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:24,120
You mean you could in theory you walk away with a laptop with 540 gig 40 gigabyte 544 gigs of quote-unquote hybrid storage

1096
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:29,000
Which I assume is spinning with a on a solid little bit of solid state. No, no, no

1097
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:35,160
It's it's two different drives one at one ms m.2 say to uh, in a ray gig ssd

1098
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:40,520
And they're set. They're set as the they're set at dil boot. I'm, not sure how they've structured it

1099
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,720
But one is they're basically they're saying hybrid approach, but it's not a hybrid drive

1100
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:50,920
It's two different drives one ssd. That's 32 and one that's the hard drive. That's 500. Yeah, they call it hybrid storage

1101
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,320
Okay, so that's where you get the 544 gigs

1102
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,360
Um, and so for all of that, so whatever like raid or whatever they're using to pull that off

1103
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,440
for that

1104
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:05,260
And a black one that's you know got a decent seller on quad core in it. Um, 283

1105
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:13,640
That's a pretty amazing deal and when i'm looking actually yeah, you know specs wise especially that it's a 1080

1106
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:19,400
It's a full 1080p. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah, 1366. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And you know, it's better than a chromebook

1107
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:25,160
Yeah as much ram as a chromebook did hey and they take bitcoin damn it

1108
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
Let's just put it in danger territory

1109
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,840
damn it

1110
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,840
It's interesting, huh?

1111
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,360
yeah, it's uh

1112
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,160
Something to watch was there was someone on reddit that said that they were going to buy it to do a block a review

1113
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,240
on their blog, so uh

1114
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:46,920
Yeah, i'll i'll try to like, you know bookmark that yeah, okay do it. Yeah, maybe follow

1115
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,200
I keep following it for us

1116
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,120
Maybe you know because it'd be interesting to see if they actually turn this into something, you know

1117
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,120
Maybe you don't actually turn this thing into a real product

1118
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,440
Maybe they'll get to the point where they'll their elementary OS project is comfortable working with them

1119
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,880
And maybe they have to get to a point where they're substantial and demand the attention of elementary OS before and maybe it's who knows

1120
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,360
I don't know. They should just give me a call and i'll help them with the marketing too. There you go. There you go

1121
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,120
Find him

1122
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,800
He's in the mumble room

1123
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,920
He did a fight

1124
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,200
Uh, i'm gonna give a real quick plug before we run for linux fest northwest coming up soon may 6th and 7th

1125
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:23,960
I'll be there. Wes will be there. It's gonna be a hell of a show. I think I think right now, uh,

1126
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,520
after after reviewing our

1127
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:31,320
Adventures at scale this year and kind of looking at the news that came out from scale

1128
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:36,120
I think it's safe to say there may be a new contender for the number one linux event

1129
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,600
in the united states

1130
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,280
run by the community

1131
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,880
i'm not saying it's gonna be necessarily as big as something maybe the linux foundation could put on right

1132
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,280
but as far as

1133
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,040
run by the community

1134
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,040
free to freaking attend

1135
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:54,440
With a great venue and great talks. I think we may have a new pack leader stepping up

1136
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,320
This is this so I mean I am so happy i'm so happy. I mean i've scaled

1137
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:04,120
I i'm sure they'll pull things around too. They'll they're gonna they're gonna get that live stream taken care of and that whole

1138
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,680
Attendance thing figured out they're gonna get it pulled around

1139
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,280
I believe in them, but I think this might be this might be linux fest year right here

1140
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:17,400
2017 is the year to go. I am really looking forward to it. Noah and I are already rubbing our hands together making plans

1141
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,480
Yeah, we've oh

1142
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,980
Very excited about it. You can find out more at linuxfestnorthwest.org

1160
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:16,080
Awesome. Thank you everybody in the Mumba Room. It was great to have both Popey and

1161
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,560
Wimpy back. Nice to hear from Mr. Lunduke. Now we gotta go pick our titles. Go get your

1162
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:26,560
titles. And then Mr. West has got to get his business up in here. You know what I'm saying?

1163
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:37,720
That's right. Turn on JB1. So JBtitles.com. That is bright. That reminds me of the Kodi

1164
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:44,920
Android situation in a way. It's not exactly similar but it reminds me of that. Yes Mr.

1165
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:49,160
Popey. Hey Chris. So a couple of things I didn't want to mention on the show but I thought

1166
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:56,540
I'd tell you now. There was a Red Hat booth at MWC as well and loads of our guys went

1167
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:03,360
over there because they had some of the best coffee at MWC. That's awesome. Good on you.
