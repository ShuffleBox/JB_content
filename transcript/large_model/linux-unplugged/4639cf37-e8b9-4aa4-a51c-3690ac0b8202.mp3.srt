1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
I have, I have, I have a, I have to come clean.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,520
I know what this is.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,480
So I went through Steam Left and that's that site that you plug in your Steam account and

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,360
it tells you how many hours of your life it would take to complete your gameplay.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,960
And this is for the games in my library that are uncompleted, 3,405 continuous hours or

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,280
in other words I would have to play for 141 days, 21 hours and 15 minutes straight to

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,520
complete my Steam library at this point.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,600
I could sail to Hawaii from LA 20 times, every time you load it gives you a different stat

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
too.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,440
I could watch the entire Star Trek the original series 51 times, which that's probably pretty

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,920
close to what I would actually do.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,920
I could work 85 full weeks, watch every Simpsons episode 15 times.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,120
I could film the Blair Witch Project 17 times, well I think that's exactly what I would do.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,240
There you go.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
That's my shame right there.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,460
Steam Left, you can go to steamleft.com and then plug your Steam profile in there and

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,400
see how many hours it would take you to complete.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
That's a sign that I've been buying too many Steam games for Linux.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
And mine's under 500.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,160
I could drive across Russia 44 times.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,360
4,219 continuous hours for me.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,040
141 for me.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Wow.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,840
572 hours for Keller, okay.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,560
Yeah, so Poppy, I got you beat a little bit.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Just a bit.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Do you guys see the mix?

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,360
So what proportion of your game are Linux games and what proportion are Windows games?

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Oh, good question.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,120
You know, because I've been a Steam user for a long time, but I have quite a bit of Steam,

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I mean it's, should I, let's see, I could open it up, let's find out.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Quite a bit of my games are Linux games because once they came out for Linux I just kind of

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
only started buying.

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,600
So I've got in total 206 games and of those, 104 are Linux.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Damn.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,680
All right, let's see, I'm pulling up Steam right now, standby.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,880
Updating user configuration, says Steam, whatever the...

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,080
It's in your home directory, isn't that what it's doing?

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Yeah.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,160
Okay, so I have 238 games of 169 of which are Linux.

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,400
That's a good proportion.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,120
That's good.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,600
Welcome to Linux Unplugs, your weekly Linux talk show that's writing down the information

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,720
of things superhighway.

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
My name is Chris.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
And my name is Matt.

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,360
Hey, Matt, you know it's all about the Internet of Things today.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Oh, it is.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,120
Do you have all your things interneted at your place, Matt?

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,800
I actually do have a hub, although I only have two sensors active.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh, you got more Internet of Things than I do, although I do have Hughes lights and I

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,480
think those are considered Internet of Things, yeah.

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
They are, they are.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
I know, I need to up my game, I need to get like a nest, I need to get everything connected,

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,480
get it reporting and talking to dashboards, I need more dashboards.

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Smart things, dude.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,440
It's got open source stuff going on there.

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Hmm, hmm, interesting.

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, Ubuntu is prepped to take over

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,160
the Internet of Things devices and we're gonna see if it's actually a real initiative or

61
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
something they just slapped together once they saw CoreOS.

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
We'll talk about that.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,720
But again, later on in the show, there's been a big hoo-roo-ha-ha between Google and Microsoft

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,360
about the disclosure of patches in Windows and Google just recently released some information

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,880
about a security flaw in Windows just a couple of days before Patch Tuesday and Microsoft

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,800
got all upset about it and it created this big debate again online.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,720
Well, Linus Torvalds was speaking at a keynote and he was asked about public disclosures

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
of bugs.

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,240
He stated his stance on it, it's a little controversial and we'll play a clip of that

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,560
later on in the show.

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,880
And then also, somebody tried to pin Linus down and get him to say, hey, how come the

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,560
documentation isn't very good and what are you gonna do about improving the documentation

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,600
of a Linux kernel?

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,000
And you probably, you won't believe Linus' response.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,240
I have not seen this covered anywhere else and when I heard it, I'm like, how is this

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
not news?

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
So we'll play a clip of that, too.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
So I think it should be a good show today, Matt.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Nice.

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Yeah.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
And we got some great feedback, too, from the audience, so I just picked out a few good

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
ones.

83
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,720
Some emails we're gonna try to get to, but just a couple this week, so before we get

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,960
into all of that, let's bring in the Mamba Room.

85
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Time appropriate greetings, Mamba Room.

86
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Hello.

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Hello.

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Hello.

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,860
Boy, aren't you just a handsome bunch.

90
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Look at you guys.

91
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,200
Looking really good today.

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,120
You know what it might be is I noticed this Ubuntu Mate desktop seems to have really great

93
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
fonts out of the box.

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Maybe that's what it is.

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,800
Everybody's looking real good.

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,000
So Earl writes in, really to Matt, Earl writes in and he says, Matt, I listened to your enthusiasm

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,320
for the Ubuntu Mate a few times now.

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,560
I'd like to try it.

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,240
I started using Linux with Ubuntu 14.10 and I've been a user ever since.

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,920
I went to Linux Mint when Ubuntu had to abandon GNOME 2.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,200
My problem is I generally use Wi-Fi from the public library when I can't use torrents.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,520
I tried HTTP sites listed in Europe, but I keep getting a timeout after an hour or so

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,920
when downloading Ubuntu Mate.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,480
Do you know if there's an HTTP site in the US?

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,680
I maintain several computers running Mint Mate for friends and the only thing I don't

106
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,920
like about having it is having to reinstall after every upgrade.

107
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,960
And no, Chris, I'm not going to GNOME 3.

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm 70 years old and I don't need that frustration.

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,720
GNOME 3 should be put out to pasture with a bullet between its eyes, Earl.

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
And I know Wimpy's here too.

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,800
Wimpy, do you have any advice if he's having problems downloading Mate edition in Europe?

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,920
Well, no, unfortunately all of the mirrors are in Europe.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,400
The only thing I could suggest is grabbing the torrents, but he seems to imply that he

114
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,480
hasn't got access to the torrents.

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,560
So if you're going to do an HTTP download, it's coming from a European server.

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,760
It's kind of just the way it is right now.

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,040
The Ubuntu Mate community have been very generous in donating to host a new community site and

118
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,120
there's some surplus funds.

119
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,760
So what I'll do is I'll put up a mirror in North America and I'll send you the details

120
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,360
and maybe you can put me in touch with this guy and we'll put an American mirror up.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
How's that?

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Oh, wow.

123
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
How about that, Earl?

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
That's awesome.

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
There's a custom solution right there for you.

126
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Very good.

127
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
All right.

128
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, and you know, I was going to say, otherwise my go-to would be definitely go with torrents.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,280
It's a shame that the public libraries block that, but I guess I understand why they do

130
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
it.

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
It's got to be for piracy.

132
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I would imagine so.

133
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
It's kind of a blanket solution, but yeah.

134
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, block all of the things just in case it gets used for something bad.

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,560
Armani writes in and he wanted to comment on the Mac Exodus topic we've been touching

136
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
on.

137
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,780
Hey guys, I came to contribute to all the Mac Exodus talk when I realized something

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
kind of funny.

139
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,720
All of my experience with Linux has been on Apple hardware.

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Well except for my Nexus 5, which I have Ubuntu on.

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
Back in high school, before I even had a Mac, I was running Linux on my iPod.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,040
This made me pretty popular among the nerd crowd and I ended up loading up with a bunch

143
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,360
of my friends iPods as well.

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,600
Needless to say, the rest of the Apple plebs on campus were pretty jealous when not only

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,160
did I have video before the iPod video was out, but I also got to play Doom.

146
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,080
Anyway, now I have a Macbook Pro running Ubuntu 14.10.

147
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,880
I made the switch to 12.04 a couple of years back and that's when I discovered Jupiter

148
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Broadcasting.

149
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
After a couple of months, it became my daily driver.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,880
Then somewhere around 13.10, I switched to Ubuntu Gnome and fell in love.

151
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
Now I'm hooked on Linux and an avid listener of your shows.

152
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,720
One thing is for sure though, I'll probably never buy anything from Apple again.

153
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
Maybe I'll go for the new Dell XPS 13.

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
So yeah, he sent a picture along to me.

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
It looks nice.

156
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,360
It's an older Macbook, so maybe that gives him a little less problems and he's got Gnome

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,640
on there.

158
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Have you seen this Dell XPS 13?

159
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Have you seen this?

160
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,160
I have not actually seen it.

161
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,800
I've been hearing a lot about it and because of my completely ridiculous bigotry toward

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,180
Dell, I purposely haven't looked, but it does sound like that they are onto something and

163
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,720
it would definitely signal to others that they need to catch up to that perhaps.

164
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm doing Popeye a favor.

165
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,800
See I know that Popeye is eventually, he's like he's riding this ThinkPad, this old busted

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,360
ThinkPad of his for a really long time and he's trying to ride that and eventually he's

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,600
going to have to pull the trigger and get something and so I want to be there for him.

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,520
So I went ahead and I picked up a XPS 13 Ultrabook and I'm going to tell you a little bit about

169
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,580
it here in just a second why I got it, all of the horrible experiences I've had with

170
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,080
Dell which confirm all of the problems that I have with Dell and why I think this might

171
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
make a great machine.

172
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,980
So I will comment on this in just a second and kind of tell you where my head's at with

173
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,040
grabbing this Dell laptop, but first why don't I tell you about Linux Academy.

174
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's start right there because Linux Academy is pretty great and I think it's something

175
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
that's worth checking out.

176
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,240
If you've heard some of these technologies out there that sure seem pretty fancy, you

177
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,000
know things like Puppet, NGINX, OpenStack, Virtualization, Docker, all that kind of stuff.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,560
You know the things that are fundamental to being successful in this space now?

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,120
Well Linux Academy has incredible courseware on all of it.

180
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,400
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,200
That's a special Linux unplugged discount, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,760
You're going to get the 33% discount.

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,160
They have step-by-step video courses for all of their courseware, downloadable comprehensive

184
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,720
study guides, live streams where you can ask the educators questions directly.

185
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,960
Stuff comes with its own servers so if you have a course on AWS or maybe you're learning

186
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,800
something with NGINX, you know whatever something's in that range, you actually get to play with

187
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,560
the technology, set up the system, look at the config file, they give you a public address

188
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,180
and you get to bang on it like a real box.

189
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,120
That way you've had true legitimate experience with it and as you go, each section is broken

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
out, tells you how long you've got to complete, it gives you reminders if you need to and

191
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,440
if you're tight on time, they have custom learning plans.

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,160
You go in there and just set your availability and it automatically generates a custom plan

193
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,800
just for you with reminders and all that kind of good stuff.

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,520
You just got to note too that they've been refreshing the NGINX and Docker courses specifically

195
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
to make sure they stay current.

196
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,840
This is one of the other things that's really great about Linux Academy is they're keeping

197
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,520
all of that stuff fresh, always making sure that it's got the most relevant, latest information

198
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,840
so that way when you go take that courseware, it's totally up to date.

199
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,780
The other thing that's super slick about it is they have seven plus Linux distributions

200
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,440
you can choose from, whichever distribution you pick, then the courseware automatically

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,560
adjusts to that distribution including like the virtual machine and all of that.

202
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,560
So you know you say CentOS, well the courseware is all CentOS, the virtual machine image is

203
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,600
CentOS, all of the environment, all the commands and all of the courseware, everything's CentOS.

204
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,620
Next time you go through, you choose an Ubuntu rig, same thing.

205
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Super slick.

206
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,480
The reason is because these are people that are crazy passionate about Linux and open

207
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
source, right?

208
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,160
These are people that really care about this.

209
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not a generic education facility where they've got everything from fixing your sync

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to working in Adobe After Effects.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,640
That's not what Linux Academy does.

212
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,360
They're hyper focused on this stuff.

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,520
It's a bunch of Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers that came together to create

214
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,820
Linux Academy.

215
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,120
And you can get in on the action over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, special discount just for

216
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
the show, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

217
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Go check out Linux Academy and see all of the cool courseware they have available, linuxacademy.com

218
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
slash unplugged.

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,560
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

220
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,920
Okay, so yeah, you know, I was really not so sure.

221
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,900
I watched CES, I watched all the hardware that came out of CES, and I think out of everything

222
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,560
that was shown, I was the most impressed by the XPS 13 Ultrabook by Dell, which surprised

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
me because I'm not generally a Dell fan.

224
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,520
And I've been kind of stuck in this like, what am I going to do?

225
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,240
I need to move my hardware situation around for a little while.

226
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,600
And the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge is that you can buy from Dell directly

227
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,440
with Bitcoin, which really surprised me.

228
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,040
Like the whole thing from end to end, like all the accessories, the laptop itself, it's

229
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,640
one click Bitcoin, it's tied in with Coinbase and you're done.

230
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,960
That is super, a super, super neat system.

231
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,840
And so that was sort of like the final deciding factor for me to go pull the trigger on the

232
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
XPS 13.

233
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
So here's what I got.

234
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Is it the new edge to edge screen watch?

235
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Yes.

236
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Yep.

237
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
With the 3200 by 1800 display.

238
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah.

239
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did you buy the windows

240
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
one?

241
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
I did.

242
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I did.

243
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Yes.

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
And here's why.

245
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Well, here's why.

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
I'm not, I'm not a big Dell fan.

247
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
And I have, I really have very little faith that getting their next Sputnik version versus

248
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,100
this is going to make a huge difference.

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,820
But I figure either way, if they ship that eventually, it'll probably benefit this one.

250
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,040
And essentially I need something now.

251
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,920
It's going to make a big difference to your freedom, my friend.

252
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, I don't mind having the windows license.

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,680
I don't have any license copies of windows right now.

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,440
And that about twice a year becomes about a real pain in my ass where I consider buying

255
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,640
windows and then I never can actually make myself do it.

256
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,800
So now I'm like, well now I have the license.

257
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
So that's good for some stuff.

258
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,120
I wanted to kind of, the reason why I wanted to go buy it now is I wanted to get out ahead

259
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,400
of it just basically for the purposes of having it for a little while.

260
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,000
So by the time they do ship something, I'll have a really sound opinion on the hardware

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
itself.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,880
So I can talk about it to the audience from a pretty educated standpoint, because if this

263
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,640
is a nice laptop, as nice as I think it's going to be, this could be the Linux Mac book

264
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,000
potentially, I think.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,400
And so I wanted to grab it now and I wanted to have an educated opinion about it.

266
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,160
So that way when the Linux version does ship, I can talk to the audience from a pretty educated

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
standpoint on it.

268
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,480
So it'll be maybe a one to one, but hopefully it'll be really close.

269
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,600
So that's another reason why I've kind of pulled the trigger early on it.

270
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,400
So what I got with it was eight gigabytes of RAM, a 512 gigabyte SSD.

271
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,520
It's got the i7 550 processor, 13 inch display, but because it's edge to edge, it actually

272
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,600
fits like in an 11 point something housing, which is kind of interesting.

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,080
And good news, it comes with McAfee LiveSafe image trial version.

274
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Oh, that's great.

275
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Yeah.

276
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Yeah.

277
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
So I can get that installed.

278
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm pretty happy about that.

279
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Garbage.

280
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,240
So this ships with the fifth gen new Broadwell chip.

281
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,440
And I was looking at a review and I don't, you know, I take it for what it is because

282
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
it comes from Forbes.

283
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,000
No, no, if it's Forbes, but they were saying that they were seeing a 20 percent GPU speed

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,680
improvement over the previous Iris graphics.

285
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,500
So 20 percent is, I mean, that was already getting pretty close.

286
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,640
There was some serious casual gaming you could serious casual gaming you could do.

287
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,860
So that's pretty healthy.

288
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
That's pretty healthy.

289
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
I'll get the machine.

290
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,080
I will probably not even boot it into Windows.

291
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Do you need to?

292
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,360
Do you need to boot it into Windows or can you just immediately format it?

293
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
I have not bought a laptop with Windows.

294
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,440
I would probably, yeah, I'm trying to remember now because it's been a bit, I don't think

295
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,920
it, no, I don't think it matters.

296
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
If you live.

297
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Yeah.

298
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
If you live disk it.

299
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Actually, I don't know.

300
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Because, yeah, it's been a while.

301
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm not sure.

302
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I suppose.

303
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,120
I don't know.

304
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm hoping this is going to be the, I don't know.

305
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm hoping this is going to be like sort of like the laptop that a lot of people want

306
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
to get to run Linux.

307
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
We'll see.

308
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,160
I'll give you my review.

309
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,520
My gut feeling is I would probably boot into Windows first.

310
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,080
If you're going to keep it and you're not going to do one of these, try and get a Windows

311
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
refund.

312
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,600
If you're going to keep the Windows license, then I would boot into it at least and clone

313
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Ziller it onto a USB so you've got a copy of it.

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah.

315
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
But also.

316
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Makes me feel dirty.

317
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,860
Well, yeah, but I would also check the Dell website for any BIOS updates and do those

318
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
while you're in Windows.

319
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Oh, sure.

320
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Just in case.

321
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Right.

322
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Right.

323
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Yeah.

324
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
That's a good point, actually.

325
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Because they got the utilities for all that garbage.

326
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,360
This is stuff you got to consider when you buy a Windows machine to run Linux.

327
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Yeah.

328
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Yeah.

329
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
It really is.

330
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,400
Some of the reviews are saying that 15-hour battery life is a bit of an exaggeration.

331
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,880
It's more like seven hours of battery life if you get the hybrid screen.

332
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah.

333
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
What a shock.

334
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,000
It's probably 15 hours when you like turn the brightness down to nothing.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You don't touch any part of it.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Turn off the Wi-Fi.

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Turn off the Bluetooth.

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Turn off everything.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, any of that.

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Run it at 1080p.

341
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know.

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
All that kind of stuff.

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Right.

344
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah.

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Exactly.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So, anyways, I'll give my updates soon and we'll see how it goes.

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,640
I mean, so at the end of the day, you really kind of come out winning in that you bought

349
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
it with Bitcoin.

350
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
That's kind of cool.

351
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Yeah.

352
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah.

353
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I mean, economically cool.

354
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Not only that, but I bought it like back on the 7th or the 8th, which Bitcoin was still

355
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,840
about worth almost $300 when I did it.

356
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Oh, well, yeah.

357
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Then there you go.

358
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
So, yeah.

359
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
You got a little hedge to your edge there.

360
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Yeah.

361
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,080
But I feel like maybe this is a bad time to use Bitcoin because usually what happens when

362
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,960
the price goes down like this is a bunch of people start buying and then it starts steadily

363
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,520
going up for a while.

364
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,360
So I might come out on the bad end of that possibility.

365
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Yeah.

366
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
It is a possibility.

367
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Matt, I'm going to try giving a guest a call.

368
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Let's see if...

369
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
All right.

370
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Hey, Christian.

371
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Can you hear us?

372
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah, I can hear you.

373
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Can you hear me?

374
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah.

375
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
We hear you great.

376
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Thanks for coming on the show.

377
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
So, Matt, this is Christian.

378
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
He's working on Gnome Builder.

379
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Awesome.

380
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
And you're probably familiar.

381
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
We've talked about the Indiegogo project that's going on.

382
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
I'm sure you're all plugged.

383
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Thanks.

384
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Thanks for having me.

385
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, no, no problem.

386
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,200
So congratulations, by the way, on the success of the Gnome Builder project.

387
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,480
That seems like that Indiegogo has probably gone better than you expected, I would imagine.

388
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Yeah.

389
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,240
I mean, significantly better than I expected.

390
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,320
I tried to set some pretty ambitious goals, but at a very, very reasonable price point.

391
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,920
And I'm hoping that people saw that and really came out to help.

392
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Well, what struck me about it is you seem like maybe you're a crazy person because you

393
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,440
quit your full-time job to do this.

394
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Why take that risk?

395
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,040
And you did that even before you launched the fundraiser.

396
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah, you know, I've been a part of the free software community for a long time.

397
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:23,440
And at some point, I decided that fixing the tools that we're all using is far more important

398
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,760
than individual career growth to me.

399
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,920
So I had a pretty kickass job, too.

400
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,960
I was working at MongoDB, working on their C driver, and there's a great group of people

401
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
there.

402
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,460
They really care about free software.

403
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,200
There's a reason why the products say GPL-licensed.

404
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,280
But ultimately, this was the most important thing I could be doing.

405
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,120
So I really had to make the switch.

406
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,740
That's very impressive and very admirable.

407
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,320
So when you launched the fundraiser, has the scope of what Gnome Builder is going to include

408
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,960
expanded quite a bit since the funding kicked in?

409
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Well, it really determines how much and for how long people are willing to support me.

410
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes, I want all of these features in there.

411
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,720
I knew that for me to be able to be successful with this, the most important thing I can

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
do is build Builder with Builder.

413
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,960
So that meant the first priority is C. Builder has to be written in C for technical reasons.

414
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,020
We want to reuse as much of the software as we can.

415
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
We want to reuse Glade.

416
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
We want to reuse Dev Help.

417
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,320
We want to reuse Git G, GTK Source View, and all these things are best integrated from

418
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,680
C. So that doesn't mean that we don't want to support Vala.

419
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,080
It doesn't mean we don't want to support Python or JavaScript or any of these other languages

420
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,760
in a first-class way.

421
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,120
It just means that our priority had to be this first.

422
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,900
So I knew that a lot of people would really care about those languages, and I really want

423
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,280
to support them.

424
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,640
It can't be the first thing to be done.

425
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
We can't put the cart before the horse.

426
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Right.

427
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
That makes sense.

428
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,840
I mean, focusing like that means that you get that right, and then once you get that

429
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,880
right, you move on from there.

430
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,760
But this looks like maybe, is it going to become a general IDE for GNOME eventually,

431
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,600
like all kinds of languages in there, all kinds of support?

432
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,760
I mean, that is certainly my goal.

433
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,560
I don't care what language you write GNOME software in, and most of us don't.

434
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,280
So anything I can do to bring more people in and more people contributing, I'm perfectly

435
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
happy to do that.

436
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
You already have basic support for some of these languages.

437
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,840
You already get like Air Reporting for Vala.

438
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,000
You already get Air Reporting for Go if you have a working Go set up.

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,680
So even beyond GNOME, someday that's quite possible.

440
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,760
But I definitely want to stay focused myself on how do we build GNOME software better.

441
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,080
Yeah.

442
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,300
And it seems like this would be a great tool for when somebody asks the question, where

443
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,560
do I get started?

444
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,080
People can say, okay, get started with Builder and go from there, which seems like such a

445
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,280
simple thing to be able to say, but we have lacked that one coherent answer for so long

446
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,840
that I've talked to a lot of developers who've been put off by that.

447
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,000
It just seems like there's so many choices.

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,080
And this represents, well, if you're going to go GNOME, if you're going to do GTK, start

449
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
here.

450
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,040
Now, that itself is a huge goal.

451
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,040
And so I'm pretty impressed that you've raised $42,000, but what happens six, seven, eight

452
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,880
months from now, this is your full-time job, that funding sort of begins to wane.

453
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,340
How do you make it ongoing?

454
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
What's the trick there?

455
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Yeah.

456
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,160
I mean, I think a really important thing is to, number one, build a really strong community.

457
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,560
So we can all share the burden.

458
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,360
But on the point that you mentioned there of having a single answer to tell people,

459
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,720
that is really, really important.

460
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,880
For my time spending helping people get started in free software, almost always the first

461
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,160
question is, how do I get started?

462
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,180
And it's a really monumental thing to get over.

463
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,800
And you look at something like Android or whatever, they have an IDE that you install

464
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,980
and there's other choices, but there's a blessed sort of way.

465
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,200
And you enable developer mode on your phone.

466
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,760
I'd really like to see that in terms of GNOME, where you're just able to enable developer

467
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,440
mode in the control settings and all of a sudden you have a complete development environment

468
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,400
and everything else is done underneath the hood and you don't have to worry about it.

469
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,280
So would a goal of yours be maybe to have Builder almost kind of considered a part of

470
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,200
a GNOME desktop, maybe like in developer mode where it's almost under the branch of GNOME?

471
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Absolutely.

472
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,080
I mean, this is, I think, I contributed.

473
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,640
I think it's just a great project initiative and we'll have a link in the show notes.

474
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,520
So Christian, I guess you're already working now, so does anything change for you now this

475
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
is successful or are you just plowing on forward?

476
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,480
Well, you know, the last couple of weeks I've been so busy with fundraising and communicating

477
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,560
with people.

478
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,840
And so the amount of code I've gotten written in January is significantly less than all

479
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,200
of the other months.

480
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,360
So I'm really looking forward to just, you know, putting the blinders on and writing

481
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
code again.

482
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah, absolutely.

483
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
I bet.

484
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Well, we'll have a link to the Indiegogo.

485
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I recommend anybody who wants to go back.

486
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,640
It's six days left and I think this is a great initiative and you're solving a huge problem

487
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,360
just from the development people that I've talked to.

488
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,240
So keep up the great work and thanks for coming on the show.

489
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
It's been my pleasure.

490
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Thanks for having me.

491
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Yeah.

492
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Have a great rest of your day.

493
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Awesome.

494
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Yeah.

495
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Well, so check it out, everybody.

496
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
We'll have a link in the show notes.

497
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
That's GNOME Builder.

498
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,360
I think it's a great initiative.

499
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, it sounds like it.

500
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Okay guys.

501
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,000
So why don't we take a quick moment right here and talk about something pretty neat.

502
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,720
DigitalOcean has just recently rolled out free BSD support.

503
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
DigitalOcean is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged show.

504
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,480
And I want you to head over there and try it out.

505
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,840
There's a lot of great things you can do including CoreOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, now free BSD and we've

506
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,560
got a brand new promo code for the year, which is kind of like, it makes me feel all official.

507
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
It's D.O.

508
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Unplugged.

509
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
D.O.

510
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Unplugged.

511
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
That's so cool.

512
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Yeah.

513
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,280
One word, lowercase, real easy and it's going to give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

514
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
What?

515
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Digital what?

516
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Yeah.

517
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
DigitalOcean.

518
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,080
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

519
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

520
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,920
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

521
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,200
Some pricing plans start only $5 a month.

522
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,640
For 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

523
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,160
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

524
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
and London.

525
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
And yeah, their London one's super fancy.

526
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,600
Go figure.

527
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,720
But that, they're all, just check out their Instagram feed.

528
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
They're all fancy.

529
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll tell you what's super fancy though.

530
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,360
That interface of DigitalOcean's.

531
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,180
The dashboard they've got, it's like amazing.

532
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
It's a bar setter.

533
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,160
It truly is simple and intuitive, but yet extremely powerful and you can replicate the

534
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,320
functionality on a larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API, which is so sweet because

535
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,320
if you're lazy like I am, there's already a whole bunch of people making great apps

536
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,080
out there for you and you can just like snap it right in the puppet.

537
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,120
You can take advantage of like from your Android app, you can be taking snapshots of your droplets.

538
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,320
I mean it's full fledged nuts how awesome it already is for you.

539
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,480
But all that said, like if you're like a go-getter and like you can do things fancy, like use

540
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,160
APIs, then have at it.

541
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Like more power to you.

542
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,920
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, spin up a droplet, create a GitLab, a WordPress, a Ghost, OwnCloud,

543
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,600
BitTorrent Sync, you name it.

544
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,200
So many things, a Minecraft server, a Mumble server, a Jitsi server, the backend server

545
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,000
for your crazy Ruby J-bot script.

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,920
Not that I would know any of that kind of stuff.

547
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,740
It's your own server up in the cloud that you get root access to, DigitalOcean.com and

548
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,480
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, all one word, DOUNPLUGGED, lowercase, you get a $10 credit.

549
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,960
Try out the $5 rig two months for free, the $5 rig two months for free with DOUNPLUGGED.

550
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,720
DigitalOcean.com and a big thanks to DigitalOcean.

551
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
You guys freaking rock.

552
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,080
You guys freaking rock and I think it's so cool you just keep on expanding and adding

553
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,040
all this cool stuff even if it is a BSD.

554
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm just really glad they're adding free BSD support because it makes my 2015 predictions

555
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,240
a little bit closer to reality.

556
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
So I'm all jacked up about that.

557
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I think that's great.

558
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,720
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED when you check out, and a huge thanks to DigitalOcean

559
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,400
for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

560
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
You guys are cray cool.

561
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Cray cool.

562
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,000
It's actually, I don't know if you caught this on Google+, I was talking about spinning

563
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,800
up a couple instances of Ghost.

564
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Oh yeah.

565
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
It's overdue.

566
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,280
I have some sites that would just benefit more from going that way and it's so minimalist

567
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
and it just, boom.

568
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
You know what I mean?

569
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
All that content.

570
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I totally agree.

571
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I totally agree.

572
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
I'm all in on that.

573
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Okay.

574
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,400
So let's talk about the big announcement from Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth today.

575
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,120
Smart things and the internet of things or whatever you want to call it.

576
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,400
Little boards with ARM chips and network connectivity powered by Ubuntu Snappy Core.

577
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,220
That brand new fancy version of Ubuntu that we've heard a lot about recently.

578
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,080
And I thought to get us started, instead of me blabbing on about it, let's join Mark

579
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,000
Shuttleworth in his home.

580
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
I love this.

581
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,420
I can't help it because I do video production.

582
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,040
So I notice things that make it not quite like a web home cam video.

583
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,600
Like the fact that he's miked with a wireless mic pack and that this.

584
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Oh yeah.

585
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
But anyways, it's still a great video for Mark.

586
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,480
So Mark's going to give us a big introduction to Snappy Ubuntu Core for smart devices.

587
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
For ARM and X86.

588
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,580
I actually think this is kind of a smart move.

589
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,520
So let's hear it in his words.

590
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Hello and welcome to my home.

591
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,360
I'm absolutely inspired at the moment by the entrepreneurs and the inventors who are creating

592
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,920
this next generation of extraordinary devices.

593
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
And I don't mean PCs and phones.

594
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,400
I mean all of the automation that is quietly transforming our homes and our lives.

595
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
This is my house.

596
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I could give you a tour.

597
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
It wouldn't be a very long one.

598
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
It's a small house.

599
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,960
There are two of us who live here and two dogs.

600
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,600
And yet this morning walking around I counted 16 little boxes that I think are running Linux

601
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,900
and which are doing all sorts of things from home automation to entertainment and security.

602
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,520
And I think over the next year or two that number is going to continue to grow with devices

603
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,120
that make our lives more interesting, safer, more secure, more efficient, more environmentally

604
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,360
friendly and richer in many, many different ways.

605
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,200
So I want to celebrate that extraordinary progress and I also, as somebody who really

606
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,520
believes in the power of open source to unleash creativity, I want to celebrate that the vast

607
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,240
majority of these devices today do run Linux.

608
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,360
That's an enormous success for all of us in the Linux community.

609
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,960
But they don't necessarily run Ubuntu, do they?

610
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,000
And so let's start here.

611
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,400
So Ubuntu's snappy, those of you who remember, is the transactionally ready version of Ubuntu.

612
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,560
So if an update goes back, you just roll back and you're good to go.

613
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,760
It makes a lot of sense to have this on devices, sort of embedded appliance like devices that

614
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,920
need to be super reliable.

615
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,360
And I think that's all well and good.

616
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,640
I'm reading this interview though with Mark Shuttleworth over at GigaOM and something

617
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
starts to smell a little off to me.

618
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
And I don't mean to be a naysayer, but what I'm reading is, and of course GigaOM takes

619
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,440
it to the extreme, right?

620
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,000
Robots embrace Ubuntu as it invades the internet of things.

621
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,320
Oh God, I love the tech press.

622
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Really?

623
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,120
And they show a picture of a drone, right?

624
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,920
So no subtleties there.

625
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Oh boy.

626
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
But here's what it reads to me as.

627
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,240
It reads to me as a company that is extremely good at turning on a dime and then putting

628
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,980
an outward presentation as if it's been part of the grand scheme.

629
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,820
It's all part of a master stroke.

630
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
It's all under control.

631
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
And here's what I mean.

632
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,480
If you read through this, what you get is, well all that time we spent on mobile is all

633
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,960
totally worth it because we invented this super cool way to do transactional updates

634
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,120
and now we're going to move that over to Snappy Core.

635
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,800
In fact, it sounds like I'm being mean, but in here Mark Shuttleworth is actually quoted

636
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,920
as, here I'll read a quote and then you can see where I'm coming from.

637
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,200
Two years ago we started seeing a lot of what I call alpha developers starting to tinker

638
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,880
with what at the time people called embedded development.

639
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,600
We realized there was a very interesting commonality between the work we were doing for mobile,

640
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,400
specifically this update mechanism work, and things you'd want to do if you were to build

641
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,200
a product around one of these boards.

642
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,480
Canonical had invested in the container capabilities of the Linux kernel as it happened for the

643
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
mobile story.

644
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,440
Shuttleworth said, as it needed to fix security issues on the phones such as isolating untrusted

645
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,780
apps from the address book, etc.

646
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,440
He went on to say, Docker is based on those primitives that we built.

647
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,060
So kind of what he's saying is, you know, everybody that's working on Project Atomic

648
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,960
or Core OS and Docker, well we were kind of onto this a long time ago when we started

649
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
working on the phones.

650
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,040
In fact, they're even kind of relying on some of the fundamentals that we built.

651
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,080
We haven't had our eye off the game, off the ball this entire time.

652
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
We've actually been working on this and moving it over.

653
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,100
Now that's partially very true, right?

654
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,200
That is exactly what's happened, but at the same time I don't necessarily believe it was

655
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,900
this grand master plan so much as an ability to recognize a need in the market and sort

656
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,480
of pivot really quick and then paint it very broadly in these sort of grandiose terms.

657
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,760
Could you take a step back and explain to a layman like me what's proven to Snappy Core

658
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
actually is?

659
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,520
Okay, so, and feel free, anybody, Popey, anybody wimpy that wants to correct me, I'm going

660
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
to probably just give a real quick summary.

661
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,360
So the Snappy Core, we covered it before more in depth, but think of your base operating

662
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,400
system as super minimal, read-only file system.

663
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,680
Applications and stuff are done in containers or something like that, and then when there's

664
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:30,960
a system update, you just replace that read-only image with the new image of a new file system

665
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
that's been fully updated.

666
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,760
The container applications are untouched because their updates are handled independently inside

667
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,920
the container.

668
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
You reboot.

669
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,120
If the system doesn't boot successfully, you just simply switch back to the other read-only

670
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,960
image and now you're right back to where you were before any updates were applied.

671
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Doesn't sound too dissimilar from something like Core OS maybe in terms of concept?

672
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Right?

673
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Exactly.

674
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Yes, exactly.

675
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,080
That's what I'm saying is they see the market, and I think this is, I think Ubuntu for these

676
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,840
types of devices is a great maneuver.

677
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,160
I don't know though, I just feel like we're being sold a little bit of a sales pitch,

678
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,000
a little bit of a story to use Mark's words, and it just stinks a little bit.

679
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,400
So from my perspective, I can see why, you know, we do this big marketing push and you

680
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,880
guys have not heard of this at all until today.

681
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,520
And prior to that, there was the Snappy Ubuntu Core announcement a few weeks back that talked

682
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,800
about the cloud.

683
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,320
And I know that this stuff has been bubbling under for a while, and I know how it can seem

684
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:47,160
like it's taking advantage of a bit of marketing to make it look like we've been working on

685
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
this for a while.

686
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,960
But I look back and think about conversations that I've had with Mark and other people at

687
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
Canonical over the years, and I've only worked for Canonical for three and a bit years, and

688
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,040
I remember my first week talking about how we're going to do these transactional updates,

689
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,400
how we're going to do this read-only image, how we're going to do these kind of things

690
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
that we're going to need in this future.

691
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:19,240
And I see Mark as a very clever guy, he's very astute, and he knows what the future

692
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,920
holds, or he has some idea of what the future holds.

693
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:31,360
And he puts in place these little markers and gets things ready for some distant way

694
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
in the future.

695
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,800
And it might look like it makes no sense right now, it doesn't look like anything you might

696
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,720
need right now, but then when the pieces start to land, it all kind of comes together.

697
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,840
And I think that's what this is.

698
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
And that makes sense.

699
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,360
But I think part of the reason why it feels a little salesy is, for example, quote from

700
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,680
Mark, let us deliver those updates to your device with the same efficiency as with the

701
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
phone.

702
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,760
Well, that is based on a preposition that there has been reliable updates shipped to

703
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
the phone.

704
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,400
I mean, yes, in beta testing, you just aren't using it.

705
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,360
Well, actually, my Nexus 5 got screwed up by an update, but I realized it wasn't enough

706
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
things.

707
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Which is not a supported device.

708
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,280
But you see, it's sort of based on, it's not a sound claim to make.

709
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,800
You can't truly, because it hasn't been done at scale, right?

710
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,760
It's not actually genuinely done at scale the way that that quote sort of implies.

711
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,360
Like if you did not follow this very closely, and you read that quote on GigaOM where it's

712
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,540
posted, you would assume that Canonical right now has a history of shipping software updates

713
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,920
to thousands, maybe even millions of devices by reading that quote, right?

714
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
It's not-

715
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Well, there's certainly thousands of devices, and it's certainly over the past two years

716
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,440
that thousands of devices have been receiving updates over the air every day reliably, including

717
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,840
machines in our data center that we do QA on, and machines that are held by developers

718
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
and machines that are held by enthusiastic users.

719
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
I agree, and it's a sound system.

720
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,320
I agree with you that there aren't millions, we're not at the scale of iOS or Android yet,

721
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,760
but there is still a reliable and proven mechanism because thousands of devices use it.

722
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Okay, let me ask you what you think about this, because I agree, I mean, I'm not saying

723
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
it's wrong either.

724
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,860
I'm just saying it's stated in a way where if you didn't have the full context, you might

725
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,360
get a misrepresentation of the scale.

726
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
But I mean, that's fair.

727
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,320
I mean, that's within his right to do.

728
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,680
Okay, here's a question that I thought was kind of astute of GigaOM to ask.

729
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,680
So they asked, is Ubuntu Core the win CE of Ubuntu or the future of the venerable Linux

730
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
distro?

731
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,560
Shuttleworth was adamant to say that the Debian package version of Ubuntu will never go away

732
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,560
because it is the mechanism with which we collaborate amongst ourselves and with Debian,

733
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,440
and should be a continued relevance to developers.

734
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,560
I don't know, Popey, like, honestly, seems like if this Ubuntu snappy core works good

735
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,860
for the phone, it works good for a Raspberry Pi, it works good for my SCADA system that

736
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,320
manages the dam, and it works good for my Hughes lights, maybe it'd work okay for my

737
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
laptop too.

738
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,520
Right, yeah, and that's great.

739
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,880
But what you're not picking up on is that the read-only image that we ship out to you

740
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,040
is built from Debian packages.

741
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,560
So we can't throw that away.

742
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,680
We can't get rid of that whole Debian legacy.

743
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,600
We keep that because it works, it's reliable, it's great for us to build that read-only

744
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
image.

745
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,640
But does that mean it has to be a shipping product?

746
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
What has to be a shipping product?

747
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
The Debian version.

748
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,440
Like, maybe it's just something internally that the...

749
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
It is.

750
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,800
I mean, you can flip a switch on an Ubuntu phone or on this future laptop that you're

751
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,320
talking about, you can flip a switch and go from read-write and then just go app-get-update,

752
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
app-get-upgrade, app-get-install-full.

753
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,960
Oh, that's cool.

754
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,680
I already have my tablet here that's running Ubuntu phone, and I've app-get-installed various

755
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,400
libraries because I wanted to build some STL-based games on my tablet.

756
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
So I, you know...

757
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,520
You know where I'm going with this, is I like the idea of, yeah, here is...

758
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,760
Let's just use today's terms, like if it's something that existed today.

759
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:06,200
Here's your Ubuntu 14.04-based, nice stable desktop, all your applications are in containers.

760
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,480
That would really be a pretty incredibly bulletproof Linux desktop.

761
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
I like that.

762
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,760
I didn't realize you could switch it over to a non-read...

763
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,040
Of course, that makes sense, but I just wouldn't think all the components would be there.

764
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
You can switch it both ways.

765
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah.

766
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
You can flip it back the other way as well.

767
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,080
But yeah, I agree with you.

768
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,240
That's an interesting idea, to use these kind of components in the desktop later on, having

769
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,720
your, I don't know, LibreOffice 4.5 in a container, and having LibreOffice, oh, I want to try

770
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,560
out LibreOffice 5, but I don't want to screw up my LibreOffice 4 install.

771
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,320
So I have that in a container, and I just click a button, and it installs it.

772
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
You could even potentially run both side by side.

773
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,480
Those are kind of panacea that a lot of people have wanted for a long time on any OS, not

774
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
just on Linux.

775
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
You know, you've been wanting to be able to run two different versions of the same application,

776
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,840
or have two different multiple users of the same machine running two different versions

777
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,640
of the same application, and that's just one tiny use case.

778
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,160
There's lots of other ways in which this is cool, but the underlying components is still

779
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Debian.

780
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,460
It's still Debian packages that built this thing.

781
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:13,700
So what I go back to then, what I wonder, is if this all rolls out, it truly, if this

782
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,120
becomes adopted by OEMs and manufacturers, is really kind of what this space is competing

783
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
with is probably Android.

784
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,080
Because that's got to be, like when you look at a lot of these embedded devices, a lot

785
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,840
of them are being built for Android, so now Canonical is going to try to compete with

786
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,040
Android in the mobile phone space and in these low-end devices.

787
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Maybe they're going to try to go lower than the Android devices are, but it still seems

788
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,920
like there's going to be some cross-competition with Google.

789
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,000
A lot of these things have Android images.

790
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,760
I like the idea of having a single OS across my embedded device, my BeagleBone or whatever

791
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,080
other device, my Odroid or whatever, and my laptop, and my server in the cloud.

792
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,000
And I know that there's consistency between them, and I know that they're all running

793
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,320
the same version of LibFu or whatever it is, and I can build my own personal libraries

794
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,480
on all of those, and it will work on all of those.

795
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,120
That is personally appealing to me.

796
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,160
If only it was Arch.

797
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,520
You had to go and do it, didn't you?

798
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I can't.

799
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
But yeah, I agree.

800
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,340
Like it is a pretty cool, like it could be a pretty cool picture once it's all completed.

801
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,680
If it gets there, a lot of uncompleted bits as of yet.

802
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,120
But it'll get there eventually, I think.

803
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
I don't know.

804
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,200
And so I'll have a link in the show notes to Mark's big post up about it, and including

805
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,560
also his video, which he talks more about.

806
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,320
I just played a couple of minutes of it, but you can find the whole video linked in our

807
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
show notes.

808
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Sounds cool.

809
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,600
Anybody else have any closing thoughts in the moment before we move on to our next topic?

810
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Going once, going twice, no, no, okay, very good.

811
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,100
Well then, let's take a moment right here, and I'll tell you about something I like quite

812
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
a bit.

813
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
And that's my cell phone provider.

814
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
That's Ting.

815
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,640
Go to linux.ting.com to get started, linux.ting.com.

816
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,400
Ting is mobile that makes sense, no BS, no tricks, no hidden fees.

817
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,760
It's just $6 for your line, and then your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

818
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,680
They just take that, they add that up, and that's what you pay.

819
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,520
And you get a hotspot teller, and you just turn it on, voicemail, a picture message,

820
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
all the stuff you'd expect.

821
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,760
And they've got a full range of phones from really low end value, like cheap phones that'll

822
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,200
just get your phones and text, and that's it.

823
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,320
It lasts probably like three days, or four days, or a week, because those phones did

824
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
that.

825
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
And it feels like an entire different time.

826
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,920
All the way up to the super high end, like go just get a GSM and put it in a Nexus 6,

827
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,720
and it's ready to go on the Ting network.

828
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,600
GSM Nexus 6, and also CDMA Nexus 6, in February, you'll be able to use both, just like in my

829
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Nexus 5.

830
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,380
That's a pretty great deal, and you combine that with Ting's no-hold customer service.

831
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,360
Now you're starting to really talk, because what I have found is the dashboard totally

832
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,720
works for me.

833
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,400
Everything I need to do with Ting, I can take care of it in the dashboard.

834
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
I mean everything.

835
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,600
Every phone I've gotten from Ting, activating them, transferring them, any of that stuff

836
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,360
I can do in the dashboard, I've never needed to call.

837
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,800
But just in case mom ever needs to call, or just in case Rekai ever needs to call, I don't

838
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,920
need to play tech support.

839
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,540
Ting has no-hold customer service, so I know they can just call 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real

840
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,960
human being answers the phone.

841
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,880
I've got three phones on my Ting account, and I'm paying somewhere in the ballpark between

842
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,200
$30 to $40, $45, depends if I'm traveling a month, for three smartphones, HTC One, Nexus

843
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,160
5, and the iPhone 5.

844
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,720
And in fact, if you are of the iPhone variety, I believe Ting has the 4S right now for like

845
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,200
$130, no contract, nor the termination fee, you only pay for what you use.

846
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
That's a pretty good deal.

847
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,760
You can go get a whole range of devices, check them out, go over to linux.ting.com to get

848
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
started.

849
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
They'll give you a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

850
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,560
If you already have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a $25 service credit.

851
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,920
Also try out the savings calculator.

852
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm saving like $2,200 a year, for every two years now.

853
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm like, that's crazy.

854
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
That's crazy.

855
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
That's like laptop money.

856
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
That's nuts.

857
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,120
I should take that money, and I should buy Bitcoin while it's cheap.

858
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm telling you, that's exactly what I'd do.

859
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,560
I mean, like, yeah, my last bill was like $20, $26, I think something like that.

860
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
It's amazing.

861
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Isn't it?

862
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,840
Well, and what I like is that they kind of hedged me into learning to use my resources.

863
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,120
As far as like my home internet, for example, I can make calls and texts over internet,

864
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
which of course saves me money.

865
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Yeah, no kidding.

866
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,600
Yeah, you just have to be a little savvy and you can save a ton of money, and I think most

867
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
of the audience is.

868
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Absolutely.

869
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
And also check out the Ting blog.

870
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,000
They have some recent posts on how you can set up your podcast catcher, so that way it

871
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,320
doesn't cost you a bunch of data either.

872
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,960
And you know, that's good for your podcast listeners.

873
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Linux.ting.com.

874
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Go check them out and help support the Unplugged show, linux.ting.com.

875
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,960
And a big, big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

876
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,480
So we talked about it a little bit on the Linux Action Show live stream.

877
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Linus and friends were at the LinuxConf AU keynote and they were talking.

878
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,640
They're doing just, Linus likes to do just Q&As mostly.

879
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,480
He doesn't like to go up there and do big presentations.

880
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,760
And that's understandable because he's done them for a long time now and he feels like

881
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,680
everybody has a bunch of questions and it keeps it sort of so fresh and so clean.

882
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
So he was happy with that.

883
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,640
And so an interesting couple of things came up.

884
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,880
Over the weekend, we heard that Linus made the comment that he doesn't care if he upsets

885
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,820
people and that's what we talked about in the pre-show.

886
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,040
And that's what kind of grabbed all of the headlines.

887
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,320
And everybody was kind of focused on that.

888
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,080
But it turns out there's other couple of bits in that speech that didn't get quite the attention

889
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
they deserve.

890
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,160
I want to start with the first one because it's a popular one in the security community

891
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,040
right now around disclosures.

892
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,200
And ZDNet did a pretty good write up about what Linus had to say.

893
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,400
And Linus essentially said that he thinks public issues like this should be disclosed

894
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,040
openly, especially for open source software.

895
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,440
But instead of me telling you about it, I'll play it in the man's own words.

896
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,840
There's another thing that's been going on which I find personally very satisfying which

897
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:47,840
is that people are less willing sometimes to kind of brush the problem under the mat

898
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,120
and leave it up to vendors and have disclosure, like infinitely long disclosure times.

899
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:02,660
I'm a huge believer in just disclosing still somewhat responsibly but security problems

900
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,080
need to be made public.

901
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,000
And there are people who argue and have argued for decades that you never want to talk about

902
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,360
security problems because that only helps the black hats.

903
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,080
And the fact is that I think you absolutely need to report them and you need to report

904
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,920
them in a reasonable time frame.

905
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,800
Reasonable for the kernel security list is admittedly five working days which some people

906
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,580
think is a bit extreme and in other projects it might be a month or a couple of months

907
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,520
but that's still much better than the years and years of silence which we used to have.

908
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Thank you very much.

909
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,800
And I think right now Google's disclosure is like 90 days to give you, so the kernel

910
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,960
mailing list is five days.

911
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,720
That's pretty tight.

912
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,640
And so if you didn't catch it, if you don't watch TechSnap, what happened kind of recently

913
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,520
is Google engineers found some significant bugs in Windows, notified Microsoft, Microsoft

914
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,880
took longer than Google's 90 days and Google publicly disclosed the vulnerability that

915
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,840
was in Windows before the patch was available to the public.

916
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,440
That happened at the beginning of like last year too, like it's happened twice now.

917
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,560
And it's kind of created this public feud about how we should disclose vulnerabilities

918
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,640
and how we do that when the code itself is open.

919
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,080
And it's a discussion that's really been going on for quite a while.

920
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,200
And yes, we'll have a link to the full video in the show notes.

921
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
Anybody have any comments in the Mumble Room about patch disclosures before we move on

922
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
to his next comment?

923
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:45,580
Yes, I actually just like to add that regardless, it always gives the people also the option

924
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:51,560
to not run the software until they actually are sure that the release was made, which

925
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,880
is often not considered, they are often just considering the developer side or the manufacturer

926
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,440
side and don't think that, okay, users should have an option on what he wants to do.

927
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Make an informed choice.

928
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
Yes, exactly.

929
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Yeah.

930
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
I completely agree.

931
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Good point.

932
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Okay.

933
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,880
So that was Linus coming down on that issue.

934
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,120
So the security community has sort of been grousing about that obviously because he runs

935
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,280
a pretty important project where security issues are critical.

936
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,200
So the question came up.

937
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
This guy got up.

938
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,240
He gets up in front of the audience and he just starts kind of harping on the kernel

939
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,040
developers for a little bit.

940
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,440
Give him a hard time for not knowing how memory allocation works maybe and that the documentation

941
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
sucks.

942
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,800
And so he eventually gets around to asking them, Linus, what the hell is your plan to

943
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,880
make kernel documentation better because it sucks right now?

944
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,720
The question today, I would ask which file manual we should have read.

945
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Do you think that documentation of the kernel is appropriate?

946
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,600
Do you have any idea how to improve that?

947
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:00,080
Well, I clearly have no idea how to improve documentation of the kernel.

948
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:08,680
This is where others sometimes step up and do a great job of explaining small details.

949
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:16,760
At the same time, there was a talk yesterday about how programming should be provably correct

950
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,480
and it would be a great thing if we could prove correctness and that we all suck at

951
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,280
it and I don't take that approach.

952
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:35,480
I'm more of a touchy-feely guy and I actually, I believe in biological processes and I believe

953
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,920
in evolution and I believe in all these making mistakes and trying and we don't have documentation

954
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:50,040
for how humans work, but humans work really, really well except when they break down.

955
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,360
And I actually think we're at the stage and we have been at the stage in kernel development

956
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:02,880
and in a lot of technology where nobody really understands everything that's going on.

957
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,460
Nobody really understands everything that's going on, the VM is very complicated.

958
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,120
So his argument to, you know, he says like obviously there's rules and policies that

959
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,640
need to be documented, some of the broader concepts are documented, but it's an ever-changing

960
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,960
beast and just like the human body, it manages to go on without proper documentation.

961
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,000
Matt, what is your reaction to that?

962
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,920
I think he, you know, he kind of danced around it a little bit, which is kind of ironic for

963
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,360
a lot of us, but I think he pretty much nailed it.

964
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,720
You know, I think that's really kind of what it is.

965
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,880
It's trying to kind of find that sweet spot and yeah, it definitely felt like a bit of

966
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,880
a dance though.

967
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,680
It did feel like a bit of a ballroom thing as he went along.

968
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,480
He tried to nail it down and still sound diplomatic and it was kind of fun to watch.

969
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
I don't know how else to put that.

970
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,000
Derek Delvin, you've heard him make this comment before?

971
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,960
Yes, they actually, I've seen older talks that Linus made and he actually was talking

972
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,520
about that they're trying to improve and everything, but the result is people weren't reading and

973
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,880
they were just making the questions in the mailing list.

974
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,320
So the mailing list became the biggest documentation of the kernel.

975
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,680
So that makes, you know, the persons that are writing documentation not feel as inspired

976
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,040
to do that.

977
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,920
And of course, that with the speed of the kernel changes, which is like about seven

978
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,440
changes per hour or something like that, it's impossible to document all that.

979
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,520
So I don't feel like, unless you're working with an LTS release and you know it's going

980
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:31,520
to be frozen, I don't think there is really, you need to get to the cores and the rest

981
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,240
is just, the code needs to be self-documenting.

982
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,080
And if we enforce that and you know your code, you should be able to understand what's going

983
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
on.

984
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,080
You just need to know your code.

985
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
I like that.

986
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,000
Also, it makes me feel a lot better about my horrible documentation.

987
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's what Linus is good at.

988
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,640
He's really good at like coming up with sound rational justifications that make me feel

989
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,040
like less of a bad person.

990
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,000
I think that's why I like Linus Clips because I'm like, yeah, yeah, our studio, it's like

991
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
a human body.

992
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's organic.

993
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's always changing.

994
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't feel so bad about that.

995
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It does things, right?

996
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,080
Yeah, of course, kernel.org, it does, of course, have some documentation.

997
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,080
So that's true.

998
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,080
All right, Mumble Room.

999
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Closing thoughts go to you.

1000
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,460
Before we get out of here, anybody have anything else they want to contribute or add?

1001
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,000
Going once, going twice, okay, very good.

1002
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Well then, we'll conclude at that.

1003
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,520
Matt, something we're working on for Sunday.

1004
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,200
I don't know if it's going to work out for sure, not because, well, we have, we're trying

1005
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,520
to get somebody from the Trisco project lined up for Linux Action Show.

1006
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,240
But as you would expect from the Trisco project, there's limitations on the technology we can

1007
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,600
use to make the connection happen.

1008
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,160
So we're working that out right now, probably going to use something like WebRTC or something

1009
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
like that.

1010
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,760
And if all that goes as planned, we'll have an interview with Trisco developer on Sunday's

1011
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Linux Action Show.

1012
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,920
But even if we don't, we'll always have something great going on.

1013
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
So I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1014
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
All right, see you then.

1015
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
All right, everybody.

1016
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,960
Well, I hope you enjoyed this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1026
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,200
Okay, everybody, thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1027
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:42,640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1028
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:55,920
I feel like this show, this episode was like a freight train, like it was just moving right

1029
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,920
along.

1030
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,920
Yeah, it really did.

1031
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,880
Reading emails, calling guests, playing clips, reading emails, calling, no, it was just moving

1032
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
right along.

1033
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
javidtotles.com.

1034
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,880
Yeah.

1035
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,240
Will Unfilter be like a mumble edition tonight or no?

1036
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,680
I don't know if we can because of having to get like a backup stream going.

1037
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:22,520
I might need that computer for backup audio stream, but I'm going to say no now, but it

1038
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,520
is going to be, hmm.

1039
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,560
It would be a pleasant surprise if it happens and if not, no worries.

1040
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,000
I hope people can join us live.

1041
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,920
Unfilter is going to be, it's going to be fun doing that live coverage of the State

1042
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
of the Union.

1043
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
javidtotles.com.

1044
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
javidtotles.com.

1045
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Oh, that's right.

1046
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
People are talking tonight.

1047
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
I forgot about that.

1048
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Yeah, yeah.

1049
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
The people are talking about the cyber.

1050
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,040
That whole TV thing, that was good.

1051
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,280
I wish we could stop calling it cyber.

1052
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Yeah, no kidding.

1053
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
No kidding.

1054
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,280
Yeah.

1055
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
Cyber.

1056
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Cybertron.

1057
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,560
So I was going to ask you guys there, did you see this Mint PC?

1058
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,800
It's a Mint mini box.

1059
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,800
It's tiny.

1060
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,800
It's like smaller than a NUC.

1061
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,800
It's $89.

1062
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,480
It comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

1063
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
It's the version two.

1064
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
There's been a Mint box before.

1065
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
This is version two.

1066
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,480
It's kind of AMD.

1067
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1068
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
You said it comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

1069
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
You mean it comes with Mint?

1070
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,480
No.

1071
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,080
That's what it says, but you're right.

1072
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Why would it?

1073
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,080
It comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

1074
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,080
Yeah.

1075
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
That doesn't make any sense.

1076
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
It must come with Mint.

1077
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
I must be misreading it.

1078
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,600
It comes with Mint, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04.

1079
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Oh, is that what they're saying?

1080
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,040
It comes with Mint, but it's also not $89.

1081
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
The one I saw- Oh, I am looking at different ones.

1082
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,040
It's like $200 and something.

1083
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,040
Yeah.

1084
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,040
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1085
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Yeah.

1086
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,040
Now that, see, yeah, I'm looking, you know what?

1087
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
I'm looking at an Intel one.

1088
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
I'm looking at this.

1089
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
It's 89 bucks.

1090
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,440
That's not bad, but boy, when you start looking at the specs, an AMD CPU, I just don't, I

1091
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
don't know.

1092
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,240
At 89 bucks, I mean, they could literally have it running with Hamster, so that's the

1093
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
Intel version.

1094
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
No, that's the Intel version.

1095
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
Oh.

1096
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
I don't know.

1097
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
I mean, am I just a-

1098
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,280
The Mint box, that's all, but that's that minty green, white, yeah, it's 295.

1099
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,240
It's 295 USD and also 295 euros per ounce.

1100
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Yeah.

1101
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,480
Yeah, 295 though, just doesn't seem like-

1102
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,480
At 295, I expect Intel.

1103
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Yeah, I want to know.

1104
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
I would never go into it.

1105
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
I don't get it.

1106
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
Who are these for?

1107
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,120
Probably the same people that did the Mint, whatever the previous one was, the Mint box

1108
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
and the Mint thing.

1109
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Maybe like, or businesses, right?

1110
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,560
Like if you're going to deploy a whole bunch of Mint workstations or something.

1111
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
I guess.

1112
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,560
Yeah.

1113
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,560
Yeah, maybe.

1114
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,000
No, it can still do all of that and still have technically better hardware.

1115
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,640
You could get, you could spend less money and get like twice as much RAM.

1116
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Yeah.

1117
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,140
Ah, but remember, and multi-billion dollar businesses are built around this philosophy,

1118
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,140
make it out of the box.

1119
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,220
Don't make someone else have to do it.

1120
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,000
And so some people, and that may be what they're targeting, is they're providing it out of

1121
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,320
the box experience versus the buy a duck and do it yourself, which is my preference.

1122
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,320
Right.

1123
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
Yeah.

1124
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Right.

1125
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,320
That's what it is, right?

1126
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,320
That's what it is.

1127
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
Must be.

1128
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
Must be.

1129
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
What do you guys think of Unity of Things as our title?

1130
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
You like Unity of Things?

1131
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
I like it.

1132
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
Yeah, I like it.

1133
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
Interview.

1134
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
Yeah, we do have the interview in there too.

1135
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,640
Should that be the, should that be the lead?

1136
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,680
I think it should.

1137
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
I think so.

1138
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,080
I actually suggested Building Builder.

1139
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,160
Building Builder is not bad.

1140
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,160
Build the Gnome.

1141
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Build the Gnome is good.

1142
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,320
Building Builder, I see, I don't know though, I feel like it's going to, I think a lot of

1143
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,160
people aren't going to know what we're talking about with that title.

1144
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,440
Well, it sounds like Bob the Builder or something.

1145
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,440
It just seems off.

1146
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,440
Oh, now you got that stuck in my head, Matt.

1147
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,520
You still have Fraggle Rock going on in your brain, you're all right.

1148
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,440
Dude, I'm still running Firefox here.

1149
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah, that's your, that's your bad.

1150
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You're just, you're just.

1151
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm still bitching about it.

1152
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I'm still running it.

1153
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You're just punishing yourself.

1154
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You're punishing yourself.

1155
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,760
So, Popey, what, what is not good about Firefox from your point of view?

1156
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,080
So I had to uninstall Flash, which, you know, arguably is, you know, a good thing for some

1157
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,400
people, but I had to uninstall it because it caused the browser to crash.

1158
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,000
I then had to disable the Cisco H.264 plugin because that caused the browser to crash.

1159
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,760
So now I have no H.264 built in video playback in Firefox and no Flash playback.

1160
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,440
So what are you doing for that stuff?

1161
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,440
I'm not.

1162
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,200
I go to my BBC News website and it says embedded Flash, you don't have Flash.

1163
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,860
So I then copy and paste that into a command line window where I then get a VLC or whatever

1164
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,480
window pop up and I can play my video that way.

1165
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,720
So yeah, I feel like I'm 1990s Linux guy.

1166
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,720
I don't know.

1167
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,960
What the heck?

1168
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,240
If you think about it, though, like most of the time, out of all the stuff that plays

1169
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,440
on a website, you only want like 1% of it.

1170
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,740
So if you have like Guaker or something like that, you drop down the terminal, you drop

1171
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,740
in a URL.

1172
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,740
It's not that bad, I suppose.

1173
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,740
Yeah, yeah.

1174
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,740
It's not so bad.

1175
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,800
It's just not seamless.

1176
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:34,200
So I'm running Firefox and I'm preparing a blog article about Firefox versus Chrome for

1177
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,120
UK streaming services.

1178
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:45,880
And long story short is once I put the HAL stub in, which just does the crypto bits for

1179
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:53,400
Flash, on Firefox I can watch all of the UK streaming services, but on Chrome I can't

1180
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,200
watch, I think it's Channel 4 and Amazon Prime.

1181
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,280
And of course I can't watch Netflix because there's no EME.

1182
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:11,680
But apart from Netflix, Firefox with Flash and a stub for HAL, I can watch all of the

1183
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,040
major UK streaming services and on Chrome I can't.

1184
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,040
I can only watch half of them.

1185
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,360
To be fair, Firefox, Mozilla have just put out a new version of Firefox.

1186
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,440
So what I'll do is I'll go through the same rigmarole and I'll reinstall Flash and see

1187
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,920
if that makes any difference and I'll re-enable the Cisco plugin and see if it makes any difference.

1188
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,760
I did this on my Boxing Day though, so this was the last version that I was using and

1189
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:43,360
I've never had a problem with the H.264 codec other than the Flash implementation is ancient.

1190
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:49,280
The only reason I had a problem with the H.264 plugin is because I disabled Flash.

1191
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,680
I went to Imgur or Imgur or whatever you call it and it detects that I don't have Flash

1192
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:01,320
and serves me up H.264 video adverts and it was an H.264 video advert that crashed the

1193
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,880
browser and it sent a bug report to Mozilla and all that and I'm sure someone will look

1194
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,800
at that and go, huh, fancy.

1195
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,120
But I will try it again with the new version because I'm sticking with it.

1196
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:21,520
There was a total, they pulled in a new revision of the open H.264 codec for the newest version

1197
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
of Firefox.

1198
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
I don't know if that will fix things.

1199
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
Sweet.

1200
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
I'll get it going.

1201
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,520
Yeah.

1202
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,320
Honestly, as a Windows user and a Linux user, Flash is always a culprit with Firefox.

1203
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,400
If we ever get rid of Flash, we'll be rid of these problems.

1204
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,520
Well, see that's the flip side is I've actually, having got rid of it on my system, I haven't

1205
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,680
got it on there at all, arguably, I'm actually a better person.

1206
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,640
I feel like I'm a net contributor to humanity by not having Flash installed.

1207
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Good job.

1208
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,640
You're a hero.

1209
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,360
Well, if you want Flash, you can go and do Fresh Player Plugin and that allows Pepper

1210
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:03,040
Flash to be used inside of Firefox and that actually solves, I have not had a single problem

1211
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,800
with Firefox, specifically Flash problems with Firefox since I did that.

1212
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,920
And I run Nightly and that's been incumbent with bugs.

1213
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:19,560
Hey, so Chris, you see how we've successfully derailed your I'm going to try KDE into another

1214
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
rant about Firefox.

1215
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
Oh, that was good.

1216
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,560
That's good.

1217
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,760
That's all I had for the KDE thing anyway, so that's fine.

1218
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,840
For now, for now, for now.

1219
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
I don't know.

1220
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,240
To me, it just seems like all this stuff isn't worth it.

1221
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,200
There's more stuff to do in the day than fight this stuff.

1222
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:44,560
So I just feel like if I need Flash, I use Chrome and I just have Chrome from Google,

1223
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
not Chromium.

1224
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,600
I'm using Chrome from Google and that's where my Flash happens and then I do other stuff

1225
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,840
in my other browsers and that works fine for me.

1226
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
I disagree.

1227
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,720
I don't think there are enough things in the day to cause us pain, which is why right now

1228
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,680
I'm attempting to install MS-DOS 6.22 on my laptop.

1229
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,400
You are crazy.

1230
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,400
You are crazy.
