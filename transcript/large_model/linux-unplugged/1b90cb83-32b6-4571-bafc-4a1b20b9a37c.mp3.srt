1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
40, 50 years ago amateur radio operators and just general electronic enthusiasts, in fact

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,000
the Linux users of like the 1920s, 30s and 40s were into a hobby called ham radio.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,280
If you haven't heard of it, basically it's you take, you build your own radios or you

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,560
buy pre-made radios and then you play with them and you learn about them and the federal

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,140
government literally takes millions of dollars of frequency spectrum and gives it to amateur

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,120
radio operators to play with.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,880
The only real requirement is you have to pass a very basic test proving you're not going

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,040
to kill yourself or anyone else.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,080
And as we have entered 2012, 13, 14, 15, 16, technology has evolved and now instead of

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,360
buying these physical radios, you still buy physical radio but the radio doesn't have

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
an interface.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,360
There's no dial, there's no ability to interface to the radio, just a box with a USB plug and

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,920
you plug that box into your computer and you can control the radio from software, thus

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,620
the name software defined radio.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,400
So what Wes is talking about is this Lua radio and I'm over here at luaradio.io and it says

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,040
Lua radio is a lightweight embedded low flow graph signal processing frameworks for software

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
defined radio.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,140
It provides a sweet source sync of processing blocks with a simple API for defining flow

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,880
graphs, running flow graphs, creating blocks and creating data types.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,040
So I'm assuming if I'm reading this right and if I'm understanding it from the 45 seconds

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,680
I've been looking at this, basically you're able to go through and piece together different

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
components of the radio inside of the software.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Am I understanding that right?

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,680
Have you used GNU radio at all?

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I have.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah, it's a real challenge if I'm being perfectly honest with you.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,360
Yeah, and so that's what I was reading this.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,080
I haven't used software defined radio very much but I'm definitely interested in it.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,000
I have a physics background so any kind of like playing with the spectrum is definitely

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
interesting even though I haven't done much of it myself.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,720
And so a lot of people are saying like this has similar capabilities but is easier to

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,080
use, more lightweight and if you're familiar with Lua at all, it's easier to interface

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
with.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Yeah, man.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,760
Have you ever used XMonet?

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
You know I have not.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,180
I've looked at it but I have not actually tried it.

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,920
So I've been playing with XMonet.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,000
I was on a – I was for better or for worse I was stuck on a very low powered machine

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,720
and the way to drag the most horsepower out of that machine was to use a tiling desktop

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,280
manager and I chose XMonet and I was super happy with it.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,960
In fact, so much so that I'm considering it making my primary desktop interface but

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
–

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Wow.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I know.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I know.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
It sounds crazy but here's the thing.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,160
Anyone that – I used to think that I used Nome because I had too much to get done and

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,580
I didn't have enough time to worry about memorizing weird commands and stuff but after

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,640
using XMonet for a while, I've honed in on this is a more efficient way to work and

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,040
to that end, you can configure it up the wazoo with Lua.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
I believe it's Lua if I'm not mistaken.

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
No, buddy.

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
It's Haskell.

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
It's Haskell.

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
XMonet is Haskell.

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Okay.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Which one?

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Is it awesome then?

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
It was awesome.

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Awesome.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Okay.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Okay.

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Well, so I guess my point doesn't really stand except for the fact that what I found

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
was the things that I was going to tweak were already tweaked for me in XMonet.

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,000
So the things I wanted to set up were already set up the way I would have wanted them to.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,160
I thought that was – Lua, apparently I confused the two.

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,280
I've gone through a couple of different ones but the point – all that to say that

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,800
those kind of configuration setups where you just have this big configuration file

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,840
in something like Lua is super easy for anyone to just – even if you don't understand

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,080
programming, it's a little daunting at first but once you learn what the little things

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,080
that you need to change are, super easy to get set up and use.

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,280
So I guess what I'm saying is I feel like it would be the same thing in the software

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
defined radio, right?

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Yeah, definitely.

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
It definitely seems like that.

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,520
People are excited that it should be portable, maybe they can use it on all kinds of different

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,560
interfaces and devices.

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
So it'll be interesting to see what this comes from.

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,360
It's exciting to see it launch anyway.

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Right.

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Right.

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:17,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, episode 152 for July 5th, 2016.

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's taken your beloved host,

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,040
shoved him into the back of an RV and sent him trailing across the country to enjoy himself.

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,280
Stepping in for the one, the only, the great, the Linux podcaster, hair master, Chris Fisher,

90
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,520
it's me, Noah Chaliya, and – Hey guys, it's Wes.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
It's Mr. Wes.

92
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
How are you doing today, Wes?

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh, I'm doing wonderful and it's great to be with you, Noah.

94
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
How about yourself?

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,880
You and I totally rocked Linux Action Show on Sunday, now we're going to rock Linux

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Unplugged today.

97
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
That's right.

98
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,240
And we have an exciting, exciting show.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,400
I told you on Sunday the show was going to be so big that we couldn't put a word to

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
it.

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,360
Is there a word to describe this show that we're about to do right now?

102
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,880
Maybe two words, exciting and confusing.

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Really?

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Well, that got me intrigued.

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
I think we'll find out.

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
All right.

107
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,880
Well, let's head on down into our mumble room and welcome our virtual live.

108
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,000
This is a group that meets over at mumble.jupitercolony.com and you can join for free.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,920
Just download the mumble client and participate with us 2 p.m. Pacific time.

110
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Hello mumble room.

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Time appropriate.

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Greetings.

113
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Hello.

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Hello.

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Hello.

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Everyone says.

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Oh, those voices.

118
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
I love them.

119
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I know.

120
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,640
It's like it's like we have our own little fan club and they and they join us via the

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,120
Internet and everyone is welcome.

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
So if you're if you're listening to Linux Unplugged, you could join Linux Unplugged

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,400
next week by downloading mumble and get with the program.

124
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Please do.

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
It's so much fun.

126
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
All right, Wes.

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Tell me about our first story.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Our first story.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,080
OK, so containers, all the rage, everyone's talking about them and maybe people are actually

130
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
using them.

131
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Right.

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
Like you were just talking with Michael on Coder about how he's deploying a lot of Docker

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
containers up on DigitalOcean.

134
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,120
So now if you're if you're one of the people using Docker containers and I know at least

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,360
me, I use them on DO, but I also find uses, you know, deploying apps on my local computer.

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Maybe I need something.

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I don't want to mess up.

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,640
We talk a lot about we've been talking about snap packages and Flatpak, etc.

139
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,960
But really, Docker can do a lot of the same things.

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
There are other considerations.

141
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Right.

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Like it's more complicated.

143
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,960
There's it's not quite in the same boat, but it really in the end, you can use it to deploy

144
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
applications in the same way.

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,120
So now NVIDIA is releasing a plugin that allows you to have GPU accelerated containers.

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,780
Awesome, awesome.

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,480
You know, that is that takes things to a whole new level on some degree, because if if you

148
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,040
if we could start to containerize games, that that seems like that would be a major game

149
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,360
changer because no longer are you packaging and developing first and you're not targeting

150
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
a specific platform anymore.

151
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,920
Now you're targeting a container and if you can if you could take that container and make

152
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,560
it interoperable among all three of the big operating systems, Linux, Mac and Windows.

153
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Now we've really changed the landscape.

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Oh, that'd be interesting.

155
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,760
Yeah, it looks like it's first right now.

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,720
They're really targeting like machine learning applications, places where you might want to

157
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
be deploying these apps.

158
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,240
But you know, inside the container, they're too restricted to get access to the GPU.

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,440
So in video, they're working on they're basically exporting, they're adding some hooks into

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,700
the user land part and having these user land accessible parts exported into the Docker

161
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
containers.

162
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,320
And then you can do like CUDA type stuff right from inside Docker.

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,380
Awesome.

164
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,300
So what have you see is this is I this is early days, I assume this is not something

165
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,760
that has that has taken off or have any real teeth to it yet, right?

166
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,280
Yeah, it is early days.

167
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,320
They do have some code up on GitHub.

168
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,920
You know, the info world here does note that like one of the biggest drawbacks is that

169
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,560
CUDA is a proprietary standard, even though but but it also just happens to be the NVIDIA

170
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
really is the chip maker that does a lot of the machine learning stuff.

171
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,120
You know, these big clusters, people doing the serious work that usually do not on NVIDIA.

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
AMD has been opening up, which is really interesting, but really doesn't have the same kind of market

173
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,240
uptake that NVIDIA does, especially in machine learning.

174
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Sure.

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
DERP learning.

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
DERP learning.

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
That's right.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
We have a term for this guys.

179
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
DERP.

180
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
DERP.

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
DERP learning.

182
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm interested outside of so you're saying, are you telling me that at this point in time,

183
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,800
what they're really targeting is really kind of only the whole machine learning thing?

184
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Or is it going to expand beyond that?

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
You know, the article doesn't mention anything that's kind of focused on the machine learning

186
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
stuff.

187
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm sure that's kind of what's hot and what's motivating this.

188
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,920
But once you have access to the GPU, it'll be interesting to see what else can be run

189
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
there.

190
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah.

191
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Yeah, it really would.

192
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:44,920
You know, it's interesting because I watched, we went to LinuxCon last year and the way

193
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,520
that LinuxCon works is they always have a sub-focus, Linux is obviously the general

194
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,760
focus and then they have this like deep down focus that they kind of run in on and this

195
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,320
year it was all about containers.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,480
And in fact, they were joking, not joking, the little subtitle was ContainerCon, right?

197
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,760
And I have watched everything in Linux over the last year focus or shift focus to be centered

198
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,560
on or around containers.

199
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,120
And you know, first we saw it happen on the server side and then very shortly after that

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320
we saw that entering on the desktop side and it makes me wonder if the future of computing

201
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,920
in general is not just going to be containers.

202
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
Yeah, I know, right?

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,780
And it's interesting, you know, having gotten, you've been using LXD in the past, I do kind

204
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,280
of get this, I'll build up a host, right?

205
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,320
And I'll have this main host and then I'll install a bunch of containers on it and I

206
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,560
just love, it's really nice having that main host just kept so clean.

207
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Anything you really want to do, you input in a container, if you're done with that you

208
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
just delete it.

209
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,240
There's really, it's very easy to manage, I can see why people are fond of it.

210
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

211
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,520
You know, I wonder, have you played with, have you played with Flatpak and Snap Packages

212
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
and all those?

213
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,840
Yeah, I've been getting my feet wet, I mean, I haven't done anything, any real work in

214
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
them yet but I played with them a little.

215
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,640
So I'll tell you, the telegram conversation I was having literally as I was getting on

216
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,720
the area is one of our prized and beloved community members is actually working on packaging

217
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,360
me a OS ticket app inside of Electron because one of the things, so one of the things I

218
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,280
hate is not being able to have a dedicated application when I'm working and I can't alt

219
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,120
tap between things.

220
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,720
It really messes up the window management kind of workflow, yeah.

221
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,240
It does and especially because, you know, things like, so for example, our ticketing

222
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,400
system, I'm basically constantly referencing back and forth.

223
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,880
You know, there's never a time when, you know, no matter what I'm doing, something is either

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,360
going in or out of the ticket system and to not have that, it's own dedicated window is

225
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,520
a huge crutch for me and so Sean was working, Sean, Adram was working on packaging this

226
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,440
just because he's a nice guy and sends me a telegram, he's like, here, I got this done

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
for you.

228
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm like, really dude?

229
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
And he's like, yeah, it actually didn't really take me on that.

230
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I know.

231
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah, I know.

232
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,480
So I'm playing with that and then, you know, the first story we get on the air, we start

233
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
talking about containers.

234
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,200
It's like, it seems like every time I turn around, something else is now possible.

235
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
Something else is now happening because of containers.

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah, exactly.

237
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, I mean, the Electron thing is just because it's web app but you don't even need an Electron

238
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,920
framework to do that.

239
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,200
There's like browsers like Surf which is from the Sucklass project and they have a browser

240
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,400
that's pretty much bare bones, nothing, it doesn't have Chrome, like any user Chrome

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
anywhere.

242
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,480
And for people who are not aware, that means like the GUI of the browser, not actually

243
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Chrome.

244
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,400
But anyway, so it has the same kind of thing, you have custom cookies for each individual

245
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
website.

246
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,600
So you can just load up any web app into Surf as its own independent window and not have

247
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,040
to worry about putting any kind of framework in it.

248
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Really?

249
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Now, have you...

250
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Oh, that does sound very useful.

251
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,000
Have you had any experience deploying this stuff?

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,560
Yeah, I actually have like three of them running right now.

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Really?

254
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,760
And how have you found it to be?

255
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
It works great.

256
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,920
The only problem is that I'm running an older version of Ubuntu base that has an older version

257
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,120
of Sucklass, which the problem with that is only because packages don't update very much.

258
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
So once that's no longer an issue, then it wouldn't matter because the latest version

259
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,800
of Surf has the latest WebKit engine, so it doesn't have any kind of weird issues.

260
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,920
For example, I have Gmail in one of them that every once in a while Gmail will say, you're

261
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
using an old version of WebKit.

262
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
Other than that, it works flawlessly.

263
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,560
It just constantly tells me that I'm using an old version.

264
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,520
But as far as functionally, it works fantastic and all you need to do is create a text file

265
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,120
that stores the cookies and you're done.

266
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,720
It runs just like a web app in a full desktop thing, but web app style.

267
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,160
Now excuse my ignorance, but isn't the entire idea of the whole container thing that it

268
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,840
shouldn't matter what version of Ubuntu you're on and what version of Ubuntu your users are

269
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
on?

270
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Right.

271
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
But Sucklass is not based on the container stuff.

272
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
This is just an old traditional deb thing.

273
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm saying like this is a browser that doesn't need any kind of framework to run around it

274
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,760
to be what you want or it's a separate window and everything like that and it has a separate

275
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,120
session so you can have two or a hundred different Gmail clients running at the same time and

276
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,160
they would all be separate windows and it would all be tracked differently and all have

277
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
a different session.

278
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Wow.

279
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,840
I could definitely use that at work and a few other places.

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Yeah.

281
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
I have one for each slack that I use.

282
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,320
I have one for multiple gmails and so on and so on.

283
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Yeah.

284
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
That's…

285
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,480
Sucklass Surf is a really good app for that.

286
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Yeah.

287
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,200
It's funny too because for a long time I told myself, I was like, what I'm asking

288
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,520
for, what I need, what I want is so simple and plain and straightforward that I can't

289
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,040
believe something doesn't exist and then I kind of got the idea that the only real

290
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,320
way to do that was with something like Electron and then I'm like, well, I guess that works

291
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,400
but I just I feel like there should be a simpler, more straightforward solution.

292
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm finding out as usual it's just a matter of my ignorance, not a matter of the lack

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
of Linux.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,840
It's also they don't really tell people about, they don't really advertise that

295
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,240
they have this feature that I did just say it's a bare bones browser.

296
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,760
They don't mention that they have individual sessions system.

297
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,760
But it's interesting because all you need to do is run whatever thing you want, whatever

298
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,720
website you want to go to, you just type in surf, put in the cookie file location and

299
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,440
then the website and that's it and it runs how you expect it to.

300
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Nice.

301
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Well, thank you.

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
I appreciate that, Rotten.

303
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,720
And you know, the next thing I want to talk about or I guess rather Wes wants to talk

304
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,400
about is making his computer more artificially intelligent.

305
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,680
And I'll tell you what, I'll give you two secret surprises.

306
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Secret surprises.

307
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,200
It's not really secret, I'm about to tell you, but it's still a surprise kind of sort

308
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,280
of keep it secret for the surprise.

309
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
There are two things.

310
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,640
One is I am desperately trying to get more patrons for Chris so when he gets home.

311
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
We have to do it.

312
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,680
You know, so he'll get home and he'll be like, Oh my gosh, Noah and West did not burn the

313
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,060
network down and dad still has a house.

314
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
This is absolutely great.

315
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,040
So we are at 650 right now so we've had we have two patrons.

316
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,200
My goal is to get us to 660 now.

317
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,400
I can't tell you quite yet because I'm finalized the details of what it is, but I have something

318
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,820
in the works and I also have a backup plan if that first plan falls through of something

319
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,840
super special and cool that we're going to be giving away to one of the 12 people.

320
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Two spots are taken.

321
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
We've got 10 left.

322
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
So if one.

323
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Yeah, I know.

324
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
I know.

325
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,560
And and so if you have been considering signing up for patron now is the time to do a patreon.com

326
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,640
slash today and if you sign up before Chris gets back so that's going to be it will have

327
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,520
to do it on the Linux action show this coming Sunday.

328
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,960
So has to be before then if you sign up before then you'll be entered into the dry.

329
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't know we're going to do.

330
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,840
We're gonna do some kind of drawing and and and pull out names and you'll win something

331
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
really cool.

332
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,720
I think it's cool anyway, and it might be even cooler if if if Noah's plan number one

333
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,880
goes through and if not a backup plan number two, okay, that's super secret special thing

334
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,540
number one super secret special thing number two next week's Linux action show if you don't

335
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,000
usually tune in obviously with Chris being gone it gives us we have to fill for his absence

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,700
and those are some pretty big shoes to to fill however we think we might have a pretty

337
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,320
good idea of how to do it and I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is but suffice

338
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,200
to say that it is going to be amazing and it may or may not relate to this next story

339
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,340
that we're going to talk about which by the way is that the mycroft AI personal assistant

340
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,880
is now available on KDE plasma 5 what do you think about that was well you know I mean

341
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Chris has just been making everyone so jealous he's using that gnome extension he's loving

342
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,280
it you've got the personal AI Popey's voice right there all the time but he's right exactly

343
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,920
oh how I wish I had that Chris why did you leave and not give me that would you like

344
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,040
so now would you like it I can send it to you because I have yep let's set that up later

345
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:30,880
I think so so if you are a KDE plasma 5 user rotten corpse you can now have access to the

346
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
mycroft AI application which let me tell you know that the thing is I am still in kind

347
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,140
of disbelief that he's managed to get this project as far as he has in the short amount

348
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,640
of time that he has oh it's incredible without compromising on basically any of his core

349
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:52,060
values you know so we really have a hugely industry competitive project in fact arguably

350
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,160
the only one of its kind right because you have things like the Amazon echo but that's

351
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,040
a very specifically tailored device that you can do very specifically tailored things it's

352
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:09,040
not a drop it's not an open extensible world right but even so even if you even if we abstract

353
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,440
away from the open source argument even if we get above that there's still no drop in

354
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,800
solution that I'm aware of that you can just take an AI you know software stack and just

355
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,680
drop it in and say okay this is my device that does you know my widget that does XYZ

356
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,160
and I wanted to have AI so here we go I don't know of any other software system that will

357
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,800
lie to do that and so you know he's really he has struck a nerve and I think that in

358
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,720
the long run that's going to work out very very well because it inevitably mycroft is

359
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,160
going to be a more versatile and useful platform than anything that remotely competes with

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,120
it right right exactly and I think we've seen like because it's so you know if you become

361
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
a business that wants to have the same thing like it's it's open to you sure you have to

362
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
contribute back upstream of course but you know it allows the community and people who

363
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
really have needs to build the tool that will do you work for them do you have to contribute

364
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,560
back upstream well depending on license so yeah if you make changes yeah yeah but I'm

365
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,240
saying as if you are a project and all you want to do is just is is use that mycroft

366
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,280
AI in its in its form you're not making changes to it you're just you're just using it you

367
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,920
just take it and use it right and totally so I you know that's exciting I think so I

368
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,320
think so and the fact that you we already I'm starting to see you know it I remember

369
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,080
we were at system 76 in November and we were they were still in the launching phase of

370
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,160
this so to watch to go from November to July and have this not be a thing just on gnome

371
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,560
but now they've extended out to KTE you know where's this going to be one year from now

372
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,040
is this going to be on every device I own I hope so I know and I also feel like when

373
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,520
you know like when Cortana came to the desktop and series coming to you just before before

374
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,400
mycroft really had picked up as much momentum as it had now it really felt like it was what

375
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,040
was Linux going to have to compete what was the open source world going to have to compete

376
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,280
we were so far behind we didn't have anything we're not that great at desktop integration

377
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,760
anyway so it really didn't seem like there's possible so really like have to throw a hat

378
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,000
tip out here to Aditya Mehra who seems to be the author of both this Qt application

379
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,880
as well as the gnome shell extension so it's really helping desktop users out a lot okay

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,040
so here's here's the here's the here's the I guess here's the thing well I won't say

381
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,440
that I won't say yeah we'll leave it at that we'll leave it on show Noah yeah no yeah right

382
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,400
no that's my thing it's my trademark I take it everywhere but suffice to say that I think

383
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,200
that mycroft is is going to be absolutely awesome and I don't think I think that at

384
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,320
this point from what I've seen what mycroft can do and that's a that's a that's a small

385
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,440
scope right I think it's much larger than that I think that from the very little that

386
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:52,520
I've seen it blows away Cortana to me is the new clippy of 2016 that's all I feel about

387
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,900
you know you mean I played with it for a little bit it feels like clippy it feels like that

388
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,080
stupid irritating paperclip that bounces around gives you nothing useful and just annoys the

389
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,280
heck out of you except now it's like it's almost like clippy combined with annoying

390
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,000
flash infomercial embedded in the page with super loud sounds yeah exactly and it's like

391
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,920
under your fingertips all the time all right so I see you're wanting to run a podcast would

392
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,440
you like exactly exactly dude that's exactly how I feel about it I think it's the dumbest

393
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,800
thing ever all right well looks like arch has finally caught up to a bunt to zygoon.pl

394
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:35,160
headline snappy in arch move to community repo and says hey there snappers I'd like

395
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,720
to announce something that you may have noticed during the last update of snapd to version

396
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,960
2.0.10 the AUR package is no longer there instead you can now get an update snappy in

397
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,200
the arch simply by running this one-liner and then he gives pacman attack s space snap

398
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:56,520
d s n a p d you know it's interesting was I was just talking again I was talking to

399
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,640
adrium right before the show and he was he was in the process of packaging this electron

400
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,800
thing to me and he says well I know that you have a bunch on your laptop now so I'll just

401
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,340
package it as a snap and I said doesn't it really not matter anymore what operating system

402
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,040
I have now if it's just a snap I just you know just start on any of us right or any

403
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,680
distro and he said no actually so turns out it's it's still very much a community thing

404
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,000
so the community distro and arch has it and you know it's it's available in a bun too

405
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,160
and it's available in copper but it's not like widely spread right so fairly wide it

406
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,120
is fairly I mean it's for the fact that it's only been around for two months it's pretty

407
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,200
wide now well I guess my question is twofold the first question is or the first part of

408
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,880
the question is doesn't it kind of eliminate a universal installer if it's not truly universal

409
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:53,040
throughout all distros and then my second question good yes but it's it's that's that's

410
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,440
only a temporary thing because it's it has to be people have to adopt it to make universal

411
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,760
yeah so what you're saying is eventually we'll get there more than likely I mean the fact

412
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,360
that it's been two months and when it first started two months ago it was in one distro

413
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,560
and then now then it became in every flavor and then it became in like six other distros

414
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:17,000
now like sent to s has it fedora has it gen 2 has it linux mint has it now like the fact

415
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,920
that it's only been two months and there's already that much support the more and more

416
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,840
distros that adopted and longer and you know the more time we have the more it becomes

417
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,440
universal I think it just hasn't had enough time to get there okay well I guess that makes

418
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,520
sense so it is good point you can't have universality just on the on the get-go or that'd be pretty

419
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,820
hard to do and we will see if we get the critical mass like if you can tip the tip the ship

420
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,160
here with enough distros then it will will you know you'll feel like an outsider if you

421
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,560
don't have it and your user will probably come to expect it yeah I just I every time

422
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,800
this discussion comes up I have to reference the whole xkcd thing problem we have 13 competing

423
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,120
standards let's create one standard to standardize them all problem we have 14 competing standards

424
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,360
I mean that's it's true but that's also kind of like we didn't really have a standard for

425
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,760
universal apps yet so they're all competing to become the standard yeah so it will eventually

426
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,520
we will have a standard because there's there's so many people who are who are behind the

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,720
idea of having a standard that it is very likely that will be the one of them will get

428
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,200
it I don't know which one but one of them will and I think the best example right now

429
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,720
is if someone wants to install like next cloud they can just you know install Ubuntu or whatever

430
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,520
that supports snap and then just snap install next cloud and you're done yeah like it's

431
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,600
that simple now like that is that is such a huge change from what it used to be that

432
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,880
I see that this is big this is definitely going to be like revolutionary type of thing

433
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,240
yeah go ahead dar I will claim that it doesn't even matter if it doesn't become universal

434
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,200
as long as the core distribution is implemented what I mean is the distribution concept is

435
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,440
a concept of try different things and see if you succeed at doing and if it becomes

436
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,360
good people adopted the toolkits GTK cute all that kind of jazz essentially for me if

437
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,600
it is good is going to get adopted by the major distributions usually people run mostly

438
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,240
on the major distributions those that are running different things it's probably because

439
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,280
they're looking for different things anyways it doesn't matter if it's not universal as

440
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,560
long as it's in the core ones if you're developing software and you want to ship it heck if you

441
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,640
can have a single binary that it runs that's what matters for your user as long as he can

442
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,760
execute your program and in the end of the day it doesn't matter yeah that's fair that's

443
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,520
fair I guess I guess I you know I started out I mostly took the opposite side of this

444
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,800
argument simply to you know to provide context and because I've been speaking with some developers

445
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,320
and they had some concerns but I think overall if I had any concerns even if they haven't

446
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,540
been those concerns haven't been directly addressed or or squashed I guess they're outweighed

447
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:03,320
by the by the huge benefits of of what this brings to the table and I guess the only thing

448
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,400
is is it is interesting to me that that something that of this magnitude is still you know is

449
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,960
is in the community repo it's not in the main arch repo although I suppose on the other

450
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,840
hand it is the main arch repo though is it yeah well there's a distinction in terms yeah

451
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,160
it's a community is just a branch it's not officially maintained by arch but the fact

452
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,920
that they're allowing a trusted user to maintain it in the official arch repos it is kind of

453
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,880
like they are kind of acknowledging that it's more than just an AR it is being maintained

454
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,100
by someone in that community gotcha okay well yeah that's an important good that's good

455
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:48,760
clarification because I was not aware of that so anyway anyway yeah I think it's I think

456
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,240
this is gonna be interesting it'll be exciting this will be my first snap package that I

457
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,180
will rely on you know I've installed telegram but I have you know I've always had the option

458
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,440
of doing it from a PPA I installed you know I've installed other applications but they

459
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,920
they are just it was specifically for the purpose to try out snap this OS ticket desktop

460
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,720
application will be the first one that I've ever that I'll have ever used that is only

461
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,740
available to me in a snap package and because snap package I guess I'll be able to use it

462
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,520
on anything right yeah I'll be really curious to see you know how that goes for you should

463
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,840
definitely when you once you've got a hold of it you should definitely see how how far

464
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,040
you can spread it just see which servers and how easy it is yeah I totally will I tell

465
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,880
you what the funny thing about the snaps is that the most of the things that as like on

466
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,120
the developer side there are certain things that I say that it could be problem but there's

467
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,800
also certain things that I think that are fantastic and but the funny thing about it

468
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,800
is that so far it's since there's only been a couple months the amount of progress that

469
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,280
has been made on the snap side is like kind of amazing just because when the very beginning

470
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,360
there was like two or three problems that were addressed as like being catastrophic

471
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,460
and there's no way it's going to be adopted and then they happened and snap release features

472
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,520
for that and then now there was like the immediate jump was then the shared library issue and

473
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,720
then now snap is basically going to have in like a couple weeks shared libraries are going

474
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,580
to be released so they're like pretty much anytime there's an issue that's not like that

475
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,000
seems like snap is not going to be something that people would want they're going well

476
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,200
okay now if you brought our attention we'll make it huh well that's a good time yeah it

477
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,240
is that's very promising very promising outlook so West you have the chat room up right now

478
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,020
yes I do so I'll tell you something I had I was I had the chat room up on my laptop

479
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,880
and then as it turns out one of the problems so here behind the scenes ready behind the

480
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,960
scenes one of the problems with doing shows from Grand Forks is I'm not usually doing

481
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,480
them from Grand Forks and so when I every show I think I kind of have everything down

482
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,140
and to be fair Kota radio was so much less overhead than last that I literally walked

483
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,480
into the studio I set up in about 15 minutes and then I was like well now what I guess

484
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,620
I guess I'll go have lunch and come back in an hour and a half and do the show and worked

485
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,760
out beautifully well thought I was all set up to do unplugged but the one thing that

486
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,520
I missed was I there's where I didn't do the intro music for Kota because there were some

487
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,840
editing concerns love I've done the intro music before and I was like wow it should

488
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,720
be no problem to knock it out but I realized I didn't have a third computer to play the

489
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,560
intro music on so right before the show starts I'm like well I'll use my laptop so I bring

490
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,200
it over I set it in the middle of the studio plug this audio cable in and run the music

491
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,680
well then I get back here and I realize I don't have access to the chat room that's

492
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,760
a problem right well the great thing about Quasl is it syncs on all of the devices turns

493
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,040
out today is the day that our techs decide they're gonna upgrade all of the access points

494
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:51,120
so we're going to AC right I have no Wi-Fi in here I have no Wi-Fi what are you gonna

495
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:59,360
do I tell you what what I did was I have my Samsung Galaxy S6 on Ting and the cool thing

496
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,120
about Ting especially if you use the code Linux or you visit the website linux.ting.com

497
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,520
is they are going to give you $25 off your first device or your first month of service

498
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:19,280
now my total bill my total bill is $24 that's what I pay every month and that is for a phone

499
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,120
for myself and my wife that's crazy yeah we have two phones and it costs us 24 bucks a

500
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,760
month now the great thing how that's even possible is you only pay for what you use

501
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,440
so I don't use minutes I in fact I hate phone calls if you call me you're likely to get

502
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,880
rejected I only answer phone calls from like three people and other than that the little

503
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,560
ringer thing if by default is set to silent and then there's certain people that I have

504
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,720
set a ringtone for like my wife if she needs something urgently for the most part I just

505
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,640
don't do phone calls so my minutes are zero my messages I hate texting because I'm on

506
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,560
so many different devices that I can't text from one device you just send me a text message

507
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,160
in fact I have those alerts disabled so I check them like once a month for those people

508
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,360
that refuse to join 2016 but I use yeah exactly I use telegram for going over you know data

509
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,920
for everything now we're an IT company so what does that mean that means that we install

510
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,080
IT infrastructure I never have to worry about not having Wi-Fi because if I'm at my office

511
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,000
except for today I have Wi-Fi if I'm at my home I have Wi-Fi and if I'm at any client

512
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,080
location we have a super secret special network that all of our all of our tech devices can

513
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,300
I do that give us admin access to the network and unrestricted speeds and all that good

514
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,720
stuff I just throw my phone on there so I have network access literally everywhere I

515
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:39,280
go so much so that when I got my s6 I didn't have a GSM SIM card at the time for it because

516
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,960
I still have my other phone activated I want to number two it's a long story but I didn't

517
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,080
have a SIM card I actually used my phone for three days while I waited for my Amazon Prime

518
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,160
SIM card by the way you can get them off of Amazon Prime the ting ones I used it for three

519
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:57,480
days voice calls through Zoiper SIP texting through telegram and of course all of my email

520
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,200
stuff and I never even really missed a beat I didn't have data while I was in the car

521
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,040
that wasn't really the end of the world so it's kind of like gap coverage and it was

522
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,280
just kind of funny today because it was one of the first times where I was like hey I

523
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,960
actually don't have I don't have Wi-Fi for the first time and that doesn't usually happen

524
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,040
so all that to say linux.ting.com go over there for 25 bucks you should easily be able

525
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,480
to get your first month of service if not if you're single person you might even be

526
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,800
able to milk two months out of that just six bucks per line and you can do a hotspot so

527
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,200
I actually in addition to my my two phones I've also got a hotspot that I use when I

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,160
go when we go out to the lake and stuff like that just so the laptops can't get connected

529
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,560
the kids can be there and and whatnot linux.ting.com and a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring

530
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,640
the Linux unplugged program.

531
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:58,120
So the next story on the docket is I believe it's this BPKG am I am I pronounced that?

532
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,840
You are dead on what does that sound like to you?

533
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,600
Big B package I mean I know what it is because I got it pulled up here but but is it is it

534
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,840
B package is that how I'm supposed to pronounce it?

535
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,080
Let's go with B package that seems like the most fun so you know you need you pretty we

536
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,960
all love package managers we're just talking about the next round of pseudo package managers

537
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,920
with snap and flat pack and docker and well everyone you know you also have things like

538
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,280
you have your you know your rust has a has cargo you have pip for python now we have

539
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,600
a B package for bash as a developer I hate them all okay tell me why hold on hold on

540
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,680
tell me why okay I will say the following if you're developing python somebody uses

541
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,220
install somebody uses pip yes they eventually fixed and merged both of the package managers

542
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,760
but that means only that now you have software that when you download the repository in the

543
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,600
source code you actually don't get all of the dependencies you need for that program

544
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,240
to to build even though you're just getting source code in tarballs you will get source

545
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,880
code and you will have all git has sub modules but developers seem that they want to use

546
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,920
whatever package manager you have go has the same problem they put the url as an import

547
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,040
inside of the language what that means you download your source code you want to work

548
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,320
offline you can't want to build you can't if the server goes down of one of the dependencies

549
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,940
you're dead essentially it's terrible drunk it's much worse the problem than actually

550
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,560
the problem you end up finding in the distributions repositories because at least you know that

551
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,680
it's your distro they might not support all the packages you're looking for when they

552
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:38,280
have something they tend to have all the dependencies you need so what would you recommend then

553
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,240
I mean are you are you saying that there shouldn't be that none of these should exist are you

554
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,760
saying that the problem is we got too much of a good thing I think it's because it creates

555
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,040
isolationism and makes it the people using a specific language end up having to recreate

556
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,880
all of these libraries that could be used across and actually have the ability to use

557
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,240
code that already exists outside of their their own isolationist thing I believe if

558
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,200
you want to fix your source code if you're already shipping source code and if you're

559
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,360
already using some sort of version in control it's not difficult to put in your build script

560
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,160
or it whatever your your version of control supports like git has sub modules in and sub

561
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,600
trees use those things please okay so you can avoid so much there's one tool to do the

562
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,360
job okay so you're saying it's unnecessary you're saying it's unnecessary I'm saying

563
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,520
it's unnecessary because let's say I want to I want to use a python program now I have

564
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,520
to have peep is install I have to have a git I have to have the distribution so all of

565
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,520
these packages are spread across not uniformly not all in the same version it's like it's

566
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:49,280
just a pain as a developer I think it's terrible actually hmm okay Wes do you have a do you

567
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,080
have a contrary opinion well you know I wasn't exactly excited about this I just think it

568
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,920
was interesting to see something like to see these concepts promulgate down even to the

569
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,720
shell level I don't do too much bash I mean I enjoy writing a bash script certainly is

570
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,680
useful but you know there's a get to a certain level where there's enough logic I usually

571
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,920
have migrated to another language that has solved these problems already I did install

572
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,600
it on my laptop here and you know it's working well it was a fast install although they do

573
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,440
recommend the one of the ways install isn't is the curl pipe to bash so there's probably

574
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,560
a theme going on here but you know you can install stuff I've got like an our tail program

575
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,120
for remotely tailing log files so I can see some utility in it and certainly if you were

576
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,000
like a bash developer I'm not sure if that's a thing but if it is a thing maybe you know

577
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,680
it does allow you to have like it will set up local dependencies for you so you can install

578
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,080
things in user land rather than you know needing root permissions just add one small thing

579
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,900
I see nothing wrong with having maybe an index of where you can find the multiple sides the

580
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,600
things that don't get published into a repository if you have some sort of index that allows

581
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,560
you to search code search code website for example you can do that but honestly when

582
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,820
it comes down to the way you distribute your package come on it's source code if you are

583
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,320
building a program that program you're shipping the source code the user expects to be the

584
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,940
user of that source code expects to be able to build and run your program make that work

585
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,360
stop depending on yet another tool to push your code so that all of your collection of

586
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,960
code is available and start dealing with you know last surface a lot of the errors and

587
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,960
issues come exactly from increasing your surface of the area you as a developer can comprehend

588
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,540
all of it perfectly you end up having dependencies and you can see as an example what happened

589
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,480
with node just actually one developer decided to okay since I can't have name I wanted because

590
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
of trademarks I'm going to delete it and broke a lot of websites because projects depended

591
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,760
on it was an example that's not a very good example just because node had a very poor

592
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,640
infrastructure it was if no did not allow them to you know remove it any time for any

593
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,260
reason whatsoever that wouldn't have happened but here's the they screwed up not necessarily

594
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,080
like the structure like not the concept of having shared dependencies and stuff like

595
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,800
that it was the the fact that node screwed up or anything specifically actually what

596
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,480
about this and this proves the example that I was speaking about if you are using versioning

597
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,720
control and you fork a repository that you are using as a dependency you can pull exactly

598
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,560
that hash version guess what you can insert into your project as a sub module as a sub

599
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:29,160
tree and it will be just there okay well well first off I would just point out that you're

600
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,940
talking about an ideal idealistic situation where everything and all source code is open

601
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,880
source but that's not the case and the majority of proprietary software would be a dependency

602
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,560
that you could not do that with so you can't you can't you can have get repositories that

603
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,640
have binaries that are proprietary you can totally do it it's a lame excuse it's doable

604
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,420
we have the tools it's people who don't who are so centric about the code way that they're

605
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,920
used to developing code they don't look at how I actually make my source code something

606
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,320
that just builds and just works they're looking at they complain about the packages issues

607
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,680
but most of the maintainers of the multiple distributions constantly fight okay this package

608
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,920
pulls from pip and this package pulls from easing install and this package puts from

609
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,880
node js which one respects my licenses in the case of devian the maintainer has all

610
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,640
of these efforts to go through if maintainers didn't have this effort to go through they

611
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,360
could just look okay we prefer in our distribution to put binaries in usr bin and so they would

612
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,560
look at where in your package build so in the directory where you build your project

613
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,800
the binaries are generated make it those binaries go to usr bin that actually will simplify

614
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,680
the process for both developers and maintainers but no nobody sees that okay i'm used to

615
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,640
i don't want to be dependent on maintainers to update my applications for the rest of

616
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,480
my life so even if even if your solution is is good in that sense it's still it still

617
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,640
puts it on the maintainers and still means that i can't update it whenever i want so

618
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,060
even if that was a solution i still don't want that for all intensive purposes you can

619
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,720
be the maintainer as much as you want i i don't care i just think that it separates

620
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,240
the concerns between what a developer ships in terms of source code what what a maintainer

621
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,400
ships in in terms of as a maintainer job currently the maintainer job basically is reverse the

622
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,840
process that developer decided to create to build their package understand how he can

623
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,560
incorporate that that into their distro one thing or not that's the process of a maintainer

624
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,640
if i just say that if you as a developer have the care of isolating your source environment

625
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,880
into a location it's actually preferable even if it's you doing the work as a maintainer

626
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,840
it's you shipping a binary or it's someone else coming and picking up on it you know

627
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,960
uh rikai says in the in the in the chat room he made a he made an interesting point i'd

628
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,920
like to get your guys's take on it he says someone point me to a distro that is packaging

629
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,720
a ton of bash scripts as packages because i don't know of any so this argument doesn't

630
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,600
make any sense to me i can see for normal packages but bash scripts and then he goes

631
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:13,560
on to say sorry i was just gonna say i'm i'm surprised that this is even a thing like this

632
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,640
no not no just that bash has packages i mean i don't even know that like a.sh file that's

633
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,840
the package for bash well i think that i don't even understand i think that's i think that's

634
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,520
what he's saying he's and then somewhere in here i can't find the exact 12 but he says

635
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,920
oh yeah here it is i would love a bash script repository so that makes sense to me but there's

636
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,000
no way to get it elsewhere without just searching get home from code and pulling down from local

637
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,760
does that does that change your perspective at all either rotten corpse or dar devlin

638
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,760
or west if you slightly slightly but very mildly only in the sense that i agree with

639
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,700
the repository i agree that there's not something for it and in that sense maybe distribution

640
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,360
should look into incorporating common bash scripts then you have to make the other question

641
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,920
isn't bash scripts for customization personalization of things and things need to be a system become

642
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,060
their own isolated demon or program if if we look at bash as something to automate things

643
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,400
for our own personal taste and our repository makes sense in the terms of community sharing

644
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,320
not necessarily as distribution actually distributing this it's very personal so i'll

645
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,280
look those things become standardized they become small little programs that end up being

646
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,840
deployed as a package good with my feeling i'll just add in in some ways like it you

647
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,080
know there's also kind of like a weird reverse or perverse incentive where a lot of times

648
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,680
bash scripts i i'll use them where i might not use another tool because you know they're

649
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,320
very portable they're easy to run you don't have to compile them etc so if i'm if i have

650
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,280
to install this secondary tool to then down these obviously you don't you can get them

651
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,960
just through the repo or whatever but you know it makes it like well if i'm gonna already

652
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
be using a package manager i might as well use something in python or a higher level

653
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,040
language that i could use rather than bash you know i'm guilty of that and i and i can

654
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,080
tell you firsthand raki is as well i mean fundamentally bash is what is is the quote

655
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,560
unquote programming language that's used to facilitate a lot of things in fact raki actually

656
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,920
shares with me a couple of little out scripts of the way that some of the videos are transcoded

657
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,540
my understanding is that's all wrapped in inside of a bash script i i actually tried

658
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,080
using you know i took a course on linux academy more about them in a little bit but i actually

659
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,240
i tried writing a little bit of code in bash uh and and then i decided i was going to quote

660
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,040
unquote graduate to a higher programming language and so i took a course from linux academy

661
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,760
on python and what ended up happening was i found in python how to write bash like how

662
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,240
i could call bash scripts and so i ended up yeah and so basically ended up wrapping all

663
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,160
of these bash scripts inside of python which made absolutely no sense but you know it's

664
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,520
fun to do but i think part of it is that you once you get you have to be comfortable with

665
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,480
bash to be a linux admin to begin with and so for those of us that are system administrators

666
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:00,860
and we're not developers being able to get small tasks done or even automated inside

667
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,840
of bash enables us to get the functionality as if we were a developer writing a a program

668
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,000
without the overhead of actually having to learn the development language and quote unquote

669
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
doing it properly and in that regard i think that there's that that bash has a lot of power

670
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,720
has a lot of power behind it you know to that point how many people do you know in 2016

671
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:27,760
that are writing hugely complicated scripts in dos or whatever you know it's just i i

672
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,680
i we have we have i mean our shell is so powerful that we're talking about a package manager

673
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,240
for it that in and of itself is cool i'm going to not without disrespecting anybody i will

674
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,600
say that the fact that once those things start needing a package manager i think is actually

675
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,520
an indication that perhaps those things should be moved outside bash it's just a suggestion

676
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,280
because a lot of things don't contemplate the use case scenarios that are beyond the

677
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,440
you know small automation bash was originally at least if i understand correctly it was

678
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,080
originally intended as you invoke mostly other programs to do but when you start doing manipulation

679
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,280
when you start producing it's a show yeah exactly when you start trying to produce output

680
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,080
maybe it's the time that you need to make a stop in your heart and say really i need

681
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,020
to get this done properly because seriously it actually just damages further because we

682
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,600
then need that bash becomes always there becomes having the issues that other programming languages

683
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,320
already have solved and now we're having to deal with an extra package manager i just

684
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,480
don't believe it's a good idea a package manager might not be good for bash but i i agree that

685
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,360
the uh the idea of a repo would be pretty cool so maybe not practical but still pretty

686
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,880
cool yeah well you guys should all just try it out and report back if you actually use

687
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,080
it yeah yeah yeah maybe that's an idea maybe we could have like a community review kind

688
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,620
of a thing you know i think part of the drive is to you know so one part of the drive is

689
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,160
just that we're familiar with it but the i think the reason that a lot of us especially

690
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,200
a system administrators i don't know about us but the reason that i've become so ingrained

691
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,920
in bash is because i can run it from the command line right yeah exactly and so basically what

692
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,080
that enables you to do is if you have a tool that you fundamentally rely on that requires

693
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:22,760
a web interface it means that you're only able to access that tool when you have i'm

694
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,640
sorry can i say web interface graphical interface you're only able to access that tool when

695
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,580
you have the graphical interface graphical desktop installed and that's not always the

696
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,700
case in fact a lot of times you'll end up using like all of my servers and i can say

697
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,120
this with 100 certainty every single server i own whether it is a virtual server or it's

698
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,840
a physical box does not have a head on it and it's it actually it provides for some

699
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,600
comical interaction because i'll get calls from clients you know all the servers that

700
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,120
we have installed at client locations they're on a rack and there's no display connected

701
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,340
to it because we administrate everything you know over ssh totally and that that enables

702
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,280
us to get it to it remotely but it'll be funny every once in a while you have a client that

703
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,860
their server goes down or something stops working and they don't want to pay us to come

704
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,920
out so they'll they'll go in there and they're like i'll fix this i'll just go and click

705
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,540
the restart button or well it's all right they're locked as a gang login but they they

706
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,080
have this they have the the cable they plug a monitor cable and they set a monitor up

707
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,440
and i've gotten more than one call where they're like well yeah oh this is so and so from so

708
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,500
and so client and uh we uh we want in the server room something's definitely wrong with

709
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,720
our server we plug the monitor in and it it's booted to a dos prompt and uh it's not loading

710
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,720
windows you know they just they have no idea right but the i think that and the the drive

711
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,920
behind that not only is it lower resources but in it fundamentally enables us to take

712
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,980
those servers if we ever need to and it's happened more than once and move them over

713
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,560
to a vps provider so you have a you have a client and they have a server and all of a

714
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,900
sudden it goes down the protocol used to be 10 years ago here's how that conversation

715
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,480
would look hey i'm really sorry that your server went down i understand that you're

716
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,800
not able to get any work done if you'd like i can go ahead and overnight a brand new server

717
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,240
to you and would have it up and running in about 12 hours if it's super super super super

718
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,680
super super important i can call xyz and they'll go ahead and uh put an expedite thing on it

719
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,520
and i can drive to minneapolis four and a half hours and i can have it up at eight hours

720
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,280
and then you'd be back online today that conversation looks like this hey guys i'm really sorry

721
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,520
that your server went down if you pay us fifteen dollars uh we will go ahead and set you up

722
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,720
an account over at digital ocean which is our chosen vps provider and then we bill them

723
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,160
15 bucks and digital ocean charges us five bucks and so we make a nice little spread

724
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,900
in there and it's a recurring cost because if you're in small business you know that

725
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,000
the most valuable revenue stream that you have is the recurring sources it's not the

726
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,560
one-offs the people that call even if it's a big client even if it's a big job and you

727
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,600
bid it out and it's you know 10 15 20 even 30 000 that money will eventually go away

728
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,320
so it's those it's those it is those reoccurring contracts where they sign up and they say

729
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,340
yeah we want because it's only five bucks we want a main server we want a backup server

730
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,920
and then we want a failover server off-site you know this that and the other okay no problem

731
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,480
i log into my digital ocean control panel i create their main server i create their

732
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,920
backup server and those may be on one data center and then i put another one in like

733
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,940
you know frankfurt or wherever that's totally off-site and it's doing off-site replication

734
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,280
so if anything fails at the main data center or something like that we have the backups

735
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,960
and i can do all of this from my laptop or even my freaking cell phone right on site

736
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,200
and i can tell the customer and i have told the customer hey we'll have this up and running

737
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,280
for you in about 20 minutes because it takes me about 30 seconds to get the server spun

738
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,600
up and working and then it takes me you know the the rest of the time i probably spend

739
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,680
half an hour locking the system down and installing all their applications and stuff like that

740
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:47,400
the thing is um if you use the code do unplugged you're going to get uh you're going to get

741
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,640
ten dollars off your first linux rig now you could apply that towards a big linux rig and

742
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,400
run a really powerful server for a free month or you could do what i do which is spread

743
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,760
that over over two machines and you can actually run two five dollar rigs now just to see how

744
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,960
far i could push digital ocean a couple weeks ago we did a review of uh virtualization and

745
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,160
i actually virtualized a five dollar droplet to see if i could do it you could actually

746
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,380
get mini droplets out of your five dollar droplet if you really had to so if you had

747
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,040
like a good example might be a web server a small web server that has like a company

748
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,980
portal maybe it redirects to a different site or maybe you just have a couple little company

749
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,980
resources something like that you need just something super super tiny maybe you needed

750
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,160
two of those you could probably get those to run on a five dollar rig i'm not necessarily

751
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,080
suggesting you put that into production because for five bucks a month who cares but i can

752
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,840
tell you this i have there isn't a vps provider out there that i haven't tried and hands down

753
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:50,600
the zero compromise vps solution is digital ocean so go over there use the code do unplugged

754
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,400
and get ten dollars towards your first linux rig and a huge thank you to digital ocean

755
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:07,200
for sponsoring the linux unplugged program so wes uh i this next piece here is uh confusing

756
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:16,300
confusing to say the least linux and open source are powering comic uh massive restructure

757
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:22,160
am i reading that right almost so uh linux and open source are powering comcast massive

758
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,780
infrastructure i didn't see the wrap there you go okay you know and it's hard that's

759
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,560
a hard one to say for us people comcast is not always our friends i know uh here at the

760
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,560
jb one we certainly complain about them i think that's every day but it's you know you

761
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,880
don't always think about like how much of the open source technology they really do

762
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:45,180
and have to leverage to compete as a huge isp uh-huh we've had our you know you speak

763
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:51,640
about uh problems but we have had a a plethora of comcast problems recently so much so that

764
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,720
chris is actively looking to try to find alternatives to comcast the problem is in his particular

765
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,000
area neck of the woods they are not terribly available in fact he was i heard him on the

766
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,240
air last week sometime he was even joking he's like maybe i'll just go do shows from

767
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,160
the road because i probably have more reliable internet yeah exactly i mean that says it

768
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,120
right there okay so dive into this a little bit for me tell me how comcast is using linux

769
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,800
well okay so basically i mean to start with obviously comcast ships a crazy amount of

770
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,400
traffic uh let's see so in 2012 they had 1.2 million gigabytes of data traffic in 2013

771
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,240
that grew to almost 7 million gigabytes of traffic and it just keeps getting more right

772
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,560
so like in 2014 now it's at 74.8 million gigs of traffic so people are clearly picking it

773
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:41,320
up and they need things that can really scale okay and so so and it's just interesting to

774
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,360
hear the people say so here um here's what their representatives saying comcast like

775
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,100
so many others is a very linux heavy operating system country a company generally speaking

776
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,960
we're more on the open source side of those linux distributions than the commercial side

777
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,520
so they mostly are using ubuntu and centos in addition they're huge open stack users

778
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,720
so they they mostly deploy kvm and then they do all their data center orchestration through

779
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,360
open stack they have a let's say they have roughly a petabyte of memory and around a

780
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,160
million virtual cpu cores that they are running under open stack mostly to pile you know to

781
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,840
run all their web interfaces billing management account stuff the x1 interface the on-screen

782
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,240
interface all that stuff so i really never really thought about it before but it's it's

783
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,720
kind of interesting you know i suppose really what you know the thing is like it would be

784
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,720
cool to you almost to use almost it would be cool to use this as something like a runs

785
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,360
linux on the linux action show but the reality is there they are the epitome of everything

786
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,800
i hate about uh these kinds of linux users and it is it is this in a very short order

787
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,760
they don't care about linux or the community they care about profiting off the backs of

788
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,080
the hard-working people and and the excellent infrastructure that linux offers now i'm a

789
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,440
small business owner i'm not against making money i'm not against making a lot of money

790
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:56,880
right our economy relies on that yeah but i am against abusing a community and having

791
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,120
zero respect for that community and oracle well and then further is pushing the people

792
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,160
that made that community exist in the first place out of the community because they are

793
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:10,920
not part of your business model and don't benefit you directly and uh comcast and the

794
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,280
few little things that i've had to deal with them seems like they hit every one of those

795
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,240
bullet points square on the head and i hate it um and so you know it's kind of cool but

796
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,220
let's face it all that to say you can't run a company the size of comcast unless you're

797
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:30,800
running it on linux i mean windows small business server ain't gonna cut it and and comcast

798
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,080
needs like you know best in class engineers and those people are gonna be using unix tools

799
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,160
and and a lot of linux based tools so here's an interesting twist for you are you familiar

800
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,320
with cumulus networks uh only a little bit okay so cumulus networks had a really bright

801
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:51,020
idea they said right now in business we have a problem we have network engineers network

802
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:56,000
technicians and we have system administrators and the system administrators are very good

803
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,440
with bash and are very good with linux and are very good with you know computers and

804
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,880
understand the networking side of linux but anytime we want to do something serious

805
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,740
heavy lifting with networking we go to our network engineers and our network technicians

806
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:13,000
and those are the guys that know cisco and they know juniper and they know hp very different

807
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,240
worlds you know microtech right exactly um and they they are who provide our network

808
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,440
so if you want to have a high functioning company you employ the best of the best of

809
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,840
the system administrators and you employ the best of the best of network engineers and

810
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,600
technicians and if your network crashes your system administrator notices he contacts a

811
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,640
network engineer and they take care of it and if your network engineer or technician

812
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,600
is there and the the server goes down they don't touch it you just wait for the administrator

813
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,780
to come but basically that means your payroll is twice because you have two equally technically

814
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,240
proficient people but they are specializing in different areas even though the guy who

815
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,560
is running your network engineer guy has to have some basic system administration knowledge

816
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,440
because he's copying files off to and from a tftp server most of the time and your network

817
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,260
engineer has to have some basic your your system administrator has to some basic knowledge

818
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,200
of networking because he's got to get a service to talk on the network and so they said why

819
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,780
not do away with this whole dichotomy and say let's use linux as the network operating

820
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:20,160
system and just route everything through ip tables and through a custom interface that

821
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,000
they wrote on linux and so how interesting yeah it is really cool dude so basically they

822
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,720
sell this switch and router and you know whatever for you know data center you know we're talking

823
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,440
like 40 gig connection i'm going to move they're not small scale right it's really big stuff

824
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,860
but right isp level that kind of thing but it's all being done on linux and you're using

825
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,480
linux so they're they're they're selling point is train your guys to be a system administrator

826
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,400
they can administrate our networking equipment as well as any of your servers because it's

827
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,040
all one operating system and you interface with it like you would any linux distro and

828
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,620
all that to all that arriving to the point that it seems like that would be a really

829
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:03,240
great route for some place like comcast who probably has an abundance of people that are

830
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,800
working in networking and now they're trying to branch out and well not necessarily branch

831
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,560
out but they're being forced because cable is going by the wayside to focus on these

832
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,720
video type services which require a huge back end infrastructure of administration seems

833
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,600
like you could really cut your costs down if you could get a network infrastructure

834
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,520
in place that utilizes the same talent as your administrators that are administrating

835
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,400
all this video content what do you think yeah it's interesting it's interesting to see

836
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,760
especially with like you know microsoft's working on their switching linux based thing

837
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,320
dell has their new operating system doing the same sort of thing definitely you know

838
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,280
software divine networking and having these things i will also say personally you know

839
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,160
networking is interesting and i have several friends who have you know cisco certificates

840
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,320
or etc or our networking guys and i work with network engineers and you know we all we get

841
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,440
along on the fundamentals and the and the protocols but it's it's just interesting

842
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,240
because a lot of the professional network engineers are applying practices with very

843
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,360
proprietary equipment you know very locked down they're very following specifications

844
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:04,480
made and implemented by these vendors it's very different in the linux world where it

845
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,020
networking really has that spirit of just like you know maybe you won't get quite the

846
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,200
throughput or you won't be able to do like you know you're not having a giant core router

847
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,640
or anything but the amount of flexibility and things you can do with the linux networking

848
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,140
stack is i'm i'm continually impressed you know it's interesting too because they they've

849
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:23,000
literally proven and i mean i'm telling you these are not cheap equipment right you're

850
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,720
looking at 20 000 plus you know totally yeah so i mean but they're selling these things

851
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,000
right and left and they're hugely popular and i think the reason is because in the long

852
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,080
scheme if you're looking at large scale really your costs are going down not up and i think

853
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,400
that i think that alone is hugely advantageous now so i don't mean to sidetrack the conversation

854
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,160
with but have you do you have do you have any networking certifications i do not have

855
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,980
any certifications now have you ever gone to any of the training i've had some informal

856
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:58,240
training from network engineers yeah so i have sat and passed the some of the cisco

857
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,240
exams right and i made an authentic comment on last i've actually made it more than once

858
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,400
that the certifications for networking are kind of a joke and i didn't mean to say that

859
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,720
network engineers are not talented or that it's not difficult to pass the test or anything

860
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,320
like that totally but what i am saying and i stand by this and after i explained it via

861
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,920
an email guy wrote back and he's like oh man you you brought back some bad memories you

862
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,120
know i thought when i went to sit down i actually i was certified in red hat first and then

863
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,320
i went back and did my cisco stuff because at the time i was focusing on system administration

864
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,240
then i went and branched out my own company this and the other when i went to sit for

865
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,720
the cisco test i expected to sit down in front of a cisco router and they would give me a

866
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,440
computer to ssh or telnet or use a serial connection whatever and give me a series of

867
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:48,080
tasks to configure the switcher router or whatever right turns out what they actually

868
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:55,300
have is a little java applet that emulates the router but only the commands that they

869
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,760
think that you should have so right off the bat you know you get used to doing certain

870
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,440
things especially if you're a cisco guy one of the first things that you'll do when you

871
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:12,280
sit down is uh is show space config enter and then it spits out exactly what the router

872
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,440
is you know doing right now you know or or show int uh you know you can you can you can

873
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,280
put in non-ambiguous terms so it the the full command would be something like show interfaces

874
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,520
brief but i i've never actually typed that out in fact i couldn't even tell you i couldn't

875
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,000
even tell you if it's interface or interfaces i don't remember what i do know is i type

876
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
show space int space br enter and it shows me all of the interfaces that are there well

877
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,320
a lot of the stuff isn't working in this stupid java thing and it and it is throwing me off

878
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:45,000
because i i'm i'm i am painfully aware that i'm not actually onto a router i'm on this

879
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,040
little emulation thing that doesn't feel like a router and nothing feels right to me it's

880
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,880
not testing your ability on a real router no it's really not aside from the fact that

881
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,240
it's super delayed and it's not in guake and i can't draw it's just everything is off to

882
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,920
me and i'm already feeling out of my comfort zone and then i get past the little simulation

883
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,680
things and they go on to these questions where they ask you to calculate subnets now i would

884
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,920
figure if i was writing the test that if i wrote four subnet questions and the person

885
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,880
can answer all four of them then they can subnet and if they can't answer four of them

886
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,880
then they can't subnet and that should be the end of it what turns out they want you

887
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,640
to do like i don't know some absurd thing like you do like 30 of these questions but

888
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,840
they give you the only i'm not very good at math and so i have to i have to do all the

889
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,980
addition basically by hand and they give you a like an eight and a half by eleven transparency

890
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:33,200
thing and an erasable marker oh man yeah but you can't erase it because they don't give

891
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,160
you they give you like a kleenex but they don't really give you like anything they don't give

892
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,320
you an eraser so you didn't wear your best clothes they're not kidding dude i'm like

893
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,000
spitting on the thing because there's no water and i'm like i use up my kleenex in like the

894
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,200
first 30 seconds and then the rest of it like it's all over my arm and i'm trying to find

895
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,440
places that it's just a mess right well that was in stark contrast to doing my red hat

896
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,960
sir which was you sit down at a linux box they give you 25 things to do and you do them

897
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,880
and you restart the computer and if the computer does all of the things then you pass and if

898
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,340
the computer doesn't do all the things and you don't pass it is it's a really straightforward

899
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:08,640
thing so i am looking at my certifications coming up for renewal and one of the big things

900
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,880
i was concerned about was red hat 7 because that's we've made this you know this big change

901
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,520
gone to we've gone from rel6 to rel7 and i have to go sit for this test and so i was

902
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:24,400
a little concerned because things have changed and i know i'm not i'm i know i'm not necessarily

903
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,640
in in the swing because i'm i'm no longer focusing on you know knowing you know when

904
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:34,280
i did the six test i was focusing on learning all the things for six now i'm focusing on

905
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,680
learning all the things i need to do to get my job done well turns out linux academy was

906
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:46,200
able to help me out there i went over to linux academy and signed up for an account by going

907
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,640
to linux academy dot com slash unplugged got a huge discount and actually did all of my

908
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:56,360
rel7 training there so i think that is awesome i feel perfectly confident i have gone i have

909
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,660
done both ways guys i have done it both ways i have paid the like it's like a three thousand

910
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,320
dollar class fee and then you go for a week and there is there is an advantage to that

911
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,340
i won't lie there is an advantage to sitting in a classroom and being surrounded by other

912
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:13,800
people that want to learn linux and spending nine hours a day you know with an hour break

913
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,080
and right it's like a boot camp no yeah no real coffee you know you have some coffee

914
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,880
but it's cold and sometimes smells aren't great as smalls are not great because you're

915
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,440
sitting in front of other it people and it's somebody else's computer and it's their uncomfortable

916
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,000
chair sometimes and they frown upon you bringing your own laptop which means you have to do

917
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,540
things at their pace but there is some advantage to that but the bigger advantage is going

918
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:38,120
to linux academy dot com slash unplugged and signing up for an account it'll cost you

919
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:43,640
pennies on the dollar literally like one one hundredth of the cost about that actually

920
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,800
and then on top of that you decide when you want to train so if i work best between the

921
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,720
hours of like 10 pm and three in the morning that's my like power zone i can get almost

922
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,680
anything done in those hours partly because my phone isn't constantly interrupting me

923
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,480
but also because i'm just i'm the most awake and the most focused right about that period

924
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,240
of time well this academy works great for me with that i curl up in bed i take my laptop

925
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:10,200
i take a course did red hat seven uh also did um python you can learn just a ton of

926
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,000
things on these on these you know e-learning sites and the other thing is and i talked

927
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,400
about this on the linux action show these instructors are not your average these aren't

928
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,720
the guys these aren't the people that are here for money they're not the people that

929
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,840
they needed a job and they couldn't actually administrate linux so they decided to teach

930
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,280
it and you wind up with some of those people sometimes these are people that are genuinely

931
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,600
passionate about linux and teaching other people about linux and i said it on linux

932
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,560
action shall say it again on on on linux unplugged if you're not making seventy thousand dollars

933
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,840
but you understand what is going on in this show then you need a new job and you need

934
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,440
to go over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged sign up for an account show your

935
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,720
support for the linux action show and pick yourself up a new skill get a certification

936
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,680
the red hat certification to take the test is like two hundred dollars to take the class

937
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:04,280
is like three thousand that's a crazy difference it is it is and the and so if you can do the

938
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,420
learning part of it if you can actually pick up the learning over at linux academy for

939
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,560
pennies on the dollar and then go take the test for two hundred bucks you'll wind up

940
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,680
in the same boat that i am in you'd be able to i think if you're if you're one of those

941
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,640
people that are that are working at like a help desk for thirty thirty five thousand dollars a year you could

942
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:25,140
double your income in just a couple of months by going to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

943
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,160
they'll hook you up and a couple of people after saying similar things on the linux action

944
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,960
show have written in and asked me some small business questions and hiring questions by

945
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,720
all means do that go over to jupiter broadcasting dot com click on the contact link and choose

946
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,280
linux unplugged from the drop down menu i'd be more than happy to address any specific

947
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,200
questions of course you can always email me no at jupiter broadcasting dot com i have

948
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,800
some experience in that area and i'm more than happy to share it with you so wes i want

949
01:05:52,800 --> 01:06:00,880
to talk about uh let's see here local wire uh let's see here which which i'm sorry where's

950
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:08,560
the next story i got lost set up uh core on a bun too is that right the local wire one

951
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:17,400
yep okay okay good okay uh local wire dot pl headline set up dot net core on a bun too

952
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,720
and then subtitle microsoft loves linux dot net core 1.0 is here and it's great and it's

953
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,080
a great opportunity to start playing with not only the windows platform not only on

954
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:32,880
the windows platform but also on linux today i will show you how not only to set up dot

955
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,960
net core but how to set up the whole development environment for developing dot net since one

956
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,200
of microsoft's goals was for multi-platform to support let's take a look at how to dot

957
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,880
net core on a bun too why a bun too well it's popular and easy and doesn't work right i

958
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,560
added that uh also microsoft uh used it as a platform for the choice for their bash and

959
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,480
docker support so windows for windows so the decision seemed quite straightforward to me

960
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,400
we'll be working with a bunch of 1404 lts good choice as it's the most widespread version

961
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,860
at this time you can also try out other platforms as i did specifically red hat enterprise

962
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:13,580
yeah which is totally free at developers dot red hat dot com for developers they also support

963
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:19,760
dot net on rel and as part of the dot net foundation quite rock solid backed isn't it

964
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,520
in fact he misses it but i'll inform you that you can actually do the same thing on centos

965
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,040
in fact that's what i totally that's what i would actually recommend because they're

966
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,840
not gonna they're not gonna cut you off rel is really if you got money and you want to

967
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,360
pay for it um i know they offer you really need that support yeah if yeah exactly that's

968
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:42,560
really what you're paying for um i am a big fan of uh i'm a big fan of centos when it's

969
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:50,160
either for me or for personal or even if it is a even if it is a a professional you know

970
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,960
production environment if it's not a large company that doesn't depend on support i'll

971
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,720
oftentimes stick them on centos just because i think it offers you know you get basically

972
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,800
the same thing for less money but you know this is super exciting especially because

973
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,360
it seems like there is a lot of disagreement on exactly what dot net core on linux meant

974
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:17,040
um exactly you know and the big thing was was i have directly been told by people much

975
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:23,220
smarter than me that you could not develop dot net on uh on on linux it had to be done

976
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:28,160
on windows and this specifically says otherwise so i think there's a lot of fud going around

977
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:38,960
no it used to be it used to be true like the dot net core thing is it's pretty much brand

978
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,560
new but like there are certain things you can do in linux there's certain things you

979
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,240
can't just like you can't use visual basic on linux that kind of thing okay i guess i

980
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,920
can i can talk a little bit about this as i've looked into actually using it on linux

981
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,660
because there was a need for a customer that uses windows and i just wanted to make it

982
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:03,240
on linux deploy it i see essentially when it comes down to this is a lot of the things

983
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:08,360
that you would rely on to have your dot net application built and shipped on windows that's

984
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:13,480
kind of the appeal is you wrote it in your linux environment you ship it there it's actually

985
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:19,060
non-existent so the wpf the windows specific stuff it's not available so you can't even

986
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:23,680
call it call it with dummy functions that would allow you to then deploy and test so

987
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,600
you can't really do that develop in environments on linux for dot net are really not curated

988
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,360
so that experience also sucks and it's a language that benefits a lot from all of the existing

989
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,420
code base of the dot net framework but without that it becomes kind of like useless most

990
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,780
of the times you better go with c++ use kit or something like that for making your application

991
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,440
at that point essentially then there's also these others thing that is actually helping

992
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,720
a little bit of its adoption in the linux platform which is everybody has seen what

993
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:58,360
oracle has tried to do with google in terms of apis and copyright so even though google

994
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:03,080
won fair use it was fair use in the google's case doesn't guarantee your case is going

995
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,160
to be fair use and you're a little bit scared of that but let's face it microsoft is also

996
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,720
a proprietary developer company they've had these clothes done for longest time they're

997
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,220
famously to being able to copyright to patent out software so if you're scared about litigation

998
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:22,620
you might not use it so in that sense we already have a curated environment around other languages

999
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:27,440
that provide those features and then you say but at least with dot net i can develop it

1000
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,640
for mobile platform well you have to pay about five thousand dollars to have a zamari account

1001
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,280
which is the only development environment which is based on mono developed i supposed

1002
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,840
to support the iphone and android so then you look at your options around and you say

1003
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,820
just no essentially this is why i think it hasn't been the explosion was intended to

1004
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:54,240
be it's like basically you lack a consistent environment to work on on the platform so

1005
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,200
essentially makes it useless for most people i would claim yeah there are definitely a

1006
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,720
lot of usability limitations i'm just kind of curious because i know there's a lot of

1007
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,680
people who like and they they kind of grew up in like c sharp is very popular some people

1008
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,680
really like f sharp and i wonder for certain like server side things if there are people

1009
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,040
who were kind of bound to windows and were comfortable in those environments and were

1010
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,980
okay with a minimal environment but they still wanted to use the core of those languages

1011
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:23,400
if they could find a find a use case here essentially they lack the tooling to support

1012
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,600
them in their use case they probably could do but they lack the tooling so they don't

1013
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,640
have visual studio as they are used to they had that they probably could do the switch

1014
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,760
but now they still can a mono developer is very good is the best choice you have when

1015
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:44,880
it comes to c sharp in linux but it still mostly sucks honestly sorry point well taken

1016
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:53,240
you know i i guess i'm watching this with interest it is from all angles the world is

1017
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,880
getting to be a smaller place now we're developing for containers rather than targeting specific

1018
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,760
distros i just talked with michael dominic on monday code radio great show you should

1019
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,320
check it out he was talking about how he pushes clients to develop for html5 because they

1020
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,960
can move from device to device and it becomes platform agnostic and now we're looking at

1021
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,200
you know bash coming to windows and we've got passion windows and dot net is on linux

1022
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,300
and it's like it's very confusing it was i i don't know if confusing is the right word

1023
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,340
or if or i guess i shouldn't say the right word wrong word but is not the word i would

1024
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,400
choose but the the it just it seems like the walls are falling down and we're all gonna

1025
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,480
find it we're all gonna look up and realize that we're all standing in the same room with

1026
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,440
the same same things regardless of what operating system we're using that couldn't be exemplified

1027
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:43,880
more sorry go ahead so the same thing will be linux i've already did this prediction

1028
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:49,080
in and unplugged before microsoft will use the linux kernel that's why bash and linux

1029
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:53,880
exist that's why they bottom a lot of android developers android companies basically to

1030
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,960
get the the developers and they will move into having a proprietary desktop on top of

1031
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,400
linux people won't even notice they will just suddenly swiftly change the underneath and

1032
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,600
since every program is already running on linux linux will be what we've seen as the

1033
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:15,080
tron operating system dude do you want to know what i would use it i would use it exactly

1034
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:20,920
i would use it if if tomorrow i tell you what if tomorrow microsoft came out and said you

1035
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,400
know what windows is a terrible you know we have destroyed the windows name we have destroyed

1036
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,120
the windows brand and we are sick of windows and windows 10 is a total failure because

1037
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,340
it sucks just a little bit less than a which sucks just a little bit less than vista which

1038
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,640
suck just a little bit more next be the the the we if if that happened tomorrow and windows

1039
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,440
says okay we're done with windows we're going to do the next thing called microsoft next

1040
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,720
os which is our next version of windows are into the future and stuff like that and basically

1041
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,560
because we have done all of this stuff and we're trying to drag these developers off

1042
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,200
their macs and we're trying to drag them onto windows we have implemented bash and we don't

1043
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,440
want to make there's no point in maintaining the nt kernel anymore because now we could

1044
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,120
just maintain we could just let the linux community which we're already relying on for

1045
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,480
the bash stuff and basically everything at the developer level all that stuff is we're

1046
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,460
pulling that in from the open source community and hey we love linux why not just use the

1047
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,560
linux kernel okay that's all right so here's our new windows version and it's kind of like

1048
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:19,640
windows except it's running a linux kernel and we have the traditional windows desktop

1049
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,880
that you all know and love with the stupid idiotic start menu which by the way we patented

1050
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:29,840
because start is such a unique and signifying word we're going to take that ui and we're

1051
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,920
going to stick it on top of linux and now all you developers don't have a reason to

1052
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,240
go anywhere else oh and by the way because we're microsoft and we basically dominate

1053
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,120
the pc market space everyone will now develop for linux because we have the linux kernel

1054
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,800
if that happened tomorrow i wouldn't when i buy a new computer i wouldn't bother reinstalling

1055
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:52,800
linux i just use what's on there because frankly even if it's a proprietary desktop am i super

1056
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,760
excited about it no but if it saves me the trouble of having to reinstall the operating

1057
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,240
system if i get support from the oem i can run all of my software because all i have

1058
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,040
to do is maybe i install the snap whatever and i can install the snap packages on top

1059
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,920
of the existing abuntu base which is probably what they're basing off of it anyway do i

1060
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,600
really care if it's a proprietary desktop now i can live with that i think that would

1061
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,880
be amazing and i would take i wouldn't take back but i would significantly reduce all

1062
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,160
of the microsoft bashing i've done over the years that would be like that would be like

1063
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,040
noah's dream come true because instantaneously america switches to linux basically overnight

1064
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,160
if that happened and i realize i'm pipe dreaming you know no need to send me an email tell me

1065
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:35,800
how crazy am i what it's not gonna happen a half past since my since my prediction two

1066
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,880
years and a half happened bash on windows happened a linux distribution on the server

1067
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,240
side happened they bought a lot of android companies to smart my words it's only two

1068
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,280
years and a half since my prediction i did a total prediction of five years i said this

1069
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:53,360
in the show i'm saying it again stick to my word do you know how do you know how happy

1070
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,640
i can't i don't know what i will do the show naked i will show up and do the linux action

1071
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,320
show naked if that ever happens i will yes the camera only goes waste up but i'll just

1072
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:07,120
i don't know i don't know what i would do i'd be so happy you wouldn't i just words

1073
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,960
cannot describe i don't know what i do i do something crazy that's how excited i would

1074
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:15,080
it'll never i don't believe it's going to happen i hope so who did that whoever did

1075
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:23,760
that amazing whoever did that should be shot no i i don't think i don't think i i don't

1076
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,960
think i'm i'm really not uh i'm really not i hope you're right i so hope you're right

1077
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,080
i have a hard time buying into it but our next story kind of exemplifies why you might

1078
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:38,240
actually be right turns out you can run i3 on windows so it's not exactly what we're

1079
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,400
just talking about because it's still the empty kernel but we're running an open source

1080
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:49,520
desktop on it wes tell me about this yeah you know this uh brian kettleson here you

1081
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,000
know he he kind of goes out and kind of talks about why you know he feels mac os is slipping

1082
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,480
he really isn't quite comfortable enough on the linux desktop i know you and i would both

1083
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,560
have a lot of things to say there about improvements you know but but for him he really appreciates

1084
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,600
that he deploys to the linux environment server side he appreciates you know the the niceties

1085
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,480
of linux desktop but he also has certain things he needs for windows a lot of people embedded

1086
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,480
in you know larger enterprises they they're hooked on outlook or compatibility with other

1087
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,720
issues uh and again i'm sure we wouldn't say like hey you know you could probably just

1088
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:23,480
virtualize that but uh he explored running i3 natively well semi-natively i guess but

1089
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,720
natively through windows uh he uses i'd seen people you know i've played a little bit with

1090
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,720
the bash shell i know you've played a little bit but i've not played at all with getting

1091
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:37,740
x11 stuff working uh so he uses moba x term and he he was able to set up the the settings

1092
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,080
right uh to have the you know have the x server exported right he configures the ubuntu bash

1093
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,920
setup he runs i3 and he gets it running i i don't know i'm i really want to try it out

1094
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,520
i don't think it would be the solution for me but i can think of a few devs i know that

1095
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,080
you know they they're more comfortable windows or windows what there's default are they're

1096
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,280
playing games i don't know how i feel about it but it's interesting how far we can go

1097
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:02,960
to really have like a mini non-virtualized linux world i think we're definitely making

1098
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,640
progress and i think that we're going in a very good direction and the exciting thing

1099
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,120
about some of this stuff is i don't think any of us would organically trust microsoft's

1100
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:18,000
motives but i think where i get super encouraged and super giddy and super happy is microsoft

1101
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,760
voluntarily or involuntarily is losing control over a large aspect of this for example they

1102
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,940
can choose to implement bash they don't really have a ton of control after that the developers

1103
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:35,720
are going to expect the same environment system inside of bash on windows as they would as

1104
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:41,880
on bash on side of abuntu and as has been exemplified numerous times if that isn't the

1105
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:47,120
case they'll simply log into a vps and do all the work in the vps and it makes it less

1106
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,560
valuable go ahead dar but there could be a reversal because what matters is who sets

1107
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,280
the expectation and who has the most users that's the trend right microsoft had i'm

1108
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,200
not trying to doom the vision i just said that they will transition i'm just trying

1109
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,380
to be transparent here microsoft originally was a company that provided software for other

1110
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:12,960
operating systems they became platform because their apps were the most adopted in those

1111
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,680
systems and they developed an ecosystem that supported development and how do you arrive

1112
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:22,480
at that microsoft started basically from the get-go as an operating system company i mean

1113
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,480
that they're they they competed at the fundamental level by they provided an operating system

1114
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:32,080
to ibm who didn't have a way to function their computers and so when you so when they had

1115
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,800
software software that ran and had to run on their operating system and that was like

1116
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:43,560
that from day one yes and no because one of the the biggest department of microsoft that

1117
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,200
made money was on the one that was selling to apple they were developing software to

1118
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:54,880
apple but but what developers look at is how they can where are the people that are creating

1119
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:00,120
things that users want and they can make money that's why people moved gradually to microsoft

1120
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,920
it's not it's not because apple stopped being a good platform because they saw that this

1121
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,640
company not only was able to develop software had an entire developer friendly ecosystem

1122
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:16,000
something i've criticized uh our our ecosystem a lot for not having which is you go to developers

1123
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:23,240
to uh to mdn on microsoft you go to developers.apple.com we barely have something similar provides

1124
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:28,440
a tool chain that you can know this is how you develop for ubuntu this is only now we're

1125
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:36,640
looking at it yeah the quickest we have that the better and easier to fix but they become

1126
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,220
a company that provides these awesome tools and demonstrates by building tools themselves

1127
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:46,820
acquiring tools themselves now they become attractive the days that standard again the

1128
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:50,800
day that snap uh we were going to do snap i mentioned to a couple different developers

1129
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,580
you might have even been in the room when i had this discussion there was instant throwback

1130
01:20:54,580 --> 01:21:00,000
to or instant pushback and i'm hearing well i don't i don't think this is a good way to

1131
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,400
go about a prescribed tool chain because the great thing about linux is that every distro

1132
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:08,160
has its own way of getting packages in and that that enables us to have much more flexible

1133
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,440
and much more distro aware developers and they're going to dumb all of the software

1134
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,720
down to not take advantage of the environment of all of the environment variables because

1135
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,480
they have to go with the lowest common denominator and i i guess what i'm i guess what i'm getting

1136
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:26,640
at is that yes this is yes universal apps are a great thing yes we don't have some of

1137
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:33,240
the stuff that that is at its core functionality microsoft windows and mac os x but at the

1138
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,960
same time there are a lot of people and the primary users of that operating system that

1139
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:43,200
i think really like those differences and it to some degree this whole universal app

1140
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:51,240
thing is a problem is a is a is a answer to a problem that that only really new people

1141
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,160
to linux really have an issue with i have not had an issue of having to get software

1142
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,800
for my computer in a very long time chris has not had an issue having being able to

1143
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,440
get software in his computer for a very long time now him and i struggle with different

1144
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,360
aspects of that he that is true why so he is going to have so it is a there's a two

1145
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:13,160
it's a two-sided coin though on my side of the coin yes i have to go to a ppa and

1146
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,600
yes sometimes the software packages are are slightly less up-to-date but there are hoops

1147
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,640
but on his side of the coin he can download the latest version of teamviewer but it might

1148
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,720
not run and he can download the latest version of lightworks and it may not run and so the

1149
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:32,240
he's got the he has the software availability but because of the the dynamic nature he can't

1150
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,360
necessarily guarantee that every piece of software works unless of course we're talking

1151
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,400
about you know gnu open source you know all that so if we're the standard yeah right well

1152
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:47,080
okay the standard for somebody who is only using open source apps yes yes true but you

1153
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,440
back away from that and you say well the the standard in the it industry for remote controlling

1154
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,640
somebody's desktop what piece of software can i be almost guaranteed that they're going

1155
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:58,080
to have on their computer that i could log into well teamviewer is a pretty good chance

1156
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,180
that that's going to happen and we don't use that for work i have a i have a different

1157
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:04,720
program and that if we weren't doing it if we weren't going to use it talk about it on

1158
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:10,240
sunday i would talk about it here but totally yeah but but we use it all the time i use

1159
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:15,120
it all the time for personal things where somebody calls in and says hey you know grandma's

1160
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,240
computer doesn't work my mother's computer doesn't work you know those things are excellent

1161
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:25,600
examples of where teamviewer works but you know all the coming full circle i think that

1162
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:30,200
i think that you know that that uh i don't know i we'll just leave it there we'll leave

1163
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:35,280
it there that i i think that there there are are different advantages of how you can get

1164
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:41,640
that software and how you get that stuff to work on so uh anyway uh wes it doesn't work

1165
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:46,160
on linux at all and then you're screwed right yeah well that's for example someone who wants

1166
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:51,880
to get for like as someone who needs something for their jobs and it doesn't work on linux

1167
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,380
at all and they have to go to this workaround of like using a virtual machine or something

1168
01:23:55,380 --> 01:24:03,480
like that so this the solution is more importantly to bringing in things that companies and developers

1169
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:09,800
don't want to mess with this ecosystem that is incredibly convoluted but if someone who's

1170
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,480
already in the ecosystem yeah it doesn't feel that convoluted except for when you look find

1171
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,160
an application you're like cool they release it as a deb but i use fedora so i use rpms

1172
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:23,260
i can't use this deb but they don't make anything other than a deb but what about someone who

1173
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:30,080
uses debian and they provide provided a deb for specifically ubuntu like there is so many

1174
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:36,000
reasons why this is our current ecosystem is not a good idea like as far as the core

1175
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,400
the core operating system it's fantastic but the application layer no yeah so right you're

1176
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:47,440
saying we should all standardize on snaps running on gnu slash k windows i don't yeah

1177
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:54,000
maybe i don't care really i i want the standard application layer i don't care what the distro

1178
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,240
decides as the core fundamental format they want to use but i do care that i can have

1179
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,560
an application that will actually run on my system and that or as a developer that i can

1180
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,760
release an app that i don't have to release four apps for the same distribution based

1181
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:17,200
on the different versions of that distribution or that the fact that i have to release uh

1182
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:23,960
technically 20 packages just to support linux as a whole like that's absurd and if i could

1183
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:29,400
just if i could release a flat pack a snap and an app image and that's it i would be

1184
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,560
happy to do that that is at least 10 times better than what it is right now or the more

1185
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,920
important thing is when they get the developer they get the packages from a repo that the

1186
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:46,000
maintainer decides i'll update it in a year i'll put out that uh let's just have the crazy

1187
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,080
idea what about you treat each distribution as their own operating system and give them

1188
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:59,400
the goddamn freedom to innovate and be different as they wish yeah honestly honestly if people

1189
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:05,440
didn't do different things we wouldn't have the diversity or the benefits we got some

1190
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,840
things got adopted cross-wide they took their time fair enough we'll leave it there guys

1191
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,280
