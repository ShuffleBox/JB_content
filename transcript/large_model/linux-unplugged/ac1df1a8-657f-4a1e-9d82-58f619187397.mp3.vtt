WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
I hope you saved up your Bitcoin, Wes, because Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World

00:04.080 --> 00:09.200
Wide Web, is auctioning off his initial source code as an NFT.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
Of course.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.200
Nice, right?

00:11.200 --> 00:17.480
I mean, 9500 lines of code of basically the original building blocks for the HTTP protocol

00:17.480 --> 00:22.760
and HTML and the Universal Document Identifier, aka the URI.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.200
It's all being bundled up in one nice, expensive package.

00:26.200 --> 00:33.440
Yeah, you also get an animated visualization of the code and a digital quote-unquote poster

00:33.440 --> 00:38.960
that is quote-unquote signed by Berners-Lee via a graphic signature.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.000
There's also, more interestingly to me though, a take-home letter written by Berners-Lee

00:44.000 --> 00:47.760
in which he reflects on the code and its creation.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.120
Okay, okay.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.360
That might actually be a little bit of history right there.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.360
Yeah, no, I'm just totally getting hung up on the whole NFT thing.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
This is wild, what's happening.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.200
I mean, this feels like sacred stuff, but I guess it's kind of cute.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.040
You're getting like a keepsake in a way, a very, very expensive personalized keepsake.

01:04.040 --> 01:09.360
Bidding opens at $1,000 on June 23rd, and the auction will run online until the end

01:09.360 --> 01:10.360
of the month.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.520
So, you know, like I said, get your Bitcoins ready.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.760
It's going to be spendy because it starts at $1,000.

01:17.760 --> 01:28.440
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
My name is Chris.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
My name is Wes.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
Hello, Wes.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.200
I see you're wearing your nostalgia pants today.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.200
Smart move.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.200
I don't know if I mentioned, they're also chaps.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.440
Of course they are, Wes.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.080
You wouldn't go anywhere else.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.040
This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud Guru, the leader alerting for the Cloud

01:45.040 --> 01:46.680
Linux and other modern tech skills.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.760
And of course, there's thousands of hands-on labs.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
Get certified.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.760
Get hired.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.060
Get learning at a cloudguru.com.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.640
Coming up on the show today, we're living up to our episode number.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.400
It was inspired by one of our virtual love members, Colonel, he said, you know, have

02:00.400 --> 02:03.000
you ever looked up what error code 410 is?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.160
Which it basically just means gone.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.640
What you're looking for here is gone.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.920
And that set the theme for today's episode.

02:09.920 --> 02:15.060
We're going to look at great Linux distros that are no longer with us.

02:15.060 --> 02:18.680
The distros that shaped Wes and I into the Linux users we are today.

02:18.680 --> 02:25.000
So put on your nostalgia pants with us and go back in time because it is a wild ride.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.780
I thought when we got into this, this would be mostly be an exercise in checking out old

02:28.780 --> 02:30.800
and busted software.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.280
And some of these pack surprising features.

02:33.280 --> 02:39.660
In fact, one of the distros I checked out from 2004 has features that just recently

02:39.660 --> 02:41.560
landed in Ubuntu.

02:41.560 --> 02:46.120
But first, with the powers vested in me, I declare a retro time appropriate greetings

02:46.120 --> 02:47.120
to our virtual log.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
Hello.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
Hello.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
Hello.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
Hello.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
Hello, everybody.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.960
It is good to see you.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.360
In fact, I'd love to be able to see some of you soon in person.

02:59.360 --> 03:06.120
I don't know if you felt it in the wind.

03:06.120 --> 03:12.640
But a JB road trip approaches an epic road trip of a scale like we've never done before.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.440
A quest for our people to reunite a mini JB team reunion.

03:17.440 --> 03:23.600
It can't yet be the full team, but a mini team reunion is happening in August.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.800
And during this, we'd like to have dinner with you.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.180
So right now, we are making plans for two meetups in the month of August.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.000
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City, August 7.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.080
The second meetup will be in Denver on August 20.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.000
Links to both meetups will be in our show notes.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.940
They are now up on the Jupiter Broadcasting meetup page.

03:43.940 --> 03:48.660
If you are interested in going to either one of these, please consider letting us know

03:48.660 --> 03:54.320
by joining that meetup because, for example, really, if no one really signs up for Salt

03:54.320 --> 03:58.020
Lake City, we probably would just not route to Salt Lake City.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.880
But we have a crowd down there.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.480
And we had promised to return to Salt Lake City because we missed it once in the past.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.180
And there is a pretty big Jupiter Broadcasting crowd down there.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.180
And we're going to try to do it safe.

04:09.180 --> 04:13.020
And we're going to try to meet up again and start connecting with our community.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.560
And we will be hosting an event.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.160
We'll have more details as they come together on the meetup page because it is a bit away.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.640
But we wanted to lock the dates in.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.100
So the first one, Salt Lake City, August 7.

04:23.100 --> 04:27.200
And then the second meeting with meetup will be in Denver on August 20.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.660
And of course, if anything changes, we'll definitely reflect the changes on the meetup

04:31.660 --> 04:32.660
page.

04:32.660 --> 04:33.660
That's the beauty of it.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.560
And we'll keep you guys kind of in the loop via the show, too.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.800
But details and nitty gritties will be on the meetup page.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.920
And I am just elated at the opportunity for members of the team to get back together again.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.760
We have plans for content production, special editions of shows that will be on the road.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.160
All of it's still in the works.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.640
And of course, we're following all the news and safety stuff very closely and trying to

04:55.640 --> 04:57.000
make sure we do the right thing there.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.360
And so all of it's got to remain flexible.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.840
We've learned that over the last year and a half or so, two years.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.640
But that's in the works right now.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.560
And details will be linked up in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 410.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.960
And Wes Payne, are you going to bring the dogs out to Denver or are they going to have

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
to stay home?

05:13.960 --> 05:15.280
Oh, you know, I'll have to think about that.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.960
It might depend on how I get there.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.080
But I'm excited already.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
And you know what?

05:20.080 --> 05:23.400
We're telling you now so you don't have an excuse not to join us if you can.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.600
The first day you and I arrive, so as we have to plan for this schedule wise, we're doing

05:27.600 --> 05:29.280
a Linux unplugged in Denver.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
Oh, boy.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.280
Of course.

05:31.280 --> 05:36.320
You know, that's kind of stressful when I think about it.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.840
But I guess, see, my plan is I'm taking Lady Joops out there.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.420
So I will bring equipment for you and I to record with me.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.680
So you don't have to worry about that.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.680
You gentlemen.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.480
Joops is right now in the shop, getting a bunch of work done to fix like my slide failure

05:51.480 --> 05:55.780
that I had on my last road trip to get her ready for this Colorado trip.

05:55.780 --> 06:01.080
So we're going to leave Washington, go down through Salt Lake City, and then up to Denver.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.860
And I'm going to attempt to get the Lady Joops tracker going again.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.880
So if people want to do a meet up along the way when possible, we'll try to arrange that

06:08.880 --> 06:10.240
as well.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.440
So more details to come.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.080
But I wanted to get it out early while we had it.

06:14.080 --> 06:19.680
Now it's kind of appropriate today that our first community news item features a piece

06:19.680 --> 06:23.880
of software that I have some real nostalgic connection to.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.800
And that is Pidgin.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.540
Pidgin is a chat program that lets you log into accounts on multiple chat networks from

06:30.540 --> 06:31.600
one app.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.200
And it means you can chat with your friends that are on, well, back in my day, it was

06:35.200 --> 06:39.680
AOL Instant Messenger and an IRC at the same time.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.840
And Pidgin, I first started using game.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.080
I moved to Pidgin.

06:44.080 --> 06:49.820
And it is one of those apps that has played a huge role in my use of the Linux desktop.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.920
And today, the primary developer, Gary, help me with your last name.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
Is it?

06:53.920 --> 06:56.120
Well, help me with the last name so I don't embarrass myself.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
It's Kramlich.

06:57.120 --> 07:03.520
Gary Kramlich, also known as Grim Online, joins us to talk about what quite bluntly

07:03.520 --> 07:09.380
is probably one of the more destructive trends that could begin to happen to free software.

07:09.380 --> 07:15.300
And I think is easily one of the worst grifts to ever happen on our community.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.920
And it's horrible.

07:16.920 --> 07:22.560
And Gary, I don't even really know where to begin with this story.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.700
From my perspective, what we have here is something that is probably a trend that's

07:27.700 --> 07:29.080
going to continue and get worse.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.600
Can you explain to everyone the highlights of what's happening to the Pidgin project

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
right now?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
Sure.

07:34.600 --> 07:41.160
So on June 1st, I got a tweet from a follower, or I got a mention on Twitter from a follower

07:41.160 --> 07:48.700
from a company named Zero Diem that posted a bounty for a remote code execution bug in

07:48.700 --> 07:52.880
Pidgin and they were offering up to 100,000 US dollars for it.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.960
We had to do a bunch of research because we didn't really know what Zero Diem was.

07:55.960 --> 08:01.680
And it turns out they're an exploit broker, which the way I like to put it is that they're

08:01.680 --> 08:04.280
basically a digital arms dealer.

08:04.280 --> 08:09.360
So what they do is they put bounties out on open source projects to find bugs in them,

08:09.360 --> 08:13.060
and then they pay people for those exploits, and then they sell those exploits to people

08:13.060 --> 08:14.280
that want to use them.

08:14.280 --> 08:20.280
In this case, their customers are typically governments located in North America and Europe.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.000
That's a disturbing thought.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.360
So they're offering a $100,000 bounty for a zero day exploit on Windows or Linux in

08:27.360 --> 08:38.000
Pidgin, and the extremely sad reality is that $100,000 bug bounty for that one bug is more

08:38.000 --> 08:41.960
than the project was able to raise, I would imagine, in multiple years.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
Yeah, definitely.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.560
For the past two years, I've actually been working on Pidgin full time, and that started

08:46.560 --> 08:50.920
with me going through savings, and I blew through that pretty fast, obviously.

08:50.920 --> 08:57.280
But then last year, I was able to raise $25,000 for the project, and now all one person has

08:57.280 --> 09:01.540
to do is find a bug in my work and they get four times as much money as the entire project

09:01.540 --> 09:02.540
got in a year.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.600
Yeah, and they're not necessarily going to disclose this bug.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.040
In fact, it's not worth the value to them because if they're offering a bounty of 100,000,

09:09.040 --> 09:12.720
they can sell it for more than that, and they're not going to turn around and give you a bug

09:12.720 --> 09:14.600
report on what gets submitted to them.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
They don't want it fixed.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
Right, exactly.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.200
That's one of the huge parts, and the other thing I want to note too is they're not necessarily

09:20.200 --> 09:22.140
stopping at one bug, right?

09:22.140 --> 09:25.360
They're looking for as many as they can because they don't want us to fix it.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.400
Right, they'll take multiple submissions.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
Right, exactly.

09:28.400 --> 09:33.400
So, when we first heard about this, I went through and started running every single static

09:33.400 --> 09:38.800
analysis tool I could, and we pushed out a release in two days to fix tons of stuff that

09:38.800 --> 09:42.880
the scan built as a tool out of Clang, what that found, and stuff like that, but it's

09:42.880 --> 09:47.520
like we're now getting into fuzzing and stuff like that to try to find other issues that

09:47.520 --> 09:50.400
we can fix that aren't as obvious or found by static analysis.

09:50.400 --> 09:55.520
Yeah, but geez, what a cat and mouse game that is, and again, it's not like these things

09:55.520 --> 09:58.800
don't need to be fixed, but at the same time, the project needs to be able to prioritize

09:58.800 --> 10:02.880
what it's working on, and so this, I imagine, is going to consume essentially all of your

10:02.880 --> 10:03.920
development time.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.720
It's not going to do all, but it has consumed a lot of it.

10:07.720 --> 10:12.240
The one benefit is the bounty is only open from June 1st to August 31st, so there is

10:12.240 --> 10:17.040
a light at the end of the tunnel, but that's still three months of development that is

10:17.040 --> 10:19.720
completely messed up because of this.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.920
I think my concern here, if you'll excuse the pun for Pigeon, is you are a canary in

10:23.920 --> 10:28.560
the coal mine, and that this could become a new form of patent trolling on free software

10:28.560 --> 10:31.540
projects that don't have the infrastructure to fight this.

10:31.540 --> 10:38.120
If Zerodium went after a commercial chat program like Slack, Slack at least has lawyers, and

10:38.120 --> 10:42.440
they could issue non-disclosures, they could fight to shut this down, they could make a

10:42.440 --> 10:43.720
big stink.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.840
Free software projects don't have those kinds of resources to fight like that, and so they're

10:47.840 --> 10:54.560
essentially just left to be picked by vultures, and when we go over all of the things in the

10:54.560 --> 10:59.160
history of this show that can lead to free software developer burnout, this just seems

10:59.160 --> 11:02.960
like a big number one at the top of the list if this starts taking off more.

11:02.960 --> 11:08.720
That's a very, very fair point, but I will point out that we are a very interesting open

11:08.720 --> 11:12.480
source project because we have been litigated against in the past.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.000
That's one of the reasons why the name changed, right?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.760
And we do have a non-profit legal entity above us to deal with this stuff, but how do you

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
even start?

11:20.760 --> 11:25.640
They're a private company, they're not necessarily doing anything wrong or illegal, right?

11:25.640 --> 11:26.640
Right.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.440
They don't even have to notify you, you just found out because somebody pings you on Twitter.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.440
Right, exactly.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.960
So is there a legal basis for us to try to stop it?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.920
I don't think so, but again, I'm not a lawyer, right?

11:37.920 --> 11:42.320
And there's no way for you to get them to release the information that they do get.

11:42.320 --> 11:47.320
You just have to hope that in your efforts you discover the same bug and fix it.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.320
Right, exactly.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.960
And you imagine this must be happening at a much wider scale and people aren't just

11:52.960 --> 11:54.760
brazenly talking about it on Twitter.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.360
I mean, Zerodium themselves directly tweeted this.

11:58.360 --> 12:05.040
They have this directly posted on their website at zerodium.com slash temporary.html.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.260
They have it right there publicly.

12:06.260 --> 12:08.000
They're not trying to hide it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.400
Others may not be so overt about it.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.960
This may be a bigger problem than we realize, especially just how brazenly they seem to

12:13.960 --> 12:15.800
be able to operate.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.900
And I'm wondering what's next.

12:17.900 --> 12:22.240
Are you hoping to just hunker down, fix every bug you can, and ride this out until this

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
window closes?

12:23.240 --> 12:26.840
Regardless, as you mentioned, people are going to be doing this stuff all the time.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.800
Our biggest concern is, of course, our users.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.000
There's a lot of people that were joking around like, oh, I know how to fix the problem.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.480
Just release with a zero day and then fix it and claim the bounty.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.240
And fund the project for two years.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.240
Right.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.240
That would be great.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.120
But morally and ethically, I don't think so.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.560
But the other concern is there's so much going on.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.520
Like I said, our biggest concern is making sure our users are safe.

12:51.520 --> 12:56.560
So while the governments or whoever might be targeting a specific person, this puts

12:56.560 --> 12:58.640
every single user at risk.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.360
And we're not going to sit here and let all of our users be at risk.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.360
Yeah.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.480
So Gary, if there's somebody in the audience who feels like they may be in a position to

13:05.480 --> 13:09.940
help you, what's the most efficient way for them to get a hold of you to try to do that?

13:09.940 --> 13:16.720
Being the developer of a universal chat client, I am essentially everywhere and nowhere.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.800
Including the Jupiter Broadcasting IRC chat room.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
Yes, exactly.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
There you go.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.520
And on top of that, I'm also in the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram and Matrix and everywhere

13:24.520 --> 13:26.880
because universal chat clients.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.240
But the easiest way is to find our contact form on Pigeon.im.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.760
You can find a bunch of ways to contact us there.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.760
Okay.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.920
My heart really goes out to you guys because this project, you know, it's a beloved piece

13:36.920 --> 13:39.960
of software and it is such a shame.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.480
It feels like the cheapest, lowest grift possible.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.200
This zero idiom company doesn't even find the exploit themselves.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.460
They pay other people and they sell it as a middleman and then they just devastate free

13:51.460 --> 13:53.640
software projects in their path.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.440
And I appreciate you being willing to come on and talk frankly about all of this.

13:57.440 --> 14:02.080
So that way our audience can be educated about it because there's some that are not able

14:02.080 --> 14:03.960
to talk about it or they're in a different position.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.360
So I hope this goes okay.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.120
And I'd love an update when you have, if you have something that comes up and just want

14:09.120 --> 14:12.040
to ping me and just let me know so I can give the audience an update.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
All right, we'll do.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
Sounds great.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.880
And thank you for the opportunity to talk to everyone.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
Yep.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
Yeah, I am.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.960
I am really sad to hear this.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.960
But thank you.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.800
Thank you for all the hard work and thank you for fighting this.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
No kidding.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.680
Let's see the parts of open source development no one tells you to expect when you get into

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
it.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
Yeah.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
Yeah.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.680
So let's talk about something that's really great to see.

14:30.680 --> 14:35.280
And that is that in Linux 514 when that ships, it will have mainline support for the Raspberry

14:35.280 --> 14:36.280
Pi 400.

14:36.280 --> 14:42.360
Now you recall that is the device that launched in last November as a full Raspberry Pi computer

14:42.360 --> 14:44.640
inside a keyboard.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.840
And I got one and I actually was extremely impressed.

14:47.840 --> 14:52.200
In fact, I think it should be the Raspberry Pi for most people because you just plug in

14:52.200 --> 14:56.360
an HDMI monitor and an Ethernet if you want, you're good to go.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.560
It's a great little device.

14:57.560 --> 15:02.600
And beginning with Linux 514, it looks like everything's just going to play fine right

15:02.600 --> 15:04.560
out of the box with a vanilla kernel.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.560
Yeah.

15:05.560 --> 15:10.880
If you don't recall, the Pi 400 costs around $100 US greenbacks.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.700
But you get a keyboard with a Raspberry Pi built in with four gigs of RAM, a 1.8 gigahertz

15:16.700 --> 15:23.640
quad core Broadcom processor, 16 gigs of storage and crucially, as Chris hinted at there, enough

15:23.640 --> 15:28.580
ports and peripherals to have a fully working computer with just a monitor.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.800
But you're not sacrificing on the Raspberry Pi side.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.080
You're just getting extra.

15:32.080 --> 15:36.280
It feels like a more finished product where the Raspberry Pi feels like a Tinkercad.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.700
And I guess that's a good differentiator, too.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.400
If you want something that's a finished product or the person you're giving it to, maybe they

15:41.400 --> 15:43.600
need something that's more of a finished product.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.560
And everybody that I showed was so impressed that an entire keyboard, a computer was in

15:47.560 --> 15:49.520
the keyboard, like they'd never seen anything like it before.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.640
And I'm like, OK, I guess it's cool.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.640
But they were like, wow.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.920
And I guess now that you're going to have just vanilla 514 support, which means any

15:58.920 --> 16:04.040
distro that uses 514 or later in the future, you can just run on that.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.120
It's nice to see that.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.520
It's kind of a bummer, I guess, that we haven't had it there already since it's been out for

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
a bit.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.520
But it takes a long time for these kernel versions to filter out to people anyways.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.580
Yeah, that is true.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.640
It's a bit strange because it didn't take that much work to get here.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.400
There wasn't a new kernel driver or anything fancy.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.420
I mean, there was some some new device tree additions specifically for the Pi 400.

16:24.420 --> 16:29.480
But that was just some updates to change the clock speed, use a different Wi-Fi chip and

16:29.480 --> 16:33.120
how power handling worked like it's a pretty small update.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
But we've got to know.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.600
Well, we're talking 514.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.000
My favorite file system, XFS, is getting a nice boost.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.840
Feronix Michael Arboman, he covers this stuff like a machine.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.520
He likes XFS almost as much as you do, I think.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.840
Yeah, I think it does.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.840
I think you're right.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.560
I had a big patch series that was sent out by Red Hat is queued for merging in the 514

16:54.560 --> 16:55.560
cycle.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.300
And it's great to see it because there's a lot of scalability improvements in there for

17:00.300 --> 17:04.160
those of us that want to take XFS to bigger and larger things.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.160
Yeah.

17:05.160 --> 17:10.280
How do you like seeing transaction rates go up from around 700k to 1.7 million commits

17:10.280 --> 17:17.320
per second and a reduction in flush operations by two orders of magnitude for metadata heavy

17:17.320 --> 17:18.680
workloads anyway?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.720
You know, Wes, I know how important those flush operations are to you.

17:21.720 --> 17:26.040
I know you got to keep things clean in your file system.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.380
It's complex, difficult to understand and full of tricky stuff.

17:29.380 --> 17:33.920
So that's why I'm really grateful that Larbal went and dug through some of this.

17:33.920 --> 17:39.720
But it looks like we're getting now this into a nice, simple, more usable path.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.820
It's taken a long journey and it has, he's followed it.

17:42.820 --> 17:47.840
It's gotten cleaner and more consistent looking, more compact looking, like faster code and

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
all of that.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.680
So it's getting to a really good spot now.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.480
I think it's a win win win here where we get a shiny new 514 relatively soon, cleaner code

17:56.480 --> 17:58.280
and better performance.

17:58.280 --> 18:05.560
Man, with ButterFS, ZFS and XFS, I actually I could really see a use case for each one

18:05.560 --> 18:09.120
of those in a disk in my system that makes me want to build like the ultimate Linux storage

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
box.

18:10.120 --> 18:14.120
Sorry, not sorry, EXT4.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.720
Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.360
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account and you support this here

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
show.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.880
You make it possible for us to do this here podcast and you get $100 in credit on Linode.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.340
It's a great deal.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.760
Linode is our hosting provider for everything we've built in the last couple of years.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.520
Their infrastructure is solid.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
It's fast.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.920
It's flexible and you can focus on your project, not your infrastructure.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.480
I also encourage your notes if you want to send them in on your experiences of trying

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
out Linode.

18:41.480 --> 18:45.040
A listener wrote in to me just the other day and told me that he did a little head to head

18:45.040 --> 18:50.560
with AWS and Linode and Linode's pulled ahead again in performance like they do.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.120
I love getting those kinds of notes and you get 11 data centers to choose from and every

18:54.120 --> 18:56.440
service level is backed by the best customer service.

18:56.440 --> 19:01.180
So if you get a $5 a month rig or you get some fancy AMD epic CPU thing with all this

19:01.180 --> 19:05.320
storage and CPU and compute, you're going to get really great customer service.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.760
I just spun up a machine and what was it?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.120
Just last episode we talked about file run.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.520
I think it was two episodes ago.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
It was really recent.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, we just spun that thing up.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.200
It's a, how would you describe it Wes?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.340
Like it's got user permissions.

19:18.340 --> 19:20.600
It's a file manager in your web browser.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
Yeah.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.560
You want like a quick web UI to expose and interact with your file system.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.200
All the stuff you might get on a local system, but exposed over the internet.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.720
And it's really straightforward for people to adopt that just need to exchange a few

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
files.

19:32.720 --> 19:38.280
We're helping the elementary OS guys get ready for their EDW that's coming up very soon.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.120
And they needed a way to exchange files with participants.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.880
And so we stood that up on a Linode for them and made it really easy for them to get access

19:44.880 --> 19:45.880
to it.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.560
And we thought about other solutions like file sync solutions and standard SFTP and

19:50.560 --> 19:51.560
things like that.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.760
And this was really the most straightforward for everyone and just got them collaborating

19:54.760 --> 19:55.760
immediately.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.760
And Linode makes it so simple.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.680
I deployed the one click Docker system.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.680
You get a couple of distro options when you do that.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.980
I chose Debian.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.600
So I just went with Debian and I hit the one click deploy.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.300
That got all the base system configured, running Docker, good to go.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.880
And then within a couple of minutes, I grabbed the project's Docker compose file, changed

20:12.880 --> 20:17.200
the variables to meet our, you know, our setup needs and fired it up.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.360
It took less time getting this new Linode file exchange box ready to go than it did

20:21.360 --> 20:23.440
for the DNS to change over.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.780
It's really efficient.

20:24.780 --> 20:28.240
You can get in and get your project up and running in an impressive amount of time.

20:28.240 --> 20:32.400
And you can really get in there because the dashboard makes it possible to get down to

20:32.400 --> 20:36.960
the details if you really want or to keep it simple if that's your preference.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
So go check them out.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.380
Linode's been around since 2003, every step of the way, making Linux on virtual machines

20:42.380 --> 20:43.600
excellent.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.640
They're dedicated to it and the dedication to Linux is baked into the product as well.

20:47.640 --> 20:52.020
And that resonates and that makes me really comfortable recommending them to you guys.

20:52.020 --> 20:57.720
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 in your account and try out

20:57.720 --> 20:59.620
all of the stuff we've been talking about.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.960
Maybe just go learn something for a little bit or experiment with a distro you've never

21:02.960 --> 21:05.840
tried up on some seriously fast hardware.

21:05.840 --> 21:12.280
There's only one way to start and that's at linode.com slash unplugged.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.040
And now a little bit of housekeeping before we move on.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.400
You heard me talking about meetups or anything really that we mentioned on the show.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.560
If you want more details, you can always hit up our telegram.

21:21.560 --> 21:25.020
There's usually somebody from our community that can answer or one of us is in there that

21:25.020 --> 21:26.020
can answer.

21:26.020 --> 21:30.660
You can find that at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram and also your emails.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.800
Keep them coming.

21:31.800 --> 21:36.440
I've been I've been trying to work in a new workflow with emails, so it's a great time

21:36.440 --> 21:37.440
to send them into the show.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.440
I'll just put it that way.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.340
Linux unplugged dot com slash contact to get your emails in here.

21:42.340 --> 21:45.040
And you heard me mention the meetup page.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.540
We should probably give you that URL, too, so you can join us in Salt Lake City or Denver.

21:49.540 --> 21:53.520
That's at meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.180
Really easy, really simple.

21:55.180 --> 22:01.340
You can find all the details over there and we'd love to see you.

22:01.340 --> 22:16.460
And now, Wes, we go back in time to distros of past.

22:16.460 --> 22:22.100
You and I wanted to kind of experience classic Linux in a way that we haven't felt or seen

22:22.100 --> 22:23.440
in a really long time.

22:23.440 --> 22:29.120
And one of the unique opportunities is a lot of this stuff can be found online and you

22:29.120 --> 22:33.300
can get it running either in a VM or on a piece of hardware.

22:33.300 --> 22:37.740
But then several awesome members of our community stepped up and also provided us with some

22:37.740 --> 22:42.580
ISOs that we were having a hard time getting our hands on from their personal archives,

22:42.580 --> 22:43.580
no less.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.580
Yeah, nerds.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.580
It's awesome.

22:45.580 --> 22:50.040
Do you want to start with Ubuntu 606 just as kind of a baseline?

22:50.040 --> 22:53.220
Because that's where our intro music there just came from.

22:53.220 --> 22:56.880
And it was kind of the first Ubuntu while Ubuntu is still around.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.240
We wanted to set this baseline here and then we're going to talk about distros that are

23:00.240 --> 23:01.460
truly long and gone.

23:01.460 --> 23:05.760
Yeah, I was harkening back and trying to remember what was the first Ubuntu that I actually

23:05.760 --> 23:08.580
used seriously, you know, like day to day.

23:08.580 --> 23:13.500
And it must have been 606 LTS Dapper Drake.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.360
And what a release.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.480
As you go through on Wikipedia and you look at some of the, they've got a great series

23:18.480 --> 23:23.180
of collection of screenshots sort of showing Ubuntu's evolution over the years.

23:23.180 --> 23:28.480
And 606 is where it really starts feeling maybe not modern, but something you immediately

23:28.480 --> 23:31.600
recognize as Ubuntu.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.520
And it got a lot of its, you know, things that we now take for granted in there, like

23:35.520 --> 23:39.940
a network manager that was able to easily switch between wired and wireless has that

23:39.940 --> 23:41.300
for modern.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.300
What a luxury, Wes.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.300
What a luxury.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.560
You mean you don't have to do that at the command line anymore?

23:45.560 --> 23:46.920
I know.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.680
It also kind of stood out to me because already by that time, Ubuntu had a reputation for

23:51.680 --> 23:54.040
working well on desktops, right?

23:54.040 --> 23:57.200
It kind of came out and was like, hey, we're making Debian, we're taking that great collection

23:57.200 --> 24:01.320
of packages, we're simplifying it down, we're making it more human so that if you're new

24:01.320 --> 24:04.520
to all this, you don't want to deal with the command line as much.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.000
We've got that option.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.400
But at the launch, Mark Shuttleworth noted that in 606 LTS, they had worked to bring

24:12.400 --> 24:17.020
that same ease of deployment and configuration to the server.

24:17.020 --> 24:22.640
And so I think 606 also sort of marks not the dominance part, but the rise, the start

24:22.640 --> 24:25.280
of rise of Ubuntu starting to take over the server.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.560
Yeah, absolutely.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.720
And at that point, their influence in a way in the rest of the desktop space was positive

24:31.720 --> 24:37.560
because it encouraged distribution makers to slim down the amount of software packages

24:37.560 --> 24:38.660
they were including.

24:38.660 --> 24:43.720
So early on, you'd have three email clients and four web browsers and three terminals

24:43.720 --> 24:47.740
and just crazy because why not have it all, right?

24:47.740 --> 24:50.840
And internet connections were slow and so you didn't want necessarily to force people

24:50.840 --> 24:51.840
to download stuff.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.560
So you just load it right off the CD, you know, have at it.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.560
The CD is there.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.400
You can have four or five CDs, who cares?

24:57.400 --> 25:00.400
And they just loaded distros up and Ubuntu changed that.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.400
They set a different tone.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.360
Yeah, you could get software off the internet if you wanted.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.600
Now, of course, it does still support the CD and that was a retro thing.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.760
I noticed right off the bat as it detected, I still had the ISO in there and was like,

25:10.760 --> 25:14.400
oh, hey, do you want to use that to install some software, which, yeah, I did.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.760
I got a open office early version going, which was pretty nice.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.440
I was also impressed already by the installer.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.120
It still had a lot of the same features that had that map to pick your time zone.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.360
And if anything, it was more pleasant than modern day.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.200
Sure, it couldn't do as much partition wise, but it was so simple.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.400
Mmm, quick, very quick.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.280
All of these old interfaces are very quick.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.640
I'm just gonna say that right up front so that way we don't have to repeat it over and

25:37.640 --> 25:38.640
over again.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.080
They were stupid fast and they were simpler, but they were stupid fast.

25:41.080 --> 25:45.800
OK, now we're going to talk about distros that are no longer with us and that were very

25:45.800 --> 25:46.800
special.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.560
And I have to start on sacred ground.

25:49.560 --> 25:53.080
I know this is a very special distribution to a lot of you.

25:53.080 --> 26:00.480
Stay a while and listen, Mandrake Mandrake was created in 1998 with the goal of making

26:00.480 --> 26:03.780
Linux easier to use for everyone.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.400
Mandrake was my first Linux love.

26:05.400 --> 26:10.000
I dated Red Hat and Debian on and off a couple of times for a while.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.960
I deployed a Debian server here, a Red Hat box there, tried out something every now and

26:15.960 --> 26:21.440
then in the computer lab, but it wasn't really clicking for me in the desktop space.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.260
But with Mandrake, with Mandrake, I fell in love and we moved in together.

26:26.260 --> 26:34.920
Version 10.1 was their last release before this long saga of transformations and transitions.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.240
It required a partly 32 megabytes of memory.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
That's all it needed.

26:39.240 --> 26:44.320
If you wanted some graphical features, they recommended 64 megabytes of RAM.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.720
And Mandrake had a few standout features that other distributions did not have.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.300
And throughout this process, I had an opportunity to try them again.

26:53.300 --> 26:58.480
And they really kind of hold up for most of the some of them are no longer required like

26:58.480 --> 27:02.920
the X11 config stuff, but some of them very much hold up.

27:02.920 --> 27:07.680
And by the way, I will have links in the show notes for a visual tour of Mandrake.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.080
I took screenshots of some of my favorite moments when I was revisiting Mandrake.

27:11.080 --> 27:15.240
And if you're an old Mandrake user like me, you may want to go check it out because I

27:15.240 --> 27:17.620
didn't know what to expect, honestly.

27:17.620 --> 27:18.620
Maybe it was my mood.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.620
I don't know.

27:19.620 --> 27:20.620
I thought I was going to be a little bit disappointed.

27:20.620 --> 27:25.600
I thought I was going to feel a little old and busted, you know, old KDE 3.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.320
It's like playing an old video game or watching an old movie, reading a book you read as a

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
kid.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.120
They never quite hold up the same, right?

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
Yeah, exactly.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.080
Be like watching, you know, favorite old movie that just didn't hold up exactly.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.040
And it was quite the experience.

27:40.040 --> 27:45.240
The moment grub came up on the screen with the with the Mandrake theme immediately felt

27:45.240 --> 27:46.240
nostalgic.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.200
I immediately triggered the feels.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.920
Then the boot splash came up and it immediately triggered the feels.

27:51.920 --> 27:57.140
Every step was like I couldn't believe how wired those moments were in my brain because

27:57.140 --> 27:59.200
I haven't thought about those things.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.120
I haven't pictured those things in years.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.820
And then the moment I saw them, it all just came flooding back.

28:05.820 --> 28:11.880
And so 10.1 was a special, special kind of peak Mandrake, in my opinion.

28:11.880 --> 28:16.840
It had Drac Conf, which was a great way to configure multiple aspects of the system.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.840
I'll talk more about that in a moment.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.440
And it had URPMI.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.200
This was the magic that made me fall in love.

28:24.200 --> 28:31.360
It's a wrapper around the RPM package manager, which back in the day, in the late 90s, early

28:31.360 --> 28:33.520
2000s, RPM was rough.

28:33.520 --> 28:38.160
You had to manually resolve your dependencies, you had to go hunt stuff down.

28:38.160 --> 28:45.200
It was called dependency hell and URPMI solved it, essentially turning RPM into apt.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.220
You could search package repos.

28:47.220 --> 28:52.560
You could update your package list, add new repos, which was just an awesome concept at

28:52.560 --> 28:53.560
the time.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.120
It just did stuff other RPM distros could not do, but maintain compatibility with a

28:58.120 --> 29:00.800
lot of the big RPM distros.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.480
It really also had some of the best theming.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.580
It had just these beautiful blues that still just really pop.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.720
The installer is clean and simple and always was.

29:10.720 --> 29:14.600
I mean, having to configure your X settings is always a bit dodgy.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.600
And it just is a classic experience of Linux.

29:16.600 --> 29:20.240
Like when you boot up, it reads out your BOGO MIPS score and tells you how fast your computer

29:20.240 --> 29:21.360
is in BOGO MIPS.

29:21.360 --> 29:25.960
Which I haven't said BOGO MIPS in years, and it used to be like how we measured everything.

29:25.960 --> 29:30.160
And this thing's packing Linux 2.68.

29:30.160 --> 29:34.020
Your whole system, Wes, will crash if you boot it on a dual core system, but you don't

29:34.020 --> 29:35.600
select the SMP kernel.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.160
Remember when you had to do that?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.160
Of course.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.160
Wow.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.520
I mean, you had to be more familiar with your hardware, that's for sure.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.520
Yeah.

29:43.520 --> 29:47.000
But you know, when it didn't work, when X didn't work, I was able to run dracconf on

29:47.000 --> 29:52.160
the command line, which I got screenshots of this, and configure my X11 settings and

29:52.160 --> 29:53.320
save them.

29:53.320 --> 29:57.400
And then just ran init level five, and my desktop loaded right up, and I was back up

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
and working.

29:58.400 --> 30:03.760
And I have not used dracconf in 100 years, and I was able to fire that thing open and

30:03.760 --> 30:08.380
resolve my ancient Linux problems within a minute.

30:08.380 --> 30:11.080
And I'm just sitting there going, you know what, this tool still holds up.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.960
It's still a good tool.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.980
When you first log into the Mandrake desktop, because this is towards the end of their run,

30:16.980 --> 30:21.080
you get hit with like this long survey that wants to ask you about your Linux experience

30:21.080 --> 30:23.400
so they can try to figure out who you are.

30:23.400 --> 30:28.740
Then you get a pitch to join the Mandrake club, which I was a member of, I will admit.

30:28.740 --> 30:32.480
The Mandrake club is a website that's dedicated to Mandrake users.

30:32.480 --> 30:37.800
They write, signing up for membership brings you exclusive benefits, exclusive access to

30:37.800 --> 30:43.360
forms, exclusive RPMs, product downloads, and discount on Mandrake Linux products and

30:43.360 --> 30:46.040
much more.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.280
And then they pitched the Mandrake online service, which is the latest service provided

30:50.280 --> 30:51.760
by Mandrake soft.

30:51.760 --> 30:56.840
It allows you to keep your computer up to date through centralized automated service.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.040
Yeah, they tried.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.040
They tried.

31:00.040 --> 31:03.320
But KDE 3, you know, it was a classic look back then.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.940
It doesn't quite hold up.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.240
That doesn't look so great.

31:06.240 --> 31:11.020
They had neat things in dracconf, like security audit tools that would check various aspects

31:11.020 --> 31:14.260
of your system to see if they meet standards.

31:14.260 --> 31:18.120
They had backups and restore in dracconf, which it's really nice to have your distribution

31:18.120 --> 31:19.940
solve that back in the day.

31:19.940 --> 31:24.600
They had weird things to like configure your desktop was an entry in the menu bar.

31:24.600 --> 31:30.160
And that opened up KDE 3 system settings, but configure your computer.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.960
So not configure your desktop, but configure your computer would open up the Mandrake Linux

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
control center.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.460
I guess just I guess that makes sense, but only because I understand how Linux desktops

31:39.460 --> 31:40.460
put together.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.100
Otherwise, that would be so confusing.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.760
That's sort of like one of those things at first when you haven't used it in 100 years,

31:44.760 --> 31:47.640
you look at it and you go, which one do I?

31:47.640 --> 31:48.640
Oh, okay.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
Yeah, right.

31:49.640 --> 31:53.700
I'm configuring the entire computer and then you get software update wizards and stuff

31:53.700 --> 31:54.700
like that.

31:54.700 --> 31:58.200
But, you know, when you look back at what it took to get Linux up and running, I can

31:58.200 --> 32:03.160
see why Mandrake with URPMI and dracconf was such a winner.

32:03.160 --> 32:07.480
And when I was talking on social media and on Telegram and whatever, when I was just

32:07.480 --> 32:11.120
mentioning online that we're doing this and asking for ISOs, so many people told me that

32:11.120 --> 32:16.500
Mandrake was their first Linux love and it was nice to visit it and not be disappointed.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.600
I felt like it really was pretty great.

32:18.600 --> 32:23.620
I think the UI looks a little dated, but my next distro was a totally different experience.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.480
But I'd like to hear about your experience with damn small Linux first.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.160
It's so small.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.580
Remember the business card live CD?

32:30.580 --> 32:31.880
That's the whole pitch for that.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
Yeah, really.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.640
Like you can fit this stuff on a 50 megabyte live CD.

32:36.640 --> 32:41.440
Now you have to find yourself a CD ROM drive, so I went virtualized on this one.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.160
But it really is quite impressive.

32:44.160 --> 32:49.680
Now for some history, it had been around for a while, but kind of stopped development in

32:49.680 --> 32:51.800
2012.

32:51.800 --> 32:57.880
So I checked out the latest RC from that just to see what would have the next and last greatest

32:57.880 --> 32:59.960
version of damn small Linux.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.960
What might it be?

33:00.960 --> 33:03.760
And it's kind of interesting because you can tell they've had to keep some of the system

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
intact.

33:04.760 --> 33:10.800
Like it's still shipping a rather ancient kernel for that time, kernel 2.4, maybe.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.420
Maybe it was 2.6.

33:12.420 --> 33:18.100
Either way, quite old, but there were some modern applications like Firefox.

33:18.100 --> 33:23.440
And despite the UI being, I don't know, unique, how would you describe it, Chris?

33:23.440 --> 33:26.160
Oh, man, not even retro.

33:26.160 --> 33:31.360
Like the most bare bones UI you could have that still like functions as a modern paradigm

33:31.360 --> 33:32.840
of a desktop, I think?

33:32.840 --> 33:33.840
Yeah, I think, yeah.

33:33.840 --> 33:38.960
It's it's it's that it is that it is barely that it is something I mean, you can really

33:38.960 --> 33:42.520
tell they were trying to keep that size down, but it's quite functional.

33:42.520 --> 33:47.400
I spent I don't know, most of an evening just trying to get as much done in damn small Linux

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
as I could.

33:48.400 --> 33:53.480
And besides not being able to resolve most websites with SSL because it's just too new

33:53.480 --> 33:59.480
of a version or had to accept on like 1000 security certificates, of course, I was impressed

33:59.480 --> 34:01.360
with just how much I could get done.

34:01.360 --> 34:05.200
I mean, you can install this thing to a hard drive if you want, but you can install software

34:05.200 --> 34:08.520
and get it all configured while it's running in memory, too.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.520
And that still works.

34:09.520 --> 34:15.000
I could go in there, configure settings and install new software still to this day.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.680
And that that really impressed me.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.680
That's a high bar.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.520
Actually, not many of these distros can actually claim that I did do a little bit in the next

34:22.520 --> 34:23.620
one I'm about to talk about.

34:23.620 --> 34:30.080
But damn small is such a fascinating story because it's it was based originally on Knoppix

34:30.080 --> 34:33.880
and then it kind of grew in to have some very cool features like around like you're talking

34:33.880 --> 34:36.640
about software installation and backup and stuff.

34:36.640 --> 34:39.500
It eventually got up to about 128 megabytes in size.

34:39.500 --> 34:45.480
But the idea that kind of was popular for a hot minute back in the, you know, 2010,

34:45.480 --> 34:52.100
2011 days, 2012, was this idea that you had these smaller CDs that you could fit in your

34:52.100 --> 34:56.560
wallet that you would hand out at a convention or a business meeting and you could have a

34:56.560 --> 35:01.160
custom damn small environment on there that would maybe like, you know, boot up and bring

35:01.160 --> 35:04.120
them up to a presentation in a web browser or something like that.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
Right.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.560
Maybe it's got a demo of your software preinstalled.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.560
Who knows?

35:07.560 --> 35:08.560
Yeah.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.680
Oh, and, you know, for a hot minute, maybe.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.840
But then the thumb drive came along and malware just basically scared everybody, everyone

35:14.840 --> 35:16.200
away from.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
That's just it.

35:17.200 --> 35:22.840
I do think it's kind of an interesting era, though, to where you could make Linux small.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.260
You know, I'm sure that stood out to you trying some of these things, too, is just like, OK,

35:26.260 --> 35:28.200
they don't take that much space on disk.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.540
It's great and it's refreshing.

35:29.540 --> 35:34.000
But damn small took that to the next level and I think is from an era where that was

35:34.000 --> 35:39.380
more possible than maybe it is today, at least with the sort of experience we might expect.

35:39.380 --> 35:42.620
So how was the nostalgia factor for that one for you?

35:42.620 --> 35:47.720
Did it hit you in the feels or was it just sort of like kind of like a science experiment?

35:47.720 --> 35:49.400
That seems to be kind of the way these can go.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.840
Yeah, it was a little bit more of a science experiment.

35:51.840 --> 35:56.960
I mean, I definitely did have experience with damn small Linux back in the day, but it was

35:56.960 --> 36:00.760
even back then it felt more like a science experience and it wasn't quite one that I

36:00.760 --> 36:03.980
would use day to day, despite being impressed with a lot of the tech stuff that they've

36:03.980 --> 36:04.980
packed in there.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.200
And yeah, the extensibility is really nice.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.460
That was something they planned in.

36:08.460 --> 36:14.280
They have a whole my damn small Linux program to get things going.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.280
It's impressive.

36:15.280 --> 36:20.160
But ultimately, no, I think if I had to pick, I'd stick on Ubuntu 6.06 for now.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.520
Well, then we go back.

36:22.520 --> 36:28.120
We go way, way back.

36:28.120 --> 36:35.540
I'd like to talk about a distro that was instrumental in me professionally using Linux.

36:35.540 --> 36:38.240
And it was a distribution that was purpose built.

36:38.240 --> 36:43.080
It was a commercial distribution that sometimes cost as much as $100 that you would buy in

36:43.080 --> 36:49.880
a box and then you would install it on your machine and you would input a serial code

36:49.880 --> 36:53.000
into a Linux distro to install it and activate it.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
It wasn't quite activated like Windows activation back in the day, but they were very serious

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
about it.

36:58.000 --> 37:07.200
And it was called Xandros and each edition of Xandros I bought one, two, 3.0 in really

37:07.200 --> 37:12.800
kind of just desperation to get compatibility with a Windows network.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.600
One of the reasons they charged for Xandros was because they included crossover office,

37:17.600 --> 37:20.680
which allowed you to run Windows applications.

37:20.680 --> 37:25.400
And they wired it up such that when you put the office installer into your CD-ROM and

37:25.400 --> 37:30.740
you pop that disc into your box, it would actually execute the auto run on that CD and

37:30.740 --> 37:34.840
begin the setup process exactly like if you would put it on a Windows machine.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.480
Because back in the day, you'd put these CD-ROMs in there, they'd auto run the installer for

37:38.480 --> 37:39.480
you.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.480
Yeah.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.780
That lovely experience was recreated on Xandros with Windows software.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.400
That's the level they were trying to get to with compatibility.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.600
They then later on, and reasons why I continued to purchase it, added features like authenticating

37:50.600 --> 37:57.760
to active directory domains, using PPTP to connect to VPNs on a Windows network, supporting

37:57.760 --> 38:03.200
browsing a Windows file network right there in the browser, in the file browser.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.920
It was a pretty good product and it actually delivered.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.980
So version three that I checked out for this was released in 2004.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.880
This is the last version that Xandros ever released and it's the last version I ever

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
used.

38:14.880 --> 38:19.600
Xandros 3 was last updated in 2005 and the version I ran was somewhere right there in

38:19.600 --> 38:20.720
the middle.

38:20.720 --> 38:25.480
There's the business edition and there's all these different kinds, but it was really onto

38:25.480 --> 38:26.480
something.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.240
I have to say, 2004 never looked so damn fresh.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.120
I was very impressed.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
I'm not joking.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.880
It installed fast and very easy.

38:35.880 --> 38:42.040
The graphical boot splash is clean, but still shows the text output of your boot in a really

38:42.040 --> 38:47.240
elegant way that I think actually looks better than most boot splashes I see today.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
Ouch.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.240
It is really good.

38:49.240 --> 38:55.440
It ships with Mozilla 1.7.3, so pre-Firefox, and that means it also ships with Mozilla

38:55.440 --> 39:00.960
Mail, so pre-Thunderbird, and they look surprisingly still the same, at least the Thunderbird one

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
does.

39:01.960 --> 39:07.800
It had kernel 2.6.9 and it was rocking KDE 3.3.0.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.880
I was able to get that sucker on the network.

39:09.880 --> 39:15.760
I was able to download files off of the internet and browse the local LAN and actually just

39:15.760 --> 39:18.260
kind of sit back and get some work done for a bit.

39:18.260 --> 39:21.840
It's laid out in a really intelligent way that I immediately was able to pick up and

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
keep using.

39:22.840 --> 39:30.200
It is very much if a group of people focused on just making a viable Windows alternative

39:30.200 --> 39:35.520
for the business market that looked and operates a lot like Windows, including when I logged

39:35.520 --> 39:40.280
in in the morning, I logged in with my Windows NT or Active Directory credentials into my

39:40.280 --> 39:42.120
Xandros desktop.

39:42.120 --> 39:46.360
That level of integration meant that I could then log in and I could launch Outlook, not

39:46.360 --> 39:50.880
Evolution, Outlook, which meant I could do everything my coworkers who were all using

39:50.880 --> 39:52.960
the exchange system could.

39:52.960 --> 39:57.360
Being able to do that and being able to show my boss, because they were very skeptical

39:57.360 --> 40:02.560
of Linux back then because of SCO, and they totally bought into all the SCO hype because

40:02.560 --> 40:07.200
they were a bank, so they were totally afraid of all of the IP stuff, but I was able to

40:07.200 --> 40:11.280
show my boss Xandros as a company, here's the box set that I buy, this is all what they

40:11.280 --> 40:13.720
focus on, and they bought off on it.

40:13.720 --> 40:18.580
They allowed the exception for me to run Linux on my daily driver at work, and that was when

40:18.580 --> 40:24.760
I was freed from Windows back in 2004 in the workplace, and it changed my life.

40:24.760 --> 40:29.700
I was willing to pay $100 a year if it meant I got a new version of Xandros with improved

40:29.700 --> 40:31.320
Windows compatibility.

40:31.320 --> 40:37.560
It had a very special spot for me because it enabled me to go full time.

40:37.560 --> 40:42.620
I could run Linux at home, and I didn't run Xandros at home, I ran Mandrake at home, Mandrake

40:42.620 --> 40:47.640
or Gentoo, and then at work I would run Xandros, which was based on Debian, so I had access

40:47.640 --> 40:50.300
to deb files and I could do apt.

40:50.300 --> 40:54.500
They actually had a pretty good software store where they were selling software and also

40:54.500 --> 40:59.440
had free software available in a software center that they made right there on the desktop

40:59.440 --> 41:02.840
and it was just their own custom app and it worked really well, and the whole package

41:02.840 --> 41:08.740
came together in a way with their own custom theming on top of KDE 3 that I would absolutely

41:08.740 --> 41:14.000
say that that Xandros 3.0 UI holds up today for people who like the traditional desktop

41:14.000 --> 41:16.320
setup for XFCE types.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
It's really clean.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.320
I would use that.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.960
You could see a version of Monte that was laid out that way, right?

41:22.960 --> 41:27.040
Yeah, absolutely, and they've done small little tweaks to make it really easy to use.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.800
I'll put the, again, I have a link to the gallery of some of the screenshots I took

41:30.800 --> 41:33.840
that got my nostalgia feels going.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.280
It never really survived.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.400
I don't think they could make it.

41:36.400 --> 41:42.320
I don't think they could make enough money, and now here we are in the future and Fedora

41:42.320 --> 41:47.080
and Ubuntu and other distributions like SUSE have built in Active Directory support.

41:47.080 --> 41:52.440
In fact, that was one of the reasons we eventually transitioned to SUSE Enterprise Linux in that

41:52.440 --> 41:58.560
environment was because of YAS built in Active Directory support for joining or being a domain

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
controller.

41:59.560 --> 42:03.600
And Xandros was sort of the proof of concept to the executives that a Linux distribution

42:03.600 --> 42:04.600
could do it.

42:04.600 --> 42:09.080
And I have even NTFS file permissions would show up in my file browser when I was looking

42:09.080 --> 42:13.840
at permissions on files, and I was showing this to my boss, and that gave him the confidence

42:13.840 --> 42:16.940
to say, well, okay, if Xandros can do it, then maybe these SUSE guys are onto something

42:16.940 --> 42:19.280
with this YAS, and they moved ahead.

42:19.280 --> 42:25.160
And for a long time, we deployed SUSE Enterprise, simply because Xandros proved the use case

42:25.160 --> 42:27.100
and that was a big deal.

42:27.100 --> 42:29.400
So we can blame Xandros for SUSE.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.800
Okay, got it.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.000
I think so, Wes.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.560
I think that's exactly what the takeaway is from there.

42:35.560 --> 42:41.040
Now, you had a chance to play with a distribution that was also an old favorite of mine.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.040
Yeah, Backtrack.

42:42.040 --> 42:47.360
You know, it just stood out to me because, I don't know, Kali gets talked about a lot,

42:47.360 --> 42:50.840
maybe just because people tell new users not to use it.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.160
But Wi-Fi was still kind of new when I was early days in Linux, you know, it was an exciting

42:55.160 --> 42:59.240
new development, just sort of getting it really deployed, at least at, you know, the nerdy

42:59.240 --> 43:01.400
friends houses anyway.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.280
And naturally, Linux was an avenue where I could go explore and play with that kind of

43:05.280 --> 43:06.280
stuff.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.360
And at the time, Backtrack was hot.

43:08.360 --> 43:15.800
It was first released back in May 2006, and lasted all the way until August of 2012, which

43:15.800 --> 43:20.080
there was a lot of changes in that time period over Linux, but Backtrack was useful, I think,

43:20.080 --> 43:21.080
throughout most of it.

43:21.080 --> 43:25.200
Yeah, and it eventually emerged into what is now Kali Linux, so essentially does live

43:25.200 --> 43:26.200
on.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.640
But Backtrack, it was a little different.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
It felt a little different.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
Yeah, it did.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.920
I got it going just to test it out on a quick shell and it had a very nice sort of graphical

43:33.920 --> 43:36.640
environment that just presented a terminal to you.

43:36.640 --> 43:40.160
It was framed around in a nice image, it had a little poll quote there at the bottom and

43:40.160 --> 43:43.720
then otherwise let you get straight to business running Aircrack NG, say.

43:43.720 --> 43:48.120
Or Nessus, in my case, or Metasploit, yeah.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.320
I actually used Backtrack to make money.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.240
I was really grateful for the project.

43:53.240 --> 43:59.880
I had paid clients and Backtrack was one of the tools, and one of my favorite things to

43:59.880 --> 44:04.800
do was to use Backtrack to come in and pop someone's FTP server and leave a little file

44:04.800 --> 44:05.800
on there that said, gotcha.

44:05.800 --> 44:06.800
Oh, dear.

44:06.800 --> 44:11.520
Yeah, it was great because it just shocks the client into like, oh, this is something

44:11.520 --> 44:16.320
we need to take seriously and it immediately changed the conversation into this is instead

44:16.320 --> 44:19.840
of a waste of my money and time into this is something we need to address.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.880
I'd bring Backtrack in, I'd bring a couple of laptops in, actually, because I had to

44:22.880 --> 44:25.360
have a Windows box with me too for some of the stuff.

44:25.360 --> 44:29.400
I'd have a couple of laptops, I'd have my own network connection and Backtrack running

44:29.400 --> 44:31.440
on one of them.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.520
It was just such a great tool.

44:32.520 --> 44:37.160
Now, of course, Kali Linux still totally fills that role, but Backtrack was where I got my

44:37.160 --> 44:38.160
start.

44:38.160 --> 44:39.160
Yeah.

44:39.160 --> 44:43.840
It was before I had tuned in really to the sort of philosophical side of free software

44:43.840 --> 44:44.840
that came a little later.

44:44.840 --> 44:48.100
And it was before I had really decided, you know, I still had fun playing with Windows

44:48.100 --> 44:49.560
and I was gaming more at that time.

44:49.560 --> 44:54.120
So I wasn't necessarily all in on the Linux desktop, but Backtrack kind of cemented in

44:54.120 --> 44:56.840
my mind that Linux was useful for more things than that.

44:56.840 --> 45:01.480
And here was this like very flexible, powerful sort of computer sciency tool that I could

45:01.480 --> 45:02.840
have access to for free.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.440
And that's still exciting.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.440
Now will you allow for one more?

45:06.440 --> 45:07.440
Okay.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.600
I feel like there's so many we could talk about.

45:09.600 --> 45:13.400
And if anybody has some suggestions that they want to send in the contact page, we'd consider

45:13.400 --> 45:15.600
another round of this at some point in the future.

45:15.600 --> 45:22.380
But I feel like I should mention Red Hat 9, not Red Hat Enterprise 9, which is what you'll

45:22.380 --> 45:24.140
find if you search for Red Hat 9.

45:24.140 --> 45:28.360
But I'm talking about Red Hat 9, the old Red Hat.

45:28.360 --> 45:32.100
And I again have a album linked in the show notes.

45:32.100 --> 45:38.080
But this is the Red Hat before they went to Fedora, before they went all enterprise.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.160
Red Hat used to actually ship a desktop Linux.

45:41.160 --> 45:47.320
And classic Red Hat desktop started in 1995 and it got all the way to version 9.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.260
So this was the last.

45:49.260 --> 45:56.840
And it was released in March of 2003 with kernel 2.4.20 and GNOME 2.2.

45:56.840 --> 46:02.840
In 2003, Red Hat discontinued Red Hat Linux in favor of Red Hat Linux Enterprise Edition.

46:02.840 --> 46:07.080
And Red Hat Linux 9 was supported for a while.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.760
It's kind of this interesting story.

46:08.760 --> 46:15.040
While it was officially end of life in April 2004, there was a Fedora legacy project that

46:15.040 --> 46:19.880
kept patches going for Red Hat 9 until 2007.

46:19.880 --> 46:24.060
So Red Hat 9 kind of became an infamous release because it was the last.

46:24.060 --> 46:28.020
And then the legacy ports project kept it going for many, many years.

46:28.020 --> 46:32.740
And then it technically stuck around for even longer because it was also the base for Red

46:32.740 --> 46:34.040
Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

46:34.040 --> 46:38.640
Ah, so the CentOS stuff we're going through now, well, we've all done this before.

46:38.640 --> 46:42.880
Yeah, there is like a lot of echoes of history here.

46:42.880 --> 46:47.840
And this distribution itself is sort of infamous for a lot of us old time Linux users because

46:47.840 --> 46:49.520
it's the one.

46:49.520 --> 46:53.440
And the one I tried out was Red Hat 9a Magazine Edition.

46:53.440 --> 46:59.200
This was a thing we used to do back in the day with the CDs, with the magazine and stuff.

46:59.200 --> 47:04.080
And distros would make a magazine edition and do a little bit of branding in there.

47:04.080 --> 47:09.120
And so that part of it, all of that real early part of the startup feels really old school.

47:09.120 --> 47:13.220
But once the graphical install starts up, it's kind of nice.

47:13.220 --> 47:17.420
And I forgot how common it was with these old distros to like prompt you for what type

47:17.420 --> 47:22.320
of install, a personal desktop, which is perfect for computers and laptops at home, or is it

47:22.320 --> 47:26.720
a workstation, a graphical desktop with development and admin tools?

47:26.720 --> 47:30.320
Or would you like to set up a server that has an optional graphical environment and

47:30.320 --> 47:32.540
a few common server services?

47:32.540 --> 47:34.040
Or would you like something custom?

47:34.040 --> 47:37.720
Which is almost always the, I almost just always chose custom anyways.

47:37.720 --> 47:41.560
And like Mandrake, Red Hat asked some basic security questions in their installers that

47:41.560 --> 47:46.540
they no longer ask, like settings for your firewall, what ports you want open, what basic

47:46.540 --> 47:48.720
level of paranoia you want.

47:48.720 --> 47:52.820
And then at the end of the Red Hat 9 install, when everything is all like all the packages

47:52.820 --> 47:57.680
are copied to the file system, you're asked some basic X config options.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.000
Again, always feels like a roll of the dice.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.040
But by this point, I knew how to get that working.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.260
So it was really no problem.

48:03.260 --> 48:05.120
You didn't break your virtualized monitor?

48:05.120 --> 48:06.920
No, you know, that used to be a thing.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.840
But this time I had it down.

48:08.840 --> 48:13.040
And so I reboot, it boots up into X, I get a first time welcome screen that walks me

48:13.040 --> 48:16.320
through a new user setup, much like we get today.

48:16.320 --> 48:19.220
And it asked me if I want to register with the Red Hat network, which is how you got

48:19.220 --> 48:24.640
updates back then, which it does not register with the network, it fails to do so.

48:24.640 --> 48:29.000
And their codec story is rough back then, especially compared to Mandrake and Xandros

48:29.000 --> 48:33.760
trying to play an mp3 file or something like that is such a joke.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.040
It's real bad.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.320
There's just a lot of problems because the copyright and patent situation was really

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
risky back then.

48:39.320 --> 48:42.000
And so Red Hat really played it safe.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.200
And things like support for NTFS and all of that just was not in there.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.860
You had to go figure that out on your own after the case.

48:48.860 --> 48:54.280
But besides that stuff, which ironically seems like less of an issue today, it holds up.

48:54.280 --> 48:58.880
I think out of all of the distros I looked at, Red Hat 9 has probably the most iconic

48:58.880 --> 49:00.880
classic look.

49:00.880 --> 49:03.280
Version 9 uses the blue curve theme.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.160
And it's kind of an iconic theme.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.160
It holds up.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.160
It's clean.

49:07.160 --> 49:11.000
I bet you there are folks out there that are listening to this podcast and their desktop

49:11.000 --> 49:13.760
looks exactly like this desktop still.

49:13.760 --> 49:17.760
It's just that kind of iconic classic desktop.

49:17.760 --> 49:21.160
It's fun because the other distros I tried were all KDE based.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.480
And Red Hat was Gnome based.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.240
And I really liked those other distro desktops.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.200
But this one, there's something that just felt really clean.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.240
The fonts looked really good.

49:31.240 --> 49:35.640
And it just really felt polished in a way that the others don't.

49:35.640 --> 49:40.560
And some of that is still the same vibe I get off the door today, which is wild to see

49:40.560 --> 49:41.560
it today.

49:41.560 --> 49:46.680
To still be able to connect with that same vibe from something that was released, what

49:46.680 --> 49:49.400
was it, back in 2003.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.280
Red Hat 9 was remarkable in that way.

49:52.280 --> 49:56.160
It really made for a great long term desktop for a lot of people because of that Fedora

49:56.160 --> 49:59.760
legacy ports and then because of RHEL 3.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.260
And so it was that special transition.

50:02.260 --> 50:07.000
And I wouldn't have it any other way than we do now because current distributions obviously

50:07.000 --> 50:12.280
blow all this stuff away and where the Fedora project at, it's just great right now.

50:12.280 --> 50:17.200
But it was so much fun to revisit this and find that it was really quite competent.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.500
It's not a joke.

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
It's not a grind.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.240
It wasn't old and busted.

50:21.240 --> 50:26.360
I think it shows how much, both how not far we've come in the sense that not really that

50:26.360 --> 50:30.000
much has changed in the computing industry, but I think it also shows how much work it

50:30.000 --> 50:31.680
has taken to get where we are today.

50:31.680 --> 50:34.040
I mean, a lot of work has happened.

50:34.040 --> 50:37.460
It's a little unsettling that what do we have to show for it is shiny your desktops.

50:37.460 --> 50:41.840
But I think that hides a lot of the real, you know, the power, the hardware we take

50:41.840 --> 50:48.680
advantage of now and just how much more consistent and reliable everything is.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.300
Thank you to our core contributors.

50:50.300 --> 50:54.360
This episode, the last episode and the next episode have all been down one sponsor.

50:54.360 --> 50:58.360
So that's three weeks without a potential sponsor that we could have sold in this spot

50:58.360 --> 51:02.540
right now where I'm talking, but we're going to get by and we're going to get by thanks

51:02.540 --> 51:03.540
to our members.

51:03.540 --> 51:04.540
We could use more support.

51:04.540 --> 51:08.360
I mean, I do dream of a day where we just eliminate the sponsor spot right here on the

51:08.360 --> 51:11.640
show and it's entirely financed by our core contributors.

51:11.640 --> 51:16.080
Uh, but so since we're in a tight spot and we're short on sponsors this month, if you'd

51:16.080 --> 51:20.180
like to join and support our core contributors, I am making a summer promo code available.

51:20.180 --> 51:24.240
The promo code is summer simple.

51:24.240 --> 51:28.700
You'll take $1 off the membership cost for the lifetime of your membership.

51:28.700 --> 51:29.700
So that really adds up.

51:29.700 --> 51:32.760
It's still, still supports the show and gives you a great deal for the lifetime of your

51:32.760 --> 51:33.760
membership.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.520
You get access to the limited ad feed or the full live stream bootleg, just like all the

51:37.520 --> 51:38.520
members do.

51:38.520 --> 51:43.420
You get discount codes for selected Jupiter garage items and you help the show stay on

51:43.420 --> 51:45.200
the air and independent.

51:45.200 --> 51:49.440
We'll have a direct link to the summer deal in the show notes, or you can just go to our

51:49.440 --> 51:55.760
core contributor website and, uh, sign up right there, which is at unplugged core.com

51:55.760 --> 51:57.560
and use the promo code summer.

51:57.560 --> 52:00.480
And thank you for your support and thank you to our members for making it possible for

52:00.480 --> 52:03.360
us to do this here show unplugged core.com.

52:03.360 --> 52:07.840
Keep the show on the air.

52:07.840 --> 52:12.120
Well let's reach into the mailbag for some feedback.

52:12.120 --> 52:19.800
Cool Jimmy writes in, I've been running TLP on my T480 since I got it two plus years ago

52:19.800 --> 52:28.160
with a start charge at 50% and a stop at 80% I have the internal battery at 97.8% and external

52:28.160 --> 52:32.840
battery at 98.4% capacity respectively.

52:32.840 --> 52:33.840
Hey congrats.

52:33.840 --> 52:34.840
Cool Jimmy.

52:34.840 --> 52:35.840
That is really good.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.880
And you know, Wes, I think one of the reasons we've been talking about managing your battery

52:38.880 --> 52:42.400
like this is because once the damage is done, it's kind of too late.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.600
Like you got to kind of solve it ahead of time.

52:44.600 --> 52:49.320
So for those of you that don't recall, TLP is a really feature rich command line utility

52:49.320 --> 52:50.320
for Linux.

52:50.320 --> 52:55.280
It helps you manage power and like you'd expect with Linux, it's super customizable.

52:55.280 --> 53:00.560
It really lets you go all in and I've been trying it on my ThinkPad since before my trip

53:00.560 --> 53:04.520
to Montana and well, I had mixed results.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.080
Zach writes in, he says, I just heard the latest episode about TLP and wanted to comment

53:08.080 --> 53:13.680
that there are commands to temporarily disable the charging thresholds.

53:13.680 --> 53:19.160
So I manually set charging thresholds in my TLP config, much like our previous writer

53:19.160 --> 53:20.160
did.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.160
Right.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
But you don't have to like go modify that every time just to adjust it, right?

53:23.160 --> 53:27.440
No, and I guess I should have realized that it was in the docs and I missed it.

53:27.440 --> 53:30.880
But thankfully, Zach writes and he says there's a command to temporarily set different charge

53:30.880 --> 53:33.480
thresholds without having to modify your config file.

53:33.480 --> 53:39.840
You do pseudo TLP full charge and that just tells TLP to allow your system to charge all

53:39.840 --> 53:41.240
the way up to full one time.

53:41.240 --> 53:47.040
You can also do things like pseudo TLP set charge to 70 or you can do things like set

53:47.040 --> 53:50.500
to like, you know, 50 percent or totally drain the batteries.

53:50.500 --> 53:55.600
There's another option, there's also a recalibrate option to bring it down and up, which is really

53:55.600 --> 53:56.600
nice to see.

53:56.600 --> 54:00.500
So thank you to Cool Jimmy and Zach for sending those in.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.520
My usage of TLP hasn't gone perfect.

54:02.520 --> 54:07.040
A couple of times it did bite me on my trip to Montana because I would plug my laptop

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
in.

54:08.040 --> 54:12.880
I had it set to, you know, not charged past, I think, 60 percent and then I would unplug

54:12.880 --> 54:16.480
it, set aside for a day and then go open it up right when I really need it.

54:16.480 --> 54:20.800
And I'd only have like 30 percent battery and I wouldn't be able to get my work done.

54:20.800 --> 54:24.200
So a TLP charge, that changed my game, though, and that helped a lot.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.240
But the other thing about TLP that you have to be careful with is I may have overdone

54:28.240 --> 54:30.420
it a little bit when it came to the CPU scaling.

54:30.420 --> 54:32.900
I think the performance impact is noticeable.

54:32.900 --> 54:37.940
There wasn't a lot of headroom for performance loss to begin with, with my X1 Carbon.

54:37.940 --> 54:43.720
And so when I then slowed down the cores and turned off turbo boost and stuff like that,

54:43.720 --> 54:48.680
I sort of robbed myself of really any kind of performance that was getting me by.

54:48.680 --> 54:52.380
And so I felt it more than I was hoping I would.

54:52.380 --> 54:55.960
So instead what I'm considering is adopting a new tool that I think you guys would be

54:55.960 --> 54:56.960
interested in.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.660
Oh, new tool, huh?

54:58.660 --> 55:01.000
New tool, Wes, new tool.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.060
And it's called Auto CPU Freq.

55:03.060 --> 55:04.680
It's a frequency, right?

55:04.680 --> 55:11.080
It's an automatic CPU scaler based on your battery state, CPU usage, the temperature

55:11.080 --> 55:16.480
of your system, your system load, kind of looks at all of that stuff sort of similar

55:16.480 --> 55:21.540
to the way Mac OS does and rescales things on demand.

55:21.540 --> 55:26.920
It can work in place of TLP or it can work with TLP, which is how I'm using it right

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
now.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.100
And I definitely have seen an increase in battery life.

55:30.100 --> 55:33.900
But what I'd really like to try is a setup where I don't have TLP installed, I don't

55:33.900 --> 55:38.800
have to bother with it, but I do have the automatic CPU frequency installed.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.480
So I have links to that in the show notes.

55:40.480 --> 55:41.480
Yeah.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
See if that's enough to get you by, huh?

55:42.480 --> 55:43.480
Yeah, I'm hoping.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.800
I'm hoping without the performance hit because it scales a little bit faster, it's a little

55:46.800 --> 55:47.800
more dynamic.

55:47.800 --> 55:51.680
And you can, when you're running it, you can put it in a mode where you're getting a report

55:51.680 --> 55:55.580
and where it's watching your system and it'll give you information about your CPU cores

55:55.580 --> 55:59.920
and if turbo boost is enabled or disabled and it will dynamically enable and disable

55:59.920 --> 56:02.120
features that you need or don't need.

56:02.120 --> 56:06.200
And so when you're not pushing your system very much, it'll clock the cores down, it'll

56:06.200 --> 56:09.580
turn off turbo boost, and it'll let your laptop sit power.

56:09.580 --> 56:14.280
But then when you launch something that needs horsepower, it immediately turns turbo boost

56:14.280 --> 56:17.000
back on, it clocks things back up.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.580
It's really dynamic like that.

56:18.580 --> 56:19.580
This looks great.

56:19.580 --> 56:22.200
I'm definitely giving it a try.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.920
Well we have a retro pick for everyone before we go today.

56:24.920 --> 56:30.320
Wes found a way for you all to get your hands on WordPerfect on Linux.

56:30.320 --> 56:33.180
Well really, there's a lot of ways.

56:33.180 --> 56:39.000
This is a great article over on LiveJournal from Liam on Linux, and it just struck me

56:39.000 --> 56:43.840
as a perfect retro pick for our retro episode because I don't know about you, Chris, but

56:43.840 --> 56:49.200
WordPerfect was really my first word processor on DOS, no less, and it kind of introduced

56:49.200 --> 56:51.360
me to the whole concept of word processing.

56:51.360 --> 56:56.280
On the pre-pre-show today, we were watching a Computer Chronicles where WordPerfect was

56:56.280 --> 57:00.880
talked about as just like this total dominant force in the global software marketplace.

57:00.880 --> 57:03.720
They just went on and on.

57:03.720 --> 57:08.580
It's kind of laughing now because I haven't seen it in years, but you know, it would be

57:08.580 --> 57:10.680
really nice to be able to check it out.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.760
How have they done this, Wes?

57:12.760 --> 57:13.760
It's not Wine.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.180
It's not FreeDOS.

57:15.180 --> 57:16.360
It's a whole other way to get WordPerfect.

57:16.360 --> 57:21.600
You know, I want to talk about the Xandros connection.

57:21.600 --> 57:22.920
Did Corel buy Xandros?

57:22.920 --> 57:25.360
Is that what I'm barely vaguely remembering?

57:25.360 --> 57:26.360
It's the other way around.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.360
Oh.

57:27.360 --> 57:31.040
Corel had to discontinue all its Linux efforts, so it sold off Corel Linux OS, which became

57:31.040 --> 57:32.040
Xandros.

57:32.040 --> 57:39.120
Corel Linux OS is the predecessor to Xandros, and then Xandros was then acquired, then acquired

57:39.120 --> 57:44.160
Linspire and merged it into itself, and then ultimately it was acquired and then they shut

57:44.160 --> 57:45.160
it down.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.160
Okay.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.440
I'm surprised you didn't know that, Chris.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.440
Like it was...

57:48.440 --> 57:49.440
I may have at some point.

57:49.440 --> 57:50.440
I just didn't.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.160
Too much retro history.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.720
It was part of the Groklaw thing.

57:53.720 --> 57:59.960
Like the whole stupid SCO thing was, whereas all that stuff kind of was unearthed.

57:59.960 --> 58:04.280
Neil, I've forgotten more about all that than I probably could even keep track of, but it

58:04.280 --> 58:05.800
does vaguely all ring a bell.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.600
That all does kind of ring a bell.

58:07.600 --> 58:09.080
The more you guys talk about it, it does.

58:09.080 --> 58:11.200
That was what I entered the open source world in.

58:11.200 --> 58:15.760
So like it will remain fresh on my mind basically forever.

58:15.760 --> 58:19.400
They've done like a script here that you basically, you grab this script, right?

58:19.400 --> 58:21.680
And it pulls down, I don't know, like a DOS environment.

58:21.680 --> 58:22.680
What's it doing, Linus?

58:22.680 --> 58:24.040
How's it making this happen?

58:24.040 --> 58:25.040
Well, it depends.

58:25.040 --> 58:30.120
There's, if you want to go explore, there is a word perfect for ancient Mac classic.

58:30.120 --> 58:33.720
If you want to try that, that's a little tricky.

58:33.720 --> 58:37.240
The one that lived the longest, I guess, is the Linux version.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.040
So that's what a lot of the article kind of explores.

58:39.040 --> 58:42.600
It explores the neat history with Corel and some of the contributions even that Corel

58:42.600 --> 58:44.800
had contributed to the wine project, say.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.520
So definitely go read the whole article because there's a lot in there.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.680
At the end, there's kind of a call for help to figure out the best way to get the Linux

58:51.680 --> 58:53.520
stuff running.

58:53.520 --> 58:59.160
The author did get it going in a very old version of Linux on a VM and tried to get

58:59.160 --> 59:00.160
it containerized.

59:00.160 --> 59:04.200
But so far, that's proving tricky because it's like pre Ubuntu 8.04.

59:04.200 --> 59:08.360
Man, if it's not StarOffice, I just couldn't care, I guess.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.360
That's what was exposed today.

59:09.360 --> 59:12.000
I'm a StarOffice guy, always have been.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Big StarOffice fan.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.480
All right, well, if you have any nostalgia picks for us or distros that you recommend

59:18.480 --> 59:20.880
we check out, you can tweet them at the show too if you like.

59:20.880 --> 59:25.080
We are at Linux Unplugged or you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

59:25.080 --> 59:29.960
The whole network is on Twitter at Jupiter Signal and there's a whole network of shows

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
out there.

59:30.960 --> 59:36.000
I got a telegram this morning from a long time listener in Australia, a shout out to

59:36.000 --> 59:40.100
you sir, who said, I've been listening to Linux Unplugged forever and I didn't even

59:40.100 --> 59:44.460
know self-hosted existed and I just checked it out and now I'm binging it.

59:44.460 --> 59:48.840
So I mean like, you know, I feel like maybe I should mention that we have some other podcasts

59:48.840 --> 59:53.000
like a Linux news podcast that covers all of the important Linux news every week.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.920
If there's something you didn't hear us talk about here, well, we probably covered it in

59:55.920 --> 59:57.560
Linux Action News in detail.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.260
So check out linuxactionnews.com as well.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.800
And we'd love to have you join us live.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.240
We do this here podcast live on Tuesdays.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.440
See you next week.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.760
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.760
That's right.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.000
Join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv or I guess you can do that thing

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.360
on Twitch.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.080
You probably know how it works better than I do.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.680
Twitch.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that low latency stream.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.680
That's right.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680
It's the low latency video.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680
There's also YouTube.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680
Who knew?

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.840
But you could subscribe over there, I guess, and get notifications when we're live.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.120
Man, who just doesn't love notifications?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.760
Get them all while you can.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760
Go get them.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.560
Go get notified or just download it when we release every Tuesday where it sounds better

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.000
and Joe's put a lot of work into it.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That works too.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.080
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program and we'll see you

01:00:45.080 --> 01:01:00.320
right back here next Tuesday.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:26.320
Okay, JBtitles.com.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.840
You know, that doubly goes for all these retro distros we talked about today.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.440
It's really about how you use it.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.560
It really was.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.880
That was sometimes the best part was solving a series of problems like Xandros by default

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.280
wasn't grabbing an IP over DHCP.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.920
It saw my network adapter once I got the right driver loaded, but didn't just go get an IP.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.400
I had to go into the config and tell it to use, yes, it's okay to use DHCP.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:57.680
And then it didn't take the DNS servers from DHCP, even though obviously my DHCP server

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.960
offers them up.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.080
But I had to then go into the DNS configuration in their little GUI and tell it, use these

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080
DNS servers.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.640
It just totally disregarded what the DHCP server supplied.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:15.120
Well, because back then there wasn't necessarily support for DNS auto configuration via DHCP.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.120
Yeah.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.600
And like, and the wireless support was so new.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.160
It was just so hit and miss.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
Yeah.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160
Oh my God.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:32.280
I used Endus wrapper until 2009 because Wi-Fi was so bad up until like 2011 or so.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280
Yeah.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.400
It was such a factor back then.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.120
And you could see each distribution was taking a different crack at trying to solve the problem,

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.880
but it was just like, there was only so much they could do.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:03:05.880
It was pretty bad.
