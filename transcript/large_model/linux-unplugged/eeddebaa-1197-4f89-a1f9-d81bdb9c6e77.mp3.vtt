00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
We start the episode this week with a call out to you Linux users with old and weird

00:07.880 --> 00:08.880
laptops.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.520
Direct quote there.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
We need help.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.600
Some backlight changes are coming to Linux 6.1 and users of old, weird laptops can actually

00:17.600 --> 00:19.680
help make sure that we don't break things.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.200
I just think this is one of those great moments.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.320
So there are changes landing in Linux 6.1 that would allow setting the maximum brightness

00:26.320 --> 00:30.160
amounts and then communicating that clearly when those controls are not supported.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.000
That seems like a great feature, right?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, early testing has actually shown that it's damaged some old, weird laptops.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
So you're probably OK now.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.720
They've made some fixes there, but they still need testing.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.680
And there are ways you can just download and help test the next kernel today.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
Go help.

00:46.680 --> 01:01.760
Only you old, weird Linux laptop user can help.

01:01.760 --> 01:05.680
Hello friend, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.040
It's just me.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.360
My name's Chris.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
Nobody else here today.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.840
See, I let Brent off the hook because he had some sort of family hit he had to do.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.840
It's family business.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.200
I can't get into it.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.760
And then Wes got the sick.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.240
I think he was doing like some really important on location business for the show and he came

01:22.240 --> 01:23.800
down with the sick.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.400
So it's just me in studio this week.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.120
But I am joined by a fired up and ready to go virtual lug.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.120
Time appropriate.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Greetings.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Mumble room.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
Hello.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.120
Hello.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
Hello.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.600
Well, that is that's a I think that's a top five intro right there.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
Mumble room.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
Hello, everybody.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.600
Thanks for being in the in the silent listening today.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.580
I hope you have your old weird Linux laptops ready to go because the kernel team needs

01:49.580 --> 01:50.580
your help.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.640
Coming up on the show today.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.760
Let's discuss if I saw long time Linux users are holding Linux back a bit from the next

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
level of growth.

01:57.760 --> 02:03.400
There's a couple of topics, both of which Liam at the register has just absolutely nailed

02:03.400 --> 02:04.400
this week.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.740
So I think, Liam, you are the unofficial co-host of the show this week because you've got two

02:07.740 --> 02:11.640
pieces that I want to discuss with the Mumble room and with you listening out there.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.980
And there have been some changes and some trends over time that have just been kind

02:14.980 --> 02:19.760
of going in certain directions that mean kind of a fundamental way, a shift in a way that

02:19.760 --> 02:24.200
the community communicates, organizes, develops.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.300
Plus your good buddy, Leonard Pottering, the system developer, has a new idea on how to

02:28.300 --> 02:29.960
really improve security for Linux.

02:29.960 --> 02:36.640
There's essentially one major change we could make and it may be good, may be bad, but it

02:36.640 --> 02:40.100
also could reduce maybe the tinkerability of Linux, if you will.

02:40.100 --> 02:44.640
So we'll talk about what that change could be, if it really is such a big deal and kind

02:44.640 --> 02:48.840
of what the idea is and why some people are saying it gives Microsoft full control over

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
Linux.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
That's like the going all the way.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.480
So I'll dig into that too.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.780
And we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks, and a heck of a lot more.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.280
So before we go any further, I have to say good morning to our friends over at Tailscale.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.440
They're like the secret sauce.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.400
You know when you have some family member's food and it's just like extra tasty and you

03:05.400 --> 03:07.520
discover they put butter in?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.120
Tailscale's the butter for my networking.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
It's so great.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.480
It just makes everything work a little bit better.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.800
It creates a mesh VPN powered and secured by WireGuard.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.760
One flat network for all your devices that you can get going in just minutes.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.760
We love it.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.300
It'll change your networking game.

03:22.300 --> 03:28.760
Go say good morning and try it for free for up to 20 devices over at tailscale.com.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.560
Tell them the Unplugged program sent you.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
So we'll see.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.240
We'll see how we do today.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.240
Just me.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.680
I don't even know how long it's been since I've done a solo show for the Unplugged program.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.600
I wonder if anybody out there knows.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.480
It's got to be hundreds of episodes, right?

03:44.480 --> 03:49.040
I think the last time you did it, you were still doing the Linux action show.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
Probably.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
Probably.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
Shoot.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.080
Like I think I was in college the last time you did that.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.200
That's 10 years ago.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.600
Are you trying to make me feel old?

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
Are you?

03:57.600 --> 04:04.760
Look, man, you started doing this podcasting when I was in middle school, so I can make

04:04.760 --> 04:06.840
you feel old by mentioning that fact.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.840
You just did.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
You just did.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
Yeah.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.840
Yeah, I know.

04:10.840 --> 04:11.840
That's pretty crazy.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.400
I know this show is older than some of my kids.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.080
That's also really weird because they're actual human beings that exist in the world.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.960
You were not married when you started.

04:17.960 --> 04:18.960
Yeah.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.440
And now I've been through divorce and remarried.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.680
So how about that?

04:21.680 --> 04:26.640
Well, the GNOME Project's going through a bit of a divorce with mailing lists.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.800
The GNOME Project is preparing to shut down its mailing list towards the end of October,

04:30.800 --> 04:32.840
which is right now.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.840
Happy Halloween, everybody.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.560
And the Register has a great piece about that.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.640
They interviewed the GNOME Project Executive Director, Neil McGovern, about this and several

04:40.640 --> 04:41.800
others.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.440
Neil points out, that's Neil from GNOME, not Neil from the Mumba Room, points out that

04:45.440 --> 04:50.960
like many other projects that use Mailman, they find that relying on Python 2 is not

04:50.960 --> 04:54.900
sustainable anymore, which probably means they have an old version of Mailman.

04:54.900 --> 04:58.320
And so that's a reason that they're shutting down the mailing lists.

04:58.320 --> 05:02.760
Evolution and other GNOME projects have made the announcement that their mailing list will

05:02.760 --> 05:04.880
be retired at the end of October.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.920
They write, as we've been communicating during the past few months, GNOME's Mailman platform

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
is being decommissioned.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.520
And they cite the Python 2 deprecation.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.080
And also, they cite a major burden with spam.

05:18.080 --> 05:23.080
They say the deadline is currently set to be the end of October 2022.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.280
Mailing list subscribers are invited to migrate to GNOME's discourse instance.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.440
And they have some information about that.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.380
And we'll come back to that discourse instance, because that's a major factor here.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.280
Other projects are doing the same.

05:36.280 --> 05:42.760
My read, and Neil, here in a second, I'd be curious to get yours, but my read is that

05:42.760 --> 05:48.840
infrastructure kind of got out of date, both physically and software-wise.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.480
The team has just had skills that evolved over those years.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.600
They don't necessarily specialize in maintaining Mailman anymore.

05:54.600 --> 06:00.560
So they don't necessarily have the right skills, people, or time to devote to replacing it

06:00.560 --> 06:03.000
or upgrading.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.720
And their mailing list has seen a steady decline since they rolled out that discourse.

06:07.720 --> 06:12.760
And GNOME's infrastructure team coordinator told the register that, quote, the new platform

06:12.760 --> 06:19.640
offers way more features than Mailman, including gamification, which newer generations in general

06:19.640 --> 06:25.200
appreciate, but also markdown support, RSS feeds, proper spam support, multiple authentication

06:25.200 --> 06:28.000
types, so on and so forth.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.720
So I'm curious, Neil, because I know you've participated across the spectrum, are you

06:31.720 --> 06:34.160
sad to see the slow death of mailing lists?

06:34.160 --> 06:37.360
And it seems like it feels like, for some reason with the GNOME project kind of winding

06:37.360 --> 06:39.000
this up, this is kind of a major one.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.080
And I'm curious what your thoughts are.

06:41.080 --> 06:46.800
So one of the big things I don't like about the elimination of mailing lists is that with

06:46.800 --> 06:52.960
forums in particular, you have an interesting restriction on who you can talk to or communicate

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
with.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.800
And that's all the people that are already there.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.840
One of the unsung capabilities of mailing list-based communication that I've leveraged

07:00.840 --> 07:06.980
over the years is being able to CC some other person somewhere else into a conversation

07:06.980 --> 07:12.220
and deliberately bring them in and give them the ability to have context and whatever.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.220
That's a great point.

07:13.220 --> 07:17.600
I've also been told just behind the scenes that it's also how a lot of people scale across

07:17.600 --> 07:21.480
multiple projects, which I'm curious if it's a tool for you, because you can aggregate

07:21.480 --> 07:23.040
into one inbox.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.840
It's the only way I can function.

07:24.840 --> 07:30.580
Projects that have moved to the forums, I've mostly stopped engaging in because I can't,

07:30.580 --> 07:34.180
in order for those things to work, I have to actually actively poke into those forums

07:34.180 --> 07:36.220
and go look at them and whatever.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.680
And yes, discourse has an email-based function.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.480
No, it's not very good.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.760
And RSS.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
What browser has RSS support?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.120
And yes, I could have a dedicated RSS reader.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.320
I don't use one because I'm on different computers all the time.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.380
And browsers are the only thing that stay in sync across all the computers I have.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.600
And Google Reader killed it for all of us.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, pretty much.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
Right?

07:58.600 --> 08:02.160
So that comes back to, I don't have Google Reader anymore, so I don't exactly have a

08:02.160 --> 08:03.880
good way of doing that.

08:03.880 --> 08:11.400
But more seriously, this move to discourse, I suspect, is actually not driven by the things

08:11.400 --> 08:12.940
you'd expect.

08:12.940 --> 08:18.720
One of the things that has been going on undercurrent in GNOME infrastructure for the past few years

08:18.720 --> 08:22.360
is that they've been retooling all of their infrastructure to run on top of Red Hat Open

08:22.360 --> 08:24.480
Shift Container Platform.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.240
And so all of their applications have to be able to deploy on Open Shift and run in the

08:29.240 --> 08:32.200
Open Shift environment and scale with that and whatever.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.000
They just recently redeployed the GNOME GitLab and broke everybody's ability to push via SSH

08:38.000 --> 08:45.360
because the way that you have to do SSH, Git SSH in Open Shift or in Kubernetes in containerized

08:45.360 --> 08:48.700
environments is completely different from non-containerized environments.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.160
And so everybody has to adjust for that and stuff like that.

08:53.160 --> 08:58.240
What about their argument that gamification appeals to a newer generation?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
That's totally true.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.600
That's why Fedora has the badges thing.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.480
And we've got this whole big thing.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.800
You remember a couple of years ago when the Butterfest stuff was going on, there was a

09:07.800 --> 09:10.960
Butterfest badge for everyone who came in and tested.

09:10.960 --> 09:16.600
That's still, I think, the most given away badge in the Fedora badges system.

09:16.600 --> 09:21.840
So it was the most tested feature that we've ever done.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.140
And that clearly shows the value of it.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.740
But that's not the point.

09:25.740 --> 09:30.600
The point is that they don't actually want to, they don't want to spend the effort to

09:30.600 --> 09:32.760
move the mailing list onto Open Shift.

09:32.760 --> 09:36.080
Maybe they could argue they don't have the right people on their team.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.080
Fooey.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.280
If you can get GitLab to run on there, you can get Bloody Mailman to run on there.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
All right.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
Well, here's the other argument.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.160
They say it reduces fragmentation amongst the GNOME communities.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
Improved integration.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.160
They have a bridge with live matrix chat so they can move conversations between ephemeral

09:53.160 --> 09:55.400
and something that's posted online.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.040
And they say it's a modernization of the overall infrastructure project.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.000
They've migrated IRC to matrix.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
This is the next thing.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.840
This is akin to IRC moving to matrix, they say.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.960
No, but sure.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.560
There's certainly a modernization aspect to this.

10:09.560 --> 10:16.280
But it's definitely not a, like, this is a strict improvement of the experience.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.880
Each certainly allows richer formatting or whatever.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.840
The biggest reason why email conversations aren't rich is because there's this convention

10:23.840 --> 10:29.680
to use plain text emails and to do bottom posting and all this netiquette stuff from

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
the 90s.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.680
Whatever.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.680
Fine.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.240
Isn't there some truth, though, to the whole, you know, when you go on GitHub, all of a

10:36.240 --> 10:38.120
sudden you get a lot more contributors?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.440
Isn't that something to, like, when you go on discourse, all of a sudden you're going

10:40.440 --> 10:42.640
to get a lot more people that can get their eyes on it?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.260
Actually, here's another dirty secret.

10:45.260 --> 10:50.320
All engagement in the GNOME project on various communication platforms has been going down.

10:50.320 --> 10:57.320
So one of the GNOMEs told me privately that discourse is, like, kind of half dead in terms

10:57.320 --> 11:00.600
of engagement from both developers and users.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.240
And the mailing lists have also rotted, but so has everything else.

11:05.240 --> 11:13.080
So if on the whole balance, engagement and communication is rotting and in decline, the

11:13.080 --> 11:16.080
ones that are in decline the fastest are probably the ones worth kicking out.

11:16.080 --> 11:20.400
And mailing lists are probably in decline way faster than all the other ones, because

11:20.400 --> 11:24.600
people just leave and whatever, and sure.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.280
And email, unlike the other platforms, is actually harder to keep up with because you

11:28.280 --> 11:31.560
still have to do all the stuff to make sure you don't get listed as spam.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.720
You have to update for the MTAs and all that other fun stuff.

11:35.720 --> 11:40.480
But in general, like from what I've been told from a couple of from a few GNOMEs that are

11:40.480 --> 11:46.560
involved in this, is that overall engagement in GNOME has actually gone downward in communication.

11:46.560 --> 11:51.880
Discourse, mailing lists, IRC, all of it is all on a downward trend.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.880
It doesn't feel like a technology problem to me, Neil.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.480
It feels like a different problem going on there.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.480
It's a different problem.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.360
We're not going to talk about that.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.400
I don't need that right now.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.460
But basically, because there's a downward trend here and mailing lists are the harder

12:07.460 --> 12:10.760
of the two to maintain, they're going to cut the mailing lists.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.680
This is actually going to be a little painful because GNOME isn't the only project that

12:14.680 --> 12:16.720
uses the GNOME mailing lists.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.680
That was why I brought them up for discussion is because they're not the only project doing

12:19.680 --> 12:22.840
this in the open source community broader.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.360
So I wonder, if we zoom out from GNOME, what are we losing here?

12:27.360 --> 12:31.260
I could think there's definitely an accessibility aspect we're losing because when you take

12:31.260 --> 12:34.520
things out of plain text and out of email, you're automatically going to make it less

12:34.520 --> 12:38.640
accessible to some folks, especially those that might be visually impaired or something

12:38.640 --> 12:39.820
like that.

12:39.820 --> 12:45.060
So I recognize that's a loss, but I'm wondering just outside of that, from a development community,

12:45.060 --> 12:48.320
what else are we losing if we move away from that?

12:48.320 --> 12:53.760
In some respects, you have to consider forms are a lot less asynchronous than email is.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.920
Because in order for you to engage, there's a different set of expectations when you're

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
working with web forms.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.140
But can't you argue they're more transparent because they're on the web and available to

13:01.140 --> 13:02.140
anyone?

13:02.140 --> 13:03.720
I think that depends.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.000
It depends on how you run the form.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.720
It depends on how the form works.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.720
It depends.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
There's a lot of factors here.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.480
But there are some common things.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.240
So web forms are pseudosynchronous.

13:14.240 --> 13:19.000
And that means that while they're technically asynchronous, there's a lot of community expectation

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
of timeliness.

13:20.000 --> 13:28.680
For example, the GNOME discourse auto locks discussion threads after so many days of inactivity.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.020
That is a pseudosynchronous thing to do.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.600
That means that there is an expectation that there is engagement continually.

13:36.600 --> 13:43.000
But the way that discourse in most web forums work, you have to actually directly go there

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
and pull the stuff.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.240
So not push-based, pull-based engagement.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.040
And because it's pull-based engagement, the effort is on you to find out what's going

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
on.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.200
Yes, there are certain ways to mitigate some of this.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.600
But you can't fully mitigate it because it's built into the model.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.360
Whereas emails are push-based, generally when you subscribe to something, the engagement

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
comes to you.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.160
And you make the choice to interact with it.

14:09.160 --> 14:12.840
And there is not really a straightforward way to lock people out of a conversation.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.840
True.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.760
And it's pretty easy for you to develop your own tooling around that to manage it, filter

14:16.760 --> 14:17.760
it, and sort it.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.640
But I will say from a research standpoint, like when I'm investigating a story for Linux

14:21.640 --> 14:22.640
Action News.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.640
Forums are easier.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.640
Yeah.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.640
Way easier to search.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.640
Way easier to find stuff.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.800
Way easier as an outsider to come in and get a get a good picture of what the conversation

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
has been.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.120
A mailing list is a chore sometimes to track it all down.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.960
I mean, there is that aspect to it.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.960
Sure, there is.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.500
And also, it also depends on what kind of archiver is being used, right?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.440
Some archivers have a search engine, others don't.

14:43.440 --> 14:49.440
Most projects using Mailman 2 or Pony something or other, I forget what the Apache one is,

14:49.440 --> 14:51.560
Ponymail, I think, they don't have any of this.

14:51.560 --> 14:56.400
And so it's, or God forbid you want to search the SourceForge ones, like that custom front

14:56.400 --> 14:58.040
end is so garbage.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.320
Oh, man.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.520
Oh, man.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.040
Painful memories there.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.040
Right.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.040
Those are difficult for sure.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.840
But like, if you look at HyperKitty, shoot, there's groups.io is a mailing list platform.

15:08.840 --> 15:14.280
It's a commercial SaaS based one and Google Groups and those it's Yeah, you're right.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
They have decent search.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.620
They're a lot more accessible to find these things.

15:17.620 --> 15:21.080
They also all have the unique capability of letting you reply from the web.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.720
I wanted to give NJCS a chance to jump in here in regards to email, accessibility, all

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
of that.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.720
Go ahead.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.800
First, I'm seeing in the chat and I want to differentiate a couple different accessibilities

15:30.800 --> 15:32.840
that people seem to be talking about.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.400
There's information accessibility when it comes to this kind of thing, which is great

15:36.400 --> 15:39.880
to mail client as long as you're pulling down copies of things, you can search through things

15:39.880 --> 15:45.440
and a mailing list is super easy to get through with a control F or however you want to search

15:45.440 --> 15:46.560
through that text.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.880
But then there's also the accessibility of low vision users, I happen to be one.

15:51.880 --> 15:56.260
And after a stint of several years working in large educational institutions that still

15:56.260 --> 16:02.280
use Mailman specifically to do mass mailings and group discussions, I can say that from

16:02.280 --> 16:08.580
a visual perspective or a low vision perspective, mailing lists are awful to get through as

16:08.580 --> 16:14.480
a low vision user, unless you have a specialty client that's going to understand the conversation

16:14.480 --> 16:15.480
nature.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.200
Otherwise, you're listening to the entire wall of text.

16:19.200 --> 16:25.880
So moving any type of mailing list for visual accessibility reasons to a web-based plant

16:25.880 --> 16:30.920
that understands messages, that understands the web standards that can separate things

16:30.920 --> 16:35.360
out for screen readers, big plus, something that I would be very excited about.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.600
Well, that's great insight.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
Thank you for that.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
That's good to know.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.880
I want to give Gamma a chance to jump in on the demographics of users that could be using

16:41.880 --> 16:42.880
these systems.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.880
Go ahead, Gamma.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.880
Like Neil actually mentioned earlier, when you have an email, you can be subscribed

16:48.880 --> 16:54.120
to so many different emails and pull them in fairly passively.

16:54.120 --> 16:58.760
So you can be engaged in the community fairly easily.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.080
There's a lot more passive, almost drive-by nature, and you really don't get that in a

17:03.080 --> 17:07.200
forum where you have to go out and actively be engaged in it.

17:07.200 --> 17:15.600
People who are going to the GNOME discourse are people who are actively seeking out GNOME

17:15.600 --> 17:22.320
things, like maybe it's a news, it's a reactionary that they're going there, instead of they're

17:22.320 --> 17:27.680
passively like, oh, they're seeing stuff as it's going on, no, they're going there for

17:27.680 --> 17:28.680
a reason.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.680
I could see your point there.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.600
Well, ultimately, Neil, I kind of want to know your thoughts around just, I know I'm

17:33.600 --> 17:38.920
sure you have lots, but my thinking is developers are really the target demographic here.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.320
Developers are capable of using their own tooling and consuming this information in

17:42.320 --> 17:46.080
their own way to work best with their particular workflow.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.200
Is that not a factor in this, and don't mailing lists potentially suit that use case better?

17:50.200 --> 17:54.840
Again, because we're not looking for everyday users, we're looking for developers here.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
For sure, right?

17:55.840 --> 18:00.080
Like everyday users, I think, totally can be satisfied by forums.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.920
And I've actually made this point before in other venues that user support isn't well

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
served by mailing lists.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.480
They're actually better served with web forums and things like that because you don't want

18:11.480 --> 18:17.360
brandos being pulled in and all kinds of crazy places, and you generally want a more curated

18:17.360 --> 18:18.680
experience there.

18:18.680 --> 18:24.600
Whereas developer engagement, especially the highly distributed nature of open source development,

18:24.600 --> 18:28.200
it doesn't work super well when you have islands for communication.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.680
But also, I wanted to mention something else.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.680
I forget which one, like someone made that point about the accessibility stuff.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.840
This is actually also a function of what kind of web email archiver you have.

18:38.840 --> 18:47.080
Some archivers do translate email conversations into something that screen readers and whatever

18:47.080 --> 18:50.000
can actually handle in the same way that they would handle a web forum.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.440
And I know that those are not terribly common in the open source space yet, but for example,

18:54.440 --> 19:00.320
I think HyperKitty groups, I owe Google groups, they all actually use these tags and smart

19:00.320 --> 19:05.140
detection to make it so that these conversations are handled in the same way that you would

19:05.140 --> 19:09.200
handle, say, quoted messages and web forums, and you're able to ignore them and process

19:09.200 --> 19:12.520
them properly and things like that.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.200
Unfortunately not everybody is using that.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.780
You've still got your mailman twos, you've got your pony mails, you've got your ML MMJs

19:19.780 --> 19:24.360
and all these other older ones that just don't do any of this stuff.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.320
Mailing lists are an email experience that you make of it, whereas web forums are typically

19:28.320 --> 19:34.520
what they've made for you, and that's where I think the crux of the difference is.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.440
That's not to say that anyone else's concerns about mailing lists are invalid, but it's

19:38.440 --> 19:45.320
certainly something where the group implementing the mailing list has to care to deal with

19:45.320 --> 19:49.720
these problems.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

19:51.400 --> 19:55.200
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and it's just a great way to

19:55.200 --> 19:59.000
support the show while you're really trying out the Linode platform.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.100
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with really the best support in the business because

20:03.100 --> 20:05.320
Linode is architected differently.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.640
They're built around a great product that had to do well in the marketplace, and they

20:08.640 --> 20:13.400
had to actually compete for their customers by making something they'd want to use.

20:13.400 --> 20:19.320
And so in that, they have created a fantastic support department that's available 365.

20:19.320 --> 20:22.140
The first person you contact is the person who resolves it.

20:22.140 --> 20:26.680
They don't have to do that silly game of escalation, but let's be real.

20:26.680 --> 20:31.720
On the big hyperscaler platforms, the support situation is obtuse, it's a nightmare, it's

20:31.720 --> 20:35.480
opaque, it's awful, and it always starts with a chat bot.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.640
So Linode is a little differently because their product had to be great, so the systems

20:39.640 --> 20:46.000
are fast, the dashboard is fantastic, the API is clear and easy to implement, the infrastructure

20:46.000 --> 20:50.640
management tools are whatever you want to use, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, yeah,

20:50.640 --> 20:51.640
it all works.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.920
And they managed to do it while they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that

20:54.920 --> 20:59.820
just want to lock into their crazy platform that they like to pretend they invented.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.120
But on top of that, the performance is just fantastic.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.120
It's so good.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.720
I've had an opportunity to try out their GPU rigs, I've had an opportunity to try out their

21:06.720 --> 21:10.080
dedicated CPU systems, their monster systems.

21:10.080 --> 21:16.220
I've got a matrix box with like 48 CPU cores and something like 96 or 128 gigs of RAM.

21:16.220 --> 21:21.160
It's in the category of like the number so high that it just doesn't really even make

21:21.160 --> 21:22.440
sense anymore.

21:22.440 --> 21:26.720
The performance is insane, and we started that at a tiny little system, a tiny little

21:26.720 --> 21:32.280
two-core box with eight gigs of RAM or something like that, that we just scaled up over time

21:32.280 --> 21:34.720
as our matrix user base needed it.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.280
I couldn't have done that with a physical box.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.780
I may have, if I built something, I may have started with something a little more powerful

21:39.780 --> 21:45.700
than two cores and eight gigs of RAM, but within a few months, I have way, way, way

21:45.700 --> 21:49.440
outstripped what I would have been able to afford to build, and I just did it incrementally

21:49.440 --> 21:52.440
as our user demand required it.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.720
It was really simple to use their tools to do that.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.800
Plus we have backups and snapshots.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.480
They got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.360
They're bringing on a whole bunch more next year.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.860
So go build something.

22:02.860 --> 22:03.860
Go learn about something.

22:03.860 --> 22:07.080
It's a great way to try out an open source project on incredibly fast hardware.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.960
Go try it for yourself with that $100.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.960
Really kick the tires.

22:09.960 --> 22:14.440
Linode.com slash unplugged is where you go, supports the show, and you get that $100.

22:14.440 --> 22:20.040
Linode.com slash unplugged.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.520
Just a spot of housekeeping here because it's all on me this week.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.400
Nobody else is here to clean up, and who's going to bring the meat?

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
This is rough.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.400
I mean, I know it sucks for West to get sick, but did nobody think about me?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.800
Anyways, just a few things to mention.

22:34.800 --> 22:39.240
If you haven't checked out our new community-built website at jupiterbroadcasting.com, something

22:39.240 --> 22:43.960
really special is going on over there, and it is totally open on our GitHub over at Jupiter

22:43.960 --> 22:44.960
Broadcasting GitHub.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.960
I don't know, github.com.

22:45.960 --> 22:46.960
You get it, right?

22:46.960 --> 22:50.800
It's a URL, and then you put slash our name in there.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.880
Anyways, you go there to the.com section, and you can open up an issue, and you can

22:53.880 --> 22:57.640
all participate, and we're kind of putting a challenge out to the community.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.480
I talked about this in Office Hours 15.

23:01.480 --> 23:10.640
I think we are probably a few months away, if people worked on it, from a portable, open-source,

23:10.640 --> 23:17.120
fully self-hostable, podcasting 2.0 compatible podcast network website.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.600
You know what's weird?

23:18.600 --> 23:22.400
There's no really good site built for a podcast network.

23:22.400 --> 23:27.840
You know, like my buddy Joe and Michael, they have Tux Digital, and Joe's got his Late Night

23:27.840 --> 23:32.360
Linux series of shows, and they've all kind of taken different approaches like I have

23:32.360 --> 23:35.320
at trying to either centralize or not centralize all of the shows.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.920
Like, how do you do that right?

23:37.920 --> 23:42.380
It's not like anything just does it out of the box, and when you go look for like templates

23:42.380 --> 23:47.840
for like Hugo or WordPress, what you find is like something that's designed for a single

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
person.

23:48.840 --> 23:53.480
And it's all like old-school, like Apple sets the terms on what the RSS feed supports.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.040
Just like an old janky way of doing it.

23:55.040 --> 23:58.400
And I don't know if we'll ever get there, but I kind of put the challenge out in Office

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
Hours 15.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.280
So the details are at officehours.hair.com.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.760
Episode is one PR at a time.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.520
I don't think it'd be that much work to like make it possible to swap out the branding,

24:09.520 --> 24:13.760
swap out the theming, and build your own network Hugo site, and the beautiful thing is this

24:13.760 --> 24:15.920
thing builds itself.

24:15.920 --> 24:20.440
When we release an episode, it just automatically builds itself.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.400
Every post is automatically generated.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
I don't have to do a thing.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.400
It's so beautiful, and it's how it should be.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
And we're building it out even more.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
We're not done yet.

24:30.400 --> 24:34.560
We're adding more podcasting 2.0 features and specs, and we're opening, we've opened

24:34.560 --> 24:35.680
up the development to the community.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.360
So there's all kinds of things that are open or can be improved.

24:39.360 --> 24:45.160
We just recently had some big updates to the website to make it possible to automatically

24:45.160 --> 24:47.000
update the sponsor segment and all of that.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.320
We'll be talking about all of that more in Office Hours.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.640
I've decided I'm putting it all in Office Hours, but I wanted to make you aware in case

24:52.640 --> 24:54.080
you haven't been listening.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.520
Our Matrix community has been growing like crazy too.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.440
Details for that over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.520
I'd love to have you join us over there and hang out with a crowd.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
Go get the Element app.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
It's open source.

25:05.520 --> 25:10.000
You can use it in your web browser or you can use it as a downloadable standalone like

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
flat packer.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't know.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's probably a snap.

25:13.000 --> 25:21.680
I got some baller boosts I want to thank before we get into the big meat of the show today.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.360
John A, you sneaky, sneaky SOB.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.680
So I get it, man.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
I get it.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
Deleted came in.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.240
She kind of threw you off your game, threw down a challenge.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.360
She felt like it was a lot of pressure.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
Stats aren't free.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.920
They are on sale right now, but they're not free.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.720
They recently went up a little bit in price.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.400
I know how you're feeling.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.960
You're feeling like I can't do this.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.960
So John A boosts in 10,000 sats, he's like, OK, I got to go low this week, someone else

25:47.960 --> 25:51.800
can have the glorious experience of paying to hear the Hey Rich Lobster song played after

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
their mention.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.160
All right, John A, for you.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.200
Hey Rich Lobster.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.580
You see, John A likes to stay in touch.

26:00.580 --> 26:03.880
So as the week goes on, John A sends another 5,000 sats.

26:03.880 --> 26:06.800
As to my location, I'm actually in the Yakima area.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
You ever heard of Yakima hops?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.460
That's where it comes from.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.980
The delicious Yakima hops in your beer.

26:11.980 --> 26:12.980
That's where John A lives.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.880
He lives in the valley of Yakima hops.

26:14.880 --> 26:19.600
So if you guys ever go to Spokane for a meetup, I'd absolutely try to make it over there.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.560
OK, all right.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
That sounds great, John.

26:22.560 --> 26:27.660
So then John A sends in another 5,000 sats and he says, I also will be in the Seattle

26:27.660 --> 26:29.840
area sometime in the next two to four weeks.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.760
I could always drop by the studio and say hi.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.040
I would love to see your setup anyways.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.400
I moonlight as a pro audio guy.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.520
Well, first of all, I want to hear more about that, John.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.320
You got any demos?

26:39.320 --> 26:41.140
Got any examples?

26:41.140 --> 26:43.180
But how dare you ask that?

26:43.180 --> 26:44.180
How dare you?

26:44.180 --> 26:45.180
No, I'm kidding.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.180
Totally.

26:46.180 --> 26:47.180
You could totally join us.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.560
Send me a boost when you're getting close, when the date is approaching and we'll arrange

26:49.560 --> 26:50.960
a little hangout here in the studio.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.760
We got a third seat you can hang out in.

26:52.760 --> 26:57.160
So I think that I think that in total puts you up to 20,000 sats, which puts you in the

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
baller section.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.380
So you made it and you would have been our top baller.

27:01.380 --> 27:06.240
But then out of absolutely nowhere, a sleeper baller comes in.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.240
Two hundred thousand sats.

27:09.240 --> 27:15.280
Hey, rich lobster.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.120
From Enutech, it was actually one hundred thousand, but then because I got their name

27:19.120 --> 27:21.280
right on the live stream, it became two hundred thousand.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.180
So that's I've never been rewarded like that for getting a pronunciation right.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.000
It totally restructures the motivation.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.600
As humans respond to incentives, my friend, he writes, I stopped using GNOME because of

27:33.600 --> 27:37.280
the member's attitude and hostility towards its users and the way they insult potential

27:37.280 --> 27:39.600
contributors in downstream projects.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.440
So this is a this is a sentiment that I've been hearing from the audience is something

27:42.440 --> 27:44.760
we talked about in our members pre-show.

27:44.760 --> 27:50.760
I'm curious to know if the politics or the communication style of the project matters

27:50.760 --> 27:53.680
to you at all out there, dear listener.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.000
We talked a lot about it on our live stream today.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.680
I'm curious to know out there in the download audience, do you really care?

28:01.680 --> 28:09.040
I realized one of the things I really enjoy about Arch and Nix is I can't really articulate

28:09.040 --> 28:12.400
any political positions necessarily that any of the leadership take.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.920
Now, if I dig around in my memory, I can.

28:15.920 --> 28:20.360
But for the most part, I can't think of any like controversial things coming out of those

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
projects.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.360
Right.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
Like I could name some out of every other project.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.600
But, you know, just as an example.

28:26.600 --> 28:31.200
And there is something nice about that and something that is a factor when I choose a

28:31.200 --> 28:32.200
distribution.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.080
But I'm curious out there if that is true for you, like it is for any tech.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.480
So you can let me know by sending a booster going to Linux some plug dot com slash contact.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.760
I want to thank you guys for the baller boost.

28:41.760 --> 28:45.320
I know they're still getting it's still kind of early uptake on the adoption outside of

28:45.320 --> 28:47.960
just showing your support for the show.

28:47.960 --> 28:53.800
Personally for me, it makes it makes me feel pretty good because I am I'm not totally comfortable

28:53.800 --> 28:59.120
with the way the podcasting and just general ad market is going.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.680
I don't actually know if we're going to be screwed, but I just keep hearing all of these

29:02.680 --> 29:08.360
disastrous reports by by the podcast networks and and podcasters that are like, you know,

29:08.360 --> 29:12.080
they get like two hundred, three hundred thousand, a million downloads of the really big numbers.

29:12.080 --> 29:16.240
And I just keep hearing these devastating stories about how they've lost their sponsors

29:16.240 --> 29:20.600
and like just seem sponsor spends are way, way down.

29:20.600 --> 29:26.800
Wes isn't here today, but he was just recently telling me about a podcast that has dynamic

29:26.800 --> 29:30.320
ads that he's listened to forever, but they just switched to dynamic ad insertion because

29:30.320 --> 29:32.600
they lost their advertiser.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.600
And I think he said, not only is it somebody that you can barely understand because their

29:36.600 --> 29:44.280
mic's horrible, but to fit in a longer ad read into a smaller section, they like time

29:44.280 --> 29:45.760
compressed it.

29:45.760 --> 29:50.520
So it switched it switches to the ad read at like two X speed.

29:50.520 --> 29:55.000
So the ad read sounds like a chipmunk going super fast, like just absolutely horrible.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.160
What's going on right now, and I just it seems like a slow decline.

29:58.160 --> 30:04.080
And I have to say, I hate to say it because it hurts me because I've been a customer of

30:04.080 --> 30:09.600
theirs for, I don't know, 13 years, but I feel like Libsyn is undercutting the podcast

30:09.600 --> 30:13.040
industry as well, the very industry they serve.

30:13.040 --> 30:18.080
Libsyn is is doing their best to undercut advertising and podcasting at the time when

30:18.080 --> 30:20.400
there's just a lot of pressure.

30:20.400 --> 30:25.800
And I worry about the tough decisions that my friends out there will have to make and

30:25.800 --> 30:28.880
that other small businesses will have to make.

30:28.880 --> 30:32.120
And the boosts are just outside of all of that.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.960
It's just a system that is outside of all of it.

30:34.960 --> 30:41.120
And there's something that I fantasize that if everything went really bad and JB collapsed

30:41.120 --> 30:45.680
and everything just totally fell apart, I feel like I would still be going down the

30:45.680 --> 30:52.840
road and Lady Joop somehow fueled by corn fuel and podcasting powered by sats.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.520
That would still be a thing that would still be that still would be online.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.400
PayPal could be gone or I wouldn't use, you know, just like it feels like it's this, you

30:59.400 --> 31:03.200
know, that there's like in the back of my mind, there's that Linux prepper in me that's

31:03.200 --> 31:07.560
always thinking about how do I be completely non-dependent on any commercial platform,

31:07.560 --> 31:11.620
on any centralized network, on anything that's closed source, that RMS in the back of my

31:11.620 --> 31:16.160
head that says, don't trust the closed proprietary networks.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.080
The commercial systems will always inevitably screw you.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.480
So the baller boosts are really kind of a way that says to me, like, there's people

31:21.480 --> 31:25.600
out there that get this, you know, you know, this is my livelihood, right?

31:25.600 --> 31:29.600
If things just went really sideways, I feel like there'd be a community out there between

31:29.600 --> 31:33.320
the members and the boosters and people who contribute to the website and people who show

31:33.320 --> 31:37.280
up in the mumble room and people who participate in our chat rooms, the people who have contributed

31:37.280 --> 31:40.880
to the meetups or have shared the show with somebody like all these ways.

31:40.880 --> 31:45.080
So that's the core value, that would continue to happen.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.040
That value for value would continue regardless of what happened with anything in the rest

31:49.040 --> 31:54.240
of the market, what happened to the podcast landscape, that stuff's a foundation.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.700
And that's why it's such a big deal to me.

31:55.700 --> 32:01.320
So thank you to John A. Thank you to Enutech and we'll get to more boosts later on in the

32:01.320 --> 32:02.320
show.

32:02.320 --> 32:07.320
But I also have in the show notes a link to how the Serenity OS developer makes a living.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.720
And that is some lean, lean living.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.920
But it's interesting how they get it done.

32:10.920 --> 32:14.360
So I have a link in the show notes if you're curious about that.

32:14.360 --> 32:18.920
But let's shift gears and talk about the future direction of Linux and just how secure we

32:18.920 --> 32:20.740
need it to be.

32:20.740 --> 32:26.400
So Lenart Pottering, the system D developer, has written a lengthy, very technical, very

32:26.400 --> 32:27.880
jargon heavy blog post.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.440
He does put a glossary at the bottom.

32:29.440 --> 32:35.920
It is entitled, quote, a brave new trusted boot world in which he outlines the current

32:35.920 --> 32:40.840
issues with the Linux boot process, in his opinion, and how there could be a way for

32:40.840 --> 32:48.800
providing a more secure, robust and trusted boot experience, leveraging your favorite

32:48.800 --> 32:55.520
technologies like TPM, secure boot and things like that, specifically TPM 2.0 hardware,

32:55.520 --> 32:57.480
sort of like Windows 11.

32:57.480 --> 33:02.000
Essentially the issue that Lenart brings up is that there is this flaw.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.900
No matter how secure you make everything else, when you update things that touch the current

33:05.900 --> 33:09.760
kernel, your Linux system updates your initial RAM disk and builds a new one.

33:09.760 --> 33:13.880
And there is an opportunity for nasty things to get slipped in there, he thinks.

33:13.880 --> 33:18.280
You update, you know, a kernel and you get a new version of the graphics driver, you're

33:18.280 --> 33:19.800
building a new init, right?

33:19.800 --> 33:24.160
Like you guys, you've all seen this if you've updated Linux for a period of time.

33:24.160 --> 33:31.960
So Lenart is essentially proposing a unified kernel image or a UKI for the kids out there,

33:31.960 --> 33:38.440
which is a combination of a Linux kernel image and init image or init RD image.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.600
My OBS system is freaking out because I'm talking about changing Linux right now.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.220
That's kind of funny.

33:43.220 --> 33:53.700
And a UEFI bootstub program that would all be loaded into a single UEFI PE file.

33:53.700 --> 33:59.180
And the PE file stands for Microsoft Portable Executable, which you can probably start to

33:59.180 --> 34:03.200
get why it bothers some people.

34:03.200 --> 34:09.340
And a shim is a boot component that extends the public key database that secure boot maintains

34:09.340 --> 34:11.240
and you can use that shim in there.

34:11.240 --> 34:16.160
So all of this is a really sophisticated system to create this unified kernel that lives in

34:16.160 --> 34:19.360
UEFI that would be completely signed.

34:19.360 --> 34:23.360
And then you would know that absolutely everything is secure because what Lenart says the issue

34:23.360 --> 34:30.920
here is somebody could just insert something in that init image and then you can have the

34:30.920 --> 34:36.440
most secure system in the absolute total protected world, but none of it's going to matter if

34:36.440 --> 34:40.280
that little init RAM image gets created and you got malware in there and it can just infect

34:40.280 --> 34:42.200
the system over and over and over again.

34:42.200 --> 34:45.760
And then you scan your system and everything looks good and you're not in that scanner

34:45.760 --> 34:49.160
isn't necessarily like going to decompress and open up the image and look at the init

34:49.160 --> 34:50.160
image, right?

34:50.160 --> 34:51.880
Like that's probably not happening.

34:51.880 --> 34:56.480
So you're just kind of blind to it and it can just attack a system over and over again.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
Hold up.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
Why wouldn't it?

34:58.480 --> 34:59.480
Why wouldn't it open up the init RAM?

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
I mean, it totally could.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.480
It should.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.240
Like Windows malware scanners open up zip files and tarballs and all those things.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.240
Yeah.

35:06.240 --> 35:11.920
If we make the assumption that we're not going to scan like archives on our disk, we're screwed

35:11.920 --> 35:13.760
a lot of different ways.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.000
So let me ask you, what are your and I agree.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.660
I'm just saying I'm just I'm just making I'm trying to I'm trying to articulate Lenart's

35:20.660 --> 35:21.660
case here.

35:21.660 --> 35:25.360
And I assume this is, you know, they're thinking primarily in server context and probably maybe

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
laptops.

35:26.360 --> 35:30.120
And I think it's actually primarily driven by laptops and not servers.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.360
That's my question, Neil, is what is the demand here?

35:32.360 --> 35:33.700
Who is asking for this?

35:33.700 --> 35:34.700
What is this use case?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.280
OK, so first of all, nobody's asking for this.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.000
That's the important part to remember.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.200
The second thing is they're thinking about like this isn't super useful on.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.300
Well, OK, of course it could be useful on servers, particularly ones that are like edge

35:48.300 --> 35:49.840
devices that are actually floating around.

35:49.840 --> 35:55.260
The key thing is this is primarily useful if the device that's running Linux is mobile.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.560
It moves around.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.560
It is.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.760
It is not fixed into a secure location.

35:59.760 --> 36:04.360
Most servers are fixed into a data center or a cloud or whatever.

36:04.360 --> 36:09.920
And basically you have perimeter protections, you have fixed area protections, things like

36:09.920 --> 36:11.240
that.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.160
This just becomes redundant on top of all of that.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.520
And then that's redundant protections, belt and suspenders.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.080
That's all well and good.

36:19.080 --> 36:27.780
But when you look at where most of the attacks are happening, they're not at servers anymore.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.980
They're at customer premises equipment.

36:29.980 --> 36:35.240
So those are edge devices, those are laptops, those are desktop computers or whatever.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.240
What about Android?

36:36.240 --> 36:37.240
Android.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.680
Yeah, Android has a similar system to this already.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.340
They already do this.

36:41.340 --> 36:44.320
But here's the problem.

36:44.320 --> 36:48.680
Android devices can do this because the user is fundamentally not screwing around with

36:48.680 --> 36:51.520
the host operating system.

36:51.520 --> 36:57.340
The brave new trusted boot world that Leonard is talking about is immediately violated by

36:57.340 --> 36:58.920
two particular conditions.

36:58.920 --> 37:03.640
The first condition is if you need to install a third party driver.

37:03.640 --> 37:10.240
Because in Linux land, your drivers need to be able to be part of the init RAMFS in order

37:10.240 --> 37:15.260
to boot the system properly, particularly graphics drivers, storage drivers, things

37:15.260 --> 37:16.320
like that.

37:16.320 --> 37:22.840
In the server space, network cards frequently, and storage controllers, even more so, are

37:22.840 --> 37:26.840
proprietary out of three drivers that you have to load into them.

37:26.840 --> 37:30.100
So once you have those cases, you can't do this anymore.

37:30.100 --> 37:35.680
Then you have hardware, you have accelerators and things like that, like the NVIDIA, what's

37:35.680 --> 37:39.160
it the CUDA accelerator things for data centers, and things like that.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.980
Again, you're back to the NVIDIA driver.

37:40.980 --> 37:44.840
As soon as you have these things, you can't do any of this because you have to generate

37:44.840 --> 37:47.480
a custom init RAMFS.

37:47.480 --> 37:52.160
But what they're, I think, envisioning here is that the default case is what they're hoping

37:52.160 --> 37:56.480
for, where you have your basic Intel laptop with all the hardware fully supported in the

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
mainline kernel.

37:57.480 --> 38:03.760
You can produce an init RAMA disk, an init RAMFS unified kernel image server side, like

38:03.760 --> 38:08.040
the distribution provides it, signs it with their key, does the whole kit and caboodle.

38:08.040 --> 38:12.520
You do that up front, ship it out as an RPM or whatever, and then you install it on your

38:12.520 --> 38:17.220
system and the keychain goes through like, okay, shim verifies against the Microsoft

38:17.220 --> 38:21.200
third-party UEFI cert, boots that, grub is cross-signed with both the Microsoft cert

38:21.200 --> 38:23.120
as well as the distro cert.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.360
So that passes the validation chain so that the grub that trusts the distro cert then

38:26.360 --> 38:30.480
boots the kernel, which then goes forward and does the PCR check and verifies that the

38:30.480 --> 38:34.200
image is there and then goes forward into the operating system and then the Linux takes

38:34.200 --> 38:35.200
over with lockdown.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.880
Yeah, in reality, we can't do any of this because there's not enough integration at

38:38.880 --> 38:44.680
the upper layers of the stack and there's no interest.

38:44.680 --> 38:51.160
There's no interest in providing this kind of security because all of this requires giving

38:51.160 --> 38:53.440
up control to the user.

38:53.440 --> 38:58.280
The other obvious issue here is that, as you just articulated, it also builds a dependency

38:58.280 --> 38:59.280
on Microsoft.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.920
Well, no, the Microsoft dependency is not a given.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.920
Right.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.720
I know you could, you could, but most hardware manufacturers don't even allow you to load

39:05.720 --> 39:06.720
your own keys.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.720
The ones that do, you could.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.320
Yeah, the ones that you do and some of them are buggy where you could break everything

39:10.320 --> 39:13.960
by doing that.

39:13.960 --> 39:18.320
The crux of the issue is that if you actually want to do this properly, you basically need

39:18.320 --> 39:23.200
custom BIOS firmware too because you have to guarantee that you can articulate the security

39:23.200 --> 39:24.200
at that level.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.640
Now, this makes the assumption that your firmware is good, your CPU is good and all that fun

39:27.640 --> 39:30.240
stuff, but you can't make that assumption because it's usually not.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
Yeah, it's not.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.720
Yeah, it never is.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.720
Right.

39:33.720 --> 39:38.160
That's not to say that we shouldn't try to strive for more security in this stuff and

39:38.160 --> 39:47.080
TPM is actually like, take aside the UKI stuff, you can do this TPM asserts on things to better

39:47.080 --> 39:48.080
protect the system.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.120
You can also do an indirect trust by saying, all right, your init remfs has been checked,

39:52.120 --> 39:58.680
summoned, verified, and you store the verification on the ESP and the bootloader then verifies

39:58.680 --> 40:02.560
that part and checks it to make sure that it hasn't been tampered with and the bootloader

40:02.560 --> 40:07.280
image itself is regenerated to include the checksum inside the binary.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.760
You've just described the NixOS boot spec.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.160
That's a research project to do this.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.160
Right.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.200
So then if you go further down the road, then you want to have your root file system locked

40:15.200 --> 40:16.200
down with that.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.320
You want to have FSVarity or something like that, which then has authenticity, so you

40:20.320 --> 40:23.200
do authentication to verify the integrity of the file system.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.040
So all your operating system components are verified against the distro key, all imbued

40:27.040 --> 40:30.840
into the file system, and that's trusted by the Linux kernel through something.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.120
You could also do IMA to do other things.

40:33.120 --> 40:37.040
You can have a kernel key ring of all these components, all files that are verified with

40:37.040 --> 40:38.040
that.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.400
There are a lot of different ways to do this to solve this problem.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.400
Okay.

40:41.400 --> 40:45.800
So you're convincing me that this isn't necessarily the only way to solve this.

40:45.800 --> 40:52.060
So I've noticed a much stronger than typical reaction of this is Microsoft because now

40:52.060 --> 40:53.960
Linart works at Microsoft.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.980
This is Microsoft just embracing and extending and everybody's conspiracy theories about

40:57.980 --> 41:00.360
System D and Linart were true all along.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.600
I've seen memes about it already, told you.

41:03.600 --> 41:08.280
So this is definitely not a Microsoft thing because I can tell you that Linart's been

41:08.280 --> 41:10.600
complaining about this for like 10 years now.

41:10.600 --> 41:15.040
He's been complaining about this on the Fedora mailing list for God knows how long.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.300
He's been complaining about it in System D mailing lists for even longer.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.960
He's been pushing everybody to use System D boot even though the user experience of

41:21.960 --> 41:23.880
SD boot is kind of crap.

41:23.880 --> 41:28.860
And it just makes it so like he's not making any friends with this proposal because he

41:28.860 --> 41:32.000
doesn't know how to communicate that.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.560
And the other people that are actually signed on to this, like if you look at the bottom

41:34.560 --> 41:37.320
blog post, there's a number of people who are also signed on to this.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.320
Some of them actually do a much better job of communicating the value problem of this.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.400
And I certainly understand it.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.680
I work at a company where I help build freaking edge devices.

41:44.680 --> 41:48.700
I of course see the value of this, but I also have to work with said edge devices that have

41:48.700 --> 41:52.520
broken UEFI and can't actually do this correctly.

41:52.520 --> 41:55.000
And the TPM doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.640
And like the CPU just bugs out all the time.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.760
So like what am I supposed to do?

41:58.760 --> 42:00.080
I don't know.

42:00.080 --> 42:05.600
It makes me realize, though, that if System D were to start life today, Linart were to

42:05.600 --> 42:11.120
start System D at Microsoft, there's no way it would have gotten the traction.

42:11.120 --> 42:15.840
It would have immediately been called out as an embrace and extend technology.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.400
It never would have taken off on Linux.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Yeah, no.

42:18.400 --> 42:23.360
Like Microsoft is not a company you want to have start like from a political perspective.

42:23.360 --> 42:27.040
This is irrespective of what good or bad or whatever, irrespective.

42:27.040 --> 42:31.040
You just don't want Microsoft to be creating Linux technologies because there is a large

42:31.040 --> 42:34.560
contingent rightfully or wrongfully, I'm not going to make a value judgment here, that

42:34.560 --> 42:40.880
Microsoft can't make a good technology choice for Linux stuff for the broader ecosystem

42:40.880 --> 42:44.360
without surreptitiously screwing over everyone in the process.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.400
So I have a question, and this is open to anyone in the Mumble Room, of course, open

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
to you too, Neil.

42:48.400 --> 42:54.800
But I wonder if this isn't sort of symptomatic of a larger tendency in free software development

42:54.800 --> 42:58.440
where the engineers, the bright people are always trying to build these really next advanced

42:58.440 --> 43:01.280
systems and these complicated ways of doing things that are so great.

43:01.280 --> 43:06.640
But when you look at the fundamental like pragmatic ways we could improve Linux security,

43:06.640 --> 43:12.040
I was just taking a quick little look skis through the System D GitHub open issues and

43:12.040 --> 43:13.600
pull requests.

43:13.600 --> 43:18.120
They have almost 1800 open issues right now, 209 of those are labeled as bugs.

43:18.120 --> 43:22.480
Some of those could be security issues, 22 are labeled as needing total rework.

43:22.480 --> 43:26.280
There's even more that are labeled as needing like complete re-architecting.

43:26.280 --> 43:29.900
There's 197 different labels that describe the various different issues that people are

43:29.900 --> 43:35.160
having with different problems on System D. One of the most recent ones today, issue number

43:35.160 --> 43:43.360
25,160, our syslog takes 100% of CPU on certain systems with System D when they interact with

43:43.360 --> 43:46.120
each other, 100% CPU.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.260
That probably doesn't leave your system at a very good state.

43:48.260 --> 43:51.460
That probably exposes it to security issues as well.

43:51.460 --> 43:55.000
It's like we don't look internally at the things that we could improve, the obvious

43:55.000 --> 43:56.200
problems in front of us.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.680
Instead, it's always like, well, what's the next big pie in the sky idea?

44:00.680 --> 44:02.600
What's the next big thing?

44:02.600 --> 44:07.480
Instead of just looking at the open issues and going, well, you know, if I fixed a couple

44:07.480 --> 44:11.600
of hundred of these, or if we focused on a couple of these, we could just dramatically

44:11.600 --> 44:15.080
improve security for multiple distributions across the board because so many people now

44:15.080 --> 44:18.640
are shipping System D. What is this tendency?

44:18.640 --> 44:20.480
This tendency is it's not fun.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.480
Is it just that?

44:21.480 --> 44:22.480
Because that just seems like such a...

44:22.480 --> 44:25.080
So, Lenart at the core of it is an architect.

44:25.080 --> 44:33.600
He wants to build architectures that align with what he believes are important.

44:33.600 --> 44:38.760
Personal theory crafting thing here is, I think one of the reasons he went to Microsoft

44:38.760 --> 44:43.280
is because as part of the Azure Linux team, he's working on CBL Mariner, and he gets to

44:43.280 --> 44:44.280
do this.

44:44.280 --> 44:49.000
He gets to be an architect to build out what he believes is the dream vision of a legacy-free

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Linux system.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.320
And I'm curious to see it because I think he's an intelligent individual.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.320
I don't mind.

44:53.320 --> 44:54.320
Sure.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.200
I mean, he's not always wrong, or actually, even most of the time, he's not wrong.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.960
He does a really good job, and he comes up with things, and he solves hard problems.

45:00.960 --> 45:06.720
But one of the things that he's struggled with, and this is true of many of the community,

45:06.720 --> 45:11.640
I could name many, many people, and I'm subject to this sometimes myself, is we don't want

45:11.640 --> 45:17.400
to think about what it takes to account for the real world when we want to solve a problem.

45:17.400 --> 45:21.360
We don't want to think about what it takes to adapt to the ugly messes that we already

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
have today.

45:22.360 --> 45:29.420
We don't want to think about, how do we build something where we minimize the pain to stakeholders

45:29.420 --> 45:31.760
around us to make things better?

45:31.760 --> 45:36.040
A good example of this is how we've gone around with sandboxing.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.080
Sandboxing applications didn't require us to change the way we delivered applications

45:39.080 --> 45:43.240
in the first place, but we tied the two together because that made it more interesting, and

45:43.240 --> 45:46.800
it was more disruptive, and it meant that you could do more breaking things.

45:46.800 --> 45:49.960
But we didn't have to do that, neither Microsoft or Apple did.

45:49.960 --> 45:53.680
There are various ways that you could implement sandboxing without having to do that.

45:53.680 --> 45:59.160
There are all kinds of other things out there that we could have done.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.520
People are just not interested in working on the problems that we have today.

46:02.520 --> 46:06.240
They want to work on the problems we might have tomorrow because those are more interesting

46:06.240 --> 46:09.680
or more fun or more Greenfield or whatever.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.400
Nobody likes working on brownfield projects.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.520
Everyone wants to work on a Greenfield one.

46:13.520 --> 46:20.000
What it sounds like to me is, if this were, say, executed on, to the degree that Leonard

46:20.000 --> 46:23.960
outlines, which we have a link to his blog post in the show notes, it would kind of seem

46:23.960 --> 46:29.340
like essentially the default bar would be Linux could only boot on systems that can

46:29.340 --> 46:30.480
also boot Windows 11.

46:30.480 --> 46:34.840
Like, you know that mark that Microsoft made that Windows 11, Linux would be hell...

46:34.840 --> 46:38.600
And that, I mean, talk about, like, we talk about eliminating 32-bit support, or we talk

46:38.600 --> 46:42.000
about eliminating 486 architecture support.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.760
Talk about eliminating a lot of users.

46:43.760 --> 46:47.600
And then on the ARM side of the world, Secure Boot often can't even be disabled.

46:47.600 --> 46:52.120
Like, on x86, you can sometimes turn that stuff off, but you can't on the ARM devices

46:52.120 --> 46:53.460
in most cases.

46:53.460 --> 46:59.280
And so, as things transition to ARM, by default, you generally can't add your own keys.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.600
If you can add your own keys, you potentially open yourself up to the vulnerability of malware

47:02.600 --> 47:04.240
being able to add your own keys.

47:04.240 --> 47:08.560
You also can't remove the Microsoft keys without breaking the system, even if it's supported.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
That's awful.

47:09.560 --> 47:13.240
And if you think about this, something people don't realize is that Microsoft's third-party

47:13.240 --> 47:17.600
and primary search are actually used to sign option ROMs and things for the hardware that's

47:17.600 --> 47:18.600
on the system.

47:18.600 --> 47:23.160
And so, for example, booting network Ethernet, the network Ethernet option ROM has to be

47:23.160 --> 47:24.520
signed by Microsoft.

47:24.520 --> 47:30.640
If you remove the Microsoft certificate, the Ethernet hardware fails to initialize.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.860
And in servers, video option ROM has the same problem.

47:33.860 --> 47:35.240
You know what it sounds like?

47:35.240 --> 47:36.240
It sounds like macOS.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
Exactly.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.240
It is.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.520
I mean, it's the same setup.

47:40.520 --> 47:46.080
And generally, computers are moving in this direction because in the proprietary systems,

47:46.080 --> 47:48.600
you don't have any other way of securing the platform.

47:48.600 --> 47:53.000
So is this the path that we inevitably set ourselves on when we accepted systemd into

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
our lives?

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
No.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.360
This was the path we set ourselves upon when we didn't have any stakeholders of the Linux

47:59.360 --> 48:02.000
community involved in the UEFI process.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Yes.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Right.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Very much so.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
I completely agree.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.440
I mean, it starts with simple things like UEFI mandates PE binaries.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.160
That doesn't even make sense because PE is one of the more complex binary formats.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.840
But it's the one that's used in that.

48:16.840 --> 48:17.840
That's a Microsoft thing.

48:17.840 --> 48:18.840
Yeah.

48:18.840 --> 48:19.840
Right.

48:19.840 --> 48:26.880
The second thing is we have the PE system, the UEFI system has specific requirements

48:26.880 --> 48:29.840
and structures that essentially force a little endian.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.480
Well, what about big endian architectures?

48:31.480 --> 48:32.840
What about power?

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
What about systemz?

48:34.840 --> 48:35.840
Why can't they use UEFI?

48:35.840 --> 48:43.280
Well, because UEFI is little endian because it was written for Itanium and x86 originally.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.040
All other architectures support UEFI need to be a little endian.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.760
But those also are all the same architectures that only Windows supports because Windows

48:48.760 --> 48:51.920
doesn't support any big endian architectures anymore.

48:51.920 --> 48:57.840
And other choices are based on the people that are actually involved in the project.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.720
Red Hat and SUSE and all these other companies, they got involved in the UEFI stuff way too

49:01.720 --> 49:02.720
late.

49:02.720 --> 49:07.280
It was just Apple and Intel and a couple of others up front, and HP and a few others up

49:07.280 --> 49:08.280
front initially.

49:08.280 --> 49:11.360
And of course, what they chose were the ones that they were working with.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.560
And because of that, we're stuck with this long legacy of choices that make it harder

49:15.560 --> 49:22.120
for the Linux side to actually really be part of this story.

49:22.120 --> 49:26.680
There's no innovation in the boot space from the Linux side because there can't be.

49:26.680 --> 49:30.000
You know what I like about you when you visit Neil is you always drop the member berries.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.880
You know, like, oh, yeah, I'd forgotten about that whole way the UEFI thing went down.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.960
It really did start with Apple and Intel and they brought a few others in.

49:36.960 --> 49:41.040
The Linux folks basically didn't get involved until everything was set.

49:41.040 --> 49:46.640
The Linux world didn't start getting involved until I think it was like 2008, 2009.

49:46.640 --> 49:52.560
That was when Matthew Garrett started working on this because Microsoft with Windows 8 started

49:52.560 --> 49:57.560
having PC makers do secure boot and then people flipped out over it because like initially

49:57.560 --> 49:59.040
you couldn't boot Linux systems.

49:59.040 --> 50:03.520
By the way, almost 15 years later, we are now getting laptops where by default you can't

50:03.520 --> 50:08.440
boot Linux on them because the UEFI third party certificate is now turned off or not

50:08.440 --> 50:13.400
installed by default on quote unquote secured core, which are all systems that are I think

50:13.400 --> 50:18.680
12th gen Intel and Ryzen fifth generation and newer.

50:18.680 --> 50:21.360
So like that's a that's a big deal, right?

50:21.360 --> 50:24.000
Like you're going to have your fourth generation Ryzen.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.360
I forget what the Ryzen 5000 series, whatever.

50:27.360 --> 50:32.000
Anyway, point is that's happening and like I actually had to help somebody just last

50:32.000 --> 50:35.320
week saying I'm trying to get Fedora to boot on this laptop.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.320
It's like, hold up, you have a yoga, don't you?

50:38.320 --> 50:44.160
All right, go into the bootloader, turn on the UEFI third party certificate because that

50:44.160 --> 50:48.040
was that's not on and that's why it doesn't boot.

50:48.040 --> 50:49.840
And that nobody knows that.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.760
Nobody knows that that's a thing.

50:51.760 --> 50:57.160
And it basically invalidates the whole reason we went through all this crap to do secure

50:57.160 --> 50:58.880
boot support in the first place.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.760
But we can't not do it because if because we're moving Microsoft certificates, by the

51:02.760 --> 51:06.680
way, NIST actually recommends that you remove the Microsoft certs when you're securing something

51:06.680 --> 51:08.760
for high security environments.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.400
But in order to do that, you have to do all kinds of other crazy things to make sure that

51:11.400 --> 51:13.640
the system still boots afterwards.

51:13.640 --> 51:18.080
But like in order to do proper security with secure boot, you have to remove the Microsoft

51:18.080 --> 51:19.440
trust and put your own.

51:19.440 --> 51:26.960
But in most computers, especially consumer ones, doing so bricks them permanently.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.720
Linode.com slash unplugged.

51:28.720 --> 51:31.880
Go there to get a hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account.

51:31.880 --> 51:35.520
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're really trying out the Linode

51:35.520 --> 51:36.520
platform.

51:36.520 --> 51:40.440
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with really the best support in the business because

51:40.440 --> 51:42.640
Linode is architected differently.

51:42.640 --> 51:45.960
They're built around a great product that had to do well in the marketplace and they

51:45.960 --> 51:50.740
had to actually compete for their customers by making something they'd want to use.

51:50.740 --> 51:57.400
And so in that, they have created a fantastic support department that's available 365.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.480
First person you contact is the person who resolves it.

51:59.480 --> 52:04.040
They don't have to like do that silly game of escalation, but let's be real.

52:04.040 --> 52:08.080
On the big hyperscaler platforms, the support situation is obtuse.

52:08.080 --> 52:09.080
It's a nightmare.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.080
It's opaque.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.080
It's awful.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.840
And it always starts with a chat bot.

52:12.840 --> 52:16.540
So Linode is a little differently because their product had to be great.

52:16.540 --> 52:18.020
So the systems are fast.

52:18.020 --> 52:19.820
The dashboard is fantastic.

52:19.820 --> 52:22.880
The API is clear and easy to implement.

52:22.880 --> 52:27.280
The infrastructure management tools or whatever you want to use, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible,

52:27.280 --> 52:28.960
yeah, it all works.

52:28.960 --> 52:32.280
And they managed to do it while they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that

52:32.280 --> 52:37.180
just want to lock into their crazy platform that they like to pretend they invented.

52:37.180 --> 52:39.480
But on top of that, the performance is just fantastic.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.660
It's so good.

52:40.660 --> 52:42.920
I've had an opportunity to try out their GPU rigs.

52:42.920 --> 52:47.440
I've had an opportunity to try out their dedicated CPU systems, their monster systems.

52:47.440 --> 52:53.560
I've got a matrix box with like 48 CPU cores and something like 96 or 128 gigs of RAM.

52:53.560 --> 52:58.520
It's in the category of like the number so high that it just doesn't really even make

52:58.520 --> 52:59.920
sense anymore.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.840
And the performance is insane.

53:01.840 --> 53:07.080
And we started that at a tiny little system, a tiny little two-core box with eight gigs

53:07.080 --> 53:11.880
of RAM or something like that that we just scaled up over time as our matrix user base

53:11.880 --> 53:12.880
needed it.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.600
I couldn't have done that with a physical box.

53:14.600 --> 53:18.120
I may have, if I built something, I may have started with something a little more powerful

53:18.120 --> 53:21.140
than two cores and eight gigs of RAM.

53:21.140 --> 53:25.200
But within a few months, I have way, way, way outstripped what I would have been able

53:25.200 --> 53:26.680
to afford to build.

53:26.680 --> 53:30.760
And I just did it incrementally as our user demand required it.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.000
It was really simple to use their tools to do that.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.640
Plus, we have backups and snapshots.

53:34.640 --> 53:36.800
They got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.720
They're bringing on a whole bunch more next year.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.200
So go build something.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.200
Go learn about something.

53:42.200 --> 53:45.400
It's a great way to try out an open source project on incredibly fast hardware.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.300
Go try it for yourself with that $100.

53:47.300 --> 53:48.300
Really kick the tires.

53:48.300 --> 53:53.760
lino.com slash unplugs, where you go, supports the show and you get that $100, lino.com slash

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
unplugged.

53:54.760 --> 53:59.720
We got some emails into the show this week.

53:59.720 --> 54:00.720
Matthew wrote in.

54:00.720 --> 54:01.720
He loves NixOS.

54:01.720 --> 54:08.280
He says, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, NixOS, oh my God, oh my God, oh

54:08.280 --> 54:09.280
my God, oh my God.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.200
I just wanted to shoot you an email to thank you for NixOS.

54:12.200 --> 54:15.200
I finally pulled the pin out and just wow, just wow.

54:15.200 --> 54:18.040
I never have to fully configure the system again.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.680
I believe the NixOS challenge was a screenshot of HTOP.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.160
Well, here's my screenshot from inside Terminator.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.160
Oh, that's great.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.800
Also, I noticed the host name.

54:27.800 --> 54:30.000
I'm loving that host name.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Picard at Enterprise.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.280
Call yourself Captain Picard.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.720
That's so funny.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.720
That's so funny.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.040
I know, I know, I know.

54:37.040 --> 54:45.240
Not everybody, Neil, loves NixOS, and that's why every week my personal struggle is not

54:45.240 --> 54:47.480
to make the episode about NixOS.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.520
That's my battle.

54:48.520 --> 54:53.800
That's my burden, and I take that, and I try not to make every episode about NixOS, but

54:53.800 --> 54:58.080
behind the scenes, I'm still freaking out.

54:58.080 --> 55:03.960
Lowpalm wrote in, and he says, I have a suggestion for the cupboard display in JOOPS.

55:03.960 --> 55:10.880
So I want to install like a tablet or a touch screen in my cupboard, and because this particular

55:10.880 --> 55:13.880
cupboard that I want to install actually has an outlet in the back of it, and I want to

55:13.880 --> 55:19.380
have the JOOPS home assistant dashboard kind of embedded into this cupboard.

55:19.380 --> 55:23.720
So they write, to make it an appliance, you should use the NURVS project.

55:23.720 --> 55:26.820
A kiosk NURVS system for the Raspberry Pi or 3 is available.

55:26.820 --> 55:32.040
You can configure the kiosk system to go to a URL in a web view on boot.

55:32.040 --> 55:36.880
NURVS is a project for creating a Linux-based firmware that boots, oh, cool, Elixir in Erlang.

55:36.880 --> 55:38.560
It's in a little VM.

55:38.560 --> 55:42.440
It's made for embedded stuff, and I suppose if I was an Elixir guy, I'd probably love

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
that.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.520
He says, but you can ignore the Elixir stuff and just have it display the home assistant

55:46.520 --> 55:47.560
dashboard.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.580
Now you're talking my language.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.580
That's great, Lowpalm.

55:50.580 --> 55:54.800
I currently use WallPanel, I think it is, on Android tablets.

55:54.800 --> 55:56.840
I might have that name wrong.

55:56.840 --> 56:01.320
I think it's WallPanel though, and that's also just basically a kiosk web browser, and

56:01.320 --> 56:06.600
I plug that in to the home assistant dashboard URL, and because I'm a fancy boy, I have different

56:06.600 --> 56:08.240
dashboards for like different things.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.560
Like I have a heating dashboard, and I have a lighting dashboard, and I have an electrical

56:11.560 --> 56:16.560
use dashboard, and I got like an admin dashboard, because, you know, dashboard for days is my

56:16.560 --> 56:17.560
thing.

56:17.560 --> 56:20.600
So different tablets point to different dashboards.

56:20.600 --> 56:25.680
So like heating and energy and lighting, and man, if that system doesn't work great, I

56:25.680 --> 56:29.200
don't know what does, but the problem is that Android tablets are crap.

56:29.200 --> 56:34.720
They're just terrible crap, and they just get junkier over time.

56:34.720 --> 56:38.000
And then to make matters worse, I'm buying the cheapest ones I can because I'm plugging

56:38.000 --> 56:42.200
these things in 24-7 and mounting them on the wall and just displaying a web page.

56:42.200 --> 56:44.460
I'm not like playing Angry Birds on the thing.

56:44.460 --> 56:46.520
You get where I'm going.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.440
We got some boosts into the show.

56:48.440 --> 56:52.960
True Grit's boosted in with a Trek Boost 17-01 SATS.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.600
I'm surprised you guys haven't noticed.

56:55.600 --> 57:01.800
The reason Wes is so good with the AI prompts is because Wes is an AI, akin to Data from

57:01.800 --> 57:02.800
Star Trek.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Now, well, now, hold on.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.600
This is before we go on.

57:05.600 --> 57:10.160
If that was true, True Grit's, then why isn't Wes here today?

57:10.160 --> 57:13.200
Do artificial life forms get sick?

57:13.200 --> 57:15.220
I'd say you could argue either way.

57:15.220 --> 57:19.840
If it's later Star Trek, Data is always the one that isn't affected by like the gas that

57:19.840 --> 57:22.800
gets released on the ship or the alien influence.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.680
But if it's season one, episode two, and everybody's getting drunk and you know what happened when

57:26.680 --> 57:30.640
Data and Tasha got drunk, well, then if you prick him, does he not bleed?

57:30.640 --> 57:32.840
So I don't have an answer for you.

57:32.840 --> 57:38.020
But Josh the Techie boosted in with 500 SATS and again, it's not the amount anymore.

57:38.020 --> 57:41.300
It's just the boost message, but I want to get to that more.

57:41.300 --> 57:45.080
But 500 SATS from Josh Techie, first time booster here from Florida.

57:45.080 --> 57:48.520
I try to listen to the show each week in between calls and meetings at work.

57:48.520 --> 57:49.520
Thanks, Josh.

57:49.520 --> 57:53.240
I don't know how you guys just kind of process and consume the show.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.760
I'm always curious.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.200
Just like to picture that.

57:56.200 --> 58:01.840
The boost for me, personally, SATS aside, because there is an amount, whatever it is,

58:01.840 --> 58:02.840
you know, it could be dollars.

58:02.840 --> 58:03.840
It could be dog coins.

58:03.840 --> 58:04.840
Well, not really.

58:04.840 --> 58:05.840
Don't send me your dog coins.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.840
I don't know.

58:06.840 --> 58:07.840
There's something real.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
It's like it's a name.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.400
It's the episode you're listening to and it's a message and there's a value attached to

58:11.400 --> 58:12.400
it.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.780
It's more, it's just more visceral.

58:14.780 --> 58:16.760
And so that's why I love them.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.360
It doesn't have to be some incredible message.

58:18.360 --> 58:19.760
She goes on to say, thanks to the show.

58:19.760 --> 58:22.880
I've gotten back in the Linux community and really enjoyed watching the evolution of links

58:22.880 --> 58:23.880
on the desktop.

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
Yeah.

58:24.880 --> 58:25.880
That's quite the show, isn't it?

58:25.880 --> 58:26.880
Keep up the great work.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.160
Look forward to listening to the next episode.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.160
P.S.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.800
I hope you put NixOS with BetterFest on the new Office Thalia.

58:31.800 --> 58:32.800
Yeah.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.080
I haven't ordered it yet.

58:34.080 --> 58:37.320
I'm just been too busy, but I'm going to.

58:37.320 --> 58:43.480
And I have been reliably informed and Intel Arc GPU is inbound, so I may have an update

58:43.480 --> 58:45.120
on that next week.

58:45.120 --> 58:50.720
Trolley the Hellhound boosted it with 7,000 SATs.

58:50.720 --> 58:55.200
This is my first boost ever here to congratulate you all on the new website.

58:55.200 --> 58:59.680
Hope you have better luck on your road trips in the future and the tech and for podcasting

58:59.680 --> 59:00.680
2.0.

59:00.680 --> 59:03.960
A podcast I worked on and got caught up on was in iHeart Media Blitz.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.240
Oh, it was about the show Firefly.

59:06.240 --> 59:10.040
It didn't last too long after that, but I wanted to throw a curveball question to see

59:10.040 --> 59:11.840
if you guys know of a program I can try.

59:11.840 --> 59:16.680
What is a good open source alternative to Kit Cineris, which I think is a screenwriting

59:16.680 --> 59:17.680
app?

59:17.680 --> 59:20.200
The problem is the program I have doesn't resize well.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
The budget is zero.

59:21.200 --> 59:24.280
So if you know out there of an open source screenwriting app, please put the name of

59:24.280 --> 59:27.200
it in the matrix chat or boost it in out there.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.800
And then they did follow up with an additional 777 SATs.

59:29.800 --> 59:35.160
So the slot machine boost is for 7,777 SATs, right?

59:35.160 --> 59:36.160
You get it.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.360
It's like 777s on a slot machine.

59:38.360 --> 59:42.440
Load it up with 777 SATs to just round it all out.

59:42.440 --> 59:46.360
If you want smart tech without Linus Tech Tips and the hype, you could listen to Linux

59:46.360 --> 59:47.360
Unplugged.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.360
Wow.

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
I didn't say it.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
I didn't say it.

59:50.360 --> 59:53.600
We got a row of ducks from BHH32.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.240
This old duck still got it.

59:55.240 --> 59:58.440
I want to see how much the Steam Deck is a success story for our community.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.640
I finally got mine last month and it's going to be my go-to gaming device now.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.560
I'm choosing this over my PS5.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.960
The icing on the cake.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.440
Is that on release day, Gotham Knights ran flawlessly.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.480
This was unheard of in the past and I believe it's still taking Linux to new heights.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.360
I'm even thinking of selling my console and going back to strictly PC gaming because of

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.040
it.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.600
The Stream Deck got my oldest definitely more interested in PC gaming again.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.760
And he's thinking about things now in terms of if I get it on Steam, then I can play it

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760
on my laptop.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.440
I can play it on dad's Steam Deck.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:39.640
I can install it on my future computers, but if I'm playing on the iPad, I can only do

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640
it on Apple's devices.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.680
If I play on the Nintendo, so it's got him thinking about things in a different way,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.520
which I think is really positive.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.560
And I think it also kind of restored his faith in Linux gaming a little bit because he was

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.440
fading because some Geometry Dash game was only available for Windows or Android or something

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440
like that.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.360
So his faith was fading and the Deck came along and I think it kind of turned things

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360
around for him.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.440
Kelz09 boosted in with 5,000 sats, B-O-O-S-T, hello JB, I've been holding on to some sats

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.260
until I had something thought provoking to say.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.260
That's not happening.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.760
So just take my sats already.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760
You guys do such great work.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.720
I'm usually always up to date on the latest LUP coder and LAN.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.000
Throw a little self hosted in there Kelz.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Well thank you.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.120
And then Mississippi Mayhem came in, which let's be honest, that would have, that would

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.120
be a great, that would be also a really great boost.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
I should have a Missy.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.540
If anybody wants to clip me a little Mississippi Mayhem boost, go ahead, but 300 sats to say.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.600
Just a quick peep to let you guys know I'm still alive.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.320
Having some issues that are making it difficult, although I do want to be involved as a member

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.380
of the community and boost into the show.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.560
Maybe next time I'll have something worth reading on air.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.280
All right, stop the show.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.160
I got something I got to say to you guys.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.160
I feel like I've set the expectations too high.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.000
Just hearing from you and knowing you're out there is really a lot.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.560
That's 80, 90%.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.760
A great message gets it on air, but hearing from you, knowing you're out there, knowing

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.480
you're listening, seeing the boost is sort of like a yes, keep going.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.840
You did a great job.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.120
That kind of stuff, that is super invaluable to us as a team motivator.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.720
So don't wait if you have something.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.640
Don't wait for some great inspiration.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.140
Just say hi and let us know you're listening.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.920
And a special thank you because not all the boosts do make it in.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.320
A couple of more, but there's more that gets sent in.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.000
We are just selecting just several to read on air.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.200
We got 100 sats from the Bosch, the Boosh.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.200
Hopefully would be willing to listen to an AI generated version of our podcast voices.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.000
If you don't know what he's referring to, check out last week's episode.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.760
We also got a 555 sats from Nomadic Coder 5.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.960
I'll be listening for the next few weeks to hear your take on the Odroid H3 experience

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.920
to get an idea if I should buy one.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
Good Nomadic Coder.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.520
I hope that's value we can offer to you.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520
I will update you.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.000
I have a couple of more components arriving.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.220
I have the Odroid H3, which is a little tiny.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.640
They call it a Raspberry Pi killer, but I call it a Raspberry Pi alternative.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.600
It's obviously x86.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.920
It's got two SATA ports, it's got an NVME slot and two RAM slots.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.800
So just like, and two gigabit, 2.5 gigabit NICs actually.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.520
So just like, it's just a huge upgrade over the Pi 4.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.520
And I'm waiting for a SATA cable and an eSATA power cable or whatever they call them.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.880
You know, the ones that have the weird adapters.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.520
I'm waiting for that still, but once that arrives, I am building my box.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.560
20,000 SATs came from Mitch, the lead developer over at Podverse.fm.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:33.400
This is sending Bitcoin boosts to your favorite podcasts with Podverse and Albie couldn't

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.400
be easier.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.560
And it's all open source.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560
Go podcasting.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.720
Thank you, Mitch.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.220
Podcasting 2.0 apps are coming along at a remarkable pace.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.180
And Podverse is one of many that are getting better every single week.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.860
If you'd like to boost to the show, support new features, support an open podcasting ecosystem

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.160
go to newpodcastapps.com.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160
Try one out.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.360
Podverse is the one we mentioned a lot because it's GPL.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.360
It's fully open source.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.120
It's what we've embedded on our website.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.880
People love Fountain FM, you hear it get mentioned all the time because you can earn SATs while

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880
you listen.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.080
Of course, there's Boost CLI if you're a Ninja and all of that.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:12.360
So go over to newpodcastapps.com and grab one and then say, hey.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.760
Two picks this week.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.160
One is an honorable mention for Brent.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.440
He submitted it even though he couldn't be here this week.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.920
And one is going around the internet like crazy.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.120
So I really, I can't take credit.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.160
I did technically flag it, but you probably have already heard of it.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.600
If you've been lurking on the internet in the last week, it's called VHS.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.560
I got my attention.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:40.200
It's actually, it's like a GIF recorder for your terminal or a GIF, your choice.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.740
So you can do something on the terminal.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.480
You know, maybe you're a neo-fetch, maybe you got a bug.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.120
You're trying to get the, you know, you got the output of the air, something like that

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.200
to build fails, whatever you're trying to capture, maybe logs on your command line.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.720
And you want to make a GIF GIF that you could like toss into a chat.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.000
Well, this is the tool that just makes it happen in seconds.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.280
You just do like the command and then you add a, so like, say you're going to open up

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280
a document.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.720
So you do nano demo.tape and then when you're all done, you get the output of that.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.360
You can give it the size, the width you want.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.240
You can add some dramatic effect, like having it type it all out slowly.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:26.280
Kind of like, you know, hunt for red October, text promptings now.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.960
That's called VHS.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.120
You've probably seen this.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120
If you haven't, you're welcome.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.600
But the one that like everybody's talking about, even our chat room was talking about

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.480
it before we got started is ffmpeg.guide.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.520
It is finally here.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:52.880
Hold the perfect ffmpeg command or filter with a graph GUI interface.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:00.240
It's so gorgeous.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.240
You have boxes with lines that connect to other boxes where you set your filter parameters.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.080
The thing connect to other boxes.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.760
It's a graph style, kind of a mind map to give you a visual.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.160
It's a bit of a mind map.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.520
Then you put it all together and out comes the perfect ffmpeg command and they got a

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.720
beautiful live demo on their website.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:26.320
Simple GUI to create complex ffmpeg filter graphs quickly and correctly without having

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.760
to mess with cumbersome filter syntax.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.180
So you know, my old school approach was I go on like stack exchange or Reddit or something

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:39.160
and just find people's like really long, super long commands, copy it and then try to like

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.300
reverse engineer what that command was doing.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.640
No longer, no longer shall you be subject to that ffmpeg.guide.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:54.360
Of course, we'll have a link to that in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 482.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:01.660
And I can't help but notice we're getting close to 486, getting real close.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:06.520
I'm feeling like we should do a retro episode from 486, especially with the hot talk about

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.380
the 486 architecture getting worked out of the Linux kernel.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.120
If you didn't know about that, you missed linuxactionnews, linuxactionnews.com, there's

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.920
a real short and tight one this week.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.120
That's kind of our deal with LAN.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.740
We're not going to waste your time.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.120
We're not going to fill it with stuff that you don't need to know about.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.960
And you know that Wes Payne, when he's not puking in toilets, he's a hell of a news analyst.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.960
Let me tell you, you'd be surprised.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960
A bit of a news hound.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
See you next week.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960
Same bad time.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960
Same bad station.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960
All right.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.160
I would love to have you join us.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.440
We do the show live on Sundays.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.060
You do it at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern over Jupiter.tube.

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.920
This week, big round of applause to our mumble room.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Thank you everybody in there.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.320
Really helped round out the show this week and you could do that too if you joined us

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.080
live at Jupiter.tube.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.760
And details for our mumble room, which is going 24-7, that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760
slash mumble.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.760
All right.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
You get in the theme like slash matrix.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
Made it real easy.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.640
Made it real easy for you.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.120
Just made it nice, nice and simple.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.660
Let's go check it out and join us live sometime.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.080
But if you don't want to, no problem.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.640
We have RSS feeds for you to get the show any way you want, anytime you want.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.280
Just thanks so much for joining us and I'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:49.880
All right.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.120
Now I know we had a couple of more things to touch on.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.160
That topic, we could have talked about the Secure Boot stuff forever, but Jeff, you had

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.560
a comment that maybe there's a communications thing that could be improved here that would

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.960
at least help end users.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.540
I consider the end user to probably be the distro maker, right?

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:13.760
So if there would be a little bit better communication, kind of going back to that whole GNOME topic,

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:19.600
maybe what you brought up, fixing older bugs and stuff like that would be better.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600
It might happen more often.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.960
I mean, we see lack of communication in other industries all the time and these engineers

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.920
come up with these great big grandiose ideas that are supposed to make everybody's life

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.840
better, but nobody speaks to the person that's actually using these products, right?

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.160
So it ends up making things worse in the long run and I just kind of wonder if that, you

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.720
know, the same idea, the same thing's happening here.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720
Right.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.200
I actually would love to have anyone out there in the world.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.960
This show reaches far and wide across the world of Linux users.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.100
Lots of you are out there in the industry.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:56.320
Does anybody want this sort of unified kernel that gets loaded into UEFI that's signed,

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.080
it's full Secure Boot from top to bottom?

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.560
Do you want that?

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560
And no judgment.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:07.560
I'm just curious, is there actual user demand, like maybe, you know, Lenard's working at

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.480
Microsoft and Microsoft's hearing from, I don't know, maybe it's government contractors

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.640
or maybe it's defense people, then they have a certain minimum bar of security and they're

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.480
pushing back and saying it's just not good enough.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.080
And so, you know, the team at Microsoft has been tasked with coming up with a solution

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.920
and Lenard's on it.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.600
Or maybe it's a problem looking for a solution.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.540
I really would love to know if you're listening out there and you're like, no guys, trust

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.540
me in our industry.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.540
We need this.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.540
It's a problem.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.540
Let me know.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.800
Send a boost or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact or ping me on matrix.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.000
Maybe Microsoft can start a discourse forum.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.800
And then just to really put things over the top, and you tech boosted live while we were

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.780
streaming another 300,000 sats, keep that change you filthy animal.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.760
Let's push the total to 500,000 sats for today's show.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.360
This boost is for some extra support for Brent and Wes.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.560
Brent, I hope everything's OK with the family and Wes, I hope you feel better soon.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.580
And Chris, keep the great shows coming.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.280
And you tech, thank you so much.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.680
Truly our baller booster this week.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.680
Much, much appreciation.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:28.840
Hey, Rich Lobster.
