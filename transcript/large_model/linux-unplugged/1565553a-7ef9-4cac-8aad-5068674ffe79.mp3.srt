1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Is anybody in here running any docker images in the mumble room?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Anybody use docker?

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Well, I think docker is getting pretty popular

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Yeah

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm worried that we are creating ourselves a bit of a long-term problem with docker

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,920
They could give us a bit of a bad name and the BSD guys are gonna give us a hard time about it

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,300
We got to get our act together when it comes to docker containers

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
So a study was just done recently

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,440
Showing that over 30% of official docker images in the docker hub contain high priority security vulnerabilities

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,020
Honestly, what did you expect?

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:42,260
So what I mean really what did you expect? I mean that is the fundamental trade-off either we have everything is linked

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,820
So you have the binary and that links to all these libraries and those libraries are dynamically updated which let's face it in practice

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,780
Never works. Well, it well, I wouldn't say never okay fine. I mean it almost never work. I don't know

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,020
I think that's a little harsh. It's not harsh eventually

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
It will cause a problem eventually usually causes a problem

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,220
But if you think about it

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,900
That is that problem happens the minority of the time because your system works the majority of the time

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,500
That's true. So so in the grand scheme of things, I agree with you

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,340
However, yeah from the I follow what you say

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,140
But it comes to like if you need that one piece of software that one piece of software doesn't work and I have been bitten

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,060
By this so many times that I I admit that I am I am like I'm overly sensitive to the issue

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,340
Yeah

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,540
But well and you're working at it from an enterprise angle to where it's much more of an issue

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,620
Right because these companies like I said, they release cut they release software for one version of Linux

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,340
Oh, here's the issue though

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,700
I mean, yeah, I guess it's not that surprising but we're talking things like these Docker containers are vulnerable to shell shock heart bleed poodle

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,500
Etc

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,420
And then images published by Docker users not explicitly verified by any authority

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,060
Like if you just go to like the general images in the Docker hub, it goes up to 40% of the images having serious

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,380
security vulnerabilities over 40% and

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
a lot of them are old

32
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,180
Mercurial when you look at the official images is the number one source of

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,020
Vulnerabilities, but of course when you look at community images ones that are not from the official hub

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,400
Then the vulnerabilities primarily come from bash

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,960
apt open SSL

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,660
File bin utils mercurial rpm like, you know the basic stuff sequel pseudo

37
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,860
HTTP W get like these things are just not getting patched and they're getting these weird vulnerabilities

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,660
So now I think you're being too harsh. Really? Well, here's this look at this. Okay, but the numbers Noah are are disgraceful

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,700
I mean, we're talking we're talking really well known vulnerabilities that have been taken care of we're talking it

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,940
We're talking like you put this stuff into production unless you have taken serious mitigation steps

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,860
40% of these images created by the community have critical vulnerabilities and by the way, dude

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,620
if you drop from critical down to medium vulnerabilities and you include everything rated as medium then

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,740
70% of the images have vulnerabilities. Yeah, but so let's start with this you start with a

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,540
Technology that is relatively new right Docker has not been around a terribly long time

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,340
He is still they I mean that you people granted people were putting into production before Docker even said

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,140
But the reality is it was just last year

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,620
I think it was that self when the guy came out and said alright

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,740
We've actually fully we actually now support you to put this into production

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Yeah, not like it's been out that long to begin with second of all, they're doing something relatively groundbreaking

50
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:17,460
Runbreaking from the standpoint that we don't really have any sort of cross-platform container that can you know cross distro cross?

51
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,060
Yeah, that's true. Okay, so then you have that working for you

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,100
Then add to that the fact that the people that are doing this the people that are smart enough and the people that have the

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,220
Resource to do this have other things to do

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,180
So they might be able to create this Docker container, but the ability to sit there and maintain it and update it constantly

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,480
Yeah, I think I better things to do right? Well, so Corky you think this is just fundamentally

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,560
The flaw with having a Docker hub

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,560
Well, I don't think we really need it

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,360
the whole point of having a hub is to replace what official package repositories if we just

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,480
Did what the rocket project is really about just taking the container and then sticking it in package repos

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,920
such as the Ubuntu repos or the arch repos and have people

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
install and

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
it use

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,800
Docker containers from official package repositories, would this be a big issue? That's an interesting approach, you know

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
I was gonna argue with you. You're right

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
I mean, I guess you could take the rocket approach and that that and do it at the distro level

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,640
I wanted to back up and say is doesn't this actually justify the need of a hub because here's a different approach

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,920
What if okay?

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,520
So what these guys are doing this this guy at Banny Ops that wrote up the post is they're doing a analysis of the code

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,520
They're scanning it. They're checking out these images. They're running a vulnerability assessments against them and they're creating like Nessus reports

70
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
or whatever the hell they're using

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Somebody at the Docker company could just as easily do this Docker could automate this process

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Docker could automate the flagging of images that have known vulnerabilities. It could even rate them with scores

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
They can say this one is had high vulnerabilities

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,680
Docker could do all of this and they could add that as a value add to the Docker hub because I I think there is

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,400
A place in the market for the Docker hub, you know, we were talking about

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,880
This new that new office suite that's going to be server-side Google Docs competitor

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,800
And they're bringing it to Linux for the first time and they're off their option for distribution when they come to Linux for the first

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Time is a Docker image because they can wrap their heads around a centralized repository that distributes these Docker containers down to end-users

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,120
For server just for server software for server software deployment

80
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,520
It does make some sense have one spot to go for all Linux distros

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,600
I don't know if I wanted to be Docker

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
I don't know if I wanted to be owned by a company

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,320
But I think it's interesting to give the market a chance to play this out because you could see a value add by doing that

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Automated vulnerability assessment automated checking rating things, you know Docker could staff that up

85
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Almost treat it like App Store reviews without all the dickishness of it and make sure people know

86
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,280
Right now though and almost feel like Docker is being negligent in this matter because these are on their platform because these are being offered

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,800
Up to their end-users. Is it not the responsibility to make sure I guess how far do you take it?

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,480
Because if you say it's Docker's responsibility to make sure that these things don't have vulnerabilities

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,560
Then isn't it also Docker's responsibility to make sure they don't have backdoors or rootkits, right?

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,360
I mean, I wouldn't say that what I would say is it's Docker's responsibility if they're going to have a central hub

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:17,020
To give an interface that will allow people to to communicate what they like and what they don't like so take Torrance

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,540
For example, right there is a there is a there is a great system in place and it's not mandated by you know

93
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,160
By any user group. It's not mandated by by any committee

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
But the reality is when you go on to the pirate bay

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,460
I can tell you the best torrent to download from the worst

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,400
Because that that's all being rated on voted on and if there was some that had that had some some snarky snark

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,920
That was connected to that torrent

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,000
I would know about that because it would be in the comments or if there's some sort of yeah

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,800
So is that really that hard to implement? That's kind of what you're talking about, right?

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,280
Yeah, I guess that actually works and even like at the AUR level like I know yeah

101
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm going right comments and usually know what's up. Mm-hmm. That's a good point

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,080
And I guess that would sort of be a good middle ground for now

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,820
And then the other thing is from their perspective all they have to do is provide the infrastructure everything else

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,220
It will be provided by the users

105
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,460
Yeah, yeah right now

106
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,720
It's a bit of a it's a bit of a clown show and they need to get it cleaned up

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,740
Because it's all happening really fast around them and people aren't gonna take it seriously if it has these kinds of problems

108
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,120
I think and I think you know, there's gonna be competitors out there. They're coming up

109
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,440
I mean canonicals launching their own format. You got obviously the rocket stuff coming out of the core OS project

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,000
You got the free BSD guys have had jails and had this fixed up figured out for a really really long time already

111
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,780
Plus they can back it up with a great file system that also provides a lot of advantages in conjunction with jails

112
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,000
Right, and we should just get all that done in just a couple months here. Yeah

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Come on I mean like so

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,200
July is that about when it came out like officially officially they were yeah when they said

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,360
It was when the latest Red Hat Enterprise 7 shipped. Okay, that would have been yeah

116
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
So June July somewhere around that was that was and I'm using air quotes here 1-0

117
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Yeah, but 1-0 shipped it shouldn't have been a 1-0, but I think I think they had that new partnership with Red Hat

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah, you know Red Hat didn't want to ship a non 1-0 thing in Red Hat Enterprise

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,000
And so I think they called it 1.0. Yeah, even though they didn't even have like signing and things like that

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, but yeah, it is new. The thing is the reason but here's what?

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
Here's where and then we can get off this cuz probably people don't care too much

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,520
But I think here's where we would give them a little too much slack

123
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,440
It's new. Mm-hmm, but the technology they're using they didn't invent right?

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Yes, they're using kernel features like right the container ization has been around

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Oh, yeah

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,880
What they invented is the layer that sits on top that does the github like checkout check in the container formats

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,800
They came like they the specs they came up with all of that stuff and that's super value-added

128
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,120
That's obviously made a huge difference and cannot be downplayed. But at the same time that's the layer they're working at

129
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,340
I mean obviously they're working with those other layers too because you know

130
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,520
They have coded that layer there there they have interest there, right?

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,880
But what I'm trying to say is like this is the area they should be focusing on

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,560
This is where their energy should be going. So like there is only so much so much room

133
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm willing to give them it's not like they're creating the entire container ization from whole cloth and they have that entire burden

134
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Yeah, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I agree

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,640
That's it

136
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Not the trip set or anything. Oh

137
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,080
Also, also why why can I say sorry? Why are people complaining about the pack that?

138
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,780
Containers having vulnerabilities when they can just update them

139
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,640
Vulnerable software in the containers themselves. Yeah, here's the issue and I was just reading I was just reading a blog post about this

140
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,780
Had this, you know, and this is part of what I think gets me a little pissy about this issue. I don't

141
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:38,580
know if you ever he ever worked with a developer who just really hates the sysadmin like the sysadmin is the guy that slows me down

142
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,820
He's always worried about security permissions

143
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,340
He's always got a firewall rule that I have to go talk to him about guy wants to do updates and it breaks my program

144
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,060
Like they just hate the sysadmin right? Yeah in fairness. A lot of sysadmins hate the developers. Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. All right, and

145
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,060
so one of these guys one of these developers is

146
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,100
Brogging about why docker is so great and it's not because it you know makes it takes care of you know, all the different distros

147
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,380
And it makes a single point of just deploying software through the hub

148
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,980
No, no

149
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:12,680
The reason why this guy likes docker is because now the sysadmin doesn't screw his stuff up with silly updates and permissions

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,980
He just gives the silly sysadmin. He didn't say silly

151
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,260
He just gives the silly sysadmin one file and it's a two-step process to get his creation right up on the server

152
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,820
And then he doesn't in his words mess it up anymore

153
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,500
And the whole idea is and the reason why I'm bringing this up is right

154
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,380
There is a mentality where people are creating docker images and they are creating these things thinking

155
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,580
This is a static world that will never change the world around it is gonna be updated

156
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,660
It's gonna be chaotic libraries gonna change kernels are gonna change whatever but this container everything in this world this Ubuntu

157
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,460
Yeah, 1404 little world in here or 1204 little world here will never ever change. You don't want to know something Chris

158
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,760
I like that. I know but that's an administrator and I like that. That's the problem though

159
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,220
That's because then the things were those processes maybe say like what what do you what for example?

160
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,340
Let's say you put the Zimbra inside a container wouldn't that be you know?

161
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,380
Just get Zimbra in a container and keep it nice and contained on it on a CentOS box

162
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,300
The problem is what if in that container?

163
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Zimbra is using a version of IMAP that gets to be a year old or so that has another heart bleed like vulnerability in right?

164
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,020
Well, then you have to go update that container to get rid of that vulnerability

165
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,940
But now you are doing something that was against the original design of the people that distributed that container

166
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,780
So your only option at that point is to essentially and I might have this wrong, but I believe the container

167
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,380
Well, you you yeah, you essentially not this is the right wrong word

168
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,060
But you essentially like fork the container you copy it and now begin running your own version of you maintain separately

169
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,700
Right than the one that comes from Docker Hub, right?

170
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,540
So there are a couple things one is I would rather have an insecure program than no program

171
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,580
So if my choices are to run something insecure

172
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,700
Are you sure like are you sure like in the in like, you know, like something that could be really bad like that

173
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,300
You know where people can read the memory on your server and stuff like that

174
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm I go back to to to a client I had and this was not all that terribly long goes in fact one of the first

175
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,400
things I it's I we had set up them up with the system 76 computer and the

176
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,740
the version of Ubuntu that had shipped with the system 76 was

177
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,060
Newer than the last LTS, but the Intel drivers to get the Wi-Fi to work had to have that that newer kernel

178
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,140
So we ran into this weird issue where the software

179
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,780
Software manufacturer would not give us they didn't have a version that would run on the newest version of Ubuntu

180
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,880
Right, but he didn't have Wi-Fi

181
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,180
So the solution was as crappy as it sounds he bought a brand new laptop and he had to have a USB dongle for a couple

182
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
months until and

183
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,940
So if my and I think if that was if that was a wider scale if we're going out to a server something like that

184
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:40,100
If my choices are there's some sort of security vulnerability and granted heart bleed is a bit of an extreme example

185
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,780
That would probably require us to sit down and talk about if using that software then is really still the best course of action

186
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,940
But if if it's anything slightly smaller than that

187
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,540
I would rather have the software work at all rather than even if it has some security flaws then not have access to that solution

188
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,980
Yeah, I mean I can I can follow that line of thought for especially a class of software and use cases like

189
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
word processor or

190
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,820
Anything that doesn't have anything that doesn't here's where I draw the line

191
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,260
Mm-hmm anything that could potentially reveal my user information or other users of the systems information

192
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,520
So like say Jupiter broadcasting had its own mail server, right?

193
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,000
And we were running it very likely if we did that we would be running it on a container on a digital ocean droplet

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,860
Right, and let's say let's go back to this timber thing. Let's say we got a compromise. Mm-hmm now

195
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,860
Maybe I wouldn't care so much about my information leaking out because I'd probably have a unique password for that server

196
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,160
And so they just compromise just that account getting my email would suck

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,200
But I do have the responsibility of everybody else that log. Yeah, right

198
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,560
And so if you know Rekha is logging in and Alan's logging in and you're logging into it and Angela's like everybody's logging into this

199
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,000
thing

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,180
If that thing starts to have a year old see the problem is too is the longer these vulnerabilities hang around things like shell

201
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:59,640
Shock and heart bleed. Mm-hmm. Those are so well known and there's such low-hanging fruit and some of them like heart bleed can be diagnosed

202
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,800
Remotely that they just get they just get written into into IP scanner scripts

203
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,600
yeah, and then you know, it becomes really almost no effort for them to start banging on your box and reading, you know, what I

204
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,840
It's like because it's so easy for them to do it and because other people are impacted by it

205
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,480
I feel like I have the responsibility to keep it even up to date even if I don't care about my own personal data

206
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,580
Right, so I'm not saying that security isn't important, right?

207
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm not saying that we shouldn't have a methodology for updating

208
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm saying that the priority level should be get the software to work then let's make it secure and

209
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,240
So that means that the security then falls upon whoever is releasing that docker container

210
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,600
That shouldn't necessarily rely on you

211
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,440
So when something like heart bleed comes out and all this data is leaked

212
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,960
We I think we should just treat docker containers just like we would treat a piece of software

213
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,520
Thunderbird had a had a security for saying the vendor should update it

214
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,160
Right. Well, I'm just saying you wouldn't you wouldn't expect to say well Thunderbird has a security vulnerability

215
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,760
I better log in there and and open the

216
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,680
So shouldn't the way it work is like so say let's go back to Zimbra again because it's like we can both wrap our brain around

217
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,320
This shouldn't December guys. Let's say they're distributing their software by a docker containers

218
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
shouldn't they

219
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,800
Test it in a docker container on their network

220
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,840
Certify that the latest security updates work and then publish that version of the docker hub and then have that

221
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,160
Distributed down to all of the people that are subscribed to that docker container

222
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,100
yeah, shouldn't it basically be like a software vendor update because if they can test in a container and

223
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,060
Verify it works and push those changes up to the docker hub and then everybody else is in a container

224
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,100
It's not like there's random library vulnerabilities are randomness or anything like that

225
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,620
They can just overwrite the same files like it seems like the solution here is for the vendor to patch

226
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,860
But then the vendors in order to do that are gonna expect some money like you want us to update your our images

227
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,740
Then you're gonna have to pay us for a support contract

228
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,220
Yeah, there's no there's no way vendors are gonna update an Ubuntu 1404 container for five years for free, right? Yeah

229
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Yeah, that's probably they would I don't know

230
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,660
Maybe they would just maybe they would because that's how people are getting their software. I

231
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,940
Don't know but it's an interesting

232
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,020
It's an interesting world

233
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,980
We're moving into a software over the over the next couple of years on Linux is gonna change a lot

234
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,080
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that invites you to insert your own Monday morning joke

235
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,500
My name is Chris. My name is Noah. Hey Noah. Hey Monday here. Happy Monday. Happy Monday

236
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,100
So we're doing this show on a Monday cuz Noah's here. He's flying out this evening. What are you flying out? Well?

237
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,760
Hopefully tomorrow tomorrow morning or whatever. Yeah, we wanted to record today

238
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,660
Yeah, we say tomorrow morning, but really that involves leaving here at like 1 30 in the morning Wow

239
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,940
Yikes yikes. Well, so that's we're gonna get you now before we have to worry about that coming up on today's show

240
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,740
We're gonna follow up on our fedora 22 review in just a little bit

241
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:50,380
We're gonna spend some time talking about Gnome 3.18 the upcoming version of Gnome and also Gnome 3.16 victory lap

242
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,060
As of fedora 22. Yeah, I know. I know. I know I'm being a little insinuating

243
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,700
Also, we're gonna talk about the new Google Cardboard how it could work for Linux Dell's perhaps huge embrace of Ubuntu

244
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,180
This is a big deal. We're gonna talk about that

245
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,340
And then also we have a little surprise coming up in the feedback section of the show Noah. It's a packed show

246
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,100
So like somehow even though you and I were just on air less than 24 hours ago doing the Linux action show

247
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,500
Yeah, we just talked about Linux. How is there more Linux to talk about?

248
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,000
We literally just literally been less than 24 hours since we did last yeah, does that blow your mind a little bit

249
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
Yeah, it's been like less than 12 hours since last actually got published

250
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,120
Wow talk about a content factory. Hey, so let's get into the catch-up

251
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,580
There's some interesting stories that have actually managed to develop since we put together Linux actions

252
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,020
Even though it's only been a couple of hours

253
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,500
So I want to bring in the mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual lug I'm like is anybody there

254
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,940
Wow, okay, we lost them all so Google I oh was last Thursday

255
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,760
And it was the biggest IO in the history of the world

256
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,420
Which isn't that actually hard of a record to set when you think about there's only been so many IOs and Google just keeps

257
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,700
Getting bigger, but it was a monster

258
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,260
It was like a four-hour keynote, and I am excited pretty much about one thing

259
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,100
I mean, I'm excited about a few things that came out, but hear more my hear more of my thoughts in code radio

260
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
but for us Linux users I

261
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,860
Think there's some potentially I think we need to get on board with this you familiar with Google Cardboard

262
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,540
I am yeah, they're VR cardboard that they gave out at last year's

263
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,220
Google IO you know it's funny

264
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,080
I've heard this described a couple of ways some people say this is Google flailing saying they can't come up with any ideas in the

265
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,060
VR market, and so they're just dropping this on the public and saying here figure it out

266
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,620
I am not such a pessimist so they updated their two point

267
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,700
They just a Google Cardboard VR 2.0

268
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,740
And it just supports up to six inch screens now including internet phones if you're a masochist and it is

269
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,860
Completely published as an open spec. There's already websites

270
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,860
That's they're selling an entire kit for like $20 or whatever

271
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,240
Uh-huh and you basically get a fully usable VR environment

272
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,400
When it comes with little glasses that it comes preset in there that are in there

273
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,860
And you just put your smartphone in there, and you have legitimate virtual reality for $30

274
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
And there's already apps out there to do this

275
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,600
There's already apps in the Play Store to take advantage of it

276
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,340
And there's nothing that says you couldn't hook it up to a Linux box and create

277
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,300
this could be the avenue for the community to create their the beginnings of their own open source response to the

278
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,460
Oculus Rift yeah, yeah, you know what's neat about that is if that so imagine this

279
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,500
Oculus wants to take this the the quote-unquote high road with yeah with with

280
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,700
Microsoft

281
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,140
Microsoft they make do they make small things well they make that the that challenger to Linux I

282
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,580
Microsoft it's that sounds like a viagra competitor to me

283
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,980
Windows they make Windows you've ever used it yeah, man

284
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,220
It cost a lot of money because it crashes a lot and stuff, but and they break you know like yeah

285
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,020
Yeah, yeah, but they have but it has tiles so

286
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
okay, but they

287
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
So they're gonna take that road

288
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,420
Imagine this imagine imagine when imagine when this takes off like the Raspberry Pi does and everyone that wants to play

289
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,840
Everyone wants to play with it goes there well

290
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,780
I could get that thing, but I'm locked into the games that they tell me I can play with the operating system

291
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,500
They tell me I can play with and and the SDK that they're gonna

292
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,780
Tell me when it's gonna release and then there's this and it's like I think do it's almost a bigger competitor to Samsung Samsung

293
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,140
Gear VR is essentially this you put a smartphone in the gear VR, but Corky

294
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,740
Do you oh, I'm sorry it was in a go-go in a go-go

295
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,560
Do you think that maybe we're just getting too excited that Google cardboard is kind of a crappy product?

296
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,940
Yeah, mainly the cardboard bit because I I got the last version for Christmas, and it was and by

297
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,140
The end of February it kind of had fallen apart

298
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,820
so

299
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,460
Would it would it make you feel better that there is several different companies that right now that are working on

300
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,900
3d printed versions of Google Cardboard

301
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,420
So it's a much sturdier case you can print it out at home or buy it it comes with the lenses you can get it

302
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,340
In different colors, there's a lot of people that are working on different kinds of moldings for the Google Cardboard, too

303
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,240
It doesn't actually have to be cardboard. It's just the nice thing about cardboard is you can make it yourself, and it's

304
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,520
It's sturdy and it's so great thing about the correlation

305
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,740
Yeah, but not all phones work with it either because some

306
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,620
For what there's one feature that requires a compass because it's like this trigger on the side yeah

307
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,260
And not all phones have a compass

308
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah, and there is definitely limitations there. I know I mean I kind of look at that as like saying well

309
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,680
Not all HDMI monitors. No, no, it's not are gonna work with are gonna work with the raspberry pi

310
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,460
I also look at this as sort of a Model T

311
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,300
That is available to the community to tinker with not like not like a full-on competitor like honestly

312
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,680
We need to start somewhere. It's kind of my philosophy about it is and when you get that price point down

313
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,320
so and this is the thing that was great about the pie, and that's this is what's great about this thing is I

314
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,280
Cannot afford to spend five or six or seven hundred dollars on a computer for a project that may or may not work

315
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,380
But I can spend the I can spend the the money

316
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,160
$30-$40 on a piece of cardboard to to put my phone in to play with it, and if it doesn't work. That's fine

317
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Yeah, yeah, I do agree with you there, and I I look forward to seeing where it goes

318
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Hopefully there's something that comes out of it. It doesn't just fizzle away

319
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,280
I don't think it will but I'd like to see the open-source community embrace it there could be I mean just think about the potential

320
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,700
Windowing environments all kinds of things could be really cool

321
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
but

322
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,460
We'll have to wait and see hey Noah. I know that you and I've talked about Dell before mm-hmm

323
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Matt wasn't a huge fan Adele. Yeah

324
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm not a huge fan. I I I talk about Dell kind of like I talk about

325
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,180
Cars and things like that like I feel like Dell's like a pretty good choice

326
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,580
It's not always gonna blow me away

327
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,940
But it's gonna get me a pretty good value for the price and come with a warranty so full disclosure

328
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,820
As you know I'm an I we own an IT company, and we are partnered with Dell so

329
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
My I'm probably a little biased

330
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,940
Because I've been we've had a very very good experience with Dell and part of that experience

331
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,580
Probably comes from the fact that Dell really values their commercial market

332
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,100
Which is kind of funny because when Dell started they started really valuing that consumer market and somehow

333
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,880
They kind of made that switch, but from a business perspective the nice thing about Dell is as Dell partner

334
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,220
When I want parts they just they ship them to me and to supply them to a client

335
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,500
So my my experience with Dell has always been

336
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,580
pretty solid on the business side a little a

337
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,280
Little adversarial like when doing large server purchases and things like that and then screwing me a few times on things

338
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,220
I didn't really need are selling me like an entire series of bad tape drives an entire series of bad perk controllers

339
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,760
Which was the entire reason for the partner program because now you don't deal with those people you deal with me

340
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,780
Yeah, and I can come on to your site

341
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,620
And I can look and then and I just go into a portal and order that stuff

342
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,500
Yeah, and but you know and but my preferred my preference there though is I mean not to deal with people like you yeah

343
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm sure like I actually prefer like the IX approach

344
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,780
Yeah, and that's sort of when I realized where I have the issues with Dell

345
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,660
But if you remove that layer of Dell I like I like things like their service tag set up

346
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,820
I like that you know they have a really good database

347
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,420
And you just really look up all the drivers for your machine and and like they have to be fair like when we have those

348
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,740
Tape drives that just failed one after another they're always very solid about replacing them right

349
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:15,980
And so I what I've always met ran down with issues with Dell has been in the consumer space and sort of how they like

350
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,940
They kind of keep putting their foot in with Linux, and then they dump it and they're like oh just kidding in the US

351
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,240
Yes in the US because in other parts of the world. That's a very different story

352
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,600
Right and that's what's been very frustrating for me is to see them be committed in other parts of the world and be like why

353
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,760
Aren't you committing here? Just stick to it like you do in other places. Just stick to it. Yeah, and so I was really happy

354
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
That when they first launched the spots

355
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Sorry, China China China for China for example, and yeah, and India yeah

356
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,320
I mean so they have they have they have widely push in fact if you go to like the kiosks in the mall here

357
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,080
We see kiosks in the mall that have Dell computers if you go over to China or India

358
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,380
You go into those into those malls

359
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,820
You're gonna see a lot of Ubuntu kiosks

360
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,620
And they're gonna push the computers that that run Ubuntu and the reason for that is is because the market is so much

361
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,660
I think the market is better there

362
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,060
They believe the market is better there to push those open source solutions that they can do that in the US

363
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,580
Yeah, I guess and I guess it's probably partially driven by cost and partially you know other other factors political. Maybe I don't know

364
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,140
but

365
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,900
That has always kind of left a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Dell's approach the Sputnik program first gave me some

366
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,860
Hope and then the spike and then they then they launched the XPS 13 spotting version which is a pretty solid machine

367
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,860
So I when I saw this article this kind of grabbed my attention like this seems to be

368
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,020
Another pretty big step in the right direction for Dell's commitment to Ubuntu

369
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,420
Check this out Noah. You know of course Dell and canonical have been longtime partners, and they just updated

370
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,260
What was that $200 Ubuntu Dell laptop? Yeah? I just I was just pulling that up

371
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,160
It is the it is the it's it's a 250. It's a 250 $49 laptop

372
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,160
And in fact I have a person in my mind of who might be the first recipient

373
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,140
It's like a week out right right right so what's gonna end up happening is I think I'm gonna start her with a

374
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,160
With with another computer that I have set up, but if it takes off, and she's like you know

375
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,700
I really like this thing just be nice to have it on some newer hardware. It's the inspiron 15 3000

376
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Yes, it's available for $249 and comes pre-installed with Ubuntu and

377
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Specs on it and all there. Yeah, I have it actually right in front of me. It is a

378
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,940
So it's for four gigabytes of RAM. It's an Intel Celeron, which is basically what you expect

379
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,220
Well, so what this is I know I know what this is Chris

380
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,940
That's right, but it's a Chromebook that I can just that comes with Linux

381
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,820
And I think that'll do all right 500 gig

382
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,920
It's a spinning it's a spinning rust drive of course integrated graphics

383
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:45,240
And then 1366 by 768 by 4 for 250 you could go you go of new egg spend another 80 bucks and put a decent SSD

384
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,820
In there right and the thing is for the people that are checking their email for the people that are browsing Facebook

385
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Editing editing some basic work documents not doing anything too heavy. This is a great computer form yeah

386
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,700
I think that's I think it's a real sell for down. Yeah, that's yeah

387
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,460
That's it so they're playing at the XPS level which is around a grand another playing down at the $250 level

388
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,820
I think the $250 level is I'm surprised somebody else like HP or somebody else doesn't come out and say let's take our Chromebook hard

389
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,740
We're just put Ubuntu on exactly why not what's it up?

390
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,060
What's gonna? Is it off there because they I think that those companies think that there is a bigger investment to be made on

391
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,300
Google's Chrome OS yeah, and I honestly I honestly suspected to that

392
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,580
Intel and Google have been subsidizing the hardware, and I believe Intel is pulling back on that now to a degree yeah, so anyways

393
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,620
Dell tweeted out on the 27th of May

394
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,220
Del's a delcarespro account at delcarespro mm-hmm tweeted out time for a new OS

395
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:43,420
Time for a new OS why not try hashtag Ubuntu check out our Ubuntu installation guide this is coming from Dell's official

396
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, verified Twitter account insane time for a new OS check out Ubuntu from Dell's freaking Twitter account. That's pretty cool

397
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,260
I'm gonna check how many followers that maybe they don't have any followers, so it doesn't matter

398
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,820
Well, they have say of almost they have 10,000 followers

399
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,340
So that's not bad. You know there's the Dell's global technical support for business customers

400
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,460
Follow us to get valuable information and support your company's IT infrastructure

401
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,860
And they're recommending people try out Ubuntu, and they've included a link to a Dell support article

402
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,900
Which is how to install Ubuntu Linux on your Dell PC?

403
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,360
Yeah, this is legit look at this article. This is legit. Yeah

404
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah, and you know the thing is there are other things that Dell can push

405
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,720
And you are the chat room is figuring it out that Dell can sell this computer and say listen

406
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,440
You don't need an upgrade for an antivirus it

407
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,720
It's not necessary, so yeah, that's not necessarily a perk for Dell though

408
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,160
Those are those are upsells that don't make money. That's money

409
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,640
That's that's true, but the but Dell also makes money off of selling their computers

410
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,520
And if they can get away with saying this is a more competitive product

411
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,560
Then the then other offerings from other manufacturers that puts a leg up everyone's buying this

412
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:54,400
$259 computer instead of the instead of the instead of the $300 HP that is at best buy well

413
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,600
If they can deploy Ubuntu, I don't know what their arrangement is with canonical

414
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
But I gotta imagine they're probably not paying for every seat of Ubuntu mm-hmm

415
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,360
So no, and I don't really know the details of Dell very well

416
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,880
I don't know maybe you follow them, but are they now a private company? Yeah?

417
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Well, so this may be the result of all this that this is that's a complicated question to the best of my understanding

418
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,660
They are owned by a private company, which is owned by

419
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,220
Actually, I believe it's Microsoft

420
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:26,220
The company that the company that took that the company that gave them the money to buy Dell back is backed by Microsoft investors

421
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,500
I got an idea so when in doubt you know you know what we do when in jail

422
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,520
We ask we just ask okay, Google

423
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Who owns Dell?

424
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,940
Let's see what according to the Dallas Morning News

425
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:46,100
Dell Inc. which had grown to one of the biggest computer makers in the world during 25 years as a public company is now privately held

426
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:54,220
Michael Dell the 48 year old company founder and CEO owns about three-quarters of the company and his investment ally Silver Lake Partners

427
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,700
That's right. Okay, okay, so if you look Silver Lake is some partners. Yeah is somehow in bed with Mike. Yeah

428
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah, I do remember that now. I wonder if okay Google

429
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:20,780
Who is Silver Lake Partners? According to Wikipedia, Silver Lake is an American private equity firm focused on leverage, buyout, and growth capital investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries.

430
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Yeah, founded in 1999 it says so that's interesting. That's really yeah

431
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,660
So and I actually said it my Dell rep is very very much aware of my of my strong Linux preference, right?

432
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:39,420
And so he knows better that he knows better than to ever recommend a product or tell me about a product that I can't put Linux

433
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,020
Yeah, so when this came through I actually called him and I said hey, you know

434
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,300
How is this gonna affect things?

435
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,580
Because right now every Dell I've ever bought I've been able to throw Linux on and it works right out of the box

436
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,300
Is that gonna change with me? And he said no, it's not because you're worried about the Microsoft connection

437
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,340
Yeah, and this seems to be an indication. Maybe you shouldn't be worried. Yeah

438
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,580
Well in his and here's the thing I know you can't actually trust to be quite honest

439
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,780
I don't actually trust everything he says because he's yeah, he's gonna he's gonna sell me the company

440
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
So he knows what I want to hear

441
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,420
Yeah, because I made it very clear to him in the past

442
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,500
So I know what he's gonna say even before I asked but I wanted to get it on record here

443
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,020
We are and this is why I brought this whole topic up is because here we are on the preface of like what's Dell doing?

444
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,520
Are they doing some good stuff here? I mean they're shipping more machines than ever with Ubuntu

445
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,940
They're tweeting out to their business customers switch to Ubuntu

446
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,900
They're creating guides on their support site how to switch your Dell machine over to Ubuntu, but then they're owned

447
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
by

448
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,340
They are they are owned by Michael Dell Michael Dell got his money from a finance company

449
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,820
Which yeah, but so there are so many steps of removal from Microsoft that the influence may be maybe not there at the end

450
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,640
I'm excited to see where this is going. I'm getting excited. Yeah, are you getting excited about well?

451
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,420
I'm getting excited because I've been excited for a little while because as a Dell partner, that's that's what we sell

452
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,600
That's what we give to customers

453
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,160
So I need to be able to go into those clients and say well you bought your computer with Windows

454
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,820
I want to put Linux on it, and I've never had a problem doing that

455
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,700
And I don't ever want to have a problem doing that right

456
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,860
but the thing that is exciting about this two hundred forty nine dollar laptop is I

457
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,560
Am the kind of person that if I see somebody that is not using Linux

458
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,800
I would like to get them to use Linux and to do that oftentimes that means they're just buy them a machine

459
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,140
What that means I was trying to think of a more graceful way to say it

460
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,580
But the reality is is a lot of times if I come to your house, and you have everything set up

461
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,060
You're not just gonna. Let me erase your computer. Yeah, put something else on it, but you will yeah

462
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,620
Well if I'm like here play with this new toy

463
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,580
Yeah, you'd give it a shot especially if it's nicer, and then once you get it hooked

464
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,560
And I just dealt with this I just dealt with this before I came out here

465
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,980
There was a guy that I had we he actually bought a Lenovo yoga based off of

466
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,820
My recommendation based off what Angela was doing yeah?

467
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,900
And the way I got him to switch was I didn't give him a laptop

468
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
But I gave him a hard drive with Linux on it and put it in his existing laptop

469
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,500
And he just didn't want to go back yeah, and then he bought hardware, and yep windows is gone

470
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,220
Yeah, but so this two hundred forty nine dollar laptop is because there's a limit to how much I can do that right yeah

471
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,840
I have a finite budget, but two hundred forty nine dollar laptop brand new

472
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,500
That's it with a warranty. I mean you might go into my cost a little more

473
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
And maybe they'll let you customize and put an SSD in there

474
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,960
Rotten corpse you have information about the Silver Lake connection there

475
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah, the reason why there was a connection to Microsoft is because they're like owned inside of a consortium. They owned part of

476
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,820
70% of Skype oh

477
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,460
Okay, oh interesting so when they sold the Skype and they become part of

478
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,700
They like it wasn't completely like there's actually some kind of stuff with like the CEOs of Silver Lake or some kind of connected

479
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,440
As well, but it was it all started with Skype in 2000 I see thank you for the information and Corky

480
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,140
You think maybe we're getting too excited. Maybe there's a much more practical reason for this

481
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,440
I think I haven't checked recently, but Dell has traditionally had a

482
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,160
Banner saying Dell recommends Windows 8 for quite a while. Yeah, that must have been an

483
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,080
Advertising deal and if that's come to an end, and they know no longer a contractually obliged to

484
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,240
Recommend Windows right they might be taking advantage with this could you imagine?

485
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,060
Yeah, because you're right they probably had a they have they might even had a they might had a marketing deal

486
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,720
That was so lucrative and so important to Dell that it might have been something like you need to position your company as

487
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,480
Supporting Windows like your entire company needs to position and then Dell's wiggling these Ubuntu machines out

488
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,740
And then if that deal expires they're no longer. I mean who knows yeah

489
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,200
Maybe the reality is the band in a go-go is checking their sites as the banners are gone

490
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,280
I don't I don't take too much stock in that because the reality is Dell

491
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,280
Doesn't exist to advocate for Linux or open source Dell is has one goal, and I don't make money

492
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
Oh for sure well, but so what I'm where I'm going with that is

493
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,960
This idea that if Dell wants if Dell wants to sell

494
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,320
Computers they're gonna sell with whatever with whatever they think the market wants and so if Microsoft says

495
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,840
They want to recommend Windows 8 so be it but if the people that are looking to buy Ubuntu

496
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't think that's gonna cut into their sales whether that banners there or not because the people that want to buy a bunch of

497
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,800
Laptop will just know I think what I'm saying and maybe Corky's implying too is that?

498
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,600
That marketing contract we're assuming mm-hmm

499
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,960
would

500
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,920
Prevent them from outwardly positioning themselves as supporting Ubuntu like tweeting it and creating guides and things like that right

501
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
I don't I don't but there's

502
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,640
Yeah, huh, I mean Microsoft's in Microsoft's here's what what here's here's the difference between a million dollar contract and a ten million dollar contract

503
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,840
Position your entire company. Here's a ten million dollar contract

504
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,200
So where is the money coming from to position themselves to support Ubuntu selling more machines as that contract expires?

505
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
They're no longer getting that money. They just want to sell more machines

506
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,600
Why not market your Ubuntu machines something haven't heavily marketed before also if I was them I'd be hedging my bets

507
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,040
So that so that's my that's my question. Why is it that you think that that?

508
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,600
That they're going to sell more machines by saying we support it, but I like Corky's there Corky

509
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,680
You have a good theory, and I'm totally on board with it. Yeah. Well. I'm just trying to understand. I just Corky Corky

510
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,220
What's yours? Why why would Dell be doing this right now? You think it's a negotiation tactic?

511
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,120
Well, I well, I hope it's a positive thing, but then this is Dell so maybe they're just trying to force Microsoft

512
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,600
to up their bid

513
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
with renewing this advertising bid I

514
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,200
The reason why I give that stock right is because I think some of the reasons why they've flirted with the Ubuntu market in

515
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,480
The past of them pulled out is they were negotiating with Microsoft

516
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,680
Yeah, that could be I guess what I'm getting at is I don't see I guess what I'm saying is

517
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,820
I don't think it's going to affect their their their Ubuntu market

518
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,320
To a certain extent anyway if they if they remove all those banners and say we support Ubuntu

519
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,720
Or they don't do that because I think the people that are buying an Ubuntu laptop are buying it for two reasons either one

520
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,440
They know the advantages or they want a cheap computer right well

521
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,180
So then then the banner being gone and that might that that that deal expiring probably won't change their dynamic much unless now

522
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,360
They're promoting it more outwardly like through Twitter and on the support calls and things like that

523
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,080
They weren't doing before we can hope we can hope we can know well

524
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,640
I think what we should do is a little market research yeah

525
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,720
Next time you call Dell you ought to ask him about Ubuntu and see what they say sure well my rep like you said

526
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,320
But he know yeah, yeah, yeah your reps gonna. I mean he's a little different cuz he'll look up and before he even gets on

527
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,280
The phone with me, and he'll say well

528
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,640
This is the latest machine we have that runs Linux and you're you'd be happy to know that we had a client that bought a couple

529
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,200
Hundred of these particular latitude series, and they all worked with Linux flawlessly and all right boys

530
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,320
You know all of a sudden

531
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,680
I'm just arguing like notifications like crazy on my phone today like now Spotify's noting notify me about tracks added to the radio stations

532
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,140
I've listened because you're popular. I guess I want I guess what I need to do

533
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,800
I need to Zen out

534
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,920
I need to go to my I need to go to my comfort zone my my sweet spot my place of

535
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,880
Absolute education and focus and learning that's right my friends

536
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,640
I call it the man cave where I bring up Linux Academy comm and I begin to learn and you can too by going to

537
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,040
Linux academy comm slash unplugged sponsor of the unplug program perfect sponsor, and no I you got to check out Linux Academy

538
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,440
Yeah, I have a membership. Whatever it is a subscription. Yeah, yeah, yeah

539
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,240
Go to Linux go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug to get the Linux unplugged 33% discount and then go check out their features

540
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,520
It's a really great service created by people that are truly passionate about Linux and open source, and they do a great job

541
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,280
They have self-paced courses you can get

542
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,920
All the content you can download it offline and like take it at your own pace, too

543
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,880
Which is great for commuters if you want to read the stuff and they have over 1500 video courses for you to take they have

544
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,240
Scenario based lab so you get a real hands-on like experience

545
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,880
Seven plus Linux distributions and the courseware will automatically adjust to those distros and the virtual machines adjust to those distros

546
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,640
I love that

547
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,800
Have you seen some of the new stuff they've rolled out recently so I went to the when when when rel

548
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,720
Release when rel released rel 7 usually I pay my you know

549
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,000
Whatever it is $800 thousand dollars to go out for two days and get a little refresher course

550
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
Yeah, and then they tell me all the things that are new and then I go take the cert

551
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,760
I did all that on Linux Academy this year because Linux Academy has they actually have a course or I

552
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,280
Already have there's there's two courses. There's a course of teach me about Red Hat Enterprise Linux, right?

553
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,760
And then there's a I understand Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I just I've been supporting six. I want to support seven

554
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,200
So tell me what are the what are the headlines?

555
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,720
Give me the bullet points of what if what has changed between six and seven that is so nice

556
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,120
It is because I don't have the time no I know right and you know the thing is training events

557
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,800
The problem is even if the training is really condensed because they do Red Hat does a fantastic job about getting it real down

558
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,080
Yeah, but it's still it's a day. I have to arrive a day ahead of time

559
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,960
Yeah, I have to rent a hotel right the rest of the day after I'm done with the class is blown

560
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,720
So you're probably you're already gonna run a car. I am running a car. I'm paying for meals out

561
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,760
Yeah, there's this huge expense that time suck

562
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,400
Yeah of going to these things and now I can do that on my laptop when I want in my skippies at night

563
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,360
I know and these guys are mostly and this is the best stuff

564
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,440
This is the best stuff around on how to do this and they've got the you can you know

565
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,880
You can get all of the study material. You can bring that with you. They're always keeping the stuff relevant

566
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,960
They just rolled out some new Red Hat stuff. It's really nice

567
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,200
And I think you know and you know what you got to do you got to think about it

568
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,800
They're gonna they're starting to roll out public profiles

569
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,000
So when you're really like your achievement courses and stuff like that on the public profile like you're embarrassed

570
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
You know what Pete the Red Hat stuff like if you did nothing with the Red Hat stuff

571
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,480
It's like at least to be all hardcore stuff on your thing

572
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,360
Well, it's one of those things where like I just do things I'm interested in and then I only a car

573
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,520
I only will look at the area you need. Yeah, that's nice though. It is they've got right? Yes

574
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,080
I know you wouldn't want to publicly show that they've got they've really got like so much great stuff

575
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,740
Like are you gonna try out their Python courses actually so funny you mentioned that

576
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,460
So the not being a developer, but I kind of want to look I'm like you

577
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,120
I kind of want to dabble in the idea of development because I like to understand these things

578
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,020
Exactly, and so the great thing about that was I will because my in my mind is so a DD

579
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,380
I'm like, oh I got done with the Red Hat stuff. Well, I'll go start Python

580
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,680
You know what?

581
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,200
I noticed Chris the guy that teaches Red Hat

582
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,600
Lives eats and breathes Red Hat like you can you can just tell by the way he talks

583
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,040
Yeah, the guy knows Red Hat and like he'll make off-handed comments. Like he'll say oh, you know that you know

584
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,880
This particular thing of course back in version 5 this way. Yeah

585
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,960
That's a guy that's been around

586
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,900
Then I go and take one of their programming courses and that guy knows like everything there is to know

587
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,880
You know about what he's like in their true testaments to their profession

588
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,520
And it's not just like they have hired a couple people and said alright

589
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
You're gonna sit in this room and we're gonna prepare content and then you present it. No, no

590
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
No, they took the time to go find industry experts

591
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,840
Yeah present this stuff and then they have they have you know

592
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,640
Like you've seen that where you can customize the course to do. I just want to learn about this specific

593
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah, that's what they have the new nuggets and there's a ton of them

594
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,160
In fact, you can you can go to Linux Academy comm slash nuggets and just do a deep dive

595
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
I love that as a new feat. That's another new feature

596
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,920
They've just rolled out a lot of cool stuff coming to Linux Academy all the time

597
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,240
That's why the membership makes so much sense

598
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,120
And I want you to get that 33% discount by going to Linux Academy comm

599
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:43,240
Slash unplugged and a big thanks Linux Academy for rockin support of the Linux unplug program. You guys are awesome

600
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,720
Alright, let's get into some emails. We haven't done emails on the unplugged show for a while and we got a bunch

601
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,280
So a Dario are writes in with the Ubuntu CC topics

602
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,240
It's not sure if you guys going to cover this or not

603
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,040
Oh really this one on unplugged or laughs, but I just found this comment on the same site

604
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
I really think they'll understand what's going on

605
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,760
Oh

606
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
All right, so he's talking about the kabuntu drama

607
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Do we want to talk about this? It's up to you

608
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,000
Does anybody in the mumble room want to talk about the kabuntu community council drama? I?

609
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,640
Mean you can if you want to I mean we I'm not avoiding the topic. I just

610
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,460
Okay. Well, here's what I'll say on it. Um in our feedback thread for fedora 22

611
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,000
You can there's there's a comment thread open and Palasso has the epic comment of all comments Noah

612
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,480
It look at this thing here. He breaks down. What is the Ubuntu community council?

613
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,120
What decision is being made the redaction to the decision or I'm sorry the reaction to the decision

614
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,420
I have light shining on my screen and the aftermath plus closing thoughts and he breaks down some acronyms, too

615
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,760
This is such a solid contribution. I don't know what more we could contribute the comment here

616
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,040
Yeah

617
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,480
And we're this there's really been no development for those of you are not familiar what's going on

618
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,920
Jonathan riddle has been asked to stand down as leader of the Ubuntu community council, I guess

619
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,920
He actually explains it all in here and a lot of people in the project are upset by that

620
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,720
the decision remains at a standstill and

621
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,560
Plasso you're in the mumble room right now. Did you have any thoughts you wanted to add to the coverage of it?

622
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,720
Are you right up by the way? Yeah, you seem to be following it very closely

623
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:24,360
Did you have any any follow-up to our coverage or any comments you wanted to kind of get on the record? I don't have anything

624
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,660
Than what I wrote, I would like to mention that there were two things two issues

625
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,200
We're asking about on the community council

626
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,280
Right

627
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,960
that were on the dot-com website and it seems that the

628
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,040
The

629
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,080
community members don't know how they have been used and the other that was

630
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
mentioned was

631
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
the part of the

632
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,840
IP policy of canonical about the binaries

633
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,400
Yeah that you know, and it's one of those things

634
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,480
The the the write-up itself

635
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Explains a lot of that stuff

636
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,640
And goes into it with a little more detail and we talked about it on last

637
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,520
But the reality is we just nobody really knows the whole story, right? Yeah, so it's it's it

638
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,660
We you kind of want to stay away from making present, you know making presumptions

639
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,320
The only information we have is been basically handed to us by yeah one one side of the party

640
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Yeah, so you want to be a little careful on that?

641
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,520
But that's a tough. I don't know if there's a whole lot to add. Yeah, and and I think you know it so the straw poll

642
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,040
We I think it was somebody a corkier

643
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,880
Somebody started a straw poll in the Linux action show subreddit to see do you guys care about this topic?

644
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,520
You know because one of my concerns is do we even should we even be talking about this at all?

645
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,320
Obviously it's getting coverage. It seems to be a popular topic for some people

646
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,640
yeah, and I feel like it seems like we're not paying attention if I

647
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,800
Feel like it comes off that we're not paying attention

648
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,000
If the number one thing in Linux is being talked about all over the internet, and we're like we gloss right over it

649
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah, so right now of 58% of the votes say yes

650
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,480
They do care and 37% of the votes say they don't care

651
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,660
And not only 71 votes of art because it hasn't been a very popular thread, but there's a link in the chat room right now

652
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,100
We'll continue to follow to see if there's been any interesting developments outside of just additional drama like any maybe statements from the canonical guys

653
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:34,780
Oh and also blast so thank you for breaking down the structure of the Ubuntu Community Council that I was good insight today

654
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,140
I was very good to have because it does seem pretty connected to come out canonical basically

655
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,500
It's Mark Shuttleworth and seven people Mark Shuttleworth likes yeah

656
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:48,060
Well, but hold on because it's not actually from canonical right yeah, yeah, the name is not in there

657
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,700
So there are currently so here's here's how it goes just for those of you

658
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,660
I'm making fun

659
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:59,780
But the the Ubuntu Community Council consists of eight people one of them is Mark Shuttleworth and seven seven others are nominated by Mark

660
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,460
Shuttleworth and elected by the community for a term of two years currently

661
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,740
There are two canonical employees Michael Hall and Daniel Halbach and one canonical ex-employee Laura

662
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:17,700
Kozinski the canonical owner himself Mark Shuttleworth and four others from the community one of the roles of the Ubuntu Community Council is to resolve

663
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,140
issues of violation of the CoC

664
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,240
community with code of conduct okay and community disputes with the participation involved members, so

665
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,620
It does kind of seem like a stack deck a bit, but I mean it was there were elections. Yeah, yeah

666
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:37,320
I guess I don't have a problem with them saying this is not an official canonical thing

667
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,220
And it's not the official word of canonical

668
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,260
I don't have a problem with that what I do have a problem is

669
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,220
When people want to try and remove it so far as to say canonical has nothing to do with this

670
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,460
I mean, it's not a canonical thing

671
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,740
It's totally separate that is come on first of all canonical controls the branding of Ubuntu second of all

672
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,820
The head of the community or the member of the board on the Community Council is the head of canonical

673
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,860
So there's definitely a connection there. There's more than a passing connection there. I agree yeah

674
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,300
All right, so David M. Wrightson with a question about open susa. He says hi

675
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm just wondering why you don't mention open susa as an option

676
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,820
I can understand why you don't like Ubuntu and arch is cool, but it's not for production

677
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:20,620
I enjoy your shows. I plan on making contribution next penny. Oh, that's nice. Thanks David, so he's asking about open susa as an option and

678
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,820
Do you want to take well the reason the reason actually I put that in there was because so

679
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,160
He says that arch doesn't belong in production

680
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,260
And you know what if you would ask me before I had spent time in the studio

681
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,860
I would have agreed with him I would have said listen I would not put fedora

682
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,380
I would not put arch on on a production machine

683
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,220
I don't want something that I knew I want my I want to treat the production machine

684
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,340
Essentially like I treat my KitchenAid mixer on the face of it. It actually seems obvious

685
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,900
Yeah, I just want it to be in appliance once I get it working

686
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,500
I never want to touch it again unless the hardware fails right and then I will do something right in practice though in practice

687
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,140
The total opposite has proved to be true

688
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,500
Numerous numerous times so much so to the point that even though I really wanted to put a bunch of matte on here

689
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,580
I don't dare open my mouth because because I know

690
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,880
Basically, I know that three weeks after I leave some update is gonna come in here

691
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,320
And even if we try not to update it somehow that stupid updater

692
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,900
You know rolls back up, and then it's something somebody or we have to install something else you have to update exactly something happens

693
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,860
That's something that's updated

694
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,020
Yeah

695
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:25,260
And then something breaks and now because it's so far gone not just one thing breaks like three different things happen at the exact same

696
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,580
Time and you don't know if they're connected

697
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,220
Yeah, or if they're separate and all of a sudden you've got problems like every time you reboot your sound cards get remapped right?

698
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:37,140
And so and I've I have argued that perhaps in media production because of the underlying stuff

699
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,580
We rely on needs to be so current all the time that Linux by its very nature just as difficult in these kinds of roles

700
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,460
And so maybe being more current is more helpful. Yeah, so open Sousa offers

701
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:53,100
You know tumbleweed and also evergreen releases so open Sousa has potentially that sweet spot right where open Sousa could

702
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,580
Fill a role on a machine that needs to be uber current and it could fill a role on a machine that needs to that could

703
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:04,500
Stay fairly static like say my bonobo. Yeah, and so but you don't use open Sousa in enterprise

704
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,620
You don't use open Sousa in your personal stuff. Why is it not really ever been a contender for you?

705
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,000
So there's a couple of things

706
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,300
I I actually really like the idea of an RPM based distro that I could use in production because really I'm not gonna put

707
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,660
I'm not gonna put fedora or at least

708
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,780
That might be changing now, but got a year ago or so. I wouldn't have put fedora into production on on on a client's machine

709
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,180
However, we tried open Sousa in one client

710
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,660
I was gonna go out and we were gonna do that and I ended up bringing him a test machine

711
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:37,260
We set it up, but it had this weird thing where it will show the it when you click on

712
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,180
You plug a thumb drive in it will show up as if it's mounted

713
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,500
but it doesn't actually create the mount point and show the files from a from a from a

714
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,500
removable storage and they had some sort of script that that kicked off that did something when somebody plugged a thumb drive in and

715
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:56,860
It wasn't the script kept failing because this thing wasn't mounting and I worked with it a little bit and I couldn't get it

716
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,460
To work and I said eventually just screw it

717
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,660
We'll just go to a bunch of because the reality was everything else they were doing other than this one tiny little piece of software

718
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,840
Which we could which had both RPM and Deb

719
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,320
Was all being done in the browser, you know, so I just went with that's that's an interesting reason not to use it

720
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,580
Uh Mike's a little more nuanced. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I I actually thought I would be sitting here and

721
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,380
I

722
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,100
Thought I thought I thought by this point in time

723
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:27,460
Open Sousa would be the far-gone conclusion because the build service was so awesome. They have

724
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,940
a tumbleweed they have their evergreen releases

725
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,860
I'm still a fan of yast and yet I sit here and I think I

726
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,460
Don't know still a bit of an unfinished mess rotten corpse. What's your take on it?

727
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,900
I would say that

728
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,020
Open Sousa has like a ton of potential and they do a lot of things that make you are really interested in them

729
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,260
But then they kind of fall short and the actual

730
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,300
Production of this stuff like for example, the OBS is cool

731
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,500
But then they don't have any focus on it and it's very clunky and it requires specific

732
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:02,860
Files and configurations that you have to know in order to send something to the OBS and then they have like the Sousa studio

733
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:08,140
Which is cool, but not a very good environment to reuse and they have like there's

734
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,200
One click install that's actually like 12, right or whatever. I very clunky

735
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,020
Yeah, they have a lot of great ideas, but they never actually like they don't all come to fruition

736
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:25,860
I actually don't think any of them really fully come to fruition and it's just like it's really cool and then disappointing

737
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,580
Yeah, and I think a lot of the changes around zipper and the package manager for a few releases a while ago

738
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:37,300
Sort of I lost momentum on my open Sousa edge like I had I for a while

739
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,580
I ran Sousa Enterprise Linux in a in a on a quite a few servers

740
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:45,500
I thought I thought it made and it was so great because you know

741
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,480
You could have it was so easy to make to make a Samba file server with Sousa Linux

742
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,520
Using the asked it would connect to the domain and authenticate all of the users and set up all the permissions and you could set

743
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,920
up extended attributes on all the file systems because Sousa was super easy with riser FS and XFS out of the box back then and

744
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,560
It was just like I could drop a Sousa box in within 10 minutes

745
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,800
I'd have it connected and authenticating to a Windows domain controller and I'd have it all updated in Yast and it was

746
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Beautiful. Yeah, and for a while I even used this program from the Zemarian folks to manage all of the it was called red carpet

747
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,280
And I could manage all of the patches on all of my Sousa boxes from one GTK console on one desktop

748
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,840
And it was so amazing and when they went through all these package manager changes

749
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,600
I just really lost momentum on all of that and and then and I just kind of I kind of fell into

750
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,920
back into apt-get and

751
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,360
Ubuntu for a long time and it just seems like such a more streamlined process to manage your packages then

752
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,880
And and there's so many layers on the open Sousa side. Mm-hmm. And then the other thing that's given me a

753
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,720
little bit of

754
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,840
Cold feet with Sousa is I'm not very comfortable with their parent company and I'm not very comfortable how they've been passed around in the

755
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,240
Last few years and I'm not super clear on what the parent company's priority is for Sousa Linux other than making a distro

756
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,640
That is a companion piece to mainframes type software and I so and I'm sure that's not their purpose and vision

757
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,120
I just I have I feel like they haven't articulated it yet

758
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,880
And so I'm not willing to invest a lot of my personal energy into that

759
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,160
Yeah

760
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,760
The one thing that I see that open Sousa really really digs down on is if I had a if somebody came to me

761
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,160
And they said I had a lot of experience

762
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,400
Administrating a Windows server and I want to switch the Linux server. What should I start with man?

763
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,080
Yeah, it is in it and it and it and and Sousa such a capable distro open

764
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,400
Sousa such a capable distro that I think it has a lot of but you know

765
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,900
Here's the other thing too. If you were gonna use open Sousa, would you not use KDE?

766
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,660
Because it's a really nice KDE implementation really nice. Yeah, and KDE is

767
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,140
Yeah, they have a good gnome one too. I mean they do overall they do good work

768
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,300
And one of the things I like is like Yast is like a Qt UI on KDE and GTK UI under gnome

769
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,700
Like they do a lot of good stuff

770
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,780
It's just it all doesn't really come together to make it super compelling but heavens

771
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,380
I'll give you a chance to give them a bit of cred here

772
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:06,380
Yes, trying to judge the desktop usage of open Sousa based on their open build service is not exactly

773
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:13,860
Doing it justice. I do use open Sousa at least in a couple virtual machines just to test and make sure that it is up to snuff

774
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:19,060
At least in my standards. It is up to my standards in terms of desktop usage

775
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,060
In every way the zipper package manager, even though it is a little bit different from RPM

776
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:30,060
But in terms of RPM distros, open Sousa is the only one that I kind of like

777
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:37,060
Yeah, but yeah, I don't know. It's just a monthly for a deb or pac-man kind of usage

778
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:46,060
But I don't think it has much to... you can't blame it based on its other services

779
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:51,060
Even though yes, it should work, but one thing, one installation of open Sousa

780
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:58,060
It should work, but one install package manager or at least one click install packages is useful for users

781
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:08,060
The package search is useful for users, adding extra repos, especially with GPG based repository authentication is useful

782
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,060
And you know, it's nice

783
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,060
That's not even the problem. The problem is the whole package

784
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:21,060
Like there's a lot of cool things and they make really good ideas with the package search

785
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:25,060
And basically everything is on the website you can install from. Really cool

786
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,060
But it's just funky when you actually go through the process

787
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,060
I think I'm done on this topic. No, no, hold on. Let's talk about more in the post-show

788
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,060
Because I don't want to spend too much more time in the show on this topic

789
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,060
Because honestly, here's where I kind of come down on open Sousa

790
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,060
That's why I don't want to spend a lot more time on it

791
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,060
Is despite as much as I wish this wasn't the case

792
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,060
And despite as much as a lot of people in the community who really love this distribution

793
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Wish it wasn't the case and the people who work for the company wish it wasn't the case

794
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,060
I believe the reality is, and I'm sorry I have to say this

795
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,060
This is the final word for this episode on the topic and we can take other

796
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,060
I just need to move on from this. I'm getting orange on the topic. Red, really

797
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:03,060
But I unfortunately do not believe that open Sousa really makes much of an impact in the market

798
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,060
In the industry, they don't really move the needle when they make an initiative

799
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,060
Nobody really pays attention except for them

800
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,060
They're not super relevant, not like Ubuntu or Fedora or even Arch

801
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,060
Or honestly, definitely distributions like Debian and Slackware even

802
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,060
I don't know, there are just a lot of distributions out there

803
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,060
That I feel like when they say something, it makes a huge, huge wave

804
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:28,060
Like when Debian decided to switch to System D, holy shit, right?

805
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,060
When Sousa switched to System D, do you know when that was?

806
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:35,060
No. In fact, I wasn't even aware that they'd switched to System D, to be honest with you

807
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,060
Right, they did a while ago, right? That's my point

808
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,060
And I wish it wasn't that way, and that's why, to be honest with you

809
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,060
As somebody who's an enthusiast about this market

810
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,060
I like to use a distro that's a little bit more relevant

811
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,060
That has a little sway, not a lot, I don't want a lot of drama

812
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,060
But I do like to have a distro that has some solid relevancy in the areas I care about

813
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,060
I just don't feel like that's where open Sousa's at

814
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,060
And that's my final word on it

815
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,060
So, Harold writes in about Angela's Yoga 3

816
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,060
And he says, I'd like to move my wife to Linux as well

817
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,060
But how do we sync an iPhone or iPad to iTunes using Linux?

818
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,060
That's her greatest stumbling block. He also wants to know what spreadsheet program she uses

819
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
A lot to choose from

820
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,060
So, it's funny that he writes in and asks that, right?

821
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:21,060
Because, just like, I think, Friday

822
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,060
It was Friday, we were working on show notes

823
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,060
And you said, hey, while we're working on that, you know what would be awesome?

824
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:30,060
If you could get Angela's iPhone to sync up to...

825
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:35,060
She's like, I'm basically doing almost everything on the Yoga, except, you know what?

826
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,060
I take pictures with my iPhone, and when I plug it in, nothing happens

827
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,060
And I thought, oh, yeah, that's right

828
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,060
We never went back around to get that working

829
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,060
We talked about it on the show, and then I just...

830
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:52,060
I forget that there's still people pulling photos off their phones using USB

831
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,060
I just think when you take pictures, it syncs to something

832
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,060
And she talked about using Dropbox and OwnCloud

833
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,060
But none of them, she takes so many pictures, and they're fairly high resolution

834
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,060
She likes being able to plug it in, have them suck off the device

835
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,060
And then delete them off the camera roll of the device

836
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,060
But the fundamental problem is you have to get the Linux box to recognize the iPhone

837
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,060
And this has got to be a common problem in our audience

838
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,060
Right, so the answer's actually fairly straightforward

839
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,060
There's two or three packages you need to install

840
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,060
We'll have a link in the show notes to them

841
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,060
But they have, once you get those packages installed

842
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,060
What it allows you to do is mount the phone as either an MTP device

843
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,060
Or actually mount it as a drive

844
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,060
Now, we actually set it up so that it mounts as a drive

845
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,060
But it doesn't have right access to the phone

846
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,060
And the reason for that is...

847
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,060
We want to be careful

848
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,060
We want to be careful, and she's had problems in the past where

849
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:40,060
She does something on Linux thinking that she is just making copies of her photos

850
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,060
And in fact it's moving them

851
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,060
Here there's no possibility it can move them

852
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,060
The only thing it can do is copy them

853
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,060
Now, you can actually set it up so that inside of Shotwell

854
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,060
It looks when a given mount point is mounted

855
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,060
So when slash media slash Ange's iPhone mounts

856
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
It will automatically look inside of that directory

857
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,060
And then the DCIM folder to sync up all of the photos

858
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,060
That's not a hard set

859
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
No, and so the nice thing for her is she just plugs her phone in

860
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,060
And somehow all of her pictures will magically populate in Shotwell

861
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,060
And she actually likes the idea too that it's in the file manager

862
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,060
So if she just wanted a single photo to post online or something

863
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,060
Right

864
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,060
Or send it to me over Telegram

865
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,060
So that would be mounting it

866
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,060
And yeah, you're right

867
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,060
So she can log in there and just manually copy that photo out

868
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,060
But it actually really took, what?

869
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,060
It took five minutes

870
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,060
And four of those minutes were researching it

871
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,060
And 30 seconds were implementing it

872
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,060
You know, so the Librem is on the verge of shipping

873
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,060
July, I think, yeah

874
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,060
The XPS 13 is very solid

875
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,060
The Yoga is very solid

876
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,060
Dell's got this new $250 laptop

877
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
Yeah, Linux is big

878
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,060
Yeah, and that doesn't even count

879
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,060
Like, System76 has their best Bonobo Extreme yet

880
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,060
Like, that thing's a monster

881
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,060
They're shipping the Meerkat

882
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,060
There's a great ton of options desktop-wise for System76

883
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,060
The Galago is amazing

884
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,060
You have like, this is the best year for Linux laptops ever

885
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,060
Yeah

886
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,060
And a lot of these are shipping with very good Intel graphics

887
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,060
There are plenty good for average users

888
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,060
And for those of us who want to have dedicated graphics

889
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
Those options are available too

890
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
Yeah, but really, if you think about it

891
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,060
The Intel embedded graphics are really what have kind of driven this market so far forward

892
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,060
Because now you don't need to have dedicated

893
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,060
Before, like five years ago, when you bought your original Bonobo

894
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,060
I bet you, like, buying integrated graphics would have been a joke

895
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,060
It was not an option

896
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,060
Because you can't get anything done on it

897
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,060
Not even possible

898
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,060
You can't game

899
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,060
And I couldn't use OBS

900
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:23,060
And this thing has to drive, this thing has to mirror the display out to the capture machine

901
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,060
So how are you going to do that with integrated graphics?

902
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,060
How can I play any, how can I show any video games under Linux with integrated graphics back then

903
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,060
And then also mirror the display 1080p

904
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,060
Right, and now, and now look at that tiny little nook over there

905
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,060
Yeah, it's doing it

906
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,060
Does the same freaking thing

907
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,060
I know, I know, I know

908
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,060
So yeah, they have gotten, it's gotten light years better

909
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
And it's only going to improve

910
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,060
Yeah

911
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,060
In fact, one might even wonder

912
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,060
At least in the mobile sphere where you want a thin, portable, powerful laptop

913
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,060
Yeah

914
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:51,060
At some point, do we just stop putting, do we stop putting up our graphics on

915
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,060
For the purpose of getting that laptop down a little bit in size and compact

916
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,060
If integrated graphics get a little bit better

917
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,060
That's why I had a great hope for Thunderbolt

918
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,060
I wanted to be able to have an integrated graphics laptop

919
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,060
And then hook up an external GPU and have at it

920
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,060
Yeah

921
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,060
But, yeah, we'll see

922
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,060
Alienware's got something like that

923
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,060
You know, so integrated graphics have been changing the game

924
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,060
For portability on the Intel-based machines

925
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,060
The, you know, the amount of performance you can get it

926
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,060
It's the same thing as sort of in the server space like DigitalOcean has done

927
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,060
That's our next sponsor

928
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,060
Where they've taken something and they've been able to get it to a price that's just unbelievable

929
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,060
Five dollars a month for your own server at DigitalOcean

930
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,060
It's incredible

931
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,060
And when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, you're going to get a ten dollar credit

932
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,060
What, what, what, what?

933
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,060
You don't know what DigitalOcean is

934
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,060
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

935
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,060
To spin up your own cloud server

936
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,060
How about that Noah?

937
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,060
That's pretty cool

938
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,060
Did you know that?

939
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,060
I didn't know that

940
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,060
Tell me about DigitalOcean

941
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,060
It's not like I have like 30 droplets

942
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:50,060
It's not like I had to email DigitalOcean and ask them to expand my droplet offering so that I could get more droplets

943
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,060
Freaking, that didn't happen

944
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,060
Game freaking changer

945
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,060
That's what DigitalOcean is

946
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,060
Game freaking changer

947
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,060
I can't even imagine if I was doing what Noah does as a day job and DigitalOcean was around

948
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,060
It would change how my business was structured

949
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,060
I mean, actually

950
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,060
You would have made a lot more money

951
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,060
Well, yeah, absolutely

952
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:12,060
And in a way, like, now I think about some of the stuff we're doing server side for Jupiter Broadcasting

953
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
And how would I have done that before DigitalOcean

954
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,060
You either had rented rack space

955
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,060
Yeah

956
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,060
You would have either had to rent an actual dedicated server which would cost you like a couple hundred dollars a month

957
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,060
Or like go crazy and I could maybe set up a server here

958
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,060
Okay, alright, let's talk about that

959
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,060
But then I got bandwidth problems

960
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,060
Hold on

961
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,060
Comcast

962
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:33,060
Before you ever get to the bandwidth problems, you got to come up with 2500 macaroons

963
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,060
To get the rig

964
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,060
To get the server

965
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,060
And oftentimes, that's not even going to include

966
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,060
You're going to want to put some solid state drives in there

967
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,060
Well, and if this thing is

968
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,060
Yeah, and these things are

969
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:45,060
And these things like, so there's a lot of automated backend functionality

970
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
If this doesn't work, shows don't go out

971
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,060
So I'm going dual, I'm going redundant power

972
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,060
I'm going to go hardware drive array

973
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,060
Okay

974
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,060
Then I'm setting this box up myself

975
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,060
Now still, you're counting on a couple things

976
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,060
One, you still have the risk of a hardware failure

977
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,060
Even if it's redundant

978
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,060
Yeah

979
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,060
They're still, they're going to be

980
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,060
Or a Comcast outage

981
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,060
Okay, so we haven't gotten to bandwidth

982
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,060
First, the server itself can die

983
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,060
Second, you might have a bandwidth issue

984
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,060
And third, what about your expandability

985
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,060
In two years, in a year, it's dead

986
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,060
And you can't upgrade that thing

987
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,060
Or what if the network starts growing really crazy fast

988
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,060
Then what am I going to do?

989
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,060
Then I'm going to stop that money because I'm going to replace it anyway

990
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,060
What I'm telling you is

991
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:22,060
And that doesn't even settle the fact that I'm going to probably need to set up like a DMZ on the firewall

992
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,060
Get that all wired in

993
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,060
Get the firewall rules all set up

994
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,060
But even if all that worked perfectly and nothing ever went wrong

995
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,060
Which, let's face it, what's the chances of that happening?

996
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,060
Thanks

997
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,060
Even if nothing, wow

998
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,060
That's because you need us, Rekai and I to come in here and do some wiring for you

999
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,060
But if that happened, it would probably have a decent chance of staying up

1000
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,060
Oh

1001
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,060
Oh really?

1002
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,060
Let's go with that every week

1003
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,060
Let's go with that again

1004
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:46,060
Even if all of the hardware functioned for a year or two

1005
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,060
At the end of that two years, now you have to do all over again

1006
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
And you have to set all that crap up again

1007
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,060
It's ridiculous

1008
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,060
And meanwhile, DigitalOcean's over here

1009
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,060
They're going to get you going in less than 55 seconds when you spin up a Dropbox

1010
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,060
Five bucks

1011
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,060
For $5 a month

1012
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:02,060
You get your 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer

1013
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:06,060
But it's a terabyte of transfer at like tier one data centers with unbelievable connections

1014
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:12,060
They have data centers in New York, they have ones in San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and Germany

1015
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,060
It is really nice

1016
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,060
And then the best part is, and I wouldn't get this if I rolled my own rig

1017
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,060
They have an amazing interface to manage it all

1018
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,060
They really have a super intuitive control panel

1019
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,060
And you can get all kinds of additional functionality on your own using their API

1020
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:28,060
And I'm thinking like create your machines, obviously destroy them, duplicate them

1021
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:32,060
Make backups of them before you make a big system change with a really nice snapshot system

1022
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,060
Full feature DNS management allows you to easily manage your domain

1023
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,060
Snapshots are a great function

1024
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,060
Now they're not just like backup

1025
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,060
These are like full, this is a great way to deploy servers

1026
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,060
Like you get a server set up just the way you want, you snapshot, you make it a template

1027
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,060
You want to snapshot something and send it off to another customer

1028
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,060
Hey, here let me set you up a WordPress machine

1029
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,060
Think about this you guys

1030
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:54,060
You could go over there and have a Droplet that you set up with like a perfect ghost installation

1031
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,060
All set up for customers

1032
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,060
And you could sell it

1033
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,060
You could sell that, like make that a service

1034
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,060
And re-host it

1035
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,060
And DigitalOcean has referral programs and all kinds of things

1036
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,060
A really great offering for the customers too

1037
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,060
They've structured in a way to incentivize you as well

1038
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,060
So go check out some of those options like their one-click installations that make the control panel super nice

1039
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:15,060
And by the way, tons of job openings right now

1040
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:19,060
They've asked me specifically to mention that they're looking for some of the best Linux admins out there

1041
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,060
To keep them in the right place

1042
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,060
I know

1043
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,060
And they also want to get some content editors because they're doubling down once again

1044
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,060
They're doing another like big push on their content for their community tutorials and whatnot

1045
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,060
They're willing to pay people

1046
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:36,060
And you know the real secret to DigitalOcean is a lot of these tutorials are not necessarily DigitalOcean specific

1047
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,060
Like how to set up an SSH key

1048
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,060
Look how well this is done

1049
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,060
Look how clear this is

1050
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,060
That is super nice

1051
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,060
That is super clean

1052
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:49,060
And none of this, none of this is specific to a DigitalOcean Droplet

1053
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:52,060
Yeah, that's the super nice thing right

1054
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,060
Is that they have those set up as just we want to help people

1055
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:58,060
We're going to set this up and provide that information to you

1056
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,060
They look at all of that as like a whole product

1057
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,060
They really do

1058
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:05,060
Because when they rolled out free BSD support, they rolled out a whole bunch of tutorials with it

1059
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,060
They don't want you to just sit there and have a Droplet

1060
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,060
They want you to really get some use out of it

1061
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,060
That's really cool

1062
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:13,060
And they have great products built around that API too

1063
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,060
Like you've tried out the Swimmer app

1064
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,060
Mist.io is really cool

1065
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:20,060
Command.io, you can manage your DigitalOcean Droplets using the command line

1066
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,060
You know what's interesting

1067
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,060
You're talking about that control panel being easy to use and intuitive

1068
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,060
The other part of it is for people like me who I do the same repetitive task over and over again

1069
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:32,060
I'm not using a lot of their features of clicking this and changing that and modify

1070
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,060
I'm going to do all that from the command line once I SSH in, right

1071
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:40,060
For me, once I log in, it's like three clicks to get stuff rolling

1072
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,060
And then I just, I have the IP address and I throw that in my DNS server

1073
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,060
And now I can access that machine

1074
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:50,060
And like you said, I didn't get a chance to show it on Sunday

1075
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:53,060
But the way that you can set it up with SSH keys, they just have a button

1076
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,060
So I can check nose lanyard, nose laptop

1077
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
And then when I spin up a DigitalOcean Droplet

1078
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
Boom, I can instantly have access to it

1079
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,060
I don't have to wait for the email to come through

1080
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,060
Do you remember when I had that problem here

1081
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,060
And then my email went down so I couldn't get the email

1082
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
That took me what, 30 seconds to set that up?

1083
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,060
It's very nice

1084
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,060
Yeah, it's quick, it's easy

1085
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,060
You've never had a better experience

1086
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,060
Because usually what you have to do is you have to SSH into the computer

1087
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,060
And you have to enter this huge long password

1088
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,060
Then you have to run all these stupid commands

1089
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:22,060
And copying an SSH key is not as easy as you might think it is

1090
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,060
Because you can't have any spaces, you can't modify it

1091
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,060
It's just a pain

1092
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,060
There I click a button

1093
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,060
One button

1094
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,060
And now I have my SSH key

1095
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:31,060
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

1096
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,060
One word and I'll get you a $10 credit

1097
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,060
Tried that $5 rig for two months for free

1098
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,060
You'd be surprised what you can do with it

1099
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:41,060
I have so many things I actually frequently forget all the things I'm using it for

1100
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,060
It's amazing how much I've integrated into my life

1101
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,060
And how hassle free that is

1102
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,060
DigitalOcean.com is so cool to have your own server up there that rocks

1103
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,060
And you could use it for so many things

1104
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:55,060
Alright Mr. Noah, I want to talk a little bit about Gnome 3.18

1105
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,060
Major updates are coming for Gnome 3.18

1106
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,060
And of course we're going to see that land in a little while

1107
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,060
But probably the ones we should talk about today is the changes coming to the files

1108
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,060
You know the old Nautilus application

1109
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,060
It's going to bring numerous under the hood and user visible changes

1110
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,060
It also fixes bugs that have been reported by users for a while now

1111
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:15,060
So fix for window focus issues that have occurred with the file manager

1112
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,060
Handling the command line options in certain areas

1113
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,060
They're going to also introduce a public API for files

1114
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
To allow for plugins to be written

1115
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:26,060
And a documentation for developers to create those extensions as well will be released

1116
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,060
Interface has added some modifications

1117
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,060
They've added padding on the window list and views

1118
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,060
And things like that

1119
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,060
I'm going to show you a picture of it

1120
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,060
Oh, they took the picture down

1121
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,060
Well good thing I put that in the show notes

1122
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,060
We do have, I do have, here's another copy of it

1123
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,060
And I'll zoom in

1124
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,060
I don't know if you can see Noah, a little bit here

1125
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,060
But they're adding some, like when you create a new folder

1126
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,060
This pop down area here is new

1127
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,060
They've cleaned up this area here and added some padding

1128
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,060
And the search area has been changed a little bit

1129
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,060
So files is getting quite a bit of attention in GNOME 3.18

1130
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,060
No, I'm just, I'm looking and I'm thinking

1131
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,060
I kind of, you know, I'm all about innovation

1132
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,060
I think that's great

1133
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,060
I'm glad that we're always trying to move forward

1134
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,060
And I can always appreciate a company that attempts to be innovative

1135
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,060
Even if I don't always agree with the innovations

1136
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,060
But like, I don't know if I want to create my folder up in the menu

1137
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,060
I think I want to, I think I want to create a folder

1138
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,060
Like I want to right click and create a folder

1139
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,060
Or if I have to go up here and create a new folder

1140
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,060
You still build it right click

1141
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,060
But yeah, have you checked out Nemo?

1142
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,060
No

1143
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
Nemo is a fork of the Noddle's file manager

1144
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,060
Started by the Cinnamon Project, I believe

1145
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,060
And it's pretty good

1146
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,060
I don't know, Noah

1147
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
No, I care

1148
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,060
See, Greater says, wow, GNOME 3 will bring updated apps

1149
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,060
It's incredible, who cares?

1150
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,060
I feel like we can be such dicks in the open source community

1151
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Like, are we so callous that we have stopped caring

1152
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,060
That a desktop that was down on the ropes

1153
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,060
That people thought was a failed desktop initiative

1154
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:53,060
Is now coming out with incredible updates that are genuinely impressive

1155
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,060
And in some cases, more trend setting than any other desktop on the market

1156
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,060
I mean, look at Yosemite

1157
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:02,060
Yosemite and some of the UI changes they made there were direct rip offs of GNOME 3

1158
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,060
You look at some of the changes in Windows 10

1159
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,060
And the way they're managing virtual desktops and things like that

1160
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,060
Very much a rip off of the way they do things in GNOME 3

1161
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,060
I think GNOME 3 has been a trend setter

1162
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:18,060
And I think GNOME 3.16 is the best full desktop environment for Linux

1163
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,060
I say you stack, Plasma 5 is getting great

1164
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,060
But it's still not there yet

1165
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,060
It's still not there yet

1166
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:27,060
As far as a full featured, complete modern desktop

1167
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:30,060
I'm not talking about your Awesomes and your Exmonads

1168
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,060
I'm talking about, you know, a real full red blooded desktop

1169
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,060
Nothing is beating GNOME 3.16

1170
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,060
And I think it's a little sad that as a community we don't give them enough recognition

1171
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,060
The updates they have made are genuinely reflecting user feedback

1172
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,060
They're genuine improvements

1173
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:46,060
And as somebody who has used desktops since we have had graphical environments

1174
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:51,060
Literally, I have been using desktop computing since GUIs were a thing for mass adoption

1175
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,060
And I, in my personal opinion, have never used a better graphical environment in 30 years of using computers

1176
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,060
Okay, so let me take the other side of it

1177
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,060
If only for the purpose of discussion

1178
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:06,060
Why is it that basic things that Unity has are still not implemented in GNOME?

1179
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,060
So I'll give you an example

1180
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,060
When I open the display manager in Unity

1181
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,060
I can choose where I want my launcher bar to be

1182
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,060
If I want it on the far right display, if I want it on the center display, left, in my house I have six

1183
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,060
I can pick which one of those six displays I want it on

1184
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,060
Why is it in GNOME, not only can I do that, I can't set the refresh rate

1185
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,060
I can't set...

1186
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,060
You can't do that in Unity either

1187
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,060
Yeah, I guess that's true

1188
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:29,060
Now remember, Unity's what, had eight releases now almost? Seven releases?

1189
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,060
Yeah

1190
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,060
So, okay, I'll give you that

1191
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,060
So you're saying they're further on? Is that...

1192
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,060
No, are you not able to set where that...

1193
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,060
Like, I'm able to set where that bar goes

1194
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,060
How?

1195
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,060
In GNOME Tweak

1196
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
Okay, well then maybe it's something I'm missing

1197
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,060
I guess where I looked for it was inside of the displays I can't set...

1198
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,060
Oh yeah, maybe the bar, how about the activities menu?

1199
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,060
So what I want is if I have three monitors

1200
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,060
I would prefer that the activities menu be on my far left monitor

1201
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,060
The reason for that is because when I send my mouse up to the far...

1202
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:02,060
I send it all the way to the end, then I want it to activate the activities menu

1203
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,060
The last time I've done it, the way it sets up

1204
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,060
The activities menu shows up on my center display

1205
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,060
And then when I scroll through my virtual desktops it moves this other monitor

1206
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:14,060
I feel like we're arguing slightly... I think I'm on another level

1207
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,060
Okay, alright, that could be

1208
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:22,060
No, what I'm saying is like, I guess don't mistake what I'm saying to say that it's flawless

1209
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,060
Right

1210
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,060
Because that's not possible

1211
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,060
Of course

1212
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,060
What I'm saying is...

1213
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,060
But you said...

1214
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,060
Because what you're talking about is like an esoteric use case, honestly

1215
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:33,060
You're talking about a three to six monitor setup and you want the activities menu to be...

1216
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,060
Two monitors, and I just want the activities menu on the other monitor

1217
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,060
Well, that's how it works now

1218
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,060
Whatever is your primary monitor is where the activities menu is

1219
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,060
Okay

1220
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,060
So if you have a dual monitor setup and you set activities to be...

1221
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,060
Whatever your primary monitor is, that's where that menu is at

1222
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,060
Okay

1223
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,060
So yeah, you can't say if I have three or four or five or six monitors, I want it on monitor number four

1224
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,060
Alright

1225
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,060
But like, these are also changes that as the desktop matures, they're going to add these refinements back in

1226
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:01,060
See, and this is the other thing is, the thing that we really crapped on them for was pulling a bunch of features out

1227
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,060
But to be honest with you, they are the developers

1228
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,060
They know what code has been rotten, they know what code needs to go, they know where they want to take things

1229
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,060
And where they need to restart

1230
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:13,060
And at some point you have to trust that they have some more insights than us users do at some level

1231
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,060
So if you accept that, then perhaps they can do some reduction of functionality

1232
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:22,060
If you also grant that basically since GNOME 3.10, it's been nothing but adding a bunch of great features that we all wanted back in there

1233
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,060
And with GNOME 3.16, we're really down that path

1234
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,060
And with GNOME 3.18 now, we're going even further down that path

1235
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:33,060
And I would argue that I also think that we have been way too hard on them for their focus on the touchscreen

1236
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:37,060
Because now that I have had a couple of users try out, I know, I know, I can't believe I'm saying it either

1237
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,060
I seriously can't believe those words came out of my mouth

1238
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,060
Roll your eyes all you want, because I still think it's also an excessive use

1239
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:49,060
But the couple of users now, and this is super anecdotal evidence, but the couple of users I've had use the touchscreen laptops

1240
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,060
They all think it's great

1241
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,060
They think it's the, they think it's great

1242
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:58,060
It is, to Angela, the best thing about her yoga is that she swipes that touchscreen up to unlock it

1243
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,060
To her, that's one of the coolest features on that laptop

1244
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:04,060
Because these people are primarily mobile users

1245
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:09,060
So the fact that they can reach out and touch it from time to time is almost an intuitive way to interact with the computer

1246
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:15,060
So I could see that if the touchscreen in GNOME functioned the way that the touchscreen functions on mobile

1247
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,060
But the reality is I still feel when I touch the touchscreen on GNOME

1248
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:22,060
I still feel like I have taken a touchscreen and plugged it into a desktop

1249
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,060
I don't feel like I actually have a touch optimized desktop

1250
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:30,060
Where she's using it is like she touches the activities corner or on the dock launcher or to unlock the screen

1251
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,060
That's about all she uses it for

1252
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,060
I can see unlocking the screen, that feels normal enough

1253
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:42,060
But even the activities menu is just small enough that I have to like kind of wiggle my finger in the corner to get that to launch

1254
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,060
I don't know, it just doesn't feel

1255
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,060
My perfect desktop would be exactly what GNOME is today, written in QT

1256
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:53,060
Well okay, so let me take it from another angle then

1257
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:58,060
If GNOME has done such a good job with the desktop, why do we have to apply so many extensions to make it usable?

1258
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,060
Yeah, that's a fair argument, but can't you say the same thing about Firefox and Chrome?

1259
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,060
Yes, I could, except I don't use any extensions in Firefox, I think it works perfectly right out of the box

1260
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,060
You really don't use many extensions in GNOME though either

1261
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,060
I don't, yeah I don't, I don't, but that's because I'm too lazy to install it

1262
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,060
But it works for you without them

1263
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:16,060
It does, it does, that's true, I'm not saying it's not usable without extensions

1264
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,060
I'm just saying that, I guess I did just say that

1265
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:25,060
My approach to the extensions is, I find GNOME irritating to use without them, but usable

1266
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:31,060
With extensions, it's so in that sweet spot where I've got kind of my cool heads up information that I like to have

1267
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:35,060
But it's not at the KDE level where I'm constantly tweaking it because the options are there

1268
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,060
It's just that sweet spot

1269
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,060
Until you update the next GNOME and then your extensions are going to break

1270
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,060
But that's been getting better too, I grant you that as well

1271
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:50,060
But my update from 3.14 to 3.16, I didn't have a single extension that didn't work

1272
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:55,060
Because either the authors were right on top of it or I think maybe I had one extension that didn't work

1273
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,060
But it's so minimal that it doesn't really matter

1274
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,060
I don't think I could use GNOME without the extensions for a long term

1275
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,060
But for a few days after an update, it's not a big deal

1276
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,060
Now how do you think that that relates to a new user?

1277
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:15,060
One of the nice things about Ubuntu and Unity is that big dock along the side makes it really, really obvious

1278
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,060
They recognize Firefox, they recognize Chrome

1279
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:22,060
So when they see those icons, it's pretty intuitive just to reach up and click them

1280
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:26,060
Now granted, there are certain things that are horrible in Unity for a new user experience

1281
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,060
For example, it hides all the menus by default

1282
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:33,060
I think by default, GNOME is a little hard for app discovery

1283
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,060
Although, remember when we sat Angela down?

1284
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,060
The first thing she did was went up to the corner and looked for applications

1285
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,060
Remember that?

1286
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,060
And we even asked her

1287
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,060
But she's also used GNOME, right?

1288
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,060
No

1289
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,060
Oh, really?

1290
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,060
Well, I mean, she's used it here, but I have the dock

1291
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,060
I mean, she's never used that menu before that I know of

1292
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:53,060
And so I just thought it was, to her, it seemed kind of intuitive to go up in the corner and launch an application

1293
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,060
But I agree, I think for normal users, I take that dash to dock extension

1294
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,060
And I set it to auto expand like the Unity byte

1295
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,060
And I think that just makes a lot of sense

1296
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,060
No, it totally does

1297
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:09,060
My question was, do you see GNOME as primarily a power user's desktop then?

1298
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,060
Maybe not power, maybe that's a wrong term

1299
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,060
Experienced users, not necessarily power users

1300
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,060
I think it's perfect for experienced users right now

1301
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:21,060
And I think if they could stabilize the extension stuff, I think it'd be a lot better for regular users

1302
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,060
Or I think the stuff they just keep adding to it, you won't require extensions

1303
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:29,060
So I'm pretty excited about it, to be honest with you

1304
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,060
Because I think they're going in a direction that is great for users like you and I

1305
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,060
That have been using Linux for a long time and are comfortable with GNOME tweak

1306
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,060
And we're comfortable with installing some extensions

1307
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,060
Ironically, those are some of the more hardcore things to do for a desktop that's supposed to be super simple

1308
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,060
But if you're comfortable with that stuff, which is pretty much everybody in our audience

1309
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,060
I think it's perfect for them

1310
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,060
And then if you can get somebody like, if you get one extension on there

1311
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,060
Basically like Angela's desktop, she could get by with just dash to dock

1312
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060
And I think she'd be fine

1313
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,060
So I think for her it's fine

1314
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,060
Yeah, I guess if you don't know what to look for

1315
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,060
Or you don't know what you're missing

1316
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,060
Or you don't know what is available in GNOME

1317
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:04,060
If you don't know, you could have a Bitcoin ticker in your menu bar

1318
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,060
Or a ping indicator

1319
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,060
You don't care when they go away

1320
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,060
Yeah, 14.2 milliseconds

1321
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,060
Yeah, oh really? Really?

1322
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,060
I'm at 11.3 milliseconds right now

1323
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,060
Yeah, I'm on wireless

1324
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,060
Oh, I get the wired advantage

1325
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,060
Hello, Ethan

1326
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
Wired advantage

1327
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,060
You know, Mr. Noah, we could go on about this for a long time

1328
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,060
We could

1329
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,060
But I do want to just take a moment here

1330
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,060
And I want to talk about our next sponsor, and that's Ting

1331
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,060
And then, my friends, we have got to dig into this stuff going on in Fedora

1332
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:29,060
Actually, there's some really interesting things

1333
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:32,060
One in particular I forgot to mention in our Fedora review

1334
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,060
Major oversight, because it's totally changed the way I use my laptop

1335
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,060
So we've got to talk about that in our Fedora

1336
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,060
I know, can you believe I forgot that in the review?

1337
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,060
Well, it's the way you change your laptop

1338
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,060
Right before you decided that you couldn't deal with Fedora anymore

1339
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,060
And you have to go back to Arch right before the show

1340
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,060
That doesn't have to do with this thing, though

1341
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,060
Yeah, I'll talk more about that, too

1342
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,060
But first, let me tell you about

1343
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,060
That's right, our buddies over at Ting

1344
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,060
Go to linux.ting.com, please, won't you?

1345
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,060
Not only do you get to put Linux in your URL bar

1346
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,060
But you get a $50 discount off your first Ting device

1347
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,060
$50

1348
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,060
Yeah

1349
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,060
$50

1350
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:06,060
That's a lot of money

1351
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,060
Dude, they have some devices that are nearly only $50

1352
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,060
It's almost the whole device

1353
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,060
And if you have a compatible device, you'll get a service credit

1354
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,060
Now, why Ting? My friends, I will tell you why

1355
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,060
Ting is mobile that truly makes sense

1356
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,060
Thank goodness

1357
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,060
Thank goodness

1358
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,060
Mobile that makes sense

1359
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,060
It's no contract

1360
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,060
You only pay for what you use

1361
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,060
$6 is all you pay for the line

1362
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,060
And then it's just your usage on top of that

1363
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,060
It's really straightforward and obvious, too

1364
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,060
There's no hidden secrets in there

1365
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,060
There's just, like, your usage and your taxes and the line

1366
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,060
And the devices are unlocked

1367
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,060
You own the device outright

1368
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,060
So that's super nice, isn't it?

1369
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,060
You can go over there and bring your own device

1370
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,060
If you have a GSM-compatible one

1371
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:40,060
Or they have so, so many nice ones to choose from now

1372
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,060
And one of the things I really enjoy about Ting

1373
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:46,060
Is I can fully manage it just using my own web browser

1374
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,060
I really never have to call Ting

1375
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,060
Even though I could

1376
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,060
Ironically, Ting is so well-structured for that

1377
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,060
If you call them at 1-855-TING-FTW

1378
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,060
Between 8am or 8pm, a real human being answers the phone

1379
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,060
Wrap your head around this, you guys

1380
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,060
It's mobile service with no contract

1381
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,060
No early termination fees

1382
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,060
You're only paying for your actual usage

1383
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,060
And they have no hold customer service

1384
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:09,060
Plus, they have a CDMA or GSM network you can choose from

1385
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,060
That's super powerful and a lot of flexibility

1386
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:15,060
For me, it's really nice just from a straight

1387
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,060
This probably sounds a little excessive

1388
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:20,060
But see, with Ting, it's very easy to have multiple lines

1389
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,060
Because I'm just paying the $6

1390
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:25,060
So Ting now has the Galaxy S6 Edge

1391
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,060
I think that's the best phone of the year right now

1392
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,060
Yeah, I think many would agree with you

1393
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,060
So I also still have my Nexus 5

1394
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,060
Which is also a very good phone

1395
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,060
The thing I love about the Nexus 5

1396
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,060
That the Edge, I don't know if it does

1397
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:41,060
Is that the Nexus 5 can be moved between GSM and CDMA

1398
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,060
So when we go to conferences and stuff

1399
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,060
I can look up the coverage map

1400
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:46,060
And see if it's stronger to have CDMA or GSM

1401
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,060
But on top of that, if I get there

1402
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,060
And I discover, oh man, the GSM network is blasted at this conference

1403
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,060
I can try switching over to the CDMA network

1404
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,060
I just got to swap the SIMs out and stuff

1405
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,060
Switch over to the CDMA network

1406
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,060
That is such a unique competitive advantage to Ting right now

1407
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,060
That blows my mind

1408
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,060
And you just pay for what you use

1409
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,060
Yeah, and the great thing about it is

1410
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,060
Because of their intuitive dashboard

1411
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,060
You can shut that phone off

1412
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
And it can sit in the studio here for six months

1413
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,060
You never touch it

1414
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,060
Then when you get there, you log in

1415
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,060
In fact, you can do it on your Ting app

1416
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,060
You can open it up

1417
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,060
From my app, that's what I do

1418
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,060
I just turn it on and off from my other phone

1419
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,060
It's really the way it should be

1420
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,060
So you said you thought that it was most of the cost of a phone

1421
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:24,060
You can actually get the Kurosera Dura XT for $47

1422
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,060
Now, at first glance, you might look at that and go

1423
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,060
Why would I want that old looking flip phone?

1424
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,060
Oh, I don't know

1425
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,060
You know how I got started on Ting?

1426
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:33,060
I was listening to the Linux action show

1427
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,060
And the only time I had to do that was at like three in the morning

1428
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,060
So my wife was next to me sleeping

1429
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,060
And all of a sudden, I get out of bed

1430
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,060
And I'm over at my computer

1431
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,060
And she goes, what are you doing?

1432
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,060
And I'm like, I got to check this out

1433
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,060
I think you can get a phone for like $10 a month

1434
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,060
And she's like, do we have to do that now?

1435
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,060
And I'm like, yeah, we have to do that now

1436
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,060
So I ordered something like this

1437
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,060
It was made by Samsung, but it's very similar

1438
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,060
It's just a little flip phone

1439
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,060
And that was how I got started on Ting

1440
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:58,060
And it was just my, what you were talking about, a Bat Phone

1441
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,060
So I gave Sarah the number

1442
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,060
And I'm like, here, you're the only one that has this number

1443
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,060
Anything really important happens, call me on this

1444
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,060
The battery will last a while

1445
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,060
And I'll just have this with me

1446
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:10,060
And then once I learned that I made sure that I could get coverage everywhere I wanted

1447
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,060
Then I switched over to Hog

1448
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:16,060
So this Kyocera Dura, right, this is a $47 feature phone

1449
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,060
It's super durable

1450
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,060
They joke here they can get hit by missiles

1451
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,060
And it still works

1452
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,060
What if they tested that?

1453
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:26,060
Well, it meets the military 801G standard

1454
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,060
Which means the phone can take dust, rain, radiation, salt, and humidity

1455
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,060
I don't see anything about missiles

1456
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,060
No, I don't either

1457
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,060
It has Bluetooth

1458
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,060
It also has a camera

1459
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,060
Now, it's not going to be a very good camera

1460
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,060
But you know what this made me think?

1461
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,060
If it's rugged, which means it's probably going to handle heat and stuff okay

1462
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,060
In my glove box

1463
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,060
It has a camera

1464
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,060
I could just have this thing plugged into my cigarette adapter for $6 a month

1465
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:50,060
When you get a $50 credit, the phone is freaking free

1466
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,060
And then it's just $6

1467
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:55,060
And I could have an emergency phone in my vehicle at all times

1468
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,060
That's really nice

1469
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,060
You could have an emergency phone in your vehicle

1470
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,060
Or I like to spend a lot of time at the lake in the summer

1471
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,060
It would be great to throw that in the backpack

1472
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,060
And just know that if I ever need a phone and it gets a little wet

1473
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,060
I don't have to baby it and stuff like that

1474
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,060
Or like I was just out at the lake recently

1475
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:16,060
And I was very, very aware that I just got the S6

1476
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,060
And it's out there at the lake

1477
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:21,060
And I'm like if I freaking ruin this phone out on the lake

1478
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,060
And it's just like even out in the sun and stuff it bakes

1479
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:25,060
So that would be the perfect day to take my day phone

1480
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,060
Now it sounds really crazy to take a different phone with you

1481
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,060
Depending on where you're going

1482
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,060
But it's so easy to move numbers around like with Google Voice and stuff

1483
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,060
And it's so cheap to do it at $6 a month

1484
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,060
And when you get the $50 service credit, this phone is free

1485
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,060
And the same thing, they have the MiFi adapters

1486
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,060
Actually, you know what I noticed?

1487
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,060
The phone is $47

1488
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,060
So actually, the phone is free

1489
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:49,060
And they're going to pay for half of the line charge for the first month or whatever

1490
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,060
They're going to pay the first $3 for the service

1491
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,060
I know

1492
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,060
It's nuts

1493
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,060
How can they afford to do that?

1494
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,060
That's what's so awesome about the MVNO structure

1495
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:00,060
They didn't have to dig the dirt and put all of those towers in

1496
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,060
So they didn't blow out a billion dollars doing that

1497
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,060
So they can focus on the customer service

1498
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,060
They can focus on the right devices

1499
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:10,060
They can focus on the awesome plans and making the deals possible

1500
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,060
They buy up all the spectrum from these guys at wholesale

1501
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,060
And they get a great price on that

1502
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,060
And when you remove that layer of having to constantly invest in the infrastructure

1503
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,060
And all the techs and pulling all the fiber and all that

1504
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,060
When you remove all of that, you can focus on really the customer experience

1505
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,060
And that's Ting's secret weapon

1506
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,060
And that's why they're always going to be more competitive than the other guys

1507
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,060
So go to linux.ting.com

1508
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,060
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

1509
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,060
Alright, so Fedora 22 came out

1510
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,060
The last couple Fedora releases we've gotten a lot of coverage

1511
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,060
We've gone from really not talking about Fedora very much

1512
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,060
To now we talk about Fedora a lot

1513
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,060
And I feel like

1514
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,060
Linux action shows are definitely improving

1515
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:52,060
Noah takes no credit for himself there of course

1516
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,060
I wasn't there for the other two reviews

1517
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,060
I'm just saying the quality of the show is improving

1518
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:57,060
Because you're talking about Fedora

1519
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,060
It's for people who like to mess with computers

1520
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,060
That is true actually

1521
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,060
I would agree with that

1522
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:05,060
Fedora is for people that like to mess with computers

1523
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,060
I actually agree with Leo Laporte on something

1524
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,060
That's amazing

1525
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:12,060
So we did mention that Fedora 22 marks the demise of YUM

1526
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,060
And the introduction of DNF

1527
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,060
And does anybody in the Mumble remember with DNF?

1528
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,060
Yeah exactly

1529
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,060
The quality of Fedora increased as well

1530
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,060
What does DNF stand for?

1531
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,060
Do you remember?

1532
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,060
Does not stand for anything maybe

1533
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,060
But here's the one thing that was the miss in our review

1534
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,060
That I wanted to follow up on right now

1535
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,060
And I also wanted to kind of mention it

1536
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,060
Because it's one of the semi-controversial things

1537
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,060
About the new release of Fedora

1538
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,060
It's not the use of Wayland for GDM

1539
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,060
But it's the new lib input

1540
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,060
That changes the way trackpads are handled

1541
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,060
And for my Synaptics trackpads

1542
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:47,060
I have noticed a huge improvement in accuracy

1543
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:50,060
Right now I'm using it to scroll this page

1544
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:53,060
I can't quite describe what it is that feels different about it

1545
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,060
But it feels very good

1546
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,060
Like this scroll

1547
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,060
It's right on the mouse

1548
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,060
It's right on it

1549
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,060
And do you notice the difference too with the mouse input?

1550
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,060
Not on this piece of crap

1551
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,060
But on my System76

1552
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,060
Or on my

1553
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
I have the

1554
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,060
Not a Dell

1555
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,060
Lenovo

1556
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,060
That's what it is

1557
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,060
My wife's Lenovo

1558
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,060
I was testing it on there

1559
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,060
And on those with smoother trackpads

1560
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:17,060
It works

1561
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,060
It was very responsive

1562
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,060
And I think you made the

1563
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:21,060
You said this

1564
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,060
I think Linux Unplugged

1565
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,060
Maybe it was last week

1566
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,060
And it struck a chord with me

1567
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,060
It feels like the cursor is glued to your finger

1568
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,060
Yes

1569
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,060
It's attached to your finger

1570
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,060
Exactly

1571
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,060
It's right there

1572
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,060
They've really nailed it

1573
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,060
It feels like a level of mouse responsiveness

1574
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,060
I've never seen in X before

1575
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,060
I thought maybe that just wasn't capable in X11

1576
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:40,060
And I was going, okay, I've got to wait for Wayland, I guess

1577
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,060
I hope they fix it then

1578
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,060
But LibInput's real nice

1579
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:46,060
So DNF, by the way, stands for Danified Yum

1580
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1581
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,060
Dandyified, right?

1582
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,060
Dandyified Yum

1583
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,060
Dandyified Yum

1584
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:51,060
Dandyified

1585
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,060
It's amazing how they come up with these names

1586
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,060
It's something

1587
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,060
Here's what's funny

1588
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,060
Here's what's funny

1589
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,060
That is going to be in some sort of corporate brief at some point

1590
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:04,060
The selling points of RHEL 9, RHEL 10 is going to update

1591
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,060
An update package manager

1592
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:06,060
You're right

1593
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,060
And they're going to be using the Dandyified Yum

1594
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,060
Like some guy in a business suit is going to sit there

1595
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:11,060
And have to listen

1596
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,060
It's just kind of funny to me

1597
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,060
It is

1598
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,060
I never thought about it from the RHEL perspective

1599
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,060
Yeah

1600
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,060
Anybody in the Mumba Room want to share their perspectives

1601
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,060
On Fedora 22 before I kind of get into what's coming up

1602
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,060
For Fedora 23?

1603
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,060
Nobody has used Fedora 22

1604
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,060
You're all missing out

1605
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:27,060
Do you know what you're missing?

1606
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,060
I've used every Fedora release since one

1607
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,060
That's a great release

1608
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,060
And nobody has tried Fedora 22

1609
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,060
This might be the best release of Fedora yet

1610
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,060
Yeah

1611
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,060
With a couple of exceptions

1612
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,060
I've had some weird problems with Chrome under Fedora 22

1613
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060
A couple of my extensions did not install

1614
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,060
Yeah

1615
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,060
Which has never happened to me before

1616
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,060
And Flash video plays

1617
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,060
The Chrome tab shows the audio is playing

1618
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,060
But I don't actually get any sound out from Chrome

1619
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,060
That's an Adobe problem

1620
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,060
It's a Flash

1621
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,060
I know, but I've never had that problem before

1622
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,060
I'm just kidding

1623
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,060
I don't even know if it is

1624
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,060
Is it even Flash?

1625
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:55,060
Isn't it rendering in HTML5?

1626
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,060
Did we talk about this?

1627
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,060
Oh, that's right

1628
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,060
I don't think it's

1629
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,060
That's right

1630
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,060
We tried HTML5 video and it doesn't work either

1631
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,060
It's just any sound in Chrome

1632
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,060
Yeah

1633
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,060
And Firefox doesn't have that problem

1634
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,060
Yeah

1635
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:05,060
So that's

1636
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,060
I've had those issues

1637
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,060
But for the most part it has been pretty good for me

1638
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,060
Chrome is sort of a sticky point

1639
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,060
I'd like to get the audience's response

1640
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:15,060
Obviously our virtual lug has not been too excited about Fedora 22

1641
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,060
Yeah, well I guess

1642
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,060
So here's the thing too

1643
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,060
Fedora is not for everyone

1644
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,060
And Red Hat acknowledges that Fedora is not for everyone

1645
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,060
And I am a diehard lover of Fedora

1646
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,060
I acknowledge that Fedora isn't for everyone

1647
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,060
Fedora is a great release if you

1648
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,060
For one, for a long time

1649
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,060
If you wanted to use Gnome

1650
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,060
It was a great release to have

1651
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:34,060
Because if you don't want to take the time to put Arch together

1652
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,060
Because maybe I just want to install my operating system

1653
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:41,060
And I'd like to have things like a software manager and stuff like that

1654
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:44,060
I think that Fedora fits the bill pretty well

1655
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:48,060
And then like I said, I think the real sweet spot is

1656
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,060
If you're a system administrator

1657
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:52,060
And you want something that you can try out the newest versions of something

1658
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:57,060
Before it actually goes into stable production

1659
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,060
I wonder too

1660
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,060
Maybe not many

1661
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,060
I wonder how many people are waiting for Korora 22

1662
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,060
The re-spin of Fedora that includes all the codecs

1663
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,060
And makes it much easier for end users

1664
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,060
So I want to clarify this

1665
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,060
So somebody says they want to bring up the comparison to Antragos

1666
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,060
Antragos is a great installer

1667
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,060
It's a great distro

1668
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,060
And I think it does do a very good job of just

1669
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,060
You plug the USB key and then I have Linux

1670
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:24,060
However, first of all, there are tiny little issues that do come up with Antragos

1671
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,060
Like its installer can be broken from time to time?

1672
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,060
Like the installer doesn't recognize the internet

1673
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,060
That seems to be an issue

1674
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,060
But the other thing too is

1675
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:35,060
Antragos still is a very customized

1676
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,060
It's very customized and it's very minute

1677
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,060
So okay, alright

1678
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,060
Give me like one example

1679
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,060
Alright, so when you plug the USB drive in

1680
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,060
You have to choose if you want to

1681
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:46,060
You have to choose which desktop

1682
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:47,060
Sorry

1683
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:49,060
You put the CD in, Chris

1684
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,060
No, I just like that you're

1685
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:55,060
Like how the desktop environment handles the USB storage medium

1686
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,060
Is like a major issue for you

1687
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,060
It's like a deal breaker

1688
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,060
I was talking about installing it

1689
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,060
But you have to choose the desktop environment, right?

1690
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:06,060
And so for somebody that plays a lot of Linux distros

1691
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,060
That's super nice

1692
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,060
And I think that's an awesome

1693
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,060
Sorry, go ahead

1694
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,060
I was saying you get to choose a desktop environment

1695
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,060
Yeah, that's true

1696
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,060
You get to

1697
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,060
But kind of the nice thing about Fedora

1698
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,060
Is when I plug it in

1699
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,060
I can just install it

1700
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Some of those things are gone

1701
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,060
And in some respects it's kind of nice

1702
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:24,060
Because it's kind of a mix between

1703
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,060
This really bleeding edge

1704
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,060
And not just having to custom

1705
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,060
A curated thing

1706
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,060
Pick every single thing

1707
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,060
I have a mail client

1708
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,060
I have a web browser

1709
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,060
So have you tried Korora?

1710
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,060
No

1711
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,060
Well yeah, a while ago

1712
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,060
I haven't tried it with obviously

1713
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,060
They don't have Korra 22 out yet

1714
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:40,060
And I think like people in our Mumble Room

1715
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,060
If you've been kind of

1716
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,060
Or in our audience

1717
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,060
If you've kind of been borderline curious about Fedora

1718
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,060
But you're worried about it

1719
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,060
Maybe not working for you

1720
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,060
You could just try straight up Fedora

1721
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,060
It's pretty great

1722
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,060
Yeah

1723
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,060
Korora 22 when it hits though

1724
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,060
You know like

1725
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,060
One of the things I really like about it

1726
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,060
Is it just

1727
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,060
It comes loaded again

1728
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,060
I know this is always my go to

1729
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,060
But it just comes loaded with a ton of stuff that I like

1730
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,060
So you get to choose from

1731
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,060
Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, MATER, XFCE

1732
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,060
It's got Adobe Flash already installed

1733
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,060
Dropbox, Google Chrome is loaded

1734
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,060
With the Google Talk plugin

1735
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,060
RPM, Fusion repos are already set up

1736
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,060
VirtualBox is already

1737
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,060
Is ready to go

1738
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:15,060
Third party driver support is set up

1739
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:16,060
And ready to go

1740
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,060
Like for Nvidia graphics cards

1741
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,060
Steam is no problem to get going

1742
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:21,060
Like it just

1743
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,060
It just takes all of the stuff that

1744
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,060
You might want

1745
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,060
And makes it ready to go

1746
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,060
So I guess where I get kind of disappointed with that is

1747
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,060
I guess it makes me disappointed

1748
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,060
That we have to have

1749
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,060
Essentially a fork of Fedora

1750
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,060
To get those things

1751
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,060
It's a respin

1752
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,060
They're using the respin tools I think in Fedora

1753
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,060
I would like to get that respin

1754
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,060
If your opinion is reflected

1755
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,060
On a large user base

1756
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,060
And I think it is

1757
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,060
I think it would be

1758
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,060
It would be nice to see those changes implemented

1759
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,060
You know they won't

1760
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,060
Because of the legal issues

1761
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,060
Right

1762
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,060
So this is taking care of a problem

1763
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,060
That Red Hat can't legally do

1764
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:59,060
If Red Hat wanted to make the most amazing desktop

1765
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,060
Ever

1766
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,060
They couldn't

1767
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:02,060
Because of the legality

1768
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,060
So you know what

1769
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,060
These guys take care of it for them

1770
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,060
And the thing is

1771
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:07,060
It follows pretty closely to Fedora

1772
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,060
And if you want to use regular Fedora you can

1773
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,060
I just think Karora is a great option

1774
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,060
Fedora 23 is going to have a new way to upgrade

1775
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:17,060
So FedUp has been around since Fedora 17

1776
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,060
Have you ever used FedUp?

1777
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,060
Yes

1778
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,060
Yes I have

1779
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,060
FedUp is getting rewritten

1780
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,060
To be totally honest

1781
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,060
I would not recommend upgrading Fedora

1782
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,060
I've done it

1783
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,060
I've done it a couple times

1784
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,060
But I've run into issues far more times

1785
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,060
Like probably

1786
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,060
It's probably not an exaggeration to say

1787
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,060
Probably one out of every three times

1788
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,060
Something bad happens

1789
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,060
Between 15 and 16 was particularly horrible

1790
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,060
Because what would happen is

1791
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,060
You would upgrade the system

1792
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,060
And it would just do this thing

1793
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,060
Where you would load

1794
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,060
It would load the log in manager

1795
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,060
And you would type in your password

1796
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,060
And then it would just go right back to you

1797
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,060
Asking for the password again

1798
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,060
And I could not find a way to fix it

1799
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,060
How annoying

1800
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:55,060
Well it's annoying when it's on your laptop

1801
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,060
And all of your work is there

1802
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:58,060
And I can't log in

1803
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
And I'm sitting in front of somebody

1804
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,060
And they're going why can't you log in

1805
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Then I have to explain that

1806
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,060
I don't know why I can't log in

1807
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,060
And not only can I not log in

1808
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,060
But I can't even log in to find out why I can't log in

1809
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,060
So here's what they're doing

1810
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,060
Here's what they're doing to FedUp

1811
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,060
They say they've come to the conclusion

1812
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,060
That the current design is unsupportable

1813
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,060
Mostly due to upgrade.image

1814
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:16,060
Which turns out to cause more problems than it solves

1815
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,060
So for Fedora 23

1816
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,060
FedUp needs to be redesigned

1817
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:23,060
They're going to download packages for the new system

1818
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:26,060
And then they're going to use SystemD

1819
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:29,060
And it's offline updates facility

1820
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:30,060
To install the packages

1821
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,060
This is really simple

1822
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,060
They say it's going to be a simple enough approach

1823
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,060
That probably will be provided by the system packaging tools

1824
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:37,060
They have a proof of concept already up on GitHub

1825
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,060
Integrated in as a DNF plugin

1826
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,060
As a DNF plugin

1827
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,060
A dandy-ified yum plugin?

1828
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,060
Yep

1829
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,060
This behavior could be implemented by package kit

1830
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:49,060
Which would make it easy to write a gooey wrapper for it

1831
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:51,060
So the plan is to drop upgrade.image

1832
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,060
Move to upgrade support into the system packaging tools

1833
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,060
And make it a simpler system

1834
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,060
So use the SystemD offline update functionality

1835
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060
Bob is indeed your uncle

1836
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,060
What do you think of that?

1837
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:03,060
Look at SystemD being an essential tool to do the updates

1838
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:07,060
Do you think that this is another sign

1839
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:11,060
That the Red Hat group is trying to move

1840
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:14,060
Is trying to repurpose and restructure

1841
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:18,060
Fedora to be more streamlined for the workforce?

1842
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:22,060
Rather than just being a testing bed for Red Hat?

1843
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,060
That's a, yeah, why do they care?

1844
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:26,060
Yeah, why do they care about being

1845
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,060
I mean, blowing away a desktop isn't that big of a deal

1846
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,060
I mean, especially if you're using Fedora

1847
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:31,060
Especially if it's for enthusiasts

1848
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,060
Yeah, right

1849
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:35,060
So it almost, and you know, look at the wording

1850
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,060
They've changed it to Fedora

1851
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,060
Now they call it Fedora Workstation

1852
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,060
That alone is interesting

1853
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,060
The only thing that is missing for me to go

1854
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:44,060
Every client I work for and say

1855
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,060
We're done with using this, that or the other

1856
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,060
We're going to switch to Fedora

1857
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,060
I have to have an LTS

1858
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,060
I have to have

1859
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,060
I have to have some sort of a locked thing

1860
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,060
That's there for three or four or five versions

1861
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56,060
That is centered around a desktop operating system

1862
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,060
And 18 months just isn't enough

1863
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,060
No, it's not

1864
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,060
And then the other thing that would be nice

1865
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,060
I can live without it, but it would be nice

1866
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,060
Is if they could offer support

1867
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,060
So I could say, pay $800, $900 per workstation

1868
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,060
And you can call this company anytime and they'll help

1869
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,060
There are clients that would demand that

1870
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:13,060
So if that would be, that would be nice

1871
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:14,060
But I can live without that

1872
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,060
We can do the support

1873
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,060
So that's not the end of the world

1874
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,060
I mean, that is how I make money, right?

1875
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:18,060
I guess

1876
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,060
You could turn away as a money maker, I suppose

1877
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,060
But I'm still not convinced it's going to be a workable solution

1878
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,060
Because the problem, honestly, is

1879
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:25,060
Fedora releases

1880
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,060
And I think 22 is an example of this

1881
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,060
In my opinion, take a month before they're good

1882
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,060
I think it takes a month of updates

1883
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,060
A month before RPM fusion is all cut up to date for everything I need

1884
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,060
A month before everything in copper is where I'm at

1885
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:39,060
And so what you really get is

1886
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:42,060
So if you're going to turn this around to a client solution

1887
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:45,060
So you're going to wait a month before you deploy it to your clients

1888
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,060
But I'd wait a month before I deploy the next LTS

1889
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,060
Of course you would, of course you would

1890
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,060
But for Fedora, you're going to wait a month

1891
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,060
Then you're going to schedule it

1892
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,060
So it's going to be two to three months before you actually get it installed

1893
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:56,060
And then what do you really have?

1894
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,060
You have a 15, 14, 16 month support window

1895
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,060
Oh, as it is, yeah, it's not usable

1896
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,060
Even if the day it came out

1897
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,060
I could get it installed, I still wouldn't do it

1898
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,060
I don't have the time of day, the effort

1899
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,060
And I'm not going to tell my clients they have to pay me

1900
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,060
You know why we use Linux to begin with?

1901
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,060
Because I can set it up one time

1902
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,060
And then I can make my money actually doing useful things

1903
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,060
And the customer sees value

1904
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,060
Because they're not paying me to redo things constantly

1905
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:21,060
If I tell them that

1906
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,060
Because you can't wait the actual

1907
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,060
The full release

1908
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,060
I would probably up it by one

1909
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,060
So if the release cycle is, let's say

1910
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,060
They release every six months

1911
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,060
And then the support cycle is 12 months

1912
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,060
I would be replacing every six months

1913
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,060
Or this is 15, 16?

1914
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:38,060
Yeah, so I'm going to replace the cycle before that

1915
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:41,060
Because I want to give myself a little buffer time

1916
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:43,060
So even if I could do it the day it came out

1917
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,060
It wouldn't be practical

1918
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,060
Yeah, if they really want Workstation

1919
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,060
And it seems to me it would be so good

1920
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,060
For so many of their initiatives

1921
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,060
If more people were using Fedora Workstation

1922
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,060
The more people that are using Fedora Workstation

1923
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,060
Are going to be writing software for Fedora Cloud

1924
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,060
The more people that are deploying Fedora Cloud

1925
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,060
The more people that are going to use Red Hat Enterprise

1926
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,060
When they step up to the next level

1927
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,060
The more people that are buying Red Hat Enterprise

1928
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,060
Are buying huge fatty support contracts

1929
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,060
That milks the cow

1930
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,060
So it seems to me

1931
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,060
I know at first pass

1932
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,060
You can't quite see how Fedora

1933
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,060
How doubling down on Fedora

1934
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,060
And making it a long-term supportable product

1935
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,060
Makes them money

1936
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,060
But to me it seems pretty clear

1937
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,060
You can put it on a lot of desktops

1938
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,060
And plus they're just going to have to compete

1939
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:21,060
With other distros anyways if they don't do it

1940
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,060
And the model has been here for a long time

1941
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,060
To do stuff like this

1942
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,060
So for example, how many times

1943
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:28,060
Do you have a program that you have the choice

1944
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,060
Between the unstable and the stable?

1945
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,060
Why can't we do that?

1946
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,060
Why can't we have Fedora Workstation

1947
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,060
And Fedora Bleed?

1948
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,060
And Fedora Bleed is the

1949
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,060
Every time a mouse moves

1950
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:37,060
Yeah, right, exactly

1951
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,060
Every time something moves

1952
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,060
We put something in there

1953
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,060
We see if it works

1954
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,060
And then when it crashes and burns

1955
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,060
Oh well, at least we have

1956
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,060
Fedora Workstation

1957
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,060
And then Fedora Workstation

1958
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,060
You take the best of that

1959
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,060
And turn that into RHEL

1960
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:50,060
And that becomes a server

1961
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,060
That's essentially what they do

1962
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,060
But without the support though

1963
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:54,060
Yeah, well kind of

1964
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,060
Except not really

1965
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:57,060
Because I still see a lot of

1966
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,060
Really, DNF should not be

1967
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,060
Well, actually it has worked really well

1968
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,060
So I guess I can't say that yet

1969
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,060
But I feel like there should have been more

1970
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:06,060
I should have had more of a chance

1971
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,060
To play with DNF before

1972
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,060
It was in 21

1973
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,060
Yeah, I guess

1974
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:11,060
But it was a transition

1975
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:15,060
Actually, DNF was instituted in 18

1976
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,060
Oh really?

1977
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,060
I started playing with it in 21

1978
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,060
Yeah, okay

1979
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,060
Yeah, I wanted to give

1980
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,060
While we're talking about DNF

1981
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,060
I wanted to give Heaven's Revenge a chance

1982
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,060
To geek out

1983
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:26,060
I know you and Rotten were looking at

1984
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,060
Go ahead, Heavens

1985
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,060
Alright, DNF is an acronym for

1986
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
A SAT Solver Algorithm

1987
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,060
As in a Satisfiability Solver

1988
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,060
It started up in YUM on OpenSUSE

1989
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:41,060
To do their dependency management

1990
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:43,060
For package dependencies

1991
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,060
Yeah

1992
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:48,060
So DNF means Disjunctive Normal Form

1993
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,060
It's just the acronym of what the

1994
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,060
Class Combining Algorithm is

1995
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:55,060
For how they do the SAT solving

1996
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,060
That's geeky

1997
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,060
Thank you, sir

1998
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,060
Thank you

1999
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,060
That's a good way to end the Fedora discussion

2000
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,060
Right there

2001
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,060
I think, you know

2002
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,060
I invited Matthew Miller, the Fedora Project Lead

2003
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:05,060
On the show today

2004
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,060
But then we moved the show today

2005
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,060
Sorry, Matthew, if you were going to make it

2006
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,060
I'm fascinated to see where they're going

2007
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,060
Fascinated to see what Fedora 23 has in store

2008
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,060
And see what they do with the workstation spin

2009
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,060
I have a lot of interest in that

2010
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,060
I think that's going to be a big deal

2011
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,060
Just a couple of bits of business

2012
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,060
We'll be back at our regular time slot

2013
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,060
On Tuesday next week

2014
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,060
2 p.m. Pacific

2015
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:24,060
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

2016
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,060
Slash calendar

2017
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,060
To get that all up in your business

2018
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,060
We're also attempting to raise some more funds

2019
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,060
For the network

2020
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,060
Post Linux Fest and events

2021
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:33,060
We are hoping to get some more support

2022
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,060
On our Patreon page

2023
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:36,060
Over at patreon.com slash today

2024
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,060
We'll have some interesting developments

2025
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,060
Coming there soon

2026
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,060
And when you go over there

2027
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,060
There is a video that Noah and I posted

2028
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,060
In fact, if I go to the post real quick

2029
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,060
I can go pull this up

2030
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,060
Noah, do you remember we did this?

2031
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,060
I posted this from my phone

2032
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,060
Yeah

2033
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:50,060
A May studio update

2034
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,060
Posted for our patrons

2035
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,060
Look at your face right there

2036
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,060
It looks like I'm calling you out on something

2037
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:56,060
Yeah, I think you were

2038
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,060
Yeah, so there I am

2039
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,060
Rocking my HTML5 shirt

2040
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,060
And Noah and I are doing an in-studio build

2041
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:03,060
Where Noah shows us

2042
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,060
Here, look at this shot right there

2043
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,060
Look at that

2044
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:06,060
You can see the rig we're working on

2045
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,060
And we talk to our patrons about that

2046
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,060
We try to do those from time to time

2047
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:11,060
For our

2048
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,060
Oh jeez

2049
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,060
Don't put Rekai in the shot

2050
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,060
There's almost a beard in the shot

2051
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,060
That's for the patrons only

2052
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,060
Yeah, yeah

2053
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,060
Cannot show that on the May studio

2054
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,060
See that right there

2055
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,060
Is worth signing up to be a patron

2056
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:21,060
Yeah, patreon.com slash today

2057
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,060
The money raised there isn't just for the Tech Talk Today show

2058
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,060
It is for all of the shows

2059
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,060
And Tech Talk Today is the way I thank you for that

2060
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:29,060
And with that

2061
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:31,060
We're going to have some announcements

2062
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,060
Of where that funding is going

2063
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,060
But it helps us build a little runway and predictability

2064
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,060
Without having to increase our sponsor load

2065
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,060
Patreon.com slash today

2066
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,060
Also, last but not least

2067
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:41,060
I'd love to get submissions from the audience for Runs Linux

2068
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,060
If you have a cool Runs Linux rig

2069
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,060
Get some video or audio of it

2070
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,060
Or pictures of it

2071
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
And send it to linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com

2072
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,060
If it's like a YouTube video

2073
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,060
You can upload that ass and send us a link

2074
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:51,060
We'd totes appreciate that

2075
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,060
And then we'll feature it on an episode of the Linux Action Show

2076
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,060
Now, we have a lot of really good episodes in the pipeline

2077
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,060
For the Linux Action Show

2078
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,060
So tune in on Sundays as well

2079
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,060
10 a.m. Pacific, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

2080
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,060
And if you want to make this show better

2081
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,060
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2082
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,060
Including the feedback thread

2083
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,060
To share your thoughts on anything we talked about today

2084
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:09,060
Noah

2085
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:10,060
Yes sir

2086
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,060
Is there any place you'd like to plug for folks to check out

2087
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,060
For you throughout the week

2088
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,060
You can head over to AltaSpeed

2089
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,060
There you go

2090
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:15,060
And check out what I do during the day

2091
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,060
In fact, actually

2092
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,060
I think next week on Linux Action Show

2093
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:21,060
You're going to find a slightly different aspect

2094
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:22,060
Of AltaSpeed

2095
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,060
That we haven't really talked about before

2096
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:24,060
Yeah, we're going to have a feature on that

2097
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:25,060
Also, check out my new Twitter account

2098
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,060
I've changed

2099
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,060
But it's still chrisles

2100
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,060
You just have to re-follow it

2101
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,060
At chrisles

2102
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:30,060
Alright everybody, thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of

2103
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,060
Linux Unplugged

2104
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,060
See you right back here

2105
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:52,060
Next week!

2106
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,060
Alright, JBtitles.com

2107
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,060
JBtitles

2108
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,060
Let's go

2109
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,060
And a last chance to vote

2110
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
We've got the Fedora 22 discussion in here

2111
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,060
We have a lot of topics we talked about today

2112
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:11,060
So, JBtitles.com

2113
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:12,060
And we'll pick that

2114
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,060
Disjoint of normal Fedora

2115
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,060
Do not Fedora

2116
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,060
Wow, Fed up with Fed up

2117
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:18,060
Wow

2118
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:19,060
The year of the Linux laptop

2119
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:21,060
Ooh, that's not bad, Ubi

2120
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,060
That's not bad

2121
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,060
Carboard container catastrophe

2122
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,060
That's not bad either

2123
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,060
Some good ones

2124
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,060
Dell recommends Ubuntu

2125
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:27,060
Mmm

2126
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,060
Mmm

2127
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,060
Crappy desktop environment

2128
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,060
Ouch, guys

2129
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,060
Ouch

2130
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,060
What's a crappy desktop environment?

2131
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,060
Well, I don't know

2132
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,060
Apparently somebody thinks something's crappy

2133
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,060
JBtitles.com

2134
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,060
JBtitles.com

2135
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:40,060
What'd you think, Mr. Noah?

2136
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,060
What'd you think?

2137
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:42,060
What are we doing after this?

2138
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,060
I'm gonna decode a radio

2139
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,060
What are you doing?

2140
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:45,060
Really, really isn't it what you think of this?

2141
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,060
What are you doing after this?

2142
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:47,060
Uh, well

2143
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,060
Rekai and I are gonna cuddle

2144
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,060
Ooh, nice

2145
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,060
And, and, and

2146
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:51,060
Burgers, right?

2147
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:52,060
You're gonna get burgers

2148
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,060
I have to give him five guys

2149
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Cause he, uh

2150
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,060
He gets really crabby if you don't give him five guys

2151
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:57,060
Yeah

2152
01:42:57,060 --> 01:42:58,060
Yeah

2153
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,060
Yeah, for sure

2154
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,060
He comes out and he's like

2155
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,060
Where's my five guys?

2156
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,060
Yeah, and he hits you

2157
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:03,060
He whips you with his beard

2158
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,060
He, that happens

2159
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,060
Uh, disjointive, uh

2160
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,060
Disjunctive

2161
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,060
Disjunctive, uh

2162
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,060
Normal fedora

2163
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:10,060
I misspelled it

2164
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,060
Can't even

2165
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:12,060
What are you trying to say?

2166
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,060
It was disjunctive normal form

2167
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:17,060
And I changed it to just disjunctive normal fedora

2168
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:20,060
Carboard container catastrophe and year of the Linux laptop

2169
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,060
Are our top contenders

2170
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,060
JBtitles.com

2171
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,060
It's a tight vote

2172
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,060
It's a tight, tight, tight, tight vote

2173
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,060
So, um

2174
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,060
You guys

2175
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:27,060
I got a little

2176
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,060
I got a little anecdote for you

2177
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,060
Wanna hear an anecdote?

2178
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:30,060
I don't know if you would actually

2179
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,060
Oh, okay

2180
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,060
Cause it's gonna be a rip on fedora

2181
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,060
Why would I do that, dude?

2182
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:35,060
I don't know

2183
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:36,060
We just

2184
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,060
Do not fedora

2185
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,060
Why would you do that?

2186
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,060
Why would I do that?

2187
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:40,060
Why would you do that?

2188
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:41,060
So, uh

2189
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:42,060
You know, uh

2190
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,060
It kinda goes like this, you guys

2191
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:44,060
Um

2192
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,060
Before, uh

2193
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:46,060
Before Noah came out

2194
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,060
Rekai comes into the studio

2195
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,060
And he says to me

2196
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,060
He says, you know

2197
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,060
Noah and I have been talking

2198
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,060
Like, they've been talking offline for a while

2199
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:53,060
About what a mess it is in the studio

2200
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,060
And about

2201
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:55,060
And about how

2202
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,060
They're gonna come in here

2203
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,060
And, you know

2204
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,060
It's just time for the professionals to come in

2205
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:59,060
And clean up

2206
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:00,060
Because

2207
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:01,060
You know

2208
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,060
You know, Chris

2209
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,060
You just haven't been able to figure it out

2210
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,060
So, yeah

2211
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:05,060
The big boys are gonna come in

2212
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,060
Yeah

2213
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:07,060
And we're gonna clean up this wiring mess

2214
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,060
And, uh

2215
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:09,060
Make sure that all this is cleaned up

2216
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:10,060
So, if he has any audio issues

2217
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:11,060
It must be cause of that

2218
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:12,060
Well, ladies and gentlemen

2219
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,060
I am happy to tell you

2220
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,060
As I stand here

2221
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:15,060
The wiring mess is now ten times worse

2222
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,060
Oh, okay

2223
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,060
Ten times worse

2224
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,060
So, you prefer the buzz

2225
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,060
Uh-huh

2226
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,060
Is what you're saying

2227
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,060
Uh-huh

2228
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,060
I'm just saying

2229
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,060
I'm just saying

2230
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:24,060
Your audio buzz is gone

2231
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,060
I got schooled on my wiring

2232
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,060
And how it's gonna be all cleaned up

2233
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,060
And then you guys

2234
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:28,060
Look at that mess right there

2235
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,060
Yeah

2236
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,060
Yeah

2237
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,060
So, uh

2238
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,060
I love

2239
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,060
You're very good at presenting one side of the story

2240
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,060
Oh, am I?

2241
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,060
Yeah, yeah

2242
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,060
You're very good

2243
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,060
So, here

2244
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:38,060
So, here's the thing

2245
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,060
First of all

2246
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,060
I

2247
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:41,060
The

2248
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:42,060
Here

2249
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,060
The cables that I have to work with

2250
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,060
Are the

2251
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,060
Are the spare ones that are in the box

2252
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,060
Because, you know

2253
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,060
This is an interesting argument you make

2254
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,060
And I like it

2255
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,060
So, your argument is

2256
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:50,060
And this is great

2257
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,060
Oh, no

2258
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,060
The reason

2259
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,060
Hold on

2260
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,060
Let me tell you what he's about to do

2261
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,060
Everyone

2262
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,060
So, just so you can appreciate this

2263
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,060
This is a destroyable argument

2264
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:58,060
And he's going to do it in

2265
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:02,060
In such a quick and precise manner that you'd think that he sat up all night and rehearsed

2266
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,060
No, it's just

2267
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,060
It's obvious

2268
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,060
Oh, okay

2269
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,060
I think it's funny that this is your argument

2270
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:07,060
So, your argument is

2271
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:08,060
If I understand it correctly

2272
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,060
Yeah

2273
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,060
That this would not be such a mess

2274
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,060
If you didn't have to use just the random assortment of odd cables I have

2275
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,060
Yes, actually that is exactly my argument

2276
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:14,060
Right

2277
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,060
So, my argument is as such

2278
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:18,060
It wasn't such a mess when I used those same exact cables

2279
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,060
Yeah, but

2280
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:20,060
I have the same cables

2281
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:21,060
Oh, so

2282
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,060
I use the same cables

2283
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:23,060
So, hold on a second

2284
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,060
So, what you're saying is

2285
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:25,060
I don't make that mess

2286
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,060
But the guy who was in charge of Jupiter Broadcasting was in this room and ordered all those cables

2287
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,060
to begin with when he decided that he was going to move his studio from his house over

2288
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,060
to this studio over here

2289
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,060
Now, here's the thing

2290
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:34,060
Now, that happened

2291
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,060
Somehow

2292
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:38,060
Somehow, the same amount of computers is in this room that was in this room before

2293
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:39,060
Right, except

2294
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:40,060
But there's way more wires now

2295
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:41,060
Yeah, and the reason

2296
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:42,060
And the reason for that is

2297
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:44,060
You say it's because they're an eclectic set of wires

2298
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,060
Right

2299
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,060
Except for when I used that set of wires

2300
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:47,060
Yes

2301
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:48,060
It was not this messy

2302
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,060
You did, but you also didn't have stereo in and out of the M-Audio

2303
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,060
So, you weren't feeding stereo to the Mumble Room

2304
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:52,060
We don't have stereo return into the

2305
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,060
Oh, I'm not done yet

2306
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,060
That's just one thing

2307
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:55,060
There are so many things that I've done

2308
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,060
Pause, because you're painting a bad picture

2309
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,060
Oh, okay

2310
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:58,060
That's a very compelling argument

2311
01:45:58,060 --> 01:45:59,060
Yeah

2312
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:02,060
Except for the fact that all of those cables are like three feet long and they're on the

2313
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,060
other end of the room

2314
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,060
Yes

2315
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,060
Over there

2316
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,060
None of this mess is because of that fix

2317
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,060
All right, all right, all right, fair enough

2318
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:11,060
But, but, so, to get that, so, so, we have, we have improvement, so it's not the same

2319
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,060
setup as it was before that

2320
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,060
I was destroying that argument independently

2321
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:18,060
But, now, but the reason that, the real reason for that cable mess back there

2322
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:19,060
Uh-huh

2323
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,060
That rat's nest

2324
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,060
Yeah

2325
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:22,060
That horrible mess

2326
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,060
Yeah

2327
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:24,060
It's in the wrong spot, it knocks the PC over

2328
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:25,060
That, that's happened once

2329
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:26,060
Which actually happened during the show

2330
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,060
Twice

2331
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:32,060
So, so, the reason for that is, is because since we don't have actual, enough HDMI cables

2332
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:35,060
to go all the way over here, I can't put the computer where it was before

2333
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:39,060
So, it has to go on the floor so that this, this godforsaken VGA cable, which I haven't

2334
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,060
used a VGA cable in probably ten years

2335
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:45,060
Somehow I, I have to use it, because that's the only way that you can see this on here

2336
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:49,060
So, the, what we could do if, if the cable mess bothers you that much is I could go back

2337
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:52,060
and put the nook back in, we could go back to a buzz

2338
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,060
Because

2339
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:54,060
But again

2340
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,060
The buzz is kind of nice actually

2341
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:56,060
None of this changes the buzz

2342
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,060
It does change the buzz, the buzz is gone

2343
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:01,060
No, this PC, if it wasn't for that VGA cable, could be on the other end of the room

2344
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,060
Yeah, that's true

2345
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:03,060
Yeah

2346
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,060
So, what you're saying is I should go to Best Buy and buy a, a, what do I need?

2347
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:06,060
Oh, you know what, actually, you know what

2348
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,060
I don't know

2349
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:08,060
Oh no, I'm about to destroy my own argument

2350
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:11,060
It's not an HDMI cable that we need, it's another HDMI output

2351
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:12,060
Yeah

2352
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,060
On the box

2353
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,060
Yeah, we do

2354
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:15,060
Well, I could go buy an HDMI splitter

2355
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,060
VGA's fun

2356
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,060
So

2357
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:18,060
Yeah

2358
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:21,060
So, yeah, so now, and now of course Noah flies out tomorrow morning

2359
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:22,060
And leaves me with a mess

2360
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,060
Yeah

2361
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,060
But that's fine

2362
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:25,060
That's fine

2363
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:26,060
That can be, that can be

2364
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:30,060
There's a reason that I plan to, I plan for longer, just in case I need to

2365
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:33,060
Well, I wonder what a spectrum analyzer would look like right there

2366
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:36,060
They say in the chat room, it looks like a pit of doom

2367
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,060
I have a spectrum analyzer

2368
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:40,060
I should have photoshopped this a little bit and added some additional cables

2369
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,060
Yeah, yeah, should you

2370
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,060
Yeah

2371
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,060
I'll tell you what, I'll come in here while you're in the middle of Coder Radio

2372
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,060
Yeah, there you go

2373
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,060
Yeah

2374
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,060
Good, good

2375
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,060
Alright, speaking of that, we gotta go

2376
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,060
So, let's see where our titles are

2377
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:51,060
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com

2378
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,060
And I'm refreshing

2379
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:57,060
And our top vote is, ladies and gentlemen, Disjunctive Normal Fedora

2380
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,060
Really?

2381
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:00,060
I guess you guys like the clever ones, huh?

2382
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,060
Which do you, do you have a preference there, Noah?

2383
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:05,060
Mine is still the year of the Linux laptop

2384
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:10,060
But that's only because I really like the idea that we're gonna have a year of the Linux laptop

2385
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:11,060
What?

2386
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:13,060
We've had one every year for the past 15 years

2387
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:14,060
Yeah, right

2388
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:15,060
No, that's the Linux desktop

2389
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,060
Now we're in the Linux laptop

2390
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:17,060
Catch up

2391
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:19,060
I'm on a different level

2392
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:23,060
The desktop, oh burn, the desktop is a part of the laptop

2393
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:24,060
Oh, is that how that works?

2394
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,060
Alright, alright, we'll go with Disjunctive Normal Fedora, that's fine

2395
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:30,060
I like it, I like it enough, we can do it, I think that's pretty good

2396
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:47,060
And I like Blaster
