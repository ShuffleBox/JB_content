00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 14 for November 12, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,040
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast still licking our

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,940
wounds from a technical meltdown and basking in the glow of ideals. My name is Chris.

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,940
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,940
Hey there Matt. So we made it, we're on the air. Despite what the technical snafus might

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,720
have tried, we've made it. It took a little behind the scenes magic. So last week for

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,320
the Linux action show, we had a great interview with Joss from OpenSUSE and we were just marred

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,560
in technical issues. We got like a two hour late start while the guest is waiting, he's

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,080
got to go catch a flight so total pressure is on. And there we were like literally swapping

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,320
hardware, streams going up, streams going down, recording starting and crashing. It

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,600
was touch and go. And it's funny because it all comes at a time after where I as a Linux

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,200
user and an open source advocate, free software believer had to struggle with going with the

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
practical solution, right? The solution that the business owner has to go with to do media

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,840
content and specifically video production. And I really had to fight this. And I ended

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,000
up going with the practical route and then as it all collapsed down around me, I thought

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,920
this is what I get. This is what I get. So I'm going to talk about that today because

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,240
I think this is in some form or another an issue that a lot of Linux users struggle with.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,840
Oh, I struggle with it every day.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, I do too actually. And sometimes you walk that line and you win some and you lose

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,760
some. But first, at the top of the show, we usually like to do some follow up and I had

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,800
a whole bunch of really good follow ups and then I somehow had a copy paste failure and

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,620
lost a lot of them. But Ben comes to the rescue. So you might have heard of this little thing

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,900
called Linux Format Magazine. Now you might be missing Linux Format. I don't know. I know

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,100
I certainly have. But perhaps today you saw a new bat signal up in the sky called Linux

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,720
Voice. Well, Linux Voice is an Indiegogo campaign that's just been launched by I believe some

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,640
of the guys behind the Linux Format Magazine. And one of those guys, his name is Ben Everett.

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,000
Everett, I believe he said it right. And he's joining us right now. Ben, welcome to Linux

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Unplugged.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Hi, I'm glad to be here.

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Hey, man. Well, thank you, first of all, for joining us literally at the last minute.

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Yeah, we just launched the campaign yesterday. It's a really exciting time for us.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Yeah, no kidding. That's why I wanted to get you on. So what are you guys doing here? I

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,560
know Linux Format and I know that it was honestly Linux Format was my favorite Linux Magazine

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,800
of all of them. I know you guys are trying to raise some funds. What are you trying to

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
accomplish?

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Basically, we want to do more or less what we did with Linux Format, but we'll be free

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,120
from the oversight of future so we can do it exactly the way we wanted to do it, which

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,120
means a lot more giving back to the community, a lot more community involvement. So if you've

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,080
seen the campaign, you'll know we'll be giving 50% of our profits back to the community.

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,400
And we'll also be making our content free online after nine months. And it's things

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
like that that we want to do differently.

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,800
Oh, wow. Now, so is this going to be, this is going to be essentially what people are

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,600
familiar with from the Linux Format Magazine, sort of rebooted and refined? Is that sort

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,160
of what, if I'm envisioning that? Or is this, is this something a little bit different from

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Linux Format?

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Fundamentally, it'll be the same idea as Linux Format, the same rough layout, the same basic

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,320
mix of tutorials, the same, aimed at the same sort of people, but hopefully done better.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,040
Interesting. Now, can you tell me about the podcast aspect of it?

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:01,120
Bellamy there. Hello. Don't forget to push the talk. So now there's going to be a podcast

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,600
component of it too, right?

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,360
Yeah. I mean, we've been podcasting for a while as Tuck's Radar, then as Linux Lifestyle.

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
So yeah, we'll just be shifting that over to Linux Voice.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,640
Awesome. So it's a magazine, but it's also something people can put in their ear holes

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,000
if they're commuting, something like that.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Exactly.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,400
And you guys have got, as some of the perks, you actually get like a print subscription

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,600
too. So there is going to be a print version.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Absolutely. There's this sort of vague rumor that print is dead, but we don't believe that

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,520
at all. I mean, print magazines are still selling really well. Linux Format increased

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,680
its circulation last year. I mean, digital is obviously great, but print still has got

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
a lot of life left in it.

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,200
Yeah. I think that's awesome. I'm looking at the different tiers here and I'm thinking,

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,720
if I'm going to throw down a thing, I'm going to throw it down for a print version. I guess

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm one of the minority, but for this particular type of content, I think I really like the

65
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
idea of being able to thumb through it a little bit. Of course, that's why it's great. It's

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,440
also a format in like audio or digital. So if I wanted to throw it on a device, I could.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,880
Well, very good. Very good, Ben. Well, I wish you guys a whole bunch of luck. And of course,

68
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,240
we'll keep tabs on it. And is there anything else you wanted to mention before we go on?

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,120
No. Just really encourage everyone to go and check out the campaign on Indiegogo and linuxvoice.com.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Awesome. And we will have a link to it in the show notes. So folks, go over to episode

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,280
14 of Linux Unplugged on Jupiter Broadcasting. We'll have a link to the Linux Voice Indiegogo

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,600
project. Well, Ben, we're going to go into one bit of feedback that I did grab this week.

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,680
You, however, are totally welcome to hang out with us. Part of Linux Unplugged is with

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,840
sort of like an online lug aspect to it. We let people hang out and chat with us as we

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,620
do the show. So you, sir, are more than welcome to hang out on air if you'd like. Or you can

76
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,960
take off if you need to to get on with your day, because I know you did have to join us

77
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,360
at the last minute. But interesting stuff, guys. So I'll put a link to this in the chat

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
room right now if folks watching live want to go throw in a little bit. And of course,

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,160
we will have it in the show notes. I don't know about you, Matt, but I love the idea

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,720
of just having a Linux magazine in print.

81
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,200
I think it's really telling that people are still under the impression that print is dead,

82
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,000
because it's not. I, for one, prefer Linux magazines in print. That's just kind of how

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
I like to absorb that. And I really love the idea of the model they're running with. I

84
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,880
think it's fantastic. I think it's really cool to see the writers running the show.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
I think that's awesome. I think their mission statement of actually giving back to the community

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,600
is awesome. I think the whole thing is great.

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,320
It is great. It is great. So anyways, you guys can go check that out if you would like.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,720
All right. Well, I did save one email. I don't know how I lost all the other ones, but it

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,960
was probably a pretty good one to keep, because it was on our topic of last week. So last

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,960
week we talked about the Dark Mail Initiative, and I was pretty bullish on it at first. Now

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,840
as I've had some time to reflect on it, I don't know if... I mean, honestly, nobody's

92
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,600
unseated email yet, and that might have been to Adrian's point. He writes, in my main

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,840
purpose for this email, after, by the way, he had a bunch of very nice things to say

94
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,040
about the show, but I cut it down to, he said, my main purpose for this email was about the

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,440
potential of dark mail. Thank you very much for an informative unplug session on the proposed

96
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,520
new protocol considered for replacing email. I would like to ask if this may also benefit

97
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,520
the world, then it may significantly reduce the amount of spam and fraudulent emails,

98
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,960
if I'm correct, mail could be encrypted with something like private and public keys. Number

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,560
one, if the email requires encryption, which takes longer to process before sending, and

100
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,480
will cost more in the spammer's resources, so then would the spammers be less likely to

101
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,960
bomb domains? I don't know if that's necessarily true now, because the type of encryption we're

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,660
talking about, not very expensive. Now bit message type stuff is, there's a lot more...

103
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,760
So bit message actually has something called proof of work that you have to complete, a

104
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,720
math question that you have to answer before you're allowed to send, and that, if you've

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
tried bit message, you've noticed it can sometimes be CPU intensive when you send a message,

106
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,760
that's exactly why. And that becomes just not scalable for spammers, but something like

107
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,360
signing an email with your GPG key, that's not going to slow them down.

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
No, not even close.

109
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,640
Number two, if the recipient has to decrypt the message, then only a public key of the

110
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,520
sender will successfully reveal the message. This suggests that the spammer pretends to

111
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,080
be eBay, then unless they have eBay's private key message, you'll not be able to decrypt

112
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,680
quickly. That is true. That is a nice thing, is if you have a good key structure set up,

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,160
then you can, at least it cuts down on phishing.

114
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Number three, he says, I do not know how public keys will be stored, but I can guess if a

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
company is requesting tens of thousands of public keys, they're either on a mega legitimate

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,360
company or a spammer, and they would get noticed. And that's interesting if you need somebody's

117
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
key to send it to them.

118
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,920
Yeah, that's an actually really interesting point.

119
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,360
He says, I'm sure you may think of more ways, but the hope is not only to improve confidentiality

120
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,680
with Dark Mail, but also to reduce spam. We'll see. And he's in Stonehenge, England.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Good stuff.

122
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,320
Yeah, it's some interesting thoughts. I guess after we did the episode, ours ran a piece

123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,080
about how Lavabit was never all that great security wise. And they tried to kind of,

124
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,160
I thought the timing was a bit of a takedown because they're doing the Dark Mail initiative

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,120
and they're not using the same technologies for the Dark Mail initiative that ours was

126
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
writing a takedown on.

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, but fax never stops ours before. I mean, they nitpick whatever they want and kind of

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,280
laugh it out there. Bam, so I went there. I'm just saying their whole approach is, I

129
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,800
mean, here's the thing about Dark Mail. For it to succeed, it's really, really, really

130
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,160
simple. The services we're already using, if they adopt Dark Mail, it succeeds. If those

131
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,960
services we're already using do not adopt Dark Mail, it'll still succeed, but on a much,

132
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,000
much smaller scale. It'll be much more bulletin board like.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,600
It'll be more Dark Mail. It'll be like TOR a little bit more.

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,360
Yeah, exactly. It's going to be like some weird mesh network or something. It's just,

135
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
it's going to be very limited.

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,840
I think that's it. I think if Yahoo says, hey, Yahoo Mail is going to stand out and

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,000
we'll adopt the Dark Mail protocol, or if Google says, you know what? We genuinely are

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,880
so pissed off that the NSA broke into our data centers that we'll adopt the Dark Mail

139
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,360
protocol. If those things happen, then I think we got it.

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Well, I think it's a great opportunity for Yahoo because they need a way to differentiate

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,680
themselves. They're not really a search engine anymore. I mean, they're basically just Bing's

142
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,920
little brother using their stuff.

143
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,800
So they have a real great opportunity here to say, you know what? We're going to cut

144
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,680
the cord. We're going to basically innovate and really shake things up and take some risks.

145
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Being a publicly traded corporation, that's always a little tricky, but I think it's worth

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
a try.

147
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,620
Or you could be Zimbra and you could be like, you know what? We're going to integrate this.

148
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,440
This is another reason why you want to switch to Zimbra from Exchange.

149
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,920
That would be very helpful. And that would be a really great testing area that if it

150
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,240
succeeds there, then they can expand out.

151
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Yeah. Well, you never know. You just never know, Matt. Well, so look, I got to bear my

152
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:48,860
soul on a few issues. I went through a self-struggling and evaluation process behind the scenes recently.

153
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,080
Brought me to my core, Matt. Brought me down to my core. I questioned everything.

154
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,320
It was just after you had a little cloud experience with your lost links?

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,600
No, no. This was a couple of months ago. It was a couple of months ago and it was right

156
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,600
before I spent a whole bunch of money on a big closed down, locked down system with this

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,360
proprietary software that costs way too much money. And I really had to do this deep soul

158
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,280
searching. Do I really, really, really want to do this? Do I really want to spend this

159
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,440
money or, and I was just being practical, or do I want to reduce the scope of the Jupiter

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Broadcasting Network and just switch to audio only and just say, you know what? 30, 40%

161
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
of our audience, I'm sorry, we love you, but I just can't do video anymore. That would

162
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,720
be gone to YouTube, it would be by YouTube, it would be by video embeds, right? All gone.

163
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
We only do audio. And that would be a massive reduction for the network. But I was at this

164
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,420
point where it's like I could spend five grand on a Mac Pro and another grand on Wirecast

165
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,180
and I could build a proprietary, I could build the next version of the proprietary system

166
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,120
that I used to run the network now for recording and streaming. Or I could just say, I'm not

167
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,880
going to do it anymore. I could let my ideal stand through and say, you know what? I can't

168
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,840
do it. I'm just going to do what my ideals allow me to do. Because I'm also the type

169
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,720
of person where if I can't do it well enough, like even maybe initially I can't do it well

170
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,560
enough, but I feel like eventually I'll be good at it, I'll start. But if I feel like

171
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,360
there's not a lot of chance that I'm ever going to have it at the quality level I want,

172
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,840
I'd rather just not do it, right?

173
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Yeah, exactly.

174
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,240
So video production on Linux, I'd rather just not do it.

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Well, and I think the one thing we keep running into with people is they say, but you can

176
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,840
do video production under Linux and they point to other popular video podcasts out there,

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,480
one specifically to gaming, for example, and they say, well, you can do it that way. And

178
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
I think that perhaps this is an opportunity for you to explain why that may not be a good

179
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
fit for us.

180
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,920
And you know, so I'm going to talk about that. But I also, I want to talk about how just

181
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,520
in general too, as Linux users, there's always these things that come up that we're like,

182
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,080
oh, my ideals are one thing, but the pragmatism in me is going a different direction. And

183
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,760
sometimes in the long run, you know, you pull an RMS a little bit and it turns out that

184
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
maybe-

185
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,280
And the value of this is negative.

186
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,800
Maybe you should have gone with the ideals. But before we talk about that, because that's

187
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,280
sort of the premise, and you know what, maybe I'll also give the background since you were

188
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
there.

189
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Oh, yes.

190
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,240
You got to see what people watching live didn't get to see while we were down. You were there.

191
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,560
So I'll also talk about what the hell happened this weekend. A lot of people have been asking

192
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,360
about that. But before we do that, I want to thank our sponsor this week, DigitalOcean.

193
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
Now you guys might not be familiar with DigitalOcean now since they were here last week. They're

194
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
here again this week, and I'm very, very excited. Now if you're not familiar with DigitalOcean,

195
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,080
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting. They have dedicated offerings with the most intuitive

196
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,200
and easy to spin up systems ever. Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,880
plans start at $5 per month. They get you 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD drive,

198
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,040
and a CPU, and also a terabyte of transfer. DigitalOcean has data center locations in

199
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,000
New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. The interface is simple, intuitive, the control

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,480
panel is brilliant, and power users have a bunch of great features too, like Docker support,

201
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
replicating backup images.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh, nice. I like the Docker support, right?

203
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Oh, dude. Matt, the Docker thing is... We've talked about Docker. It allows me as a sys

204
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,540
admin or it would allow somebody as a developer to create a completely isolated environment

205
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,400
locally on their laptop, on their desktop, test it, get everything working just the way

206
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,360
they want, spend all their time locally working on it, make that Docker snapshot, move it

207
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,000
up to DigitalOcean, and spin it up and have it running on one of their SSD powered VPSs.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Now I'm looking at the Create Droplet screen right now. This gives you an example of how

209
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,360
intuitive their interface is. You give it a host name, so like I could say unplugged

210
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,640
for the host name, and I could choose which one I want. Now I'm going to choose 512 megs

211
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,380
of RAM, 20 gig SSD with a terabyte of transfer. That's $5 a month, and what's awesome right

212
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,640
now, if you use the code LINUX13, lucky number 13, LINUX13, they're going to give you a $10

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,400
credit, so you can try out one of these VPSs for free for two months, and the one I spun

214
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,960
up I put up in New York, and I went with an Archbox, but they've also got Ubuntu, CentOS,

215
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,560
Debian, and Fedora. You could also just say it by application. You know, hey, I want a

216
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,920
LAMP server, or give me a Git server, right? This is a good one. I've already got my Docker

217
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,040
created. Create me an Ubuntu 1304 machine with Docker already installed, so I can just

218
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,440
drop it on there, and I am ready to go, or hey, you know what? I need a WordPress blog.

219
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,620
You can click right here. They'll spin one up. It is so cool, and then once you get it

220
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,240
just set up the way you want, you can create that image, so then from that point forward,

221
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,720
you can just spin up additional machines as you need based on that, so like for me, I

222
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,360
started with an Arch machine, got it really nice and minimal, just what I needed, got

223
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,580
a few things set up. I could take an image of that, and then from then on, whenever I

224
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,040
want an Arch machine, I just use that image if I want. It's so awesome. They call them

225
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,240
Droplets. It's really cool. It's based on KVM, which is great, some great Linux technology

226
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,840
using Docker as well. I love all of it, and really, when you're using the code LINUX13,

227
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,080
you can try it out for free. I've been using it recently to do backup recordings of our

228
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,960
live stream, to do BitTorrent sync distributions of the Unfilter Supporter Show, so that way

229
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,120
people get better speeds when they're pulling that down. DigitalOcean also has something

230
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,020
really cool for their community. They have a collection of tutorials on their community

231
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,400
site, and users can submit an article, and if it gets published, that user will get paid

232
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,280
50 bucks, which is pretty neat.

233
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Can't beat that with a stick. It's great all the way around, and I love the fact that you

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,240
can do a remote Arch install, and then do BitTorrent sync or something like that. That's

235
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
so awesome.

236
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
It is really awesome.

237
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
The geekiness, it just makes you salivate.

238
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,320
The LINUX13 is where you get started. You can go check it out, and these things, the

239
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,080
fast connection combined with the SSD really does make a difference, and the other thing

240
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,080
I love about it is I've tried other systems in the past, specifically from Rackspace and

241
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,560
Amazon, and both of them have gotchas. Like, oh, here's your DING for your CPU usage. By

242
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,680
the way, you use this much bandwidth, here's the DING.

243
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,380
The great thing about DigitalOcean is I know exactly what my cost is. It's $5 a month,

244
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:50,440
and if I use 900 megabytes of transfer, if I use a terabyte of transfer, it is $5 a month.

245
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,720
There's not, at the end of the month, this, oh my goodness!

246
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah, surprise!

247
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah, it's a fixed cost. It's exactly what I expect, and because it's there, I keep coming

248
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,520
up with new uses for it all the time. Trust me, you want your own Linux server on demand

249
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,880
up in the cloud, and you can have it in Amsterdam, you can have it in New York, and you can have

250
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,160
it on the West Coast, so go to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code LINUX13 when you check

251
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,380
out. That lets them know that you appreciate them sponsoring Linux Unplugged, and it also

252
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,840
gets you two months for free if you get that $5 unit, or you could get the big boy for

253
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,120
10 bones a month, and just have it free for that month and just try it out. I'm not going

254
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,560
to judge. You do what you want. You do what you want, and thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

255
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Linux Unplugged.

256
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,240
Big thank you. That's just awesome stuff, and boy, I'll tell you, I've got a couple

257
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,880
of items I might be rolling out onto this here pretty quick.

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Boy, howdy, Matt. Boy, howdy. Once you've got it, once you've got a system, there's

259
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,160
like, oh, you know what? I've been kind of wanting to do this. I could do that up there,

260
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,800
and then something else. You know what? I've been wanting to do this. I'll toss that up

261
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,100
there. It's been really cool.

262
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,460
It's like someone just dumped out a big box of Legos with every piece I've ever wanted

263
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,200
directly in front of me that I can build anything I want. It's awesome.

264
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah, it is pretty cool. So this week, I've got to just take a deep breath. We had a rough

265
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,360
Sunday. We had a really rough Sunday. So Friday, we canceled the fo' show, so that way I could

266
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,800
take the studio offline. Okay, I've got to back up even further. I've got to back up

267
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,000
even further. Years ago, when we decided to switch from audio to video, that's when we

268
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,640
made the switch from producing the Linux action show and related shows. At that time, it was

269
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,320
pretty much just Linux action show on Linux. We made the switch from Linux to a Hackintosh.

270
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,960
I thought I could cheat. I thought I would get by, and I wouldn't get a Mac. I wouldn't

271
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,880
be legit. I'd do a Hackintosh, and that sort of made it okay. It meant I wasn't investing

272
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,600
a bunch of money in Apple hardware.

273
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
You weren't investing in the hardware, and you still got to get some geek cred.

274
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,720
And I could dual boot Windows and Linux on them. So I used this time, and I was a contractor

275
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,680
back then, and I just made plenty of money, because I was just working crazy hours as

276
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,880
a contractor. I even had a bonus structure set up, so when I went over 40 hours, I made

277
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,520
like a good percentage rev share of the revenue from that client for the month. So I was making

278
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,320
good money, and so within a three or four month period, I spent about $10,000 trying

279
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,560
out different hardware and software configurations under the Macintosh, Linux, and Windows, trying

280
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,400
to come up with a solution to provide real quick, fast production video and live streaming

281
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,160
that I could then turn into these shows.

282
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,320
And I landed after all of that testing on the Mac, and that's when I went with Hackintosh.

283
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,940
And this has been fine, and this is a system that I've evolved and continued to sort of

284
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,120
improve upon throughout the years, till where we're at this summer. Then the summer comes

285
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,200
along and the Hackintosh starts to die. It's just gotten old, and what we need from it

286
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,120
is beyond what the hardware is capable of. And there's no upgrade path for the operating

287
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,760
system, because it probably won't boot if I upgrade it. And now the software we use

288
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,040
is starting to require new versions of the OS, and all of these problems that you run

289
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,640
into. So I'm like, okay, all right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to

290
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,440
buy a Mac Pro. I'm going to put the OS on there, and I'm going to load the software

291
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,360
on there, and I'm just going to be a big boy, and I'm just going to swallow the medicine,

292
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
right?

293
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,600
I remember this, and I remember right before the purchase, you really weighed out all your

294
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,000
pros and cons and decided you're going to bite the bullet. You're just going to do what

295
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
needs to be done. And clearly, this is going to solve all your problems, right?

296
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,680
I looked at the numbers and I said, I really honestly considered for a couple of days dropping

297
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,920
video, because then I wouldn't need to buy the Mac. I wouldn't need to buy the commercial

298
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,640
software. I could go back to doing all the production under Linux, and now that Linux

299
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,880
has gotten even further, it's even better than it was back then, right? So it's like

300
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
there's more incentive to do that now than there used to be.

301
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Oh, absolutely.

302
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,600
So I'm thinking, God, I would love to do this. And so for a couple of days, I gave real serious

303
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,880
thought. And everybody listening, think about this. All video production on Jupiter Broadcasting

304
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,880
almost went away, right? Because I really wanted to switch.

305
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,280
And so at the end, after really thinking about it, I knew that that would be just too much

306
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,040
of a loss. People do not like it when you take away things.

307
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
No.

308
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,840
Because going from video to audio is a big, totally different animal than going from audio

309
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
to video.

310
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
From audio to video.

311
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Yeah.

312
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Which is actually an addition versus a subtraction.

313
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,360
Right, right. And so I thought, okay, all right, I got to do it. So I bought the Mac Pro,

314
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,320
which has been marred with certain hardware failures, which I've had all repaired under

315
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,160
warranty, which is now fine. Then I kind of strategically waited to deploy it, because

316
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,720
a new version of the software that Jupiter Broadcasting uses, Wirecast, Wirecast from

317
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,280
Telestream came out. Version 5 came out on September 5, 2013, Matt. And I thought, I'm

318
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,640
going to give this time to cook. Now, I happen to know people who work with it. They worked

319
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
with it in beta.

320
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Yeah.

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
And they gave it the thumbs up.

322
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
It's great. Try it.

323
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,800
So I thought, okay, if I'm going to deploy this, I don't want to deploy something that

324
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm just going to have to update in a few weeks anyways. So I'm going to go straight

325
00:21:53,300 --> 00:22:00,680
to the new version. It's been out since September. Give this a go. Oh, boy. So there was, there's

326
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,360
a lot of bugs. So this is a case not to go with rolling, right? Because here I am, Mr.

327
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Rolling saying, I went with the new stuff and boy, did I get hit.

328
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,520
Exactly. Yeah, you kind of made someone else's point there. But still, still.

329
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,440
So it had a few features though that would sort of justify it. Like it has X264 support,

330
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,040
much superior video codec, right? And that plays through in like the remote network.

331
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,740
Like right now it is, Wirecast is capturing the screen from a computer that is an entirely

332
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,240
different room in my house than the Wirecast machine is, right? Because it is over the

333
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
network, over the gigabit network, and they improved it now so that the network capture

334
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,200
can do 60 frames per second over the network. That's great for games and stuff.

335
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Sure.

336
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,440
So I was like, okay, I kind of want that. And then the last feature they added that

337
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,520
I just thought I just had to have is the ability to take an RTMP stream and pull it in as a

338
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,940
camera source. So when Alan does BSD now up in Canada, I could pull it in and retransmit

339
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,040
it out to all of our endpoints like Roku's, XBMC's, the audio stream. So it gives a more

340
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,920
complete. So I'm like, all right, these are enough compelling features. I know people

341
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,280
have had it in production. I'm going to go ahead and deploy it.

342
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Seems like a great idea.

343
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah. Then I've had nothing but issues. So Friday, or Sunday, I'm sorry. I mean, how

344
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,000
would you describe what was happening, man? I was just...

345
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,900
So let me give you the spectator support. Have you ever seen one of those really angry

346
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,080
monkeys that were in the diapers that swing around from the trees and fling things? That

347
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,440
didn't actually happen. What did happen is Chris worked really hard at trying to find

348
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,240
out what was going on. It was just basically one issue after another with it. Basically,

349
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,680
he would start up the stream, he'd turn around, and then it would drop.

350
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Yeah.

351
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,880
Then he would start it up again. He'd stare at it for a little bit.

352
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,040
He wouldn't touch anything, right? Just look at it.

353
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,840
Never touch it. As soon as the eyes have rolled off of the monitor and he's heading back to

354
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,040
the seat, it's down every time. And after a while, it becomes like a perverse bad joke.

355
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,120
It's like seriously, it's like there's someone out there with a clapper trying to clap, turning

356
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,200
stuff off. It was the weirdest thing. And so yeah, it was very frustrating.

357
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,680
So we actually... I'm an old enterprise IT guy, right? So I'm about what's your disaster

358
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,480
recovery plan during a core IT upgrade. So I spent extra money, doubled up on some hardware

359
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,360
that way it wasn't like... Initially, I was going to be cheap about it. And I was going

360
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,880
to take parts from the Hackintosh, like all the HDMI capture cards and some of the drives,

361
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,860
and I was going to put them in the new Mac Pro so that way I could spend as little as

362
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,400
possible on a Mac Pro.

363
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Yeah.

364
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,360
And then as I thought about my thought, if this doesn't work, I've got mixed new and

365
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,480
old hardware in here and I can't just immediately revert back to the Hackintosh. So I spent

366
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,440
the extra money and got new stuff all for it. And so that way I could swap the two.

367
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
So there we were Sunday morning, already an hour late, our guest, Joss, had a flight he

368
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,040
needed to catch. He's in Germany. It's 10 a.m. Pacific time. God only knows what time

369
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,960
it was in Germany at that time. He's waiting on us. We can't even be in the stream to tell

370
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
him what's up.

371
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Right.

372
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,880
And I'm too busy fixing to really even tell him what's up. So I think probably at least

373
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,840
five or six times thought, we don't have an episode this week.

374
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,520
Yeah. Chris looked at me dead eyed and said, I honestly, I don't have a solution to this.

375
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,520
What do we do? And of course, I'm thinking, whatever you need to do is cool, but we're

376
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,640
both just kind of shrugging, going, ah, you know, what do we do? What do we do? Yeah.

377
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,560
And so I was like, all right, I'm going to swap back. So I swapped back to the Hackintosh.

378
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,960
I plug the Hackintosh all back up, which never goes as smooth as it's supposed to. Right.

379
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
There was little wiggly things that I had to get right. The HDMI capture cards didn't

380
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,920
work. So we had to shut everything off. Everything, all the computers had to be turned off, all

381
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,640
the camera, everything had to go down and turn it all back on. Didn't work. We had to

382
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,120
shut everything down again, turn it all back on. Then it worked the second time.

383
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,080
When watching this, it looked like you were playing Twister.

384
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,320
The Hackintosh has some sort of like GPU problem and it was totally not working. So then after

385
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,360
switching to the Hackintosh, we knew we had to go back. We had to switch back to the new

386
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,320
Mac Pro and try to get that solution, which we just bailed from working. And at this point,

387
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm thinking, my God, if we just get it up and a single camera shot on Joss or on the

388
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,000
chat room, we'll just hit record and we'll just print what we get. Right. Exactly. And

389
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,520
so I put the new machine back in, hook everything back up. And of course, there's like random

390
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,160
bugs and wirecasts where all the HDMI interfaces get reassigned every time it restarts. So

391
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,240
that way, what was once the camera is now the Skype machine, which was once the Skype

392
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,760
machine is now the camera, which was once my Bonobo is now the USB webcam.

393
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,440
This just adds, of course, to the already growing workload.

394
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,200
Right. Because then every shot has to be edited that refers to those cameras to now refer

395
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,240
to the new mapping every time. All of this is happening while we're trying to communicate

396
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,880
with the live stream, what's going on, trying to communicate with our guests, get back up

397
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,580
and running, realize it's like one teensy-tinsy little config issue that was a default on

398
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,880
how the audio got encoded, which I didn't even want. It was a change default, I think.

399
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,840
I think it was actually changed without your knowledge. It was applying AAC compression

400
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,120
to the audio, which I didn't want that. I want uncompressed audio. That's how I roll.

401
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,600
Right. And then so changing that resolved the immediate crashing. What I later discovered

402
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,680
through correspondence, I sent them a few of the crash reports from the software. Later

403
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,080
correspondence with the support, I realized, I don't know why this was never a problem

404
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,600
with the previous version, but Wirecast 5 is only a 32-bit application.

405
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,920
Oh, for pizza. Seriously?

406
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,320
I got a machine.

407
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,880
How adorable. 32.

408
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,280
I got a machine with 32 gigs of RAM and then a 32-bit core application.

409
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,760
It's kind of like, wait, what now?

410
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,680
And so it turns out X264, because it can utilize your system more, combined with the Morph

411
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,360
processor threads and memory usage, the two things were just... And I was sending an X264

412
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,080
stream off to Scale Engine for the streaming, because then the live stream would look better.

413
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,480
And again, it was their default setting. So I went with that. And so what I've discovered

414
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,600
now is I fixed that audio compression setting. So it's just doing uncompressed audio. And

415
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,800
I turned off using X264 for the live stream. So now we're using regular H264, the slightly

416
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,280
inferior version of H264. And so far, the machine is now running, according to Wirecast,

417
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,960
at 98% memory usage. That's how close we are. In fact, I'll go check it right now, because

418
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
sometimes we even go over a little bit.

419
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,960
So help me to understand that. In almost 2014, they released a new version of an application

420
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,600
designed for pro use that's designed for 32-bit systems. Am I understanding that correctly?

421
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Yeah. Okay. So right now it's using 90...

422
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
That's disgusting.

423
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,160
It's using 93% of the memory now. And so there's just an S ton of free RAM sitting on the box

424
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
not being used.

425
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,080
Yeah. It's completely not being used, because you can't. I mean, oh my God. I can't fathom

426
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,560
how they would release a new version of an application that's running with standards

427
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,040
from five, 10 years ago.

428
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,560
I think it's... So this is part of the problem is video production software has this massive...

429
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,960
It's like building a car. It has this huge pipeline of production, and they start working

430
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,400
on it back in the day. And then by the time they get it to a point where it's good, they

431
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,880
have all this legacy baggage. And this is why Apple aborted Final Cut 7 and upset everybody.

432
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,920
Well, apparently that's what Wirecast might've needed to do as well, because now they have

433
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,800
all this technical debt that they're stuck with that is really plaguing it. And I looked

434
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,760
back on this and thought, if I had that time, made the decision to just drop video for now

435
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,280
and maybe in a couple of years... Here's the thing though. I honestly don't think video

436
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,800
production will ever come to Linux at the level it is available to the Mac.

437
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,920
Not unless there's a vested interest with high money. No.

438
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,840
A company like Valve, but even then...

439
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,480
It would require a studio that has a falling out with somebody that gets mad enough. But

440
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
even then...

441
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,360
One of the reasons why it works for the Mac is because there's this huge ecosystem of

442
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:59,840
software vendors, like Telestream making Wirecast, like Blackmagic making the Intensity, all

443
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,040
of the capture technology, all the Thunderbolt peripherals, all the USB stuff that all are

444
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:10,760
designed to work with the Mac. And that takes five, 10, 15 years in the marketplace to develop

445
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,400
businesses around it. There's entire businesses that sell products around that.

446
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,160
I don't think it's ever going to come to Linux. And I think what will happen is we'll just

447
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,200
do it differently. And that will be doable on Linux. I think what we have with Hangouts...

448
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,680
Google now with Hangouts, you can do real time lower thirds. You can do green screening.

449
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,120
You can add all kinds of effects with the cheesy apps. And you can do it all from Linux.

450
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
And it's not free. It's not open.

451
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,040
And you're locked into a YouTube experience if you want to pop it out to something. That's

452
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
the problem.

453
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,520
But it shows you it can be done. And so maybe down the road, something... It sounds crazy

454
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,200
today, but I think if you would have told people that they do photo management in the

455
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,880
cloud 10 years ago, they'd say you're crazy. I think video editing will become an online

456
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,480
app in a lot of cases. And the more powerful these web browsers get with WebGL and OpenAL

457
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,200
and all these things, I think eventually it's just going to move to something else completely.

458
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,360
And then Linux will just be included at that point.

459
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,880
There are some NOE editors out there that are... They're very, very early days, very

460
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,720
close movie maker level. But I think it shows that, as you point out, it can be done. We

461
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,160
need to basically give it time. I need to win the Powerball and actually drop some coin

462
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
into developing a solution of that sort.

463
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I don't think though...

464
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
That'd be cool.

465
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,200
I think if you took Final Cut or if you took Adobe Premiere, which might be the more realistic

466
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
one, Adobe Premiere.

467
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Right.

468
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,320
If you took that and dropped it on Linux today, I don't actually think it would make much

469
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
of a difference.

470
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,080
No, no, no, no. I think that the key is to stop trying to emulate what they're doing

471
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,800
on other operating systems and basically build on what already works for us. Like as you

472
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,040
pointed out, Google Hangouts is a good example. Come up with a cloud-based solution that is

473
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,640
not trying so hard to be something else, but basically utilizes some of the tools we already

474
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,400
have, HTML5, various other stuff on the backend, all these little goodies put together and

475
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,400
find ways of making the technologies that already exist work better and let it grow

476
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
organically.

477
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
That'd be interesting to see what happens.

478
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
So I guess that...

479
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Can I chime in on this?

480
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Yeah.

481
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,440
So I was just thinking, if you're going to move video editing to the cloud, that's going

482
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,000
to need a lot more bandwidth than most people are currently capable of.

483
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,680
Right. But look at the way they do with Hangouts where you connect in, they do the switching

484
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,400
remotely and you stream to them and they record the central location.

485
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
That's right.

486
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Yep.

487
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
And that's the key. That's the key.

488
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
What's LightWorks like nowadays?

489
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:37,040
Again, it's okay, but the problem is the editor is... I think the editor is a problem that

490
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,680
somebody is going to solve, but it's the hardware ecosystem, it's the codecs, it's all of it.

491
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
It's all missing.

492
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,960
It's the ability to put something on a live stream and have all that available on the

493
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
go.

494
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,800
Yeah, last time my chat, last time my chat, LightWorks was only 64-bit, but it was pretty

495
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,100
usable.

496
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,760
It was. And I think all video editors on Linux at this point are really good at making clips

497
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,180
and adding transitions and throwing in some goofy effects here and there. They're pretty

498
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,080
good with that, but they don't really solve problems yet.

499
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
That's a problem.

500
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,480
Yeah, but LightWorks is a professional program. It's used for like movies, studios, and outside.

501
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,980
The problem we're facing here is we have all the post-production software in the world

502
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:27,920
on Linux that we could get, but we need software like Wirecast that we can use during a production

503
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,080
like Chris does during his shows.

504
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,720
Yeah. And that's becoming more and more common. You're seeing a lot of people do live production.

505
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,120
And it's just from an economic standpoint, it makes so much more sense if you can produce

506
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,360
things live in real time. And with chat rooms and mumble, you want to be live. You want

507
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
to be streaming.

508
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,600
Yeah. And you said about streaming, but you've got YouTube streaming. You've got G+. There's

509
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,040
quite a few other options you could use if you was on about the cloud streaming-wise.

510
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yeah.

511
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I mean, it's not just much about-

512
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
What about the lock-in there though? But yeah.

513
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
It's not about-

514
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
If you want to go really old school, you've got like Justin.tv.

515
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Right. Yeah.

516
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
And you stream.

517
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
And you stream, sure.

518
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,840
It's not as much about the service you're using. It's about the effects you can use

519
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,280
and the stuff you can overlay the video and how you can transition stuff and maybe streaming

520
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
from another box.

521
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Yeah.

522
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,880
Are you eliminating an intern that needs to go and do all this stuff for you because you

523
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,720
have a dynamic situation that you can do easily and quickly like Chris is able to do at this

524
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
point?

525
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Yeah.

526
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,880
Wirecast is really good at like green screening, taking multiple different camera sources,

527
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,920
combining them together, and then doing all of that on consumer purchasable hardware.

528
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
That's the big thing.

529
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,400
For me personally, I would use Lightworks with YouTube, with the YouTube streaming feature.

530
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:41,480
There's an alternative to Wirecast called VidBlaster, but it's much cheaper.

531
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Yeah.

532
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Well, it's cheaper for a reason though.

533
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Yeah.

534
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Yeah.

535
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
So VidBlaster was one.

536
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,200
In fact, I've even considered using VidBlaster for some things in studio, like for bringing

537
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,520
a bunch of Skype colors in and doing like a multi-box and then sending that to Wirecast

538
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,040
as a camera source, but VidBlaster is not really a full competitor to Wirecast.

539
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,360
And when I was playing with Lightworks specifically, I was actually one of the early beta testers.

540
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,160
It's good software and it absolutely, yes, it was absolutely used in a number of well

541
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,000
known recognized films for production, actually creating a film.

542
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,920
But it wasn't, to my knowledge, I don't know how it would be used effectively to work with

543
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,720
a live program.

544
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
Via YouTube, eh, maybe, kind of, not really.

545
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I don't know.

546
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,560
I mean, I'm not really sure how that provides the kind of functionality we're dealing with

547
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
now.

548
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
I don't see it.

549
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,240
You know, Lightworks just looks to me like your standard NLE where it's not even made

550
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
to do live production.

551
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Right.

552
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
It wasn't designed for it, no.

553
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,720
The most I've even seen regarding live production on Linux is, Matt, what was that software

554
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
that you've always promoted back when you were a student?

555
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,200
Oh, I was involved with it.

556
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Webcam Studio.

557
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Yeah.

558
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,840
Webcam Studio was, it was kind of like, it's kind of like a Babylon 5 where it was meant

559
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,000
to do one thing and ended up going a completely different direction.

560
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,520
Someone else took over the project and it's kind of just hopping along at a real snail

561
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
space.

562
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,280
The problem is just the back end technologies just weren't effective enough.

563
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,640
And no matter what language you wrapped it in, the problem was is that the underlying

564
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,800
tools just weren't quite there.

565
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,120
That being said, that could change over time, but it's just not quite there yet.

566
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,920
The problem I had with it is I would use it one time and it would have one user interface

567
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,600
and the next time you use it, the user interface did a 180.

568
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,280
That was Patrick and we certainly talked about that.

569
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,600
He felt like he wanted to continuously, in his eyes, improve it in a way he felt was

570
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
good.

571
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,260
I would have preferred it just stuck to something that was, I don't know, maybe voted on or

572
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,120
just something a little more tame, but he had a vision for it and I think he was just

573
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,500
trying to find what worked for him in his eyes and I can't speak to it specifically,

574
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,920
but I would agree that I really wish it would have stuck to one thing or another because

575
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,040
it was – I had to relearn it too and I was part of the project, so every time he'd

576
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,880
do a new one, I'd be like, oh, I have – the SVN would come out and be like, okay, wait,

577
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
what the hell is this?

578
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
How is this working?

579
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Where do I find it?

580
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Yeah, it's totally – I totally get where you're coming from there.

581
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Yeah, I think that was part of its failure is it kept changing every other week from

582
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
what I saw.

583
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
That was part of the failure, yeah.

584
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,360
The other part of the failure that I experienced from most people was that the technology wasn't

585
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,040
universal from like say Fedora to Debian, from Debian to Arch, from this to that to

586
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,280
the other thing.

587
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,040
They had a completely different experience and performance.

588
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,480
It was wrapped in Java, which of course added a whole other layer of challenges and there

589
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,200
are just a lot of – there are a lot of factors.

590
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah.

591
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Yeah, for sure.

592
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,080
Also, going back to LightWorks, you're forgetting too that LightWorks is not an easy program

593
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
to learn.

594
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
No, it's not though.

595
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,280
The interface is very old school and analog style, so it takes some getting used to, that's

596
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
for sure.

597
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Yeah, it is.

598
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Completely agree.

599
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
It is very different.

600
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,240
I'm going to stop here for a sec and sort of like rotate the conversation a bit to – this

601
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,780
really came down to probably for me one of my biggest ever like as a Linux user like

602
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,200
moments where I was like, what am I going to do?

603
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,680
This is coming down to like my core beliefs, but also the practical business sense in me

604
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,280
who says, well, I know as a businessman, I'll be cutting my arm off if I drop all video

605
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
support.

606
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,320
Well, come down to would you like to eat next month?

607
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
I mean, really?

608
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah.

609
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
I mean, that's really the meat and potatoes.

610
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,400
You know, so this was – so I want to talk a little bit about like some of the things

611
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,160
we struggle with there and maybe we'll get the Mumbles room take on some of the things

612
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,200
they've run into and maybe if in the end, we aren't all happy if we do stick with the

613
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
ideals.

614
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,080
But first, I want to talk about Ting because Ting is a perfect sponsor for the Linux unplugged

615
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
crowd.

616
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

617
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,480
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider, you can get started by going

618
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,320
over to linux.ting.com.

619
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,300
Now Ting does things really different than most carriers.

620
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,520
First of all, no contracts, no early termination fees.

621
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,320
I know you guys like that quite a bit.

622
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,600
The other part is you're in control.

623
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,320
You own it and you only pay for what you use.

624
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,840
They take your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

625
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,440
They add them all up at the end of the month and whatever bucket you fall into, well, my

626
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,920
friend, that's what you pay.

627
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,080
Yeah, actually, it is true.

628
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
It is true.

629
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,440
You don't have to know somebody in the biz to get a secret deal.

630
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,760
Ting's got your good deal.

631
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,400
You just pay for what you use at Ting and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

632
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,880
They got a lot of great devices, some really good devices and testing if you know what

633
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
I'm talking about.

634
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
This is fun.

635
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Oh, man.

636
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
iPhone.

637
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
iPhone.

638
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Oh, I had a little...

639
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
That too.

640
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Yep.

641
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,440
Boy, we both had a little tickles in our throat.

642
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh, my goodness.

643
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Weird.

644
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Yeah.

645
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Weird craziness.

646
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, and you can always stay up to date on what Ting's up to by going to blog.ting.com.

647
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,200
And I want to say, go over there because you're going to be pretty impressed.

648
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
Average Ting bill is $21 a month per line.

649
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,000
Now, did you know that Ting is a shared pool of minutes?

650
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
So if you have several phones on a line, you guys all just pay for what you use.

651
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
You just pay $6 for the line.

652
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,000
So in my case, if I have myself and my mom on a plan or myself and my wife on a plan,

653
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,040
each of us will just end up paying for whatever we use, but we can share from a pooled set

654
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
of minutes.

655
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
We can also...

656
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,640
And all these plans include hotspot, tethering, voicemail, picture messaging, caller ID, all

657
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,080
the stuff you'd want.

658
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
And they have a...

659
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,160
There's an excellent Ting app and an excellent Ting dashboard on their website to let you

660
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,960
stay on top of all the stuff, add devices, rename devices, remove devices, order new

661
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,120
devices online.

662
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,260
It's really great.

663
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,140
Their online control panel and the Android app together give you so much visibility on

664
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,840
what's going on with your Ting account.

665
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,280
And I'm a year in now, really, almost, 11 months, I think, into my Ting service.

666
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
Yeah, about 11 months, I think.

667
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,620
I keep coming back to one of my favorite things about Ting, now that I'm a long-term customer,

668
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,660
is that dashboard.

669
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,800
It's just so well done.

670
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
It really sets the bar.

671
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,080
And that's what I'd say about all things Ting.

672
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,420
They set the bar on everything.

673
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,800
They set the bar on customer service.

674
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,160
When you call them, a real person answers the phone.

675
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
They set the bar on how they sell to you.

676
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,740
They sell direct, they sell off contract, you own the device.

677
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,360
They set the bar on the way they bill, and they set the bar on their transparency.

678
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720
People love Ting, and I love Ting.

679
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,160
I think you guys will love it, too.

680
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,200
So go over to linux.ting.com.

681
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,740
That's going to take $25 off your first device.

682
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,900
If you've got a device that's compatible with the Sprint network, go check out the list

683
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,000
of Ting's compatible devices, because they're going to give you $25 on your first month

684
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
of service.

685
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,520
And if you're like most Ting switchers, that means your first month's going to be absolutely

686
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
free.

687
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,720
So keep that in mind once you discover what a cell service should really actually be like.

688
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
You'll never go back.

689
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,340
Even though there's no contracts and no early termination, you're not going to switch.

690
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,700
Because then you are going to be in a position of power.

691
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,340
And as a pro user, I think all of you guys know, it's like getting a Linux box without

692
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,580
root access.

693
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,580
It's just ridiculous.

694
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,800
It's like root access to your carrier.

695
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
That's really what it is.

696
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,160
It feels like you have root access to your carrier.

697
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,240
I call these folks.

698
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,040
I have a question or problem.

699
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,200
They are not going to put me on hold and get someone else or deal with whatever.

700
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
They're going to solve my issue because they're empowered to do so.

701
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
You're the boss.

702
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
You're the boss.

703
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Yes.

704
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,280
So a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

705
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,800
And thanks to you guys for supporting our sponsors, letting them know that you appreciate

706
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,240
them keeping the Ting show, the unplugged show on the air.

707
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,400
And go get started by going to linux.ting.com.

708
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,960
Oh yeah.

709
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Okay.

710
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,280
So I bring this open to the mumble room.

711
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
Anybody can chime in any time.

712
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,120
But I honestly, I probably have never struggled like this, like I had a few months ago.

713
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,040
When I tried to do it kind of, because I felt like it was a business thing, I didn't need

714
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,720
to make a big deal about it on there.

715
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,040
I didn't need to say much about it.

716
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,680
I just felt like, I think I bitched to Matt like before we went live, like, oh man, I've

717
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,440
been in a bad mood for about two days.

718
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh, I feel you.

719
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,280
And I totally, I totally understand.

720
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I really do.

721
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Yeah.

722
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
It's just like, it's a lot of money.

723
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
It goes against my ideals.

724
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,120
And that was really part of it was like, I don't, I don't like vote.

725
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,480
I'm a big, I'm a big proponent of voting with your wallet.

726
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,640
Like I really think out of all of the, out of all the things that go on in this world,

727
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,600
one of the few things we have control over is how we spend our money.

728
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,700
That's one of the reasons I recommend Ting.

729
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,000
That's why I recommend System76, because we can vote with our wallets and we can actually

730
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,720
make a difference by how we spend our money.

731
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,800
And I believe that by me spending $5,000 or whatever it was on a Mac Pro was not me voting

732
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
appropriately.

733
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,560
That was a bad vote in my opinion.

734
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,440
Not going with an open source system was a bad vote.

735
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,280
And in this case, if Wirecast had been open source, I could have looked at that and could

736
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
have determined, holy shit, this is not a 64 bit application.

737
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm not going to spend $400 on this.

738
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Oh, no kidding.

739
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,280
Mind you, I still would have bought it even though it was, you know, $400 by the way,

740
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,240
it was the discount cause it was an upgrade.

741
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,080
I originally spent a thousand dollars on it multiple times over.

742
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,640
So I've probably spent $2,000 on this wire, $3,000 on this Wirecast.

743
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,360
And not even, yeah, I was going to say not even counting all the support hardware and

744
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,880
other support factors that go tie into it.

745
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,040
I still would have paid for it if it was open, but I at least could have gone and figured

746
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,920
out on my own if it was 64 bit.

747
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,920
And it was a total black box until I bought it and I took it home and I unwrapped it.

748
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Boom.

749
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,880
There's a 32 bit stinker in the box for me.

750
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,320
Here's what I want to say is with Apple having this push towards everything 64 bit, why did

751
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,160
Wirecast stick with 32 bit?

752
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,360
I think that's just legacy, man.

753
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,760
I think it's because it's so much of what it would be such a fundamental amount of effort

754
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,680
to rewrite it to 64 bit.

755
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,200
They're probably, they said they're working on it, but it's probably a multi-year process

756
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
for them or something.

757
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,400
Well, and I think part of the two is they get something that works and then of course

758
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,120
they have to, they have to slowly migrate that out.

759
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,800
So 64 bit could be and have been in the works for a long time now and it's still just not

760
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
ready.

761
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
So.

762
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,520
If you have to go through the trouble of updating all the libraries and everything that goes

763
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
with it.

764
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Yeah.

765
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,840
It's kind of like if you pay $1,000 for an application that you need to step up and do

766
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
that.

767
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
It is 2014.

768
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,080
Well, and to their credit, you know, like one of their develop, I've actually now been

769
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,760
connected to a developer I believe based because I submitted some bug reports and you know,

770
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
so it's kind of funny.

771
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,080
Like in some sense it was a little bit like an open source relationship where I found

772
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,480
a bug, I submitted the bug, the guy who's now taking ownership of the bug is now contacting

773
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,200
me directly and I'm giving him details.

774
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,960
But that's only because I gave him a good bug and because I'm technically literate,

775
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,740
I can troubleshoot with him.

776
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,840
It's because of their convenience.

777
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
They're doing it.

778
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,480
I've also had experiences where I've been completely left out unanswered, right?

779
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:01,240
So I guess I feel like there's more control taken away and when it's a core business function,

780
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,520
that's where it needs to be under your control in the absolute every sense of the word, right?

781
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,880
You really need to be able to guarantee it.

782
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,360
And if it was open source, I feel like that is much easier for myself to guarantee.

783
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,920
Well, I think so because if it's not being done, you have the freedom to go and find

784
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,680
a shop or a person or a developer that will get it done for you.

785
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,880
You can say, look, they're not, you know, this person's not developing it with, what

786
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,200
can we do to basically work around it or to come up with an offshooter?

787
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,800
You know, you have some, you have some tools to work with.

788
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,640
You're not in some weird vendor lock-in situation.

789
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
All right, Mumble Room.

790
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
So what do you think?

791
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,400
Have maybe tried going audio only for a little while, stuck to my ideal guns and say, no,

792
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
this far, no farther?

793
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
No, no, no.

794
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Absolutely no.

795
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
Absolutely no.

796
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
No, no.

797
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,920
I don't think the fans of the Poe Show would have forgiven you.

798
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
That's true.

799
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Yes.

800
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Yes, you say?

801
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
No, I'm just kidding.

802
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
We're not biased at all in any way, shape or form.

803
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
Okay.

804
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,200
No, let's put it, let's look at this like a logical sort of way.

805
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
Okay.

806
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,280
You are, you're a YouTube sponsor.

807
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,560
So you put your videos out and you put them out onto YouTube.

808
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,680
Well, yes, you could put the audio out on YouTube, but the thing is people probably

809
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,240
wouldn't watch them, to be honest.

810
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,040
Oh, this show is mostly audio only.

811
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
Yeah.

812
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,000
But how popular is this show compared to the Linguist Action Show?

813
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,280
I mean, if you look at views on YouTube compared to this, to this show, the Linguist Action

814
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,920
Show is much more popular.

815
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,040
Well, for me personally, I start watching on YouTube and then I found the website and

816
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,160
watched all the back episodes, but if I hadn't saw it on YouTube, I wouldn't have known about

817
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
it.

818
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
That's really the big thing about YouTube.

819
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,920
YouTube is big about the discovery.

820
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,400
And so YouTube we find brings, people find us on YouTube.

821
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,200
They watch there for a little while and then they transition to the site usually because

822
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,280
they want it on demand.

823
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,280
They want it in their RSS feed or they just want to watch the HTML5 version on the website.

824
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Right.

825
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,520
For a nice callback, I actually found last because of the webcam studio review.

826
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Did you really?

827
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh my gosh.

828
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Nice.

829
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:10,240
I personally found about this on YouTube, but if it was not a video, I wouldn't watch

830
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,240
it.

831
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Right.

832
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Yeah.

833
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,040
I mean, there's a, there's a, and anything I've noticed over the years too, which this

834
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,460
is a little bit of a pro tip for anybody who wants to start a podcast, I suppose, is nobody

835
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,700
shares links to audio shows.

836
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
Nobody does.

837
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,560
But if you say something in a YouTube video, people will share a link to that, right?

838
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,080
And the other thing is you can like even link to the time code, which is really nice.

839
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,280
And so like just for people or, or like when, for example, when we did a review of Cinnamon

840
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
2, right?

841
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,120
Clem did a post on the, on the Cinnamon blog about it and he doesn't embed the MP3 file.

842
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,720
No, he embeds the YouTube video.

843
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
Right.

844
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Exactly.

845
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,240
So I'd say unless you're doing something like a distribution review, the only show I'm really

846
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,680
engaged in visually watching would probably be the Fo' Show.

847
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,680
You talking about my Weiss boobs?

848
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
Awkward.

849
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Technically, you just implied it.

850
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
No, it's the lower third.

851
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,840
Hey, Chris, I got a quick question for you.

852
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:09,160
If you had gone audio only, would that have affected the sponsorship at all?

853
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Maybe.

854
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Yeah.

855
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,200
That was, that was a part of the consideration because there'd be less numbers, right?

856
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Yeah.

857
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
YouTube isn't so important.

858
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
I mean, we love you guys on YouTube.

859
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,200
Don't get me wrong impression.

860
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,120
But I mean like if you came to me and said, sorry, you can no longer publish to YouTube,

861
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,080
I'd be like upset about it, but it would not affect the business.

862
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,440
But you know, if you cut off all videos, like all the downloads, all of the embeds on our

863
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,800
website views, that would impact the numbers.

864
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,560
And so, you know, at least it would affect the rate we probably charge, but it would,

865
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,600
I think, you know, part of it is, is there's just an extra level of cache to being in video,

866
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
I suppose.

867
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,360
And I think with the sponsorships, you know, you display the product of like System76,

868
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,800
you display the beautiful machines or you show the phones off for Ting or their website

869
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,400
or how you set up a plan.

870
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Yeah.

871
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Yeah.

872
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,200
What about doing audio for some parts, like during the interviews and stuff and then just

873
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,400
do editing the rest later?

874
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,760
Well, so if you're going to do video, might as well do video.

875
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,320
There's no point doing part of it or doing part of it video.

876
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Yeah.

877
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,600
Go big or go home.

878
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,000
I guess it's funny because here we are, a bunch of Linux users, obviously very passionate

879
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,960
about Linux, but there is a practical element to it, right?

880
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,360
I guess our inner RMS only goes so far.

881
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360
That's true.

882
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:27,440
I think it's the side of us that see, you know, the whole open source versus, you know,

883
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
free software argument.

884
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,320
It's kind of that point to where the open source folks are a little more in tune with

885
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,660
just wanting to use it because it works or it's providing no vendor lock and it's providing

886
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,480
various benefits where the other crowd might be more about, you know, to hell with convenience.

887
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
It's all about ideals.

888
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
I guess so.

889
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Yeah.

890
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
That's just my view.

891
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,200
Freedom is negative in the practical dimension.

892
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Wow.

893
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,200
That's pretty good actually.

894
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
I like that.

895
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,720
It's just negative in the freedom dimension.

896
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,200
All right.

897
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Okay.

898
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,360
So I continue to, it was an interesting technical battle because it also involves, every show

899
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,360
has a profile.

900
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah.

901
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,320
Like, you know, which camera shots, which lower thirds.

902
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,220
This show has a profile for the chat room shot or my screen or whatever, there's a few

903
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,120
other in there, prerecorded or reruns.

904
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,540
And every show has to have a new profile built for it for Wirecast 5.

905
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,840
And that is a ton of work.

906
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,680
So this week has been marred in like the technical problems, you know, hitting just bugs.

907
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,320
And it's funny because there's still bugs that were there from four and they're in five

908
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
now too.

909
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,320
You know, so it's like some of the same bugs that used to cause it to crash now new bugs

910
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
too.

911
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,340
But on top of that, then it's creating a new profile for every single show before it airs.

912
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,640
Like there was nothing for unplugged until about an hour before the show went on the

913
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,840
air where I recreated everything from scratch.

914
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Yeah.

915
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
And those are serious bugs, right?

916
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
I mean.

917
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,840
It's wild.

918
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
I mean, it has been a process, Matt.

919
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
It has been a process.

920
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,960
And so, you know, I go back to, I've been a big advocate of rolling software.

921
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,360
There's obviously when you come into production, there's, there's something to be said about

922
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
stop working.

923
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Yeah.

924
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,520
My wife, you know what, when I told my wife, when I told her, I was like, well, I considered

925
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,320
deploying with Wirecast 4, but then I'd probably would have had to do an upgrade.

926
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,960
I probably would have had to upgrade like a month or two down the road or even a few

927
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
weeks.

928
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
She just looks at me and goes, you could have gone with Wirecast 4?

929
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Noob.

930
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,760
Probably going to call the noob on my wife.

931
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Well, yeah, because she's looking at it through practical eyes being like, why did you make

932
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,400
this more complicated than it needed to be?

933
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,320
I think, you know, I think that's probably how she sees it.

934
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,840
I was like, well, if I got to go, I might as well go to the latest version.

935
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,400
It's been out for weeks.

936
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,080
Oh, and we trusted that, you know, you had a recommendation that it was going to work

937
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,520
and the fact that, you know, it had been out for a few weeks.

938
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,240
We would assume based on its price tag that it would function.

939
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
But alas.

940
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
Surprise.

941
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
I mean, I don't want to know.

942
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:47,440
So it's funny because even in its sort of current state, it is still more functional

943
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,520
than pretty much anything else.

944
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,480
And it's interesting because I've been using Wirecast really since we went video, right?

945
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,320
Back when I was recording the Linux action show here in this office with webcams and

946
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,440
weird angles and stuff.

947
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,320
And you know, it got very little recognition by the pro industry.

948
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
It's a toy.

949
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,160
But now a lot of stuff that is going on live is using Wirecast.

950
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,220
It's totally worked its way into pro level production.

951
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,920
So I think that's good for hopefully the quality of it, but it doesn't seem to have directly

952
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,400
impacted the quality just yet.

953
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,560
So is Wirecast the subscription service or did it pay you once?

954
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
No, they're pretty good.

955
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
They're pretty good.

956
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,060
You buy the major version and then like, you know, for I had a couple of year run at least.

957
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,240
And so I got every update.

958
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,960
You drop cash once and then you own it.

959
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,520
You don't have to pay a monthly thing.

960
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

961
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,880
And so and then I also got I got I got grandfathered in on the price instead of having to pay a

962
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
thousand dollars.

963
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,080
I paid like three ninety or something like that to get the upgrade.

964
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,680
Well, you know, and that includes everything, the virtual sets, the green screen capability,

965
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,680
all of it.

966
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,340
So it's it's pretty functional.

967
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,280
There's an anecdote I just found somebody was asking if there's ever going to be a Linux

968
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,920
version and then reply from the from the one of the community managers or moderators said

969
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
you could use a Mac.

970
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,680
Yeah.

971
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,680
Yeah.

972
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Wow.

973
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,680
That's the response.

974
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,000
You know, ironically, if they came up with a Linux version, even if I even if I would

975
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,240
prefer just even if I even if it was still closed source, I'd still prefer to have it

976
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,240
on Linux.

977
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,400
Well, and they would probably be especially as temperamental as it is.

978
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,240
They'd have to bake it in to one release and then every time it's updated, it would have

979
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,600
to be baked in to that release that is then cooperative with it.

980
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,000
It could not work in like, you know, the fact that they still have to work on a 64 bit Mac

981
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
version.

982
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Exactly.

983
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah.

984
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So we're so far off.

985
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It doesn't matter.

986
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Right.

987
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I mean, yeah, totally.

988
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

989
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You know, so there you go.

990
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
There you have it.

991
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,280
I also thought about, you know, going audio only would mean like it'd be way easier to

992
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,580
do shows on location.

993
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,240
Doing audio on location is is diametrically simpler than doing like it's just unbelievably

994
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,240
simpler than doing video.

995
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Yeah.

996
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,240
I mean, I wouldn't have to.

997
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
I wouldn't have to drive.

998
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
I do what I do now.

999
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
You know, pants would be optional.

1000
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Right.

1001
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,720
You know, if we want to get away with that anyway, your legs are underneath the table.

1002
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,120
You could be just in your boxes with like a nice shirt on.

1003
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
That's true.

1004
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
That's true.

1005
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,600
Well, you know, I mean, Chris has always been great about wearing pants, you know, most

1006
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,600
of the time.

1007
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Most of the time.

1008
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
You know, it's you know, unless it's like no pants Friday.

1009
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,080
I don't think I've ever done a show with shoes on.

1010
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,080
But at least I'm wearing.

1011
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, well, you got your comfy slippers.

1012
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Yeah.

1013
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Sometimes slippers.

1014
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah.

1015
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Just depends on how cold it gets out there.

1016
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yeah.

1017
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I might have missed this one.

1018
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,440
Has anybody, have y'all ever looked at open broadcaster software?

1019
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,440
Yeah.

1020
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,440
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,440
Yeah.

1022
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,400
Have you ever considered like for doing remote stuff like TriCaster?

1023
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Yeah.

1024
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,560
TriCaster is another way to go where it's sort of like a dedicated piece of hardware.

1025
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,680
But you know, to get into a TriCaster to do what we need, it's starting at ten thousand

1026
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
dollars.

1027
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
Yeah.

1028
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
I was going to say that.

1029
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,680
Yeah.

1030
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
And then it's a Windows 7 box that I have to have in my house.

1031
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Which.

1032
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,160
But last time we went to the, what was it, the convention that Perlo was putting on,

1033
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,040
we actually found, I think a TriCaster alternative we were looking at.

1034
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
That product.

1035
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,760
And again, it was like a Windows 7 type box.

1036
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,400
That product was built on Wirecast.

1037
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,800
So Wirecast works on Windows or the Mac.

1038
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,400
And I think one of the reasons why it's gotten shittier on the Mac is because they've been

1039
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,960
working on their Windows version.

1040
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
Right.

1041
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,680
But that is sort of like a combination of things.

1042
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,220
Like here's a hardware appliance, we've streamlined it down.

1043
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,220
Here's a switcher for it.

1044
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,760
Like there's a lot of little more pro level solutions being built up around it.

1045
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah.

1046
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,280
They just need like an Indiegogo or something for Jupiter Broadcasting to get one.

1047
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,960
I'm surprised, I'm surprised I'm asking this, but would Wirecast work on Wine by any chance?

1048
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,320
I don't, you know, I couldn't imagine with all the video piping it has, hooks to QuickTime

1049
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,440
and whatnot, I would imagine that would be a pretty.

1050
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,960
That would be probably harder than bringing Netflix to Wine.

1051
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,320
I mean, which was doable and did, but even then it was, the breakage was constant.

1052
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,240
Pipelike, we have actually got Netflix working in the Firefox browser.

1053
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,720
Just took them, it took so long, they almost have HTML5 now, but yes.

1054
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,200
Yeah, I think it was Pipeline.

1055
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,120
I also think in some instances, at least some people in Firefox actually had to use a user

1056
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,560
agent switcher just because of the old.

1057
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Yeah, you do have to switch.

1058
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Yeah.

1059
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
But it works.

1060
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Yeah.

1061
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
I just use a Roku, that runs Linux, I don't know.

1062
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,960
I mean, the video production stuff is about as complicated as it gets because it's constantly

1063
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,080
pushing the GPU, it's taking in multiple video signals from different sources, it's writing

1064
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,600
to disk, it's encoding video and streaming it over the network.

1065
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:29,040
I mean, it is, there's basically, there's no more demanding software out there.

1066
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,080
Right now, I've got a pretty high-end Mac Pro out there that's running at almost max

1067
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,560
capacity because it all just pushes it.

1068
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,000
And of course, it all got crappy when it went to HD.

1069
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,360
That's where things really got difficult.

1070
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
Oh, definitely.

1071
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,280
Well, and going back to the whole crowdsourcing campaign, a good example of what that would

1072
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,120
actually look like is, let's roll back to the OpenShot campaign and look at where they're

1073
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
at currently.

1074
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,120
Yeah.

1075
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,680
It was successful, but they're still trying to build this out in a way that's going to

1076
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,680
be practical.

1077
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,680
So even if we, you know, that's how big of a project it is.

1078
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,120
And like I said earlier, I think, you know, that's only a very small part of the overall

1079
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,120
plan.

1080
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah, exactly.

1081
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,560
But listen, I think we should probably wrap it up because who knows how much longer this

1082
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
thing's going to run.

1083
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,120
But I did have an email I want, I know, no, seriously, we go too long, this thing might

1084
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,720
just run out of memory.

1085
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,760
See what I say earlier was at 95% and right now it is at, no, it's still sitting at 95%

1086
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
good.

1087
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Oh, it was at 93 earlier, now it's at 95.

1088
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
All right.

1089
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,800
Well, we do have a final email I wanted to touch on before we run.

1090
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,240
So this one came in from Jonathan.

1091
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,920
He says, thanks for the great show and all the work.

1092
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,820
I was hoping you could announce the release of Sonar GNU slash Linux 13.10.

1093
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,160
Thanks to the Sonar campaign, we were able to get better sounding voices for the Orca

1094
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
screen reader.

1095
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
Wow.

1096
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,040
Yeah, this is a distro that is targeted to folks with disabilities.

1097
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,840
He says, we're working on some LibreOffice buffs, but not sure when Sonar will release

1098
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
those.

1099
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,520
Sonar has an assistive technology for blind users like the Orca screen reader, screen

1100
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,480
magnification for low vision users, a font included for people with dyslexia, an on-screen

1101
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,920
keyboard with customizing the mouse for people with low motor skills.

1102
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,320
He says, there's also software included for paraplegics to move the cursor of the mouse

1103
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,400
just by moving their heads or eyes.

1104
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,480
And you can find it at sonargnulinux.com, sonargnulinux.com, we'll have a link to that

1105
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,960
in the show notes.

1106
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,960
How awesome is that?

1107
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
That is so cool.

1108
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,200
He wanted to help spread the word because they just shipped version 13.10.

1109
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
That is awesome.

1110
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,760
I mean, because I've looked at other projects, I think it was the Adrian set up in the Canopix

1111
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,760
and things like that.

1112
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,760
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,700
You know, I've looked at other stuff like this, but I love the fact that they have better

1114
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,920
voices in Orca because that's a big one.

1115
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,600
And the fact that they're addressing dyslexia is mind boggling.

1116
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,880
I mean, I don't have dyslexia, but I have a laundry list of learning disabilities.

1117
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,840
And so for someone like me, that would be awesome, you know, that'd be great.

1118
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,280
Yeah, that is really cool.

1119
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,040
And so Jonathan sent that in and I might try to remember to give it a mention on last too

1120
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:49,240
just to help extra spread the word because I feel like there's so much opportunity there

1121
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:54,360
and we need to start working on it now because the Microsoft gravy train is drying up and

1122
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,800
people aren't going to be sure to Microsoft and we need to have people don't want to or

1123
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,560
people are not going to want to use a tablet interface on their desktops and the desktops

1124
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
aren't going away.

1125
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,560
And so people start switching to Linux.

1126
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,760
We need to have solutions available for people that have these disabilities.

1127
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,040
So sonar gnu slash Linux at sonar gnu linux dot com and we'll have a link to that in the

1128
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:15,200
show notes and you know, congratulations to them for for working on something that really,

1129
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,920
you know, probably doesn't get enough acknowledgment, probably doesn't get enough attention.

1130
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,600
Well, I love the fact that rather than doing what a lot of other similar projects have

1131
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,440
done to where basically they just keep redoing what's already out there.

1132
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,960
These guys are not only trying to make it better, but they're actually addressing specific

1133
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,000
needs such as better voices and other factors that weren't being addressed previously.

1134
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So I love that.

1135
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1136
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Good stuff.

1137
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
All right, Matt.

1138
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,160
Well, that brings us towards the end of this week's unplugged.

1139
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,720
Now, don't forget on Sunday we're doing our open Sousa 13 one review.

1140
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,440
I think that's going to be good.

1141
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,440
Looking forward to that.

1142
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,560
And that'll be two weeks of open Sousa love on the big show.

1143
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,120
And you guys can join us for that on a Sunday morning.

1144
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,080
Don't forget you can join us live for this show, too, for Linux Unplugged.

1145
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,680
On Tuesday afternoons, we start at two p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

1146
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,040
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar has it in your local neck of the woods time

1147
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,040
zone.

1148
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Don't know what that is.

1149
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,040
That's time math.

1150
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,040
We have time.

1151
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
Yeah.

1152
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,040
Even with time zone changes.

1153
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
We have time.
