WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Wow, an abominable winter ale West brings us.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.080
World class beer, sustainable, Portland, Oregon.

00:10.080 --> 00:18.080
17 degrees, 70 IBU, 17 degrees.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.080
What is that?

00:19.080 --> 00:20.240
17 degrees, Plato?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
What is that?

00:21.240 --> 00:23.440
I've never even heard of that.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.240
It's like a beer metric, because it's like, it says it's 70, it's got a 70 IBU, which

00:27.240 --> 00:32.280
is International Bitterness Unit, it's got an alcohol volume of 7.3%, those are all things

00:32.280 --> 00:36.120
I understand on the side of a beer, and then it's got, it's one pint, I understand what

00:36.120 --> 00:43.680
that is, but then it says 11 degrees, Plato.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.720
You guys ever heard of that on a beer before?

00:46.720 --> 00:52.080
Maybe I'm, am I, it's P-L-A-T-O, right, that's Plato, yeah, I mean.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.080
It's a beer, come on.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.080
What does that mean?

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
That means it's degrees proof?

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
What does that mean, Diddle?

00:58.080 --> 01:02.360
There's apparently a Wikipedia page about beer measurement, which mentions degrees

01:02.360 --> 01:03.360
Plato.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
Really?

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
I've never heard of that before.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.160
No, I've never heard of it either.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.480
Wait, they can increase philosophers in there?

01:09.480 --> 01:13.080
Did you see that this has a beer measurement metric on it, which I've never seen, this

01:13.080 --> 01:18.000
thing is 7 degrees, 17 degrees Plato.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.760
It's got a 70 IBU, and a 7.3% alcohol by volume, and a 17 degree Plato.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.320
Wow.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.400
How many Platos do I want?

01:27.400 --> 01:28.400
I don't know.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.320
I think this is the most Platos I've ever been aware of.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
Compared to zero?

01:34.320 --> 01:37.240
I know, I'm like thinking, is this like the philosopher?

01:37.240 --> 01:40.320
Like this is how many beers, this is how many of these Plato would have drank?

01:40.320 --> 01:42.720
Boy, he could knock them back.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
Yeah.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.240
Apparently, it's Fritz Plato.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.240
It's what?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.240
Exactly.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.600
German chemist Fritz Plato.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.760
Oh, I see.

01:50.760 --> 01:55.260
The Plato scale differs slightly from the Bolling scale, whatever that, or the Baling,

01:55.260 --> 01:56.400
what is this?

01:56.400 --> 02:00.200
Which is the, okay, the measurement of specific gravity used to determine the dissolved solid.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.200
Oh, wow.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
Oh, wow.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.780
Oh, so you're getting, you're getting like, you get to know how, how they measured it.

02:06.780 --> 02:10.500
So this is like a dish, this is like really, this is for people that are really into beer,

02:10.500 --> 02:11.500
is what that is.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.200
That's, you know what that is?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.980
That's a little nod to like, if you're drinking this beer, you're a beer connoisseur.

02:16.980 --> 02:19.640
So we're going to tell you about, you get to know everything.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
Even the Platos.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
Interesting.

02:21.640 --> 02:26.720
beerandbrewing.com, I mean, they would seem to be the ones to know.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.220
The Plato scale is used by most brewers worldwide, although brewers in the UK and those using

02:31.220 --> 02:35.820
British brewing traditions tend to prefer to use the specific gravity scale instead.

02:35.820 --> 02:40.160
This is derived by measuring the specific gravity of the wort, multiplying by 1000 and

02:40.160 --> 02:44.400
then subtracting 1000 from that figure to give the degrees of gravity.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.160
Thus a wort is specific gravity of 1.048 is said to have a 48 degrees of gravity.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.580
The Plato and gravity scales can be approximated by multiplying P by four to give the degrees

02:55.580 --> 02:56.580
of gravity.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.580
Well, there you go guys, duh.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.580
Didn't we know this?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.220
See, drink beer and you learn things.

03:01.220 --> 03:04.120
It's some science.

03:04.120 --> 03:20.600
This is Linux Unplugged episode 180 for January 17th, 2017.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.740
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that prepared for this week's episode

03:24.740 --> 03:27.760
by learning more about how to measure your beer.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.760
My name is Chris.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.760
My name is Wes.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
It's true fact.

03:30.760 --> 03:31.760
True fact.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.560
We actually did learn a little something about beer today.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.640
I love the pre-show.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.640
Wes, we have so many project updates.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.760
I actually started today thinking we wouldn't have much to talk about.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.160
I know, but people have been busy.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
Yeah, they have.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.840
We got some good ones to go through, so we'll start with that.

03:46.840 --> 03:51.320
Then we have a new distribution that says it's inspired by material design.

03:51.320 --> 03:56.480
It's going to create cohesive Linux desktop and apps.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.680
I know, it's a totally radical idea.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.120
I've never heard it before.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.360
So we're going to take a look at a new distro you likely haven't heard about today.

04:03.360 --> 04:09.200
Then there's some crazy kids releasing some crazy assistant on that crazy Raspberry Pi,

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
the Crasberry.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
Raspberry Pi.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
Crasberry.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
I got one.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Here it is, Wes.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
Look, I think I found it.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Right here, I got a Pi 3.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Pi 3, right in the box.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.240
If we had a screen for this sucker and a keyboard and a mouse, I'd say we should try it live

04:20.240 --> 04:24.840
on the show today, but we'll tell you about it and how you can try it out and maybe report

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
back.

04:25.840 --> 04:31.620
Then at the end, I'll be getting some feedback, so I'm going to address something that we've

04:31.620 --> 04:36.320
been covering on the show recently, and it's generated a lot of feedback in the audience.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.520
Chris has got to get real with you guys for just a minute.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
Just a minute.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
We're going to take it a moment.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
Heart to heart?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.520
Yeah.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
Just a little real talk at the end of the show.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.520
Our minds to your mind?

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
Mind-meld kind of thing.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.520
Yeah.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.320
So that's coming up on episode 180 of the Unplugged program.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.880
Lots of stuff to get into, and more stuff that I couldn't even remember right there

04:52.880 --> 04:53.880
during the intro.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.120
But one thing I can't forget is that Mumble Room.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.680
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
Greetings.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
Hello.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.680
Hello.

05:00.680 --> 05:07.560
It's good to see all of you, and I'm glad to have you all here to help us go through

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
the week's news.

05:08.560 --> 05:14.760
So let's start with this first story, which I kind of think is maybe one of the bigger

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
stories.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.200
It's definitely an interesting trend that's developing.

05:18.200 --> 05:26.120
It's now possible to use OpenSUSE inside Windows 10 using that Linux sublayer.

05:26.120 --> 05:31.360
Seuss's senior product manager was intrigued by the fact that Microsoft chose to enable

05:31.360 --> 05:32.920
the wrong Linux distribution.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.360
Ooh, strong words.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.640
By default.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.440
So within the Windows subsystem for Linux used by the company's latest Windows 10 builds,

05:39.440 --> 05:44.600
and he decided with his own agenda, he would go off and teach people how to use Seuss inside

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
of WSL.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.280
And he says, why Seuss?

05:48.280 --> 05:52.960
And this is some really sound, solid reasoning.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.160
Really gets me fired up to go try this.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.360
Why Seuss?

05:56.360 --> 06:03.400
Well, Seuss knows what they are doing because they have been in Linux business since 1992.

06:03.400 --> 06:08.440
Try to find a Linux vendor, or in that case, a distributor, which is older.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.740
You won't.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.000
There aren't any.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.120
That was the senior product manager's solid endorsement for using Seuss, is because Seuss

06:17.120 --> 06:18.120
is old.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.120
Fired up.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.320
You know, I think people sometimes ask Chris, say, hey, Chris, how do you say, is it Seussa,

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
is it Seuss?

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Is it open Seuss?

06:25.320 --> 06:29.520
Is it lowercase O, uppercase O, all uppercase, lowercase U?

06:29.520 --> 06:33.960
Part of the confusion might come from when your own team doesn't even use the right language.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.800
So the product manager at Seuss is calling open Seuss, Seuss.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.920
Which just confuses the general public.

06:41.920 --> 06:47.560
And then the news article is rightfully just quoting the words of the senior product manager,

06:47.560 --> 06:51.440
who's calling another product, open Seuss, the name of his own product.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.280
Which is like, yeah, okay, maybe it works for the people who, like, you're all using

06:54.280 --> 06:55.280
it and you're familiar.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.600
But for any outside observer, it's just, yeah, it's just confusing.

06:58.600 --> 07:04.480
Now, that aside, pretty interesting to see this developing pretty quickly.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.920
The Windows Linux subsystem, or whatever it's called.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
Windows Subsystem for Linux?

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Yes, I think that's it.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
WSL?

07:09.920 --> 07:10.920
WSL.

07:10.920 --> 07:11.920
Pretty cool.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.960
And the instructions do work probably, I believe, I have not confirmed any of this, but I believe

07:15.960 --> 07:20.920
they also work for Seuss Linux Enterprise, so you can also run Sles on there.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.240
I would want to try, I think I would definitely want to, if I was doing this, I would definitely

07:25.240 --> 07:29.680
want to try Sles, because that seems to make the most sense, because if I'm doing this

07:29.680 --> 07:33.520
on Windows, it's probably to match my server environment that I manage.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.520
That's kind of what I envision.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.720
Probably a dev or admin who needs to test stuff locally.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.100
Yeah, you've got Sles servers, and you want to have a common local environment, just so

07:42.100 --> 07:44.640
it's sort of the same, I think, the big draw for having Ubuntu.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.120
So have we seen Fedora or Centos on the sub, I don't know.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
No, I don't think so.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.120
I haven't seen it.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.880
We do see, there is a couple of different efforts to get Arch on the Windows subsystem

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
for Linux.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.400
Here's one I have linked in the show notes where you can get Arch on there, which would

07:59.400 --> 08:03.680
seem to look a little bit like what just needs to be done, you know, obviously it's not that

08:03.680 --> 08:08.200
much if they're all getting it working, I'm sure it's just some dealing with the boot,

08:08.200 --> 08:13.260
maybe getting the, not boot, but starting the user land, getting everything working.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.260
This makes a lot of sense.

08:14.260 --> 08:19.760
In this screenshot for Arch under the Windows subsystem for Linux, they're using your work,

08:19.760 --> 08:24.360
and now if you got access to a lot of the AUR command line applications on the Windows

08:24.360 --> 08:29.600
Linux subsystem, that would be very useful.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.400
I know they're just poking fun, but to say that Microsoft chose to enable the wrong default

08:33.400 --> 08:36.320
distro, I feel like that's sort of the opposite of the truth.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.560
It's obviously the right distro because of the massive cloud penetration, and that's

08:40.560 --> 08:45.320
really why Windows admins want it in the first place and not really why anyone was ever asking

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
for SUSE.

08:46.320 --> 08:52.400
It's also funny to kind of imply like, well, Canonical jumped at this or worked with them

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
to develop this.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
You guys did not.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.160
It's hard to make that wrong when they were the ones taking some of the initiative here.

08:58.160 --> 09:03.360
Right, that is true, although it does demonstrate that there's nothing specific about WSL to

09:03.360 --> 09:04.360
Ubuntu.

09:04.360 --> 09:08.360
That, I think, is the more promising thing.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.120
Is anybody in the Mumble Room trying this or using this?

09:11.120 --> 09:16.400
I thought about it for a hot moment over the weekend, I thought about trying it because

09:16.400 --> 09:21.440
I saw this story come up, and I thought to myself, I wouldn't mind dual booting into

09:21.440 --> 09:25.960
a system and trying Premiere again, and then using this for the tools I would undoubtedly

09:25.960 --> 09:30.160
need while I'm there, and I could see a use for that, but I just can't bring myself to

09:30.160 --> 09:31.160
use Windows.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.160
Then you have to install Windows.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
That's the most painful part.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
Yeah, yeah.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.720
The thing is, we're not the target audience for this, really.

09:36.720 --> 09:41.760
It's people who run Windows full-time who want to have an environment in which they

09:41.760 --> 09:47.040
can run Linux-y tools natively just in a window.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.960
Your audience are probably not likely to use it, and not likely to use it on a daily basis,

09:50.960 --> 09:55.320
but someone whose employment demands that they run Windows, but they want to be able

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
to have a shell.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.200
There's probably a fair amount of people listening.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.840
I see a huge thing for the enterprise where it's like, yeah, your developers are complaining.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.720
Maybe they want MacBooks, but if you can be like, no, here's our already-domained, everything's

10:05.720 --> 10:08.120
in Windows already for everyone else.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
Here's your Linux shell.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.120
Go crazy.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.960
That's a pretty big sell and a good compromise for a lot of people.

10:12.960 --> 10:19.080
Yeah, especially if you can offer them a piece of hardware that's attractive, like some of

10:19.080 --> 10:21.840
those XPS 13s and 15s.

10:21.840 --> 10:30.040
If you run Windows 10 on that, and then you put SUSE or ARCH or Ubuntu on the subsystem,

10:30.040 --> 10:34.400
that does seem like just the right mix of enterprise compromise for people that need

10:34.400 --> 10:39.200
to use the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem like Active Directory.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.520
It's interesting to see this developing.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.560
I just wanted to give them a shout-out.

10:42.560 --> 10:48.720
More so than that, guys, if you want to try SUSE out or open SUSE on your Windows 10 box,

10:48.720 --> 10:52.360
there is instructions in this article on how to get it set up, and then the one we've linked

10:52.360 --> 10:58.200
for ARCH, it's a script that does it for you, I believe, and it gives you a minimal ARCH

10:58.200 --> 11:01.960
Linux distro that you can then go out crazy on.

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
Can we run the show in it?

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
Do a whole episode?

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
Yes.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
Run from subsystem for Linux?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.840
I don't really feel all that fired up.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.640
I don't really feel too fired up about that, Wes.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.480
You know what I am fired up about, though?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.920
N1 going free.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.720
Now they're calling it Nileus Mail instead of Nileus N1, and they're introducing Nileus

11:18.720 --> 11:19.720
Basic.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.720
Basic.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.620
I really am excited.

11:22.620 --> 11:25.880
This is my mail client of choice.

11:25.880 --> 11:31.040
I've been trying to very cautiously recommend it because it costs money for the Pro version,

11:31.040 --> 11:35.820
and if you don't want to do any work, you have to run off their intermediary host, but

11:35.820 --> 11:36.820
this is really nice.

11:36.820 --> 11:40.040
So N1 has been renamed to Nileus Mail, and they're launching a free version of Nileus

11:40.040 --> 11:44.100
Mail called Nileus Basic, and by free, they mean also open source.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.100
That's great.

11:45.100 --> 11:48.280
Yeah, I got the GitHub link linked in the show notes.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.040
They're still working on it, so there's not much to see there yet.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.460
So does this mean that they're comfortable enough with their monetization as a company

11:53.460 --> 11:57.360
with their being Pro only for a while, that they're ready to... Because that was one

11:57.360 --> 12:00.440
of the things I was a little disappointed at when they did go Pro only.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.700
They still had the open source, but it felt like there was a lot of hoops to jump through.

12:03.700 --> 12:08.000
They weren't really welcoming that tier, so now that there is a basic tier, does that

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
mean they're feeling more established?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.640
I think it's the opposite.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
I think it's the opposite.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.640
They need more people.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.560
They're hoping to sucker people in here.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.580
Well, I don't know about sucker, but I think it didn't work out.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.960
I think, first of all, it's funny.

12:19.960 --> 12:26.760
Having been a Pro user, it was not easy to give them my money, and it was clunky, so

12:26.760 --> 12:30.160
I would not be surprised if they saw not a big success with that.

12:30.160 --> 12:34.160
Plus, who wants to toss a bunch of money at a no-name company, at least a company you

12:34.160 --> 12:37.760
don't know, building an upstart mail client that's Electron?

12:37.760 --> 12:40.560
There's not a lot of people that are going to get in on that when you've got good old

12:40.560 --> 12:42.040
Thunderbird sitting there.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.920
So I think that was an uphill battle for them, and I'm betting this is more of a... Well,

12:47.920 --> 12:51.000
this is a plan B. This is a bit of a pivot.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Interesting.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.160
Yeah, actually, it's funny you asked that.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.240
Daniel from Elementary OS jumped into a conversation thread that we were having in the Linux Action

12:59.240 --> 13:04.400
Show subreddit, where an Elias employee stopped by and said, there's no Linux builds yet,

13:04.400 --> 13:06.320
but we're going to get them out soon.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.560
And Daniel, before I jumped in, says, well, my big question is, what's your funding model?

13:09.560 --> 13:10.560
How has it changed?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.560
How are you going to remain profitable?

13:11.560 --> 13:12.560
Oh, right.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.040
He says, to me, hearing that this service is now free is scary.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
Who's the real customer?

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
Am I now the product?

13:18.040 --> 13:21.400
I think Daniel's asking some good questions.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.720
So I'm excited that it's going open source, but I don't understand how they're going to

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
fund and continue development.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.320
And I know a lot of you are probably like, I don't care.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
I don't care.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.120
Well, that's because you are so wrong about life right now.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.680
It's a really good mail client, and you don't …

13:33.680 --> 13:38.720
And it's nice to see innovation in this sector, like with Thunderbird being installed and

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Geary.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
Stop it.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.560
It's disappointing that we can't be like, yeah, OK, we don't have Outlook.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.560
But you don't want Outlook.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
You want this better Linux product.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.000
And so if there's a good open source client that we can tell people to use, that'd be

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
awesome.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.340
Here's a fundamental problem I have with email.

13:52.340 --> 14:01.080
And this is something that Nyleas, I guess it is, Nyleas Mail, has made better for me.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.960
Email is a son of a bitch because it allows anybody to all of a sudden create an expectation

14:05.960 --> 14:10.240
of you without you even knowing that an expectation has been created and now being held against

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
you.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.860
And so anybody can drop any turd in your inbox asking something of you, requesting something

14:15.860 --> 14:21.080
of you, telling you about something, hey, FYI, heads up, any of these things, they all

14:21.080 --> 14:23.680
create a different set of social expectations.

14:23.680 --> 14:30.400
And we all have different internal calibrations of how we treat email.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.380
For me, some weeks, I check my email once a week, maybe twice.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.000
Some weeks, I check it daily.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
It really ranges.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.800
But people that email me, I often get emails from people that I work with that expect me

14:40.800 --> 14:43.160
to be responding, not at JB, but outside of JB.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.320
People in JB know.

14:44.320 --> 14:49.060
But outside of JB, people will often send me an email expecting me to respond within

14:49.060 --> 14:53.720
the first maybe half hour I receive the email, let alone the day, right?

14:53.720 --> 14:57.240
And it will be sometimes days before I get back to them, I just have to say, I'm sorry,

14:57.240 --> 14:58.380
I've been busy.

14:58.380 --> 15:04.300
And the thing that now mail does for me is it allows me to take a couple of extra steps

15:04.300 --> 15:08.040
to manage that situation where I can take an email, get it out of my inbox, but then

15:08.040 --> 15:12.840
have it come back later and say, you asked to be reminded about this tomorrow at 8 a.m.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
Guess what?

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
It's time.

15:14.840 --> 15:15.840
Here's that email again.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.560
It's a simple function along with its really sophisticated read-receipt system that's better

15:19.560 --> 15:21.400
than anything else out there before.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.440
It has a great set of signatures and good support for GPG.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.680
And now it's open source.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.320
It is a very good mail client.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.840
It works on every OS you want to use it on because it's Electron.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.520
And if you're an Electron app hater, you're like, I don't want, I don't like the overhead

15:36.520 --> 15:39.120
of an Electron app, that's so stupid.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
I understand.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
That was me.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.320
I was totally that guy.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.620
And then I got a few Electron apps that are actually pretty good because that's the thing.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.640
There's bad Electron apps and there's good ones.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.920
And this is one of the good ones.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.440
So I think it's encouraging for Electron as an app platform.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.040
It's encouraging for people that are looking for some innovation to make email not such

15:56.040 --> 15:58.200
a life suck that it is.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.240
It's great.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.360
And I just, I don't feel like it gets enough attention.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.960
I'm hoping now that they've gone this route, they've gone free, they've gone open source.

16:05.960 --> 16:06.960
Maybe more people start talking about it.

16:06.960 --> 16:07.960
Hopefully they can be sustainable.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.960
Yeah.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.880
I will say it seems like Electron fits well with your lifestyle where you're maybe distro

16:11.880 --> 16:13.360
hopping or on random computers.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.000
You don't have to worry about being in the package manager.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.480
You know it can run.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.480
Yeah.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.480
It is.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.460
And also it's not like these are 3D games or video editors.

16:23.460 --> 16:28.720
They're not something where I have to have the just unbelievable desktop performance.

16:28.720 --> 16:33.320
And then let's get off our high horse here for a second and stop pretending like Qt and

16:33.320 --> 16:39.040
GTK are these hyper optimized lightweight toolkits that make application rendering lightning

16:39.040 --> 16:40.580
fast that no other.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.960
We all know that's a load of crap.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.520
But the Linux desktop is not the fastest snappiest desktop and part of it is the toolkit.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.960
I mean one thing I hate about using Windows is that GDI system is so crappy and old and

16:51.960 --> 16:55.640
the Windows toolkit, I forget what it's called, is such an ancient piece of crap and then

16:55.640 --> 17:02.080
they managed to throw it all into a GPU buffer now post Vista or 7 even.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.480
It actually like Windows fly open on Windows.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.360
Like that's the one thing Windows is good at is actually opening Windows.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.760
It's funny but that is actually what it's good at is opening and displaying Windows

17:10.760 --> 17:12.160
very fast.

17:12.160 --> 17:17.960
This you often with a super high end machine will still sometimes see parts your UI render.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.960
So yeah we can be on our high horse about electron apps.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.040
I hear that shit every time I talk about electron app.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.520
I get emails and tweets.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.140
The chat room goes on about it.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.560
People watch the show afterwards and then come back in the chat room and trash.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.120
Can't believe Chris is once again promoting electron apps.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.080
People get all their high horse about electron apps.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.580
Meanwhile Qt and GTK are not like they're the second coming to UI speed.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.120
So just give it a shot.

17:39.120 --> 17:43.320
If you have problems with email and for you you struggle with email like I do it's worth

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
looking at.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.600
And they do have some pretty good stuff.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.780
I've always enjoyed their blog posts.

17:46.780 --> 17:50.720
They do some they have some interesting discussions about how they a lot of their stuff's in Python

17:50.720 --> 17:52.080
and how they package it and that kind of stuff.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.840
So it seems like they're kind of contributing their good upstream people.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.760
I want to I want to give a little attention to something that I see happening more and

17:59.760 --> 18:05.060
I want to I want to also get some participation from the audience to help us with something.

18:05.060 --> 18:11.320
So there is a trend that's beginning to take off and clever projects like the guy that

18:11.320 --> 18:17.760
runs the Ubuntu Mate project have have been reaching out with their community using Patreon

18:17.760 --> 18:21.880
and other funding moments been doing it for a long time to using their own custom system.

18:21.880 --> 18:26.540
A lot of different developers and projects are starting ways to get funded and Patreons

18:26.540 --> 18:31.300
becoming a pretty common one and I wouldn't be surprised eventually people start feeling

18:31.300 --> 18:36.980
Patreon fatigue but what I would what I would like to what I would like to try to do is

18:36.980 --> 18:43.260
use the audience reach of our shows to help promote some of these funding methods at least

18:43.260 --> 18:44.260
for a little bit.

18:44.260 --> 18:48.740
Maybe we spend one episode on it because I have a feeling that that's probably something

18:48.740 --> 18:53.120
the audience feels would be a good use of our airtime would be giving recognition to

18:53.120 --> 18:58.220
like this one I have up on the screen right now is a GIMP developer who is rewriting the

18:58.220 --> 19:04.540
GIMP backend image processing core and if he's successful GIMP will then have high bit

19:04.540 --> 19:10.860
depth support full CMYK support full layer effects and all of it's impossible without

19:10.860 --> 19:14.260
this rewrite and now he's launching a Patreon I think he's got like a hundred and something

19:14.260 --> 19:21.200
patrons this could really change the game and we've seen this actually work now we've

19:21.200 --> 19:27.360
seen some different projects some better than others really pull this off and I think the

19:27.360 --> 19:30.440
audience would feel like it's a good use of our time to give them attention and airtime

19:30.440 --> 19:34.440
but I need their help finding a lot of them I have I know I know about some of the Saudi

19:34.440 --> 19:39.040
developer I can think of three or four or five off the top of my head I but I know there's

19:39.040 --> 19:44.540
got to be more and so wherever you're watching this I'm asking I'm asking at last and I'm

19:44.540 --> 19:49.540
asking in this episode please let me know in the comments or in a tweet or submit them

19:49.540 --> 19:55.380
to the subreddit mm-hmm and so I would just thought maybe they haven't actually watched

19:55.380 --> 20:00.420
this video yet but this is this is some work that's going into GIMP that will eventually

20:00.420 --> 20:04.260
yield and some big big improvements lots of stuff that we've wanted to see in GIMP for

20:04.260 --> 20:09.580
a very long time which could be landing in GIMP to some of it could be landing in GIMP

20:09.580 --> 20:19.180
2.10 I haven't seen this video yet oh yeah okay I have seen this that's right it's just

20:19.180 --> 20:26.220
it's just a video of a giant goat or whatever that is that's what the it's just a I don't

20:26.220 --> 20:33.740
know I guess it's kind of cool to show off what you could do with GIMP I forgot I for

20:33.740 --> 20:37.040
some reason I blocked that out of my memory anyways it's really cool work that's happening

20:37.040 --> 20:40.920
and I guess I'm just I'm kind of saying hey if you think that we should spend some of

20:40.920 --> 20:45.000
our time giving attention to this stuff well then I need your support making it actually

20:45.000 --> 20:51.500
happen exactly Wimpy do you have any thoughts on this topic I currently back a couple of

20:51.500 --> 20:58.060
projects through their patrons that I'm interested in and I'm sure there are others so yeah I'd

20:58.060 --> 21:04.780
be interested to hear what else is out there so that if there's things that I'm already

21:04.780 --> 21:10.980
using or something that I think is nifty then I've got a way to support the project yeah

21:10.980 --> 21:17.320
obviously because patreon has been hugely successful for Ubuntu mate and I would like

21:17.320 --> 21:26.140
to see other developers have similar success yeah I agree and I think one of the nice things

21:26.140 --> 21:31.480
about patreon is once you're signed up it's it's not too much more barrier to then go

21:31.480 --> 21:35.160
support somebody else and you can set limits so you don't overdo it and stuff like that

21:35.160 --> 21:40.300
so it's a it's a system that makes it possible to support multiple content creators without

21:40.300 --> 21:43.900
having to go create an account everywhere they decide to go right and we do need the

21:43.900 --> 21:48.740
scaffolding as in you know in the free open source software community yeah I want to be

21:48.740 --> 21:52.700
able to give back but there's just you need a minimal set of hoops yeah we'll have to

21:52.700 --> 21:56.260
jump through yeah all right so let's brainstorm more we can do more brainstorming too in the

21:56.260 --> 22:00.880
post show if you guys want I want to keep going though because there's a topic that

22:00.880 --> 22:05.820
we have kicked around a lot and haven't gotten updates on a little bit and so now we'll have

22:05.820 --> 22:13.880
one plus the FSF has a new top 10 list that they want you to focus on so first let's take

22:13.880 --> 22:18.380
a moment and thank ting for sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com go there

22:18.380 --> 22:22.300
to save money off your first device or off your service plan depending depending on if

22:22.300 --> 22:26.980
you buy a new phone or bring your own phone and one of the really cool things about ting

22:26.980 --> 22:32.320
that you're gonna love is no contract nor the termination fee and just pay for what

22:32.320 --> 22:38.020
you use just your minutes your messages and your megabytes and six dollars for the line

22:38.020 --> 22:42.780
I love it such a simple system because it means if I want to turn something on I just

22:42.780 --> 22:47.100
pay six bucks that month and then when I get rid of it it's gone that's really nice for

22:47.100 --> 22:51.120
my five for backup my files when I'm traveling it's also been really nice when I've had a

22:51.120 --> 22:54.120
problem and I'm traveling and I was able to use their customer service you get to speak

22:54.120 --> 22:57.740
to a real human being but I've always pretty much gotten done in the dashboard and they

22:57.740 --> 23:03.620
have CDMA and GSM networks for you to use I think the perfect combo nexus device or

23:03.620 --> 23:07.120
maybe a pixel device now I guess I should stop saying you gotta it's dead Chris get

23:07.120 --> 23:15.740
over it I would do this I would get a device from the play store or get an unlocked device

23:15.740 --> 23:18.800
somewhere and bring it to ting because ting's not gonna lock it up they're not gonna stay

23:18.800 --> 23:23.500
in the way of updates personally if you could afford it I would recommend either an iPhone

23:23.500 --> 23:27.640
or a pixel I think that's really the way to go these days if you can go there ting though

23:27.640 --> 23:32.320
they've got all kinds of great options because I know those are expensive unless you get

23:32.320 --> 23:36.080
like a nexus 5x or something I mean you can start at nine dollars for just a SIM card

23:36.080 --> 23:41.280
if you have a device you can get a feature phone for like 20 bucks and then they are

23:41.280 --> 23:46.240
they actually this one by the way the Kyocera Dura they have this one back in stock now

23:46.240 --> 23:50.680
this is like the indestructible phone if you want like a phone that has like a week-long

23:50.680 --> 23:57.300
battery you can hear the ringtone from anywhere in the house and it'll almost survive a war

23:57.300 --> 24:03.160
like Indiana Jones in a fridge check that thing out lots of other phones oh wow the

24:03.160 --> 24:13.680
iPhone 4 is only 87 bucks now from ting wow wow yeah iPhone 591 bucks iPhone 5c and then

24:13.680 --> 24:18.280
they have of course all the other devices like the one plus the motos I think you should

24:18.280 --> 24:21.080
go over there and just see what you might want to get if you don't have a device already

24:21.080 --> 24:25.880
or you want to start fresh you can see the whole lineup over at ting including that pixel

24:25.880 --> 24:32.320
phone or you could just bring one and enjoy the ting savings by going to linux.ting.com

24:32.320 --> 24:40.920
linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program now we

24:40.920 --> 24:46.040
go into the future and look back at last year yes that's right to go into the future we

24:46.040 --> 24:50.360
must look back the future being Mir and Wayland of course and to look back to see how Mir

24:50.360 --> 24:58.280
is doing this was just posted on the insights.abuntu.com blog I guess and they will go over some of

24:58.280 --> 25:02.640
the things in 2016 they say it was a good year for Mir it's being used in more places

25:02.640 --> 25:07.880
as better upstream support and it's easier to use by downstream projects 2017 will be

25:07.880 --> 25:12.540
even better when we see version 1.0 will somebody in the mumble room to find what upstream is

25:12.540 --> 25:15.920
for Mir for me I'm not trying to be clever either I really don't understand what upstream

25:15.920 --> 25:24.280
is for Mir wouldn't upstream just be Mir's project itself nobody knows I don't I wasn't

25:24.280 --> 25:32.360
paying attention so what is what in the context of Mir when they say it has more and this

25:32.360 --> 25:39.180
was Alan Griffiths on the insight blog he says it's being used in more places it has

25:39.180 --> 25:44.960
more and better upstream support and it's easier to use by downstream projects so what

25:44.960 --> 25:47.320
does upstream support mean?

25:47.320 --> 25:53.120
Maybe he's talking about back end support for things like Qt and different toolkits

25:53.120 --> 25:58.800
and what have you and then here's a there was a piece here enabling Mir on Ubuntu non

25:58.800 --> 26:04.080
or enabling I thought this is a good one enabling Mir on non Ubuntu Mesa or Mesa distributions

26:04.080 --> 26:09.560
Ubuntu currently carries a distro patch for Mesa to support Mir work is planned for this

26:09.560 --> 26:14.580
year to update it and and then upstream this patch we've not done so yet as we know there

26:14.580 --> 26:19.040
are changes needed to support current developments such as Vulkan which brings us to the next

26:19.040 --> 26:23.880
thing which I thought was interesting they're working on improving the graphics API to support

26:23.880 --> 26:28.400
things such as Vulkan which requires development of the Mir plugin module and now that they've

26:28.400 --> 26:32.360
actually done the work on getting the Vulkan support in as one of the first major plugins

26:32.360 --> 26:36.240
they've also discovered a bunch of stuff needs to be done to the plugin architecture looking

26:36.240 --> 26:41.000
forward to 2017 they'll see a cleanup of the toolkit API and better support for platform

26:41.000 --> 26:45.800
plugin modules after learning so much from Vulkan I would imagine and they'll be working

26:45.800 --> 26:52.280
to upstream their Mesa patch soon they also have a snapshot of all the progress include

26:52.280 --> 26:56.280
they've been reducing latency and big wins and performance which are available right

26:56.280 --> 27:01.160
now and we're going to complete changes and believe they will see the Mir 1.0 release

27:01.160 --> 27:08.640
in 2017 wow yeah something to look forward to that's been a long time coming that's a

27:08.640 --> 27:13.360
Mir in 2017 predictions book out here Chris I didn't make that prediction I just kind

27:13.360 --> 27:16.840
of was like you know what I just I couldn't do another year of predicting Wayland and

27:16.840 --> 27:21.400
Mir I even though it feels like this would be the year of all years doesn't that say

27:21.400 --> 27:26.480
something I just done West despite that you're just no I couldn't do it nope Wes I couldn't

27:26.480 --> 27:31.840
do it I just I had to put it to bed and because I had to come to a personal acceptance West

27:31.840 --> 27:37.080
I had to come to a peace with the fact excellent forever this stuff is hard West and it takes

27:37.080 --> 27:42.120
a long time and you know what else I realized is even once this shenanigan ships I'm probably

27:42.120 --> 27:46.200
going to be one of those old codgers on X for a long time because I'm going to need

27:46.200 --> 27:51.540
my x11 Forden or I'm going to want V and I'm going to want something West that these new

27:51.540 --> 27:59.400
fangled Vulkan powered Wayland and Mirs from every which browser and desktop environment

27:59.400 --> 28:03.960
maybe I want my clipboard to share contents between all my applications maybe I want my

28:03.960 --> 28:08.520
clipboard to be able to monitor my screen even when I have like my apps stealing all

28:08.520 --> 28:14.760
of my credentials that's why they're there so yeah I figure I figured this wouldn't be

28:14.760 --> 28:18.760
the year to really get excited about Wayland or Mir because it probably won't be the year

28:18.760 --> 28:22.320
for Chris anyways because all of the reasons that we just stated but you can read more

28:22.320 --> 28:29.740
about the post on the quote unquote blog blog where they also have a screenshot of the obligatory

28:29.740 --> 28:34.160
screenshot of GIMP running on Mir which feels like you got to do two things you got to have

28:34.160 --> 28:39.260
a terminal and you got to have GIMP running to show that your new display system works

28:39.260 --> 28:44.160
with legacy applications what should we show I know GIMP's a UI monster let's show that

28:44.160 --> 28:48.760
that's what everybody does it's a monster let's put that up on the screen but it works

28:48.760 --> 28:55.120
mm-hmm yeah I'm gonna stick with X for life you're gonna pull it from my cold dead insecure

28:55.120 --> 29:02.200
hands all hacked so the Free Software Foundation I don't even need to tell you guys this because

29:02.200 --> 29:06.960
I'm sure you all probably check this daily so for those of you that maybe didn't know

29:06.960 --> 29:11.080
about this that don't have this as your homepage it turns out that the Free Software Foundation

29:11.080 --> 29:14.760
has a high priority software projects list now I know you guys all knew that you're checking

29:14.760 --> 29:18.560
it constantly that's how you make your morning prioritization decisions what should I work

29:18.560 --> 29:22.720
on today I better go check Richard's list I know I understand but for those of you that

29:22.720 --> 29:29.240
weren't aware the Free Software Foundation has been working on this since 2005 and they

29:29.240 --> 29:36.760
got a lot of feedback in 2016 from about 150 free software community members the high priorities

29:36.760 --> 29:45.040
projects committee let's just let that soak in for a second is that where my money goes

29:45.040 --> 29:49.760
if I donate to the Free Software Foundation is a bunch of committees the high priority

29:49.760 --> 29:55.260
projects committee what is this a government institution the high priority projects panel

29:55.260 --> 30:03.760
recommended extensive updates to the yeah to the high priority project list the high

30:03.760 --> 30:08.120
priority projects initiative draws attention to a relatively small number of projects of

30:08.120 --> 30:13.480
great strategic importance to the goal of freedom for all computer users this list serves

30:13.480 --> 30:17.880
to foster work on projects that are important for increasing the adoption and use of free

30:17.880 --> 30:22.840
software applications and free software operating systems and here's where my here's where my

30:22.840 --> 30:28.960
issue begins because that is a very fine statement to make if you just did one thing where they

30:28.960 --> 30:34.160
have a period where they say the list serves to foster work on projects that are important

30:34.160 --> 30:38.760
for increasing the adoption and use of free software applications and free software operating

30:38.760 --> 30:50.160
systems instead of a period it should be comma in our opinion man they speak as if they are

30:50.160 --> 30:55.040
the ultimate they're the absolute they're the Free Software Foundation ergo they have

30:55.040 --> 30:59.400
the ultimate authority to declare what is and what is not important what must be our

30:59.400 --> 31:05.560
attention must be directed to and what must be ignored and it's not it's not it's just

31:05.560 --> 31:10.700
some it's something about the way this is framed to me I find it to be slightly sort

31:10.700 --> 31:15.840
of it's almost like that in their mind it's a foregone conclusion you know there's no

31:15.840 --> 31:20.040
element of convincing or storytelling it's kind of just like these are the facts these

31:20.040 --> 31:26.000
are the things we've decided this we are the bastion of your freedom please read yeah yeah

31:26.000 --> 31:29.240
I guess it does kind of so here you ready for it you ready for it this is the list here

31:29.240 --> 31:34.360
are the high priority free software areas a free phone operating system smartphones

31:34.360 --> 31:39.260
are the most widely used form of personal computing today that's the need for a fully

31:39.260 --> 31:47.200
free phone operating system is crucial to the proliferation of software freedom yep

31:47.200 --> 31:52.960
okay accurate decentralized Federation and personal services a software substitute clouds

31:52.960 --> 31:58.800
a little phrase they've got here yeah I like that service as a software substitute yeah

31:58.800 --> 32:03.000
that is good the large and fragmented space deals with increased centralization of web

32:03.000 --> 32:08.880
activities and user reliance on servers they don't control or service as a software substitute

32:08.880 --> 32:12.880
clouds the free software community provided extensive feedback regarding many projects

32:12.880 --> 32:17.520
that follow this initiative also they say this is on their list free drivers firmware

32:17.520 --> 32:20.540
and hardware designs man it's a good thing they got a committee to come up with this

32:20.540 --> 32:24.040
list because otherwise they might have missed some of this maybe our community should come

32:24.040 --> 32:31.360
up with a list and we can compare and contrast real-time voice and video chat so this their

32:31.360 --> 32:40.720
list okay I guess I guess I feel like there is this does nothing there is probably nobody

32:40.720 --> 32:44.400
who's sitting back oh man you know what I got 40 hours free this week and I just don't

32:44.400 --> 32:47.900
know what to do I'm gonna go check Rick's list and see what he thinks I should be working

32:47.900 --> 32:54.120
on I mean the idea is preposterous so instead of their set of my money to the free software

32:54.120 --> 32:57.840
foundation going to actually funding some of these projects or paying a developer for

32:57.840 --> 33:02.400
a week to do this work it goes to creating committees and updating lists from 2005 of

33:02.400 --> 33:07.340
no no shit statements of course we need a free phone operating system no shit Sherlock

33:07.340 --> 33:11.720
of course we need to use WebRTC better no crap yeah we need free drivers people been

33:11.720 --> 33:19.280
working on that for years now none of this is useful what are they doing and it really

33:19.280 --> 33:23.320
feels like it kind of lacks the community aspect that makes a lot of these things important

33:23.320 --> 33:26.480
right like it's not it's not an ongoing discussion it's just kind of like put out

33:26.480 --> 33:30.800
there as a list right so it's not let's work out together what we should work on as a community

33:30.800 --> 33:34.580
bettering things you know it would be great you know it would be amazing if this was a

33:34.580 --> 33:39.460
list of how they were organizing action around these items the free software foundation has

33:39.460 --> 33:44.640
identified these as critical areas to the freedom and so we are organizing groups of

33:44.640 --> 33:48.880
people around these particular items we don't need to sit around and wait for Google Summer

33:48.880 --> 33:55.240
of Code here's their patreon pages go fund them they'll be working on these items here's

33:55.240 --> 33:59.240
how you can help why does it take some stupid podcaster in Arlington Washington going around

33:59.240 --> 34:03.020
go hmm you know I ought to come up with a list of ways we can contribute to open source

34:03.020 --> 34:07.120
developers so they can financially afford to work on free software I can come up with

34:07.120 --> 34:10.680
that idea but the free software foundation can't come up with that idea why aren't there

34:10.680 --> 34:15.420
links to patreon pages on this why aren't they telling you how I actually take action

34:15.420 --> 34:18.960
this just feels like they're preaching from on high to us I don't know why this list offends

34:18.960 --> 34:26.600
me so much but it literally offends me reading this list all right so there you go if you

34:26.600 --> 34:32.360
want to read that masterpiece that took a committee some go ahead is there anyone here

34:32.360 --> 34:38.680
who's donated to the I have recently oh yeah recently last year do you do you get spam

34:38.680 --> 34:45.640
from them yes yeah yeah I wasn't impressed about that yeah so I did I did a talk earlier

34:45.640 --> 34:50.000
in the year which I was paid to do and it was all about you know Linux and open source

34:50.000 --> 34:54.960
stuff and I said to the organizers that I wanted to donate that money so I chose to

34:54.960 --> 35:00.760
donate it to the FSF because why not and now I just get spam from Richard Stallman with

35:00.760 --> 35:04.960
choice photos of him gallivanting around the world and what have you right and the verbiage

35:04.960 --> 35:10.080
is would you like to join our low volume mailing list and receive a monthly newsletter that's

35:10.080 --> 35:15.680
the verbiage when you sign up on it I'm getting a paper newsletter as well from America like

35:15.680 --> 35:19.640
a little pamphlet you know I might if I was getting mail I don't get much mail because

35:19.640 --> 35:24.840
I they have my old address so but I didn't I didn't ask for this I just sent them some

35:24.840 --> 35:30.440
money and now I get email spam and snail mail spam and they you know like the chairman say

35:30.440 --> 35:34.120
well maybe they're not linking to patreon pages because patreon is negative in the freedom

35:34.120 --> 35:40.000
dimension but they'll happily accept you to pay by credit card or PayPal and they'll also

35:40.000 --> 35:45.200
take Bitcoin which is how I donated but they'll also happily accept PayPal so I don't think

35:45.200 --> 35:50.280
it's about some sort of moral reason why they're not linking to developers patreon or bug bounties

35:50.280 --> 35:54.760
and Richard Stallman doesn't have a problem with people making money from free software

35:54.760 --> 35:59.480
so I yeah it's yeah wimpy that there is it's sort of I guess where I'm going with this

35:59.480 --> 36:06.500
and I didn't even realize it is there is a real easy way for people that are creating

36:06.500 --> 36:11.840
something really great to go out and seek direct funding and there does seem to be less

36:11.840 --> 36:18.240
relevancy for this particular function of the FSF not that it's irrelevant but for this

36:18.240 --> 36:24.060
particular organizing and function like this this makes no difference in the community

36:24.060 --> 36:28.280
in the direction of what people work on this is this is them basically shouting into the

36:28.280 --> 36:32.660
wind and pretending some sort of pretense of relevancy here we talked about it there's

36:32.660 --> 36:37.000
like a couple news stories maybe and then that's it right it's done it's in a way it's

36:37.000 --> 36:41.100
an average it's advertising the little bit of sway that they they seem to be lacking

36:41.100 --> 36:45.340
now over the free software community it's sort of it sort of undermines their position

36:45.340 --> 36:48.520
in a way to do things like this I should move on because I'm probably pissing off a lot

36:48.520 --> 36:58.240
of people things to talk about yes including including Wes I have right here in my hot

36:58.240 --> 37:05.180
little boxes a new distro that I bet you've never seen whoa yes never tried oh distro

37:05.180 --> 37:10.900
it is very bespoke it is very very bespoke and I did a little sniffing around under the

37:10.900 --> 37:15.320
hood and I I got a full report if you like going under the hood and then friends I recommend

37:15.320 --> 37:20.760

what I'm talking about use the core scheduler for your busy week figure out how these learning

38:46.160 --> 38:50.220
paths can help you lock into a specific type of learning path which help you know in those

38:50.220 --> 38:54.200
moments we like I just got to get this done and I know exactly the type of content I need

38:54.200 --> 38:58.320
to buzz through and instructors have built these learning paths just for your particular

38:58.320 --> 39:04.980
career tasks you might be in this is really a slick system and one of the things I continue

39:04.980 --> 39:09.900
to use it for and I never ever would have thought this in my and I guess is probably

39:09.900 --> 39:14.360
because of the way my mind works is this feature that I thought was kind of silly at first

39:14.360 --> 39:20.660
called nuggets who calls it nuggets good sound delicious actually and they turn out

39:20.660 --> 39:25.040
to be just like these deep dive topics where you can go in get something it's like maybe

39:25.040 --> 39:28.800
five minutes long maybe it's an hour long it depends on the content it's just whatever

39:28.800 --> 39:32.720
the content dictates and you just learn that one particular thing so it's not like how

39:32.720 --> 39:37.680
to do Python on Linux it's not that broad it provides a little like sandboxed area like

39:37.680 --> 39:40.920
okay I'm gonna learn this one thing I can understand this one thing and you come out

39:40.920 --> 39:45.840
of it with a new skill or tool I mean I got 45 minutes yeah exactly check it out linuxacademy.com

39:50.480 --> 39:59.000
for sponsoring the unplugged program so they call it leery l-i-r-i l-i-r-i leery is an

39:59.000 --> 40:05.840
OS and apps built with modern design and features it's available for download right now they

40:05.840 --> 40:11.720
say we're building some exciting features including atomic upgrades powerful notification

40:11.720 --> 40:17.840
support not average power and much much more we're leveraging the latest and greatest Linux

40:17.840 --> 40:25.400
technologies including OS tree Wayland Qt 5 and much more wow they say by utilizing

40:25.400 --> 40:31.040
elements and principles of material design we'll be able to create a framework that incorporates

40:31.040 --> 40:36.680
components and animations that provide more feedback to users additionally a single underlying

40:36.680 --> 40:42.060
responsive system across all platforms to allow more unified user experiences leery

40:42.060 --> 40:46.720
is a mediocratic consensus based community interested in developing an OS and apps with

40:46.720 --> 40:51.160
modern design in mind we believe in the power of open source free software and worldwide

40:51.160 --> 40:55.600
collaboration as we want to build share and improve software together and make it available

40:55.600 --> 41:02.640
to everyone a modern responsive framework based on material design and universal integrated

41:02.640 --> 41:07.940
apps leery ships with a set of modern and flexible apps and the core apps are tightly

41:07.940 --> 41:14.800
integrated into the OS yeah so I did a little sniffing I went to the downloads want to get

41:14.800 --> 41:18.880
a little idea of what I was dealing with here and I something something jumps out at me

41:18.880 --> 41:25.080
you can try leery OS with a live image and eventually install it from there or if you're

41:25.080 --> 41:30.680
already using arch Linux you can add a repository to install the packages and build them for

41:30.680 --> 41:38.400
yourself with the AUR interesting yeah yeah I could just turn this thing up into a material

41:38.400 --> 41:43.320
design desktop yeah now how are they gonna do atomic transactional updates using I don't

41:43.320 --> 41:47.340
know I think it's they probably got they got some distance to travel but so yeah I loaded

41:47.340 --> 41:53.480
it up here and yeah it is a let me expand the size now this feels like one of those

41:53.480 --> 41:58.800
distros that does not really that deserves to be I should put it this way this is a distro

41:58.800 --> 42:03.440
that deserves to be tested outside of VM yeah bare metal they're talking about animations

42:03.440 --> 42:06.800
and I've already noticed some of it it's usable and I just wanted to show it to you guys check

42:06.800 --> 42:10.260
out this cray cray launcher West now for those of you on the audio feed let me I'll describe

42:10.260 --> 42:14.240
it to you you click on what looks like it might be the gnome applications button because

42:14.240 --> 42:17.000
I've got one right I've got one right next to it looks almost just like the gnome all

42:17.000 --> 42:24.200
applications button but when you click it it brings up a what was your window it's like

42:24.200 --> 42:29.060
a modal file manager almost but it's got like a search bar at the top yeah and it's you

42:29.060 --> 42:33.520
type the application name so you put in like terminal there and then okay can't hit enter

42:33.520 --> 42:39.720
but then you click it and it it launches terminal they have a their own terminal window decorations

42:39.720 --> 42:44.760
here they have their own likes bar there that there's a gap between where the applications

42:44.760 --> 42:49.160
are and the launcher is to where the clock is and the notifications are at notifications

42:49.160 --> 42:54.280
slide out on a slide tray same with like network settings they slide out in there and disk

42:54.280 --> 43:00.580
information as well where I can see what this are mounted and the date and time but there's

43:00.580 --> 43:04.560
no calendar in there like you might expect like say from like solace I think it's kind

43:04.560 --> 43:09.140
of interesting it has like built-in share buttons in the terminal window or no maybe

43:09.140 --> 43:12.940
although I'm sorry those are open a new window it has a tab support even though it seems

43:12.940 --> 43:18.480
to be their own application so they are building some of their own apps too which is they mentioned

43:18.480 --> 43:21.360
that do you see anything else in there that looks let's take a look because there's not

43:21.360 --> 43:27.480
a lot of here's not a lot of apps and pre-installed apparently and now all you get is terminal

43:27.480 --> 43:32.320
no I bet here we go so yeah this is pretty much it this is pretty much let's check out

43:32.320 --> 43:38.360
the file manager because that's kind of my my only other I'm betting this is oh nope

43:38.360 --> 43:43.080
this is their own file manager look at that wow it does look like material design it does

43:43.080 --> 43:49.120
yeah it looks very Android it but none of it even scrolls like Android do you see that

43:49.120 --> 43:52.560
yeah I do it's got a little momentum to the scrolling it rolls a little bit after I finish

43:52.560 --> 43:58.560
scrolling but not in a bad way it's not crappy really could be worth oh yeah well that's

43:58.560 --> 44:02.840
that looks right flashback there yeah it looks like an Android dog box but it really I mean

44:02.840 --> 44:10.000
it really could be worse yeah yeah yeah so I don't personally in my life have any room

44:10.000 --> 44:14.880
for another distribution that wants to whole cloth create all of its own apps and its own

44:14.880 --> 44:20.240
desktop paradigm use those X apps every day Chris yeah oh yeah that's right this is using

44:20.240 --> 44:27.840
Wayland that's right it's no good it's no guy kidding what about this as like on a Chromebook

44:27.840 --> 44:34.080
on a Chromebook or as the like desktop component to like a convergent style phone device like

44:34.080 --> 44:38.480
Maru but if instead of like a Debian XFCE it launched something like this I've always

44:38.480 --> 44:49.280
been a fan of a desktop UI that has animations that do that serve a purpose that explain

44:49.280 --> 44:54.440
to you the position of Windows or they explain to you where an alerts coming from or they

44:54.440 --> 44:57.920
show you where an applications land once you've installed it like there's certain animations

44:57.920 --> 45:01.920
that I find actually be they help you in yeah intuitively understand and then there's some

45:01.920 --> 45:04.960
animations where it's just excessive and when your systems under load you're like okay that

45:04.960 --> 45:09.000
looks like crap so you got to walk that line but I actually feel like there's I feel like

45:09.000 --> 45:13.440
there's more room for that kind of stuff in desktop Linux and I like that there is a project

45:13.440 --> 45:15.840
out there that's willing to mess around with that if they're really gonna build some sort

45:15.840 --> 45:21.000
of unified core running on top of Wayland I mean I'm gonna check it back in on it I'm

45:21.000 --> 45:26.360
gonna see how we absolutely yeah we should put it on bare metal one no word yes no word

45:26.360 --> 45:31.400
on touch support I don't see that the governance model seems interesting too for a distribution

45:31.400 --> 45:40.760
like this the leery is a mediocratic consensus based community okay that seems very specific

45:40.760 --> 45:44.320
and they have documents out that describe their governance model so they're like I feel

45:44.320 --> 45:50.600
like they're big about it yeah hopefully that means a constructive good community can form

45:50.600 --> 45:57.280
they have an app they have app rovers maintainers chief maintainers decision makers lazy consensus

45:57.280 --> 46:01.840
decision making typically involves the following steps proposal discussion discussion by consensus

46:01.840 --> 46:06.940
maintainer if consensus not reached and chief maintainer they really got some of this stuff

46:06.940 --> 46:11.880
dialed in like they got some stuff seriously figured out about their about their organization

46:11.880 --> 46:17.180
anybody the mummer have any thoughts on leery building a new distro with a you know new

46:17.180 --> 46:20.840
desktop paradigm creating their own apps again anything like that I'll put it up to you guys

46:20.840 --> 46:29.080
for a moment before we move on no no no I think it I think Wes was right it looks like

46:29.080 --> 46:34.240
it'd be something it'd be good on Chromebooks but outside of that I'm not not sure we need

46:34.240 --> 46:39.360
more of the same when people aren't already doing this work yeah I don't want to discourage

46:39.360 --> 46:44.320
them from doing something cool but it's probably not for me for a little bit it might be fun

46:44.320 --> 46:48.440
to play with if you got an extra machine like when West finally gets a new Sputnik or whatever

46:48.440 --> 46:52.080
he's gonna get totally be cool to throw it on we should I mean I'll throw it on here

46:52.080 --> 46:57.080
I left like half the hard drive here just for distro there's no apps though I guess

46:57.080 --> 47:01.360
if you have the AUR then that's where you are yeah they probably have to pull down all

47:01.360 --> 47:08.800
those GTK you probably I'll make that sacrifice for you guys Wow Wes you know what you know

47:08.800 --> 47:15.160
what else we should try is that where's that what happened that what happened to the Raspberry

47:15.160 --> 47:18.840
Pi story we never covered the Raspberry Pi story should we just talk about it real quick

47:18.840 --> 47:24.320
yeah I guess we should because we forgot to so this week Mycroft released images for the

47:24.320 --> 47:29.280
Raspberry Pi so you can put I secretly use yeah I know I know I know that you don't have

47:29.280 --> 47:36.240
to interrupt the show you can put Mycroft images now on a Raspberry Pi and go all you

47:36.240 --> 47:39.840
know Amazon Echo style using a pie so I got one right here so I was thinking maybe I might

47:39.840 --> 47:43.600
try it eventually what do you think of this West is something to be willing to kick with

47:43.600 --> 47:46.400
kick around and see if that works I don't know if I have an SD card for mine at the

47:46.400 --> 47:50.920
moment yeah that was my limitation maybe I'll order a new one if I can't find one tonight

47:50.920 --> 47:55.920
yeah I mean I'm kind of curious especially after you got the Alexa here in studio let's

47:55.920 --> 48:02.440
see if it can't and there is an element like I played with it a little bit I've installed

48:02.440 --> 48:07.800
like the the desktop version that kind of thing but there is something to be said about

48:07.800 --> 48:12.320
just being able to flash it onto a drive stick it in a pie that really I'm just like same

48:12.320 --> 48:15.840
with you it's like sitting on my shelf I've been waiting for a project to use it on so

48:15.840 --> 48:21.040
I can certainly start talking to it and connecting it to things around my house and it seems

48:21.040 --> 48:25.120
like a very it seems like a platform that's easy a lot of people have it and it makes

48:25.120 --> 48:28.760
the barrier to entry a lot lower yeah that is a huge thing to start playing with I hope

48:28.760 --> 48:34.080
this I would what I would hope for is that this creates some serious adoption because

48:34.080 --> 48:38.880
right now we have this we have this I think we have this really bad habit in the open

48:38.880 --> 48:43.760
source Linux community and maybe general tech community at all as a whole it's probably

48:43.760 --> 48:52.720
not just us where we get all hot and bothered on specs and features and technical differences

48:52.720 --> 48:57.720
that matter to some degree but don't matter in the wider market and that's premature

48:57.720 --> 49:01.720
optimization so we're kind of sitting here like gosh it's gonna be so cool once Mycroft

49:01.720 --> 49:07.160
is about as fast as an echo and can do about half the stuff that the Google home could

49:07.160 --> 49:10.520
or echo can do like it's gonna be great when it gets to that point it's not even at that

49:10.520 --> 49:15.160
point and we're still here talking like it's a possibility that this thing has a chance

49:15.160 --> 49:22.960
in the market but that's only because we're geeks like the reality is the markets already

49:22.960 --> 49:27.960
moving on and I really I mean to that end was I believe that so firmly and I really

49:27.960 --> 49:31.760
I I spent a lot of time on this show like bringing attention to Mycroft and talking

49:31.760 --> 49:34.520
about what important can be and I'd still love to see the project continue I'd love

49:34.520 --> 49:39.080
to see it work on Linux desktops but I really think like the home market I here was what's

49:39.080 --> 49:44.380
in you tell me what's in this box oh this looks new yeah I just came today actually

49:44.380 --> 49:48.680
so it's kind of funny that we're covering the story this is a new brand new inbox Amazon

49:48.680 --> 49:53.520
echo yeah I full one the big boy you know ten speakers and everything yeah I got that

49:53.520 --> 50:01.480
for the RV I you're sold huh yeah yeah yeah it is really it once what I actually like

50:01.480 --> 50:04.440
I actually think it's I know people are worried about monitoring but in some ways it's actually

50:04.440 --> 50:08.720
improved my network security so I like it for that reason alone but how do you feel

50:08.720 --> 50:15.120
about Amazon's platform versus Google well I definitely feel safer about Amazon see

50:15.120 --> 50:21.000
Amazon I think is on the this is why I think really the Mycroft doesn't have a shot is

50:21.000 --> 50:29.440
Amazon has this huge institutional priority to get these things in your homes they don't

50:29.440 --> 50:33.880
have a storefront they can't guarantee you're gonna go to amazon.com when you need to buy

50:33.880 --> 50:39.400
something but if they can get an echo in your house then they have essentially get ready

50:39.400 --> 50:46.240
for a debug term here they've disrupted the store they if they can they can do if technology

50:46.240 --> 50:50.600
can give them a quantum leap over even needing to establish stores although I could see Amazon

50:50.600 --> 50:58.400
opening stores one day but I think this is so fundamental to their long-term business

50:58.400 --> 51:03.120
because it's not just about buying shit on Amazon because having three dots or two that

51:03.120 --> 51:06.680
I use and one for the beard I've never bought one thing from Amazon I don't know if I ever

51:06.680 --> 51:12.200
will buy anything from Amazon using an echo device because it's like a minor feature that's

51:12.200 --> 51:15.600
not what you know what it for you know what I do buy from Amazon is I buy shit that's

51:15.600 --> 51:21.400
compatible with Alexa now so a lot of stuff on Amazon says works with Alexa and it's becoming

51:21.400 --> 51:27.200
a massive at part of their like accessories and technology they're selling related to

51:27.200 --> 51:30.800
the Alexa so there's that entire market then there is the fact a lot of people will use

51:30.800 --> 51:35.600
it to buy stuff off of Amazon that is something a lot of people will and do use it for there

51:35.600 --> 51:40.960
is a massive strategic priority for Amazon to have a device like this in your home and

51:40.960 --> 51:44.720
they don't need it for monitoring your metrics your data your mood they don't need it for

51:44.720 --> 51:48.520
the reasons Google needs it to sell you ads they need it to make their business profitable

51:48.520 --> 51:53.920
and sustainable they need a storefront in your home nobody else needs that like Amazon

51:53.920 --> 51:57.840
does so they have a real incentive to make this thing work with as many third parties

51:57.840 --> 52:02.360
as possible to make the API as generous as possible they have the biggest incentive to

52:02.360 --> 52:06.740
keep updating to give it more features they're going to keep pushing the price down nobody

52:06.740 --> 52:11.880
else even has a multi-device ecosystem now there's like three echo devices you can buy

52:11.880 --> 52:17.240
directly from Amazon dot tap and echo now after CES like a dozen other manufacturers

52:17.240 --> 52:23.240
including frickin Ford in cars has announced echo integration so we're sitting here talking

52:23.240 --> 52:27.360
about mycroft now the conversation about mycroft is going to have to be how can us

52:27.360 --> 52:32.480
geeks incorporated into our homes and our desktops not how is the market going to adopt

52:32.480 --> 52:37.000
mycroft that's that's not happening I found it interesting what you were talking

52:37.000 --> 52:42.040
about about the perhaps market pressure pressure for third-party integrations which I think

52:42.040 --> 52:47.160
is important if we're going down this road of a proprietary semi-documented interface

52:47.160 --> 52:52.340
rightly way better if you could use the echo and use the and use mycroft in the same way

52:52.340 --> 52:55.480
because they integration spoke the same language but probably that's not what we're gonna happen

52:55.480 --> 53:01.440
I would love that but so at least we would need an ecosystem that is right like it matters

53:01.440 --> 53:05.880
less to Google do that than it does Lipsy in the chat room says this is a lot of self-rationalizing

53:05.880 --> 53:12.040
going on that's the kind of tech arrogance I'm talking about where you think well because

53:12.040 --> 53:15.480
it's open source because I could run a lot of devices and people could create plugins

53:15.480 --> 53:20.200
for it and make it extensible it's obviously gonna win one day that's such bullshit like

53:20.200 --> 53:23.640
if that was the case we'd all be using free software on our phones right now that's not

53:23.640 --> 53:27.320
how the real world works anymore it's all about ecosystem it's all about who you integrate

53:27.320 --> 53:32.080
with and all of that integration is closed up behind these stupid API's the world's all

53:32.080 --> 53:37.240
gone to API's well API's mean I control what you have access to that's what an API is and

53:37.240 --> 53:42.080
so that's how the entire world communicates now and mycroft isn't anywhere in the spectrum

53:42.080 --> 53:46.160
unless there's somebody like Hughes or somebody else who just has a general public API they

53:46.160 --> 53:51.760
make available service integration things like that only Amazon and Google and Microsoft

53:51.760 --> 53:55.560
are gonna be able to make those kind of deals and right now I don't think anybody has anything

53:55.560 --> 54:00.480
that competes nowhere near to what the Echo can do that's not self-rationalization that's

54:00.480 --> 54:05.720
I thought this was a joke product for like a year I was skeptical of this thing finally

54:05.720 --> 54:08.760
got one because they put the dot on sale at 40 bucks and I thought alright I'm gonna give

54:08.760 --> 54:14.040
this a go and you know what I've changed my tune I think really have yeah I think it's

54:14.040 --> 54:19.900
a really legitimate product category and it's not just me it's my entire family uses it

54:19.900 --> 54:23.760
when they're like when the kids are here when he is here they're they've all taken to using

54:23.760 --> 54:27.800
it for all kinds of things like it's it gets frequent use by other people besides me I

54:27.800 --> 54:31.840
think 2017 is gonna be a really interesting like I'm really curious to see if if you say

54:31.840 --> 54:35.320
the same thing at the end of this year right now about the family about the excitement

54:35.320 --> 54:43.040
about your uses and then at the same time like is this like first first out there advantages

54:43.040 --> 54:46.800
Amazon just gonna take off with it or are we gonna see some competitors are we gonna

54:46.800 --> 54:50.840
see this as a general enough category who else has the presence they do to it like they

54:50.840 --> 54:55.640
constantly are pushing on every box you get from Amazon it's it's covered in echo branding

54:55.640 --> 55:00.560
they have they have the echo plastered all over their page when you go to amazon.com

55:00.560 --> 55:04.160
every any device or service that works with the echo it says it right there on the on

55:04.160 --> 55:06.960
the product and I agree I mean I think they have all those advantages I only ask because

55:06.960 --> 55:11.760
it's still early days in some ways for this industry I think it's shifted with CES and

55:11.760 --> 55:18.600
a little bit before I think it shifted to a couple I think also people are more the

55:18.600 --> 55:22.040
industry is more willing to get in bed with Amazon because they're already in bed like

55:22.040 --> 55:28.080
selling stuff through Amazon whereas Google is bigger risk and Amazon seems more consistent

55:28.080 --> 55:32.760
right like Google's the often they're like high castle out there doing their thing deprecating

55:32.760 --> 55:37.200
what they want stopping agreements whenever they want they you know like the whole they

55:37.200 --> 55:41.920
bought Motorola just to sell them to Lenovo you can't really trust Google to do except

55:41.920 --> 55:45.840
for their core advertising business right and I I think what I'm concerned about with

55:45.840 --> 55:52.280
mycroft is it sort of the smartphone problem only way worse like the smartphone is sort

55:52.280 --> 55:58.380
of was made like the iPhone part of what made the iPhone successful was the whole ecosystem

55:58.380 --> 56:03.640
of content apps music videos and when Android first launched Google didn't really have that

56:03.640 --> 56:07.500
stuff there wasn't a play store it took Google like three years to really get that stuff

56:07.500 --> 56:12.240
all figured out and dialed in and then now they have a pretty successful ecosystem it's

56:12.240 --> 56:16.980
the same with this only to a higher degree because now it's not just the music and the

56:16.980 --> 56:20.960
videos that you integrate with but it's also all of the hardware products and the home

56:20.960 --> 56:28.840
services and and it's things like alarm companies and and you know business relationships are

56:28.840 --> 56:34.040
being made and if your device can't do those things if you know if if your Amazon device

56:34.040 --> 56:38.320
can unlock your house or lock it when you leave it but the Google one can't then what

56:38.320 --> 56:41.600
are you gonna do you're not gonna relock your whole house now I'm not saying everybody listening

56:41.600 --> 56:45.560
to the show wants those things no certainly not and I think there's for me there's still

56:45.560 --> 56:48.720
a I'm still gonna play around with mycroft I'm still gonna see what I can do I would

56:48.720 --> 56:53.280
prefer that it does everything the echo can do but I'm pretty skeptical at this point

56:53.280 --> 56:58.640
and not not not happily so either I'm kind of bummed out about it I think I think it's

56:58.640 --> 57:04.160
kind of it's kind of a bit of a bad situation and I think that's something to be clear about

57:04.160 --> 57:08.720
too is like you're not saying that you don't have these other qualms or this desire to

57:08.720 --> 57:13.320
use mycroft right but you're you're exploring this in a practical sense of like you have

57:13.320 --> 57:17.080
a studio that you run you need you want something that can help you and to help automate your

57:17.080 --> 57:24.480
day-to-day life and the echo is meeting that need yeah it does it it I think it's it's

57:24.480 --> 57:30.040
hard to describe the value of the product until you have one because it really depends

57:30.040 --> 57:33.880
on your setup and if you don't have hardware to control it's less valuable it immediately

57:33.880 --> 57:37.880
I would I would be 40 bucks asking it things it's like well I can I can do that with my

57:37.880 --> 57:43.280
phone exactly yeah that's not a compelling use case for the kids and others like it I

57:43.280 --> 57:47.480
do not I know I don't I don't do that that's not what I use it for I use it specifically

57:47.480 --> 57:52.600
to automate things in studio and whatnot all right well let's let's move on there's been

57:52.600 --> 57:57.000
something I got some feedback on a lot of people said you know we we've talked a lot

57:57.000 --> 58:02.320
about recent Mac switchers and a lot of people oh Chris you're such a Mac hater such a Mac

58:02.320 --> 58:08.120
hater and I thought there was says the man towards the man who's made how many hackintoshes

58:08.120 --> 58:13.380
and other things well I don't it's just they're just I don't think they're good value propositions

58:13.380 --> 58:18.120
so there's another post that I was posted just after last week's show and I I wanted

58:18.120 --> 58:22.920
to instead of go through his whole why I switched to Linux but it's yet another why I'm switching

58:22.920 --> 58:27.820
to Linux from Mac OS which is interesting in itself but what I wanted to cover was some

58:27.820 --> 58:30.920
of the replacements he came up with for his Mac apps because I thought that would be kind

58:30.920 --> 58:35.440
of interesting so for iTunes he switched to no music for Photoshop he switched again

58:35.440 --> 58:42.240
not too surprising there for sublime text he went to Emacs for Lawrence yeah wow yeah

58:42.240 --> 58:48.280
I know for Lightroom he went to dark table for albatron live which is audio processing

58:48.280 --> 58:51.680
he went to our door for DD he went to gnome disk which is funny that he switched from

58:51.680 --> 58:57.880
DD I know right yeah textual he went to hex chat mailed that app to Thunderbird I cal

58:57.880 --> 59:03.360
the gnome calendar address book to gnome contacts I term two to terminator good choice reader

59:03.360 --> 59:06.960
to feed the monkey Twitter for Mac to just using the website he says I basically stopped

59:06.960 --> 59:11.640
using Twitter so it's not really a big deal he switched from no password manager to key

59:11.640 --> 59:18.360
pass and he uses type talk which I might try out which is I guess it's a it's an app that

59:18.360 --> 59:23.920
allows the computer to read articles to you and whatnot mmm type talk nice I could see

59:23.920 --> 59:26.760
that especially if you're like well I want to read this but I'm you know doing the dishes

59:26.760 --> 59:33.840
or I there is something fascinating about peeking into their experience because they're

59:33.840 --> 59:37.600
looking at some of these applications for the first time say in 10 years and so watch

59:37.600 --> 59:41.740
them evolved for the right years necessarily so to them it's like look there's this contacts

59:41.740 --> 59:46.000
application gnome has a calendar now and me I'm like why does gnome have a calendar and

59:46.000 --> 59:50.520
they're like no mess I can't wait from the coming from Mac like that makes sense you

59:50.520 --> 59:57.760
expect that yeah yeah talks about how this is better than the disk program is macOS now

59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.220
that's that is true though yeah it's I was just recently experimenting with a hackintosh

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:07.960
and I don't even know how you format things in that I don't I don't just go to the terminal

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.280
yeah like I just I was like this is how the disk manager works in macOS now this is this

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.440
is that was bad so why did I switch this is the summary this is the part I thought we'd

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.360
touch on I think it started with some dissatisfaction about OS 10 and the desire to be at least

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.200
in theory able to change things so they would work like I want them this translates directly

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.120
to the GPL with its which is the license most of these programs I use is under add that

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.440
to the feeling of membership because everyone at work is using Linux and also pride in curiosity

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:43.960
I'm able to look behind the scenes which he likes a lot directly at the code this is not

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.120
possible on OS 10 at all and to top it all off with the fact that I use Linux on so many

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.960
different hardware my laptop my desktop at work the security cam I'm running in Poland

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.240
the Raspberry Pi I have embedded devices in my car on the phone my router and so on all

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:06.840
this together right now is so compelling macOS doesn't stand a chance that's it's interesting

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.220
that the the pressure of everything else using Linux is encouraging him to give Linux another

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:17.080
chance to he did try Linux back in the day like he was a mandrake user he was you know

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.960
there are a lot of Mac Mac users in that same position like well we tried it we dabbled

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.080
with it yeah here was this like beautiful shiny Unix compatible thing that well we were

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.600
gonna go with it um it was kind of he's also just a couple other things he says you know

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.360
I started off I just love this because because this really fits my prediction I'll be honest

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.080
that's really why I love this because because I've been I've been seeing this and so it's

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.920
fascinating to see this materialize so this is exactly what I was this is exactly what

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.280
I've been thinking because he writes after five or six years of he admits I fell in love

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.920
with macOS but after five or six years I started seeing the cracks first small they introduced

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.560
spaces and a desktop manager that wasn't working anymore thus I wasn't able to change the speed

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.640
which I could change between virtual desktops which are central to my workflow then they

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.440
introduced iCloud into a text editor and instead of starting it and then you could save anywhere

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:14.860
on my hard drive I had to take an extra step and tell it not to save to iCloud I hated

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.520
it so much that I rewrote text editor myself so it would work like it did before with plain

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:25.260
text and he links to text Ed iTunes started getting out of control accurate yeah he says

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.320
and it gets worse and worse with time I wanted my computer to work a certain way and it often

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.400
worked that way before then came OS 10 update and made it possible to keep and made it impossible

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.160
to keep my workflow so I don't use macOS much and so I don't often upgrade but I have the

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.400
macbook pro that you know we installed archon during this show and a dual boots final cut

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.680
OS and so I went into final cut OS and I decided well if I'm going to use final cut I should

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.600
update the latest version of final cut OS because it's totally free so from the final

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.120
cut app store it downloads final cut OS and doesn't install and updates to mac OS final

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.720
cut Sierra I don't know and you know what the first thing it does and I went you know

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.040
what I wanted to do two different things I wanted to edit my video and go to bed it wanted

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:14.040
to re-index all of the photos on the computer for some sort of deep learning analysis which

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.040
pegged my processor cores at 40% so at least they're doing it locally right but that's

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.100
why it's pegging your processor I'm like I like and is it not like set as a low priority

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.180
like how is it not falling off into the background when I go to use final cut how is that not

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:33.160
a thing they thought of yeah well I actually what I did is I was so frustrated I just rebooted

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.160
back into archons and I'll edit later that sucks though it does because you know what

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.840
I ended up doing is I just oh yeah this thing so in the morning I booted it up and let it

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.920
sit there and do its thing and then just shut it down again so that way it's done so now

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.080
you can edit video yeah yeah because I just let it go for a while but I really feel like

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.480
I had no domain over that computer I like I guess it's not too unusual after an upgrade

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.880
for some backend process to work like that but I don't need my photos I don't use photos

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.120
on that Mac I don't need it to do those things there's just probably stuff that's in that

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.100
library because that's where stuff gets dumped like I don't need that to be done like I would

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:10.320
just like to go and check that box and I looked around in the OS I couldn't find anywhere

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.160
that allows me to turn off that feature it just does it I don't need my photos analyzed

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.440
you know right that's the kind of thing it just drives me nuts about that and I feel

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.080
like if they were focused on that platform like it was the only they didn't make an iOS

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.400
device and it was the only major platform they had to worry about these kinds of little

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.560
cracks wouldn't be so bad but they feel like iOS has really especially with how popular

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.740
and how much it defined the early smartphone era I feel like it changed the idea of who

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.120
their product was right and so that has changed the way that they design products well you

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.160
know I mean they send they sell they might sell a hundred million iPhones in a year and

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.540
they might sell 20 million racks and no one thinks that an iPhone is thinking differently

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.920
right like that that's just it doesn't it's incongruent yeah that's interesting too so

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.480
I wanted to move now that we've had that little brief aside unless anybody in the moment wants

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.240
to jump in and I thought we'd go something more technical just to sort of refresh our

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:07.760
palates this is an interesting talk that you found I think right building a billion user

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.360
load balancer this was at the USENIX conference I think is that right and this was a gentleman

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:20.760
from Facebook Patrick Shuff I think and he gave a talk on that and I just thought I'd

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.800
play just a moment before it's very interesting and I'll jump ahead a little bit here into

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.040
the presentation single server served all of Facebook so the entirety of Facebook every

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.520
request comes in and we're gonna slowly build up one by one layer by layer each of our load

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.640
balancing infrastructure pieces so that we get to the point where we have a multi data

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:45.560
center multi-continent load balancing infrastructure to serve all of the requests a couple of points

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:52.020
I want to make here is we use a lot of open source software so almost all the pieces in

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.960
this talk are going to be open source there is going to be some custom stuff Facebook

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.680
specific to our environment that aren't necessarily open source but all of this stuff is easily

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:06.200
done in open source and I will talk about all of those different projects as well and

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.440
lastly my my goal for this talk is for you guys to you know think about the patterns

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.720
that we use you know use doing what we do for load balancing might not make sense for

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.460
everybody but kind of looking at the patterns and how we evolve our infrastructure and applying

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.260
it to some of the things that you guys are building now he does get into numbers so when

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.480
people ask me what is a traffic what does the traffic engineer at Facebook do this is

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.840
the image that comes to mind so this is a visualization showing all the people on Facebook

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.920
and all their connections to all the other people on Facebook our job is to make sure

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.280
that no matter where you are in the world when you open up Facebook app on your phone

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.440
or you type Facebook.com into a web browser that you connect to our servers as fast and

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:53.000
secure as possible so our job is to make sure that you know we were able to connect the

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.320
world you know that is the mission of Facebook is to make the world more open wow so just

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.140
to kind of quickly go over the agenda for today we'll talk about the different types

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:06.220
of requests that kind of make up Facebook it's kind of hyperbole but I suppose in a

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:14.260
way it is sort of true like I think most of my family that's not technical uses Facebook

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:20.640
to stay in touch absolutely it's like they sometimes use email for like planning big

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.800
family events but mostly everything and since I'm not on Facebook when I show up at family

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.000
events I'm like out of the lube on half the stuff and I get the feeling too in that way

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.560
where it's like well we used email because grandma isn't on Facebook and but she does

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.240
check her email once in a while you know and then you're like so suddenly you're lumped

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.980
in a very different technical group I still get the question what is Linux what is what

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.760
is Linux and I you can say you know to something that really connects with people it's what

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.880
powers huge websites like Facebook yeah lastly I'll open it up for Q&A and you guys you know

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.600
can ask any questions about load balancing Facebook production engineering anything at

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.360
all all right now here's the numbers I believe so let's dive quickly and talk about some

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.760
numbers real fast these are company-wide numbers every month and the month of the month of

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:10.120
September 1.7 9 billion people use Facebook and on average over that month 1.1 out 1 8

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:16.200
billion people use Facebook so these numbers are really cool and you know these are Facebook

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.720
numbers but I think about these in terms of a traffic engineers perspective so that means

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.240
every day assuming there's only one TCP connection per device and this is you know I think you

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.440
guys all know this is probably very improbable you know that means we at least have to terminate

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:36.520
1.1 8 billion TCP connections every single day and serve us from those and also the really

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.660
important interesting thing is 1.09 billion are on mobile devices so we have to think

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:48.120
about people who are using high-speed you know LTE or or you know landline cable modems

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.360
we also have to think about people using networks like 2g and 3g wow you know all these different

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.320
networking environments and we need to make sure when you hear numbers like that it gives

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:03.600
you an idea of how entrenched Android and iOS are when the numbers of mobile active

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:11.800
I want to just make sure these that this didn't go over you 1.09 billion mobile daily active

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:18.280
people they're not even like fudging that it's daily active so it's not like you have

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:24.240
an account but you never log in it's daily active people can you imagine building an

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.640
infrastructure for that and that's just mobile that's just mobile I mean it should be said

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.520
they probably engineer their apps so that if you ever installed the app that it wakes

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.920
up at least once a day to ping their servers but that's still their service right so they

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.920
still have to design for it that's probably true oh I like the way you think Wes that's

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.840
probably very true that is probably something there to it but damn even if they were they

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.840
are responding to those TPC yeah I don't think most people could handle that kind of load

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.960
unbelievable so it's just cool like whatever you may think of Facebook and obviously we

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.000
both have our qualms there yeah they do either not very much yeah I have an account I have

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.520
an account as well I do use Instagram sometimes but yeah I've experimented with Facebook more

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.320
as like a means to drive traffic than anything else they do some serious engineering yeah

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.080
and that's all laid out in this video well not all of it obviously but a lot of really

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.600
good stuff is laid out at least at 16 and you can get access to it usenik.org you can

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.640
find more but I would probably just start with the link in the show notes and then go

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.320
out from there because that's a big site and that's an interesting talk and yeah like Wes

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.120
is saying regardless of your opinions of Facebook the technical feeds and you know what's fascinating

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.560
yeah bringing it from just one server to what it is now mind-blowing that is a hell of a

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.920
project a hell of a project if you want to get started with your own infrastructure friends

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:49.000
digitalocean.com is the place to do it digitalocean.com use the promo code do1plug it's one word

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.680
it's one word it's the best word do1plug unplug digitalocean but not really because I mean

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.040
that'd be cray cray because you know what happens a lot of 40 gigabit connections right

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.160
just like would you take you all day all day all day and they got data centers all over

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.880
the world so you better get prepared to travel and then they'd have one of those talented

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.780
engineers from digital ocean just plugging them right back in right behind you you'd

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:14.120
never win they probably could outnumber you yeah that's the thing and if you use the it's

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.200
just way easier to use the promo code do1plug go create account apply it to your account

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.680
and then get started they got a great interface very simple and intuitive to use five dollars

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.440
a month for one of their machines or you can go hourly I love the hourly system so great

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.380
for trying out open source projects lots of nice stuff that I'll I'll often just burn

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:36.580
a digital ocean droplet for an hour yeah exactly oh some sense I might count fine yeah totally

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.200
worth it three cents an hour okay all right well I can do that I get two cores I mean

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.720
this one of the best parts is that unlike some other cloud providers you may have used

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.880
they're so upfront about their pricing it's like bam this is what you're going to pay

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.300
here you go you know it mm-hmm and it's all SSD based so even at the five dollar one you're

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:57.540
still getting a 40 gigabit e-connection you're still getting SSDs you can still pick from

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.720
a data center all over the world you can choose any district you want or that free BSD which

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.720
I hear people like digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged and by the way

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.000
they are doing early sign up like they were with their block storage not too long ago

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.320
for monitoring for like metrics very curious to see what it looks like yeah I am too I

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.220
bet I mean man so far everything they've released I've been super impressed with the UI to manage

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:28.080
it I'm really curious to see what they come up with really curious so they say they're

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.840
launching it soon no configuration required hey damn you can get alerts when problem I'm

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:42.320
signing up to right now I'm gonna do it right now that is that's a that's a no brainer all

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.480
right there I've signed up digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged in a big thank

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:55.960
you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program so you guys I don't think I need to

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.160
build the case that I think the Mac books are a bit of a train wreck or that I think

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.120
people are switching from Mac to Linux and Windows to Linux obviously but I'll tell you

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.560
something that was super disappointing in my test and you might have heard me mention

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.560
earlier that I was I was experimenting with a hackintosh over the weekend I tried it on

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.280
three different computers just to kind of see what the state of hackintoshing was and

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.620
that was following a test I did which was massively disappointing we have we frequently

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.400
have a conversation on our different shows about media production under Linux and a lot

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.320
of times people say they have a pet project have you tried have you tried Katie and live

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.600
have you tried blender have you tried open shot have you tried you know all of these

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.400
and there was a question posted on the our Linux subreddit about the current state of

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:48.440
Linux video editing in 2017 and I I just happened to go through another round of this I tried

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.920
it on my XPS 13 on the entryware Apollo on the Librem 15 and on my custom build hair

01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:03.440
master machine which is a six core i7 with 32 gigs of RAM and all SSD storage that's

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.640
with a GTX 9 handsome as you are Chris it's not a GTX thank you well thanks Wes you handsome

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.240
devil yourself it's not a GTX 10 series graphics so it could do better there but it is a GTX

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:20.880
9 series graphics so for video editing purposes it's it's pretty capable out of all of the

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:30.380
machines that I used in my testing none of them could even play back my test footage

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:37.320
except for hair master and to do so it took all the six core CPU performance I have which

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.360
didn't leave much left over for applying effects and I'm not talking editing I'm not talking

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.160
rendering I'm saying just trying to play the footage back that I intend to edit the systems

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.360
literally cannot do it so there is now footage that is available in consumer grade equipment

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.260
that the codecs on Linux are just not capable of playing back I'm talking things at 4k resolution

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:04.660
not crazy frame rates not well high bit rates but not unbelievably high bit rates and they

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:09.600
just they just do not play they just chop or like in the case of some players they they

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:17.240
freak out and it goes all green or they flip the image and it's two frames a second in

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:26.240
2017 I honestly believe the state of Linux edit video editing is worse than it's been

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.840
in a while we have what we have right now are a half a dozen half baked tools that are

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:40.040
almost good enough but not good enough and we don't have a supporting media pipeline

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.120
under those tools to make it all connect and to make playback streamless and to guarantee

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.120
that if something works in one editor it'll work in another editor like if you won't even

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.620
get in there that's an entirely different dimension we are in a we are in a really bad

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:59.440
position if you're trying to do anything with that any if you're trying to work with any

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.320
camera that was sold in 2016 or 2017 I was gonna say like is it safe to say that like

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:11.280
we're getting there in terms of like video from 2009 but you know like yeah all right

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.320
you've got like maybe 1080 video you can edit that you can do it but any 30 frames a second

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.960
you could probably do that but modern video which is not that anymore like the world has

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:25.760
moved on and we are not catching up right and so this guy on reddit kind of had the

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.720
same experience he said some of some 4k wouldn't even play back on my machines there were only

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:37.440
five minute clips I recently went through I tried Katie and live PDV blender Lightworks

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:43.280
open shot as my main ones I spent the most time with Katie and live and Lightworks because

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.180
those are the ones I always tend to like the most and of all that I like Katie and live

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:55.880
the best so if you have a straightforward project it's really it's but but it's not even Katie

01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.620
and lives fault anymore like the fault lies in the underlying yeah in the codecs they're

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:06.640
not hardware accelerated and depending on which ones you get they if they are hardware

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.720
accelerated they don't support the right resolution and frame rate so they have to fall back to

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.240
CPU decoding and we are leaving the world where CPU decoding is impossible it just doesn't

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:22.560
work anymore yeah it took a six core system playing from an MV and then from a fast solid

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:29.120
state storage to play it back the enemy yes thank you and I so the when this when this

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:35.480
question came in about the current state of video editing on Linux this is an area where

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:42.760
it's still it's the thing is is a 2013 MacBook Pro that I have can play this back not only

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.400
can it play these files back but I can apply real-time color and I can speed them up and

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:53.840
slow them down and I can apply those effects interact with them I can so like yeah that's

01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:01.880
a 2013 MacBook Pro running a system name is a 2015 but hey oh but you get my point exactly

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.800
right like and yet you could buy the latest XPS or whatever and not be able to do it on

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.640
I mean these are this this is a sky like let alone over here X I mean it's a pretty bad

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.720
situation and I maybe it's just not a market we're ever just gonna be able to capture because

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:25.040
maybe the maybe the technology is moving too fast and maybe it's just not possible maybe

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.040
there's just certain things that open source isn't equipped to tackle is that I hate that

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:34.200
I hate that be the conclusion I come to but I just and it's frustrating to be in the position

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:39.040
where like there's so many tools right where Windows has the or Mac has the like power

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:43.540
user light option but then you can go to Linux and get the like oh no you're an expert this

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:47.980
is the real power but video editing is not that way right like you the second you go

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.920
to Linux you start making compromises you're like well but yes I want to make manual workflows

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.040
yes I want to do these things like I don't mind spending a few minutes configuring so

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.120
that I get optimal things but those settings are not as good as on the proprietary solution

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.240
people listening could will often respond well what about transcoding into an intermediate

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.920
codec or what about working with proxy media you know you could do Chris you could do this

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:14.000
with proxy media that first thing no suggested that all takes a ton of time and it it doesn't

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:21.400
allow for sort of a flexible creativity that is when you can take a set of mixed resolution

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:26.200
mixed frame rate footage drop it all in your timeline put your piece of music down and

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:31.960
just start cutting and working with the music with the footage it's an entirely different

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.920
process then I'm going to import all my camera footage I'm going to load up this program

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.200
that transcodes all my footage into this output directory then I'm going to take this output

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.800
directory I'm going to add it to my project folder then I'm going to add this project

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.200
folder into the editor and I'll only work with this media and then once I render it

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.760
out I'll replace this media with the final foot with the final cut with the final you

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.720
know high resolution footage and just hope that all of the color effects and all of the

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.020
speed up and all that translates well to the final footage even though it's a different

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:01.800
frame rate it's a totally different codec it just doesn't make any sense and it would

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.960
be one thing like if you worked at the local news station or something with the support

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.840
crew right but especially with like the the vlogging you've been doing etc like I don't

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.160
I don't know if people understand the workflow where like you're on your own you've got like

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:15.840
three different cameras you've got one laptop you've got a truck and you're trying to like

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:19.600
you're trying out experimental shots you need to be able to review that footage right there

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.300
on the scene and figure out what's going to work or not yeah it's it's it's this weird

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:28.960
paradigm because we have all of this flexibility with hardware we have all this flexibility

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.400
with software but it's left us sort of incapable of answering certain types of workloads and

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:39.100
it's the most frustrating thing because it would be perfect so I'd say for depending

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:44.000
on your workload and depending on your camera footage and depending on the bit rate of your

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.600
clips what your expectations are yeah if you wanted to jump in with Linux video editing

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.760
and you were working with some pretty straightforward stuff I just went through it again I mean

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.900
I've done this on and off for years but I just went through this I think Katie and live

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:02.240
still my favorite I thought I go Katie and live I go with a dark theme I think it looks

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:09.280
really pro it works well it sometimes is a little sluggish the it's weird some of the

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.760
effects the way you change the settings are super arbitrary and weird and and not like

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:20.480
any other editor you'll ever use but you know as far as an editor that just works and is

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.600
pleasant to use and allows me to have your audio tracks and your video tracks and intermix

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:30.060
and have multiple tracks and it's really simple works in a way that a person who's edited

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:34.440
video would expect Katie and live org we should throw that in the show notes to put that in

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.040
there too all right mumble room anybody have thoughts on media production under Linux before

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:44.480
we wrap before we go I know and I also should just say that I don't feel like this any of

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.480
this applies to audio production on your Linux no ironically I feel very different yeah I

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.920
feel like I feel like if you were gonna only use if you can only have one platform to do

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.700
audio podcasts Linux would be it especially with some of the cool stuff wimpy makes some

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:01.560
of the cool open source projects that are out there some of the stuff we've built internally

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.520
yeah the script ability and automate ability I think XMN might be right is what Final Cut

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:14.680
is is sort of sort of what you what you get when you control the operating system the

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:21.480
software application that runs on it and the hardware that's the upside the downside is

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.560
anemic hardware a company that has an unsure direction that's focused on a different product

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.960
and has way too expensive prices I mean that new MacBook is a killer so that's the downside

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.320
of the Apple approach just in a nutshell and the lock-in obviously but the upside is for

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.200
one particular application this entire stack integration it's all optimized I mean they

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:47.500
know they know their quirks and how to write for it so yeah all right I'll get off my high

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.860
horse but I wanted I think part of the reason why I wanted to talk about this with you guys

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:59.120
is we've spent a few episodes in a row talking about how people are leaving the Mac and about

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:04.640
how the Mac is crap and about Mac OS is junk and about how they're switching to Linux and

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.480
I just I just also wanted to give you a little bit of a reality check and say it's not all

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.240
roses like the the that platform is still viable for a large portion of the workforce

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:23.400
that right now Linux is in my personal opinion fallen behind moron now because equipment

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:28.920
has pulled ahead and so the situation right now is worse in some ways than it has been

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.520
in a while because it you now give me the point where Linux isn't even capable of playing

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.520
some of these files so I know I've spent a lot of time harping on the MacBook and people

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.840
switching to Linux but I felt like this was sort of a counterbalance to some of that and

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.840
I'll keep testing and I'm not ever done testing oh no certainly not right none of these are

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.800
foregone conclusions it's more of a this is what's the feeling right now yeah this is

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.080
sort of like I've gone through around it all up and this is sort of where it lands for

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.880
me personally the other thing about it is everybody's workload is different what the

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.680
footage you're working with is different the the aspects and goals of your project is your

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.520
turnaround time what's the yeah right there's a huge part of it to affect that huge part

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:14.040
of it if I did one two shows a week I might you could do proxy or like whatever exactly

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:18.640
exactly that would be it but if I'm trying to do something every single night totally

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.040
different and and during the day to it's not like it's like I do it all day long and then

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.560
I go home and I do it at night now as a side project so it's like it's really got to be

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.760
pretty tight it's and there's really no time for extra bullshit yeah yeah and so that all

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.760
is a totally different thing but I feel like that sort of probably more better my my view

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:43.280
probably is more representative of the larger industry and and maybe less and less and less

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.320
of the personal hobbyist and but I think it's probably where the money is where people would

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.920
be coming from where the switchers are becoming from and when people are looking for certain

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.160
requirements that group I have I think I have a better idea of what that group will be looking

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.880
at and I'd say right now we're worse off in some ways right and I guess it comes back

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.040
to that story of like you know are you trying to sell someone you're like yeah you should

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.720
pick up this new Linux rig and it'll do all your things but if they're the new hobbyist

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.320
vlogger can you honestly say that and not say yeah but here's the here's the capitulation

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.720
job to me I'd say it depends on how professional you want your stuff to look that's one thing

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.520
and it like if you're doing a screencast and you're cutting up the screencast to make a

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.560
little bit shorter or take it out a mistake that's that's Kaden live would be great or

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.400
you have a New Year's party video that you shot and you want to make a quick three-minute

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.600
video and share it around it's gonna be awesome for that you know you even maybe like a trailer

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.400
for a Kickstarter project there's a lot of things you could use it for so it really just

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.520
depends on what you're doing so that's sort of my answer to the state of video editing

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.160
in 2017 and I wonder I hope it's a good question I wonder I'll definitely know I mean I try

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.880
it it seems to be almost every other month or so I sit down and I go alright let's take

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.440
a project I get all the same footage and I say I'm gonna take the same footage I'm gonna

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.400
take I'm gonna try to make the same thing three or four times it's extremely monotonous

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.920
but it's the best test I have and I try to create the same exact product as close I can

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.680
and you know what in this test sometimes I feel like I end up with something better than

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.700
I did in the other editor like because the way it works and the workflow it's better

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:20.400
with the way my mind works I get a little more creative better with your creative spirit

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.660
yeah right and then other times I'm like I just basically make doldrums yeah grinding

01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:32.340
it out it's the awful and it could all change right like maybe we live in the Vulcan Wayland

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:38.280
open source AMD driver Wonderland in two years but we're not there now many you had a question

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:46.520
before we wrap up no oh sorry many oh sorry sorry right I had you I had you muted I'm

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.720
sorry I'm a jerk go ahead talking to me yeah I had you muted I'm sorry repeat what you're

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.760
saying so did you do your tests on the X server and Wayland or only Wayland only X server

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.760
no way I think that no Wayland do you think that that had that has an influence on it

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:09.440
would it be I mean you know good try are you wondering for video playback yeah yeah I don't

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.220
really think this display server was the limiting factor I think the the issue was that all

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:19.640
of the codecs were dumping the decoding job off to the CPU and even on even on like a

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.320
Skylake you know system it just wasn't the throughput wasn't there yeah four cores but

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:30.560
not enough to six core system could do it though yeah yeah I thought there's something

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.120
else I thought I saw in the chat room but I think I will wrap it up there I think I've

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.120
made I've made my pay a piece about it oh yeah that was mr. go go says that the Linux

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.840
gamer is a good example someone who will use Linux for video editing yeah Linux gamer and

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.680
Linux gamecast yeah exactly there's projects out there that are being done on this stuff

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.960
that you can go check out right now they're producing content and I like I say you know

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:57.200
if I was doing one or two things a week and it might be a great like you don't have money

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.960
to shell out on a new Mac system totally the most professional editing software but you

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.640
want to start making your vlog or whatever like yeah Linux is still great for that yeah

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.480
and you got it really to like one of the nice things about Linux is where the software tool

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.200
might not be as quick or you got to make proxy media or the the toolkit might be a little

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.640
clunky but you could also get like a 12-core Xeon with 64 gigs of RAM and all that like

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.000
you can go nuts on that and it'll all work it all yeah so you there are areas where you

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.160
could where it's one part might be slower but you could go way faster another aspect

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:34.680
of it and you know the other nice thing is with arch and and and Ubuntu and and and all

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.640
of these different distributions having these video editors packaged for them you get just

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.680
as part of your package updates already there you get the new you get the new improved editor

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.040
which is nice actually it is generally with these it's nice to get that new stuff because

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:54.320
all the new OS that wants to re-index your pictures that's exactly what I'm talking

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.800
about that you don't get drug along with that strategy tax and so there's there are huge

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.840
benefits to doing media production under Linux I guess my advice is don't ever try Final

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.560
Cut don't ever don't don't do premiere don't use premiere don't use it is always easier

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.880
if you haven't tasted the you know yeah sweet sweet grass on the other side yeah yeah yeah

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.200
don't use what was that what's a Sony Vegas don't use Vegas don't use that don't use it

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.160
so don't use that never work at Pixar wait no that works on Linux yeah I know wouldn't

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.360
be nice if some of their tools yeah they're down although I thought I feel like their

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.240
tools be more like using blender and it's so funny there's people a lot of one of the

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.940
number one comments actually I get is Chris have you tried blender and I always my response

01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.440
is have you tried blender for video editing it you have to create 3d views to just do

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:46.720
this simplest and this is again back to that like the like weird Mac Windows professional

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.640
hobbyist type thing right like it's like you're not barking basement you're not beginner you

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.300
have some budget for this thing but you're also not like this isn't necessarily your

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:59.840
like $200,000 a year day job thing you fall in the middle where you have serious expectations

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:05.040
you want to get stuff done and it's just not there but you also can't spend 50 grand on

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.120
a software license right yeah no and it's it's then and then on the other side of it

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.600
you just have a lackluster hardware that cost too much so it's you pay one word yeah that

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:20.960
is Chris's take on the current state of video editing and Linux and thanks to it was glee's

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.160
a web for asking that question because it got me it got me chewing on the topic a little

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.960
bit discussion it's some it's it's good counterbalance to a lot of the coverage we've been doing

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.880
recently all right that brings us to the end of this week's unplugged program would you

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.360
like to contribute you can do it several ways you can spread the word about the show maybe

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.320
somebody out there that would like a Linux podcast let them know that's a direct way

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.680
you can help the show you can also join us live in the chat room and chat as we go over

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.040
jblive.tv or hang out in our mumble room and get your voice heard in our virtual lug all

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:56.200
of that's possible just get started going to jblive.tv for the chat room where you can

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:01.280
get mumble information or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where you can get calendar

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.280
information now don't miss tech snap where you can check out Wes on the new tech snap

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:32.080
that's right that's right and we'll see you right back here next week.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:53.040
I've never installed GNU slash Linux. Chris I've got a question for you. The other day

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.680
you might have been on Laz I think it was in between segments you were talking to Noah

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:03.280
about your laptop and things you like to keep installed on your laptop and you mentioned

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:10.840
sab nzb and couch i think yeah well actually not necessarily on my laptop but yeah on my

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:16.920
on my workstation upstairs uh right now it's uh right well it can be those two right now

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:24.360
my my setup is uh sonar and nzb git but i could also do sab nzb and sick rage couch

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.840
potato i care less about yeah i don't care as much about couch potato but uh it's nice

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:38.560
to have because i i made a snap of sab nzbd and couch potato no no really just to make

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:42.560
it nice and easy to install them and it's stupidly easy so how does it i wonder which

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.540
others you would use what is the okay so but here's the question what is the mechanism

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.720
now for that to get updated like that's kind of that's kind of what my docker question

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.920
was about is like if i get a docker image am i going to get behind on sab like what

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:59.000
is that mechanism so the the ultimate goal would be for me to contribute this to upstream

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.940
the main project and for them to have their continuous integration system push it into

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:07.040
the store whenever there's a new release and so you would just do you would just do nothing

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.820
it would just update automatically in the back end um it's much like like my next cloud

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:18.280
box updated i didn't even realize it upgraded from next cloud 10 to next cloud 11 the snap

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.760
just updated in the background and i had no idea and it just carried on working i didn't

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:28.820
do anything so that's the kind of thing but it would need to be update um adopted by upstream

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:32.240
so they would push it to the store that's uh those applications are a good example of

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.080
something that's a bit of work it's not impossible but it is a bit of work and if you could have

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.960
snaps for it that's really nice it's a great idea that's exact and i signed up for a new

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:47.000
service just so that i could test it because i haven't touched these for a while so yeah

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.760
yeah yeah it's it's uh it is a pretty slick um you know it's a pretty slick setup once

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.180
you get everything all set up because essentially they're set and once they're once they're

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.640
configured and the programs you want to monitor or the movies you want to monitor are specified

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.680
you just kind of walk away and everything will find it'll automatically find the content

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.360
download the content extract it rename it to a naming convention you want and put it

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:17.360
in the folder you want so that way your media server sees it it's pretty it's it really

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.020
is nice i just got the push notification on my phone about chelsea manning's uh sentence

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:30.760
being the book commutes the book the book of the sentence yeah that's amazing that's

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:36.960
great wow well i i might try that out poppy that's that's really cool yeah gimme um i'll

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.980
try the others so now i've looked at sonar and do you say nzb get yeah nzb get which

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:45.400
is i guess you know after i talked about i got a note from a couple people like you should

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:48.940
try nzb get chris it's actually a lot better actually i am using it that's what i am using

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:55.800
now uh sabin zb just seems to be the one that has more traction all right well i'll i'll

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.160
do these and commit them upstream and see what they say but i mean it may well be they

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.240
say no because some some projects we've talked to say no no no we're not interested you know

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.560
if you want to put it in the store do it yourself and then you know i could set up a cron job

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.800
that will just grab the latest and push it to the store or something but it's entirely

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.680
up to them it's their project yeah they can yeah yeah i hope they i hope they take you

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:19.280
up on it so that would be that would be really great
