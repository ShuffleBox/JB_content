1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
The heck does this really mean Netflix at Netflix tweets to the 53 people who have watched A Christmas Prince

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
every day for the past 18 days who hurt you and

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,040
And then people are like Netflix. Why are you watching me and Netflix responds with well? We just care about you

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,560
We're just worried about you and like Netflix has been outing people's crazy watching habits over Twitter for the last couple of days

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Have you seen this? It's bizarre. I like it though. It is good. It's like it's funny

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,480
But then it's also a reminder how these hosted platforms are constantly monitoring everything we do and even when I like them

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,300
It's still a little gentle reminder every time you hit that play button. They know you're watching someone is silently judging you

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,220
My buddy, but I'm gonna be at the same time exactly exactly

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,080
My buddy got hit with it. They checked in on him

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,800
Really?

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah, he binge watched. I can't even remember what it was but nutshell he binge watched like eight

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,160
Seasons of something within like four days or and they're just like oh your patterns look different. Are you good?

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,080
You know what? I heard from somebody else

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,640
This is not the first time I've heard the story that and the person was legitimately depressed and they were in a funk and they watched

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,040
They watched like a whole bunch of shows back-to-back-to-back-to-back and Netflix support emailed them and asked them if they were okay Wow

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,320
Netflix is kind of a crazy company. That's really crazy

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,240
I mean, it's good that somebody cares right even if it's just some anonymous support person at Netflix. It's nice that somebody cares at the

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
Stock you right?

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,120
Like do they have like some sort of dashboard where they're like somebody's having a bad day like alert comes up

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,020
It's probably a piracy thing. It's probably like a somebody is downloading a whole bunch of content off our servers

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,360
Let's flag them and then they look at it go. No, it looks legit. They're just depressed. Yeah

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Oh, yeah, but that's their job. All they're doing now is watching Netflix. Oh, gosh

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
This is Linux unplugged episode

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,160
227 for December 12 2017

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,160
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,320
That is so fired up about today's episode it might just strike a little too close to home. My name is Chris

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,280
My name is Wes. Hello, mr. Wes today on the show. We're gonna tackle a few big topics

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,600
first we'll bust through some community news things you need to know about and

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm not gonna lie the system to you debate rages on still

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,880
This time you're never died

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Your humble hosts are taking a flamethrower to the idiots that won't stop this once and for all

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,560
We're going to take a flamethrower to this particular discussion and then let's get in to replacing YouTube

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's get in to replacing patreon. Let's get in to replacing Twitter. That's right on this week's episode

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
We're going to attack

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,340
centralized platforms and services and tell you how it's nearly

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,080
Within your grasp to replace all of these with p2p

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,440
Decentralized no single point of failure or control systems. The internet is falling apart

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,120
And there's been a couple of things that have happened just this last week

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,640
That honestly as a Linux user

40
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,080
Get a little like throw up in my throat, you know

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,640
Like we need to throw up a little bit and you gotta swallow it down. You're like, hmm. That was horrible

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah, that's how these things make me feel. I've been throwing up in my throat all week

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Okay, well proverbial not really the proverbial throw up in my throat

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,720
I'll tell you why and we'll bust through all of this and the solutions that are emerging that are all open source

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,240
They're all peer-to-peer and that are all decentralized. How about that?

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,020
So it's not quite there yet, but who better than Linux users to push this crap over the edge speaking of Linux users

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,620
Let's bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mobile room

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,280
Hello

49
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,920
Hey, oh, hey. Hey. Oh everybody. Thank you for joining me. I know everybody's busy as the

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Freaking holidays approach and I appreciate everybody taking a moment of their busy day to join us in the lug

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,560
It's nice. It just wouldn't be the same without you. It wouldn't the beards not here this week. I should mention lonely

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,480
We need you mumble room. He sends his regrets, but he's out on assignment assignment being moving. Yeah, which

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,460
Do not envy that rather be here. Do you remember dev one?

54
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:28,060
Yeah, yeah, the the Ubuntu fork or no the I'm sorry the Debian fork that doesn't have system D. No

55
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,500
System D in dev one and we've we've had some things here to there to say about dev one

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,620
But nobody's had something to say about dev one

57
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,220
like

58
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,420
The owner of a server hosting company not inside the US his name is Nico

59
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:50,100
I think is how you pronounce it doesn't write an ICO. I'm sorry Nico if I'm if I'm mispronouncing your name

60
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,020
and he takes to the internet this week to defend dev one and to

61
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,100
Silence the system D lovers once and for all with his empirical data his hard-learned evidence

62
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,340
And of course his links that are indisputable which would be all the studies that he references in his I'm sorry what?

63
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,580
Mm-hmm. He doesn't have any of those things. He doesn't have any any studies. Mm-hmm. This is all anecdotal evidence. Uh-huh

64
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,540
I'm just been informed that my producer says that we're good to go with the story. So here we go. We carry right

65
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,620
So I'll dig into some of the most important parts. So this is a defense of dev one. He opens up

66
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,260
He says I understand that some of you may think that dev one a fork of Debian is an infinite waste of resources

67
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,700
The problem is that you're small-minded and you don't understand how the world works you see because it's saving the world

68
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,360
It's saving resources and I'm gonna explain to you why and if you don't understand and disagree

69
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,100
Then you're just not obviously a server person. So they tried to build a data center light, you know

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,760
Like a thin compact study version of a data center on Debian and Ubuntu

71
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,600
But you see there's a fundamental problem with servers that run system D. They don't boot

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,940
they don't boot and they don't reboot and

73
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:14,180
System D resolve D that constantly interferes with core network configurations made it very expensive for them to run Debian or Ubuntu their words not mine

74
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,220
And while they're using flowery words, they say the reason to use dev one is the hard calculated costs

75
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,820
They're a small team and they simply don't have the time to fix problems caused by system D on a daily basis

76
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,740
Did you know that you're having problems with system D on a daily basis with the systems you run?

77
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,900
Did you know that every day? Did you know that? Yeah, I see

78
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,340
I was under the I was under the mistaken impression that all of my systems with system D have been running fine now for about

79
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
a year

80
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
That might just be you I'm an idiot

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,740
Their objective is to create a great easy-to-use platform for virtual machine hosting not to walk a fucking tightrope

82
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,540
So don't get it wrong. Okay, because I don't want to you want to walk a tightrope. That's a different business

83
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,220
That's somewhere else not in a day. That's where Debian's at. That's where Ubuntu is at not that type

84
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,540
Oh the devil in community creates infinite economic costs. Sure, but that's not their fault

85
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,300
Creating dev one is simply a counter reaction to ensure that Linux

86
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,100
remains stable

87
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,620
Which is of high importance to a lot of people because everybody in IT management

88
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:23,620
Everyone who's built a data center and anyone who's ever managed at a server is completely aware that if you can run a minority

89
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,820
Operating system that is tested by a very very few fraction of the users that doesn't have wide use in production

90
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,460
That's the definition of a production ready system. If you can have a system that only a couple handful of tens

91
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,180
maybe at most

92
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,420
15,000 users are using versus a system that's literally deployed by millions of users by the largest enterprise companies in the entire world

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,460
You don't want to use that system because their systems don't boot

94
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,920
see what you want to do is you want to stick with the esoteric fork that's only used by a very small minority of people who

95
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Aren't likely to bitch in the first place because it's confirmation bias and they don't want to validate confirmation bias

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
So you got to stick with that system

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Yeah, you read it, right dev one developers are creating stability. Think about it

98
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,560
If not for a few repeating system system debugs or the insecurity caused by a huge

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,820
monolithic piece of software running and Ruth root privileges then system do you be okay see what we much prefer are

100
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,140
tens of thousands of tiny programs that are no longer maintained that diffract our

101
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
vulnerability landscape across

102
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,340
Thousands of lines of entry points in code so you don't want to have one active project being maintained by the most important people in

103
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,780
The industry who have their entire revenue model on the line to make sure this thing works. That's the last thing you want

104
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,660
That's the last thing you want what you want

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,560
What you want to make sure you have on your data center servers is something that is no longer maintained

106
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,620
something that is done by thousands of different pieces of software instead of one maintained code base and

107
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,220
Something that's simply too large for one any one individual to fully understand

108
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,460
That's you got to have something like that when you run in production and system D

109
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,700
Not that

110
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
That's a problem. You see when you're running servers. You got to make sure

111
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,260
Keep it as diffracted keep it as just deferred as possible really the key thing there

112
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:20,020
And then and then you're getting as close to old Linux as possible and everybody's happy. There's no problems. It's not too complex

113
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,700
It's nothing like Windows and it's stable. Remember how much fun we had when we tried out slackware the other month. It was great

114
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah, old-school Linux with system D. The main advantages to use Linux

115
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,180
Are obsolete. So what is the importance of Devon?

116
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,340
it's not only crucial to Linux users, but to everyone running servers or rockets or

117
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,300
watches

118
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,140
Or anything that actually depends on a stable operating system

119
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
support to have one

120
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
support

121
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,380
That's

122
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,020
This is a this is the shit that we deal with and it's so funny because

123
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,140
You know what really people who care have switched to free BSD or another BS and another BSD like people that really care about system

124
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,260
D on their servers. They're just I'm working on gentoo right here, man. No, that's right. We got to talk about that

125
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,300
so, you know the thing that I guess what I'm coming back to here is

126
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,180
If you if you see this as they do then you need to reevaluate why you're in the industry and you need to think about the

127
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,700
Fact that you may be a risk to your business your personal stubborn views on the way computers should run

128
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,340
probably make you a risk not because you're even necessarily wrong about system D or the reason it was deployed or the fact that one

129
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,900
piece of code base is a singular target versus thousands of scattered applications

130
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:44,780
You could be right on all of that, but there's a fundamental fact of the network effect testing user testing and enterprise

131
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
deployment that makes system D

132
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,980
Inevitable if you want to run Linux in a major installation and anything that's actually production important in the next few years

133
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,860
If you're not on system D, you're not going to be on Linux and I I'm sorry

134
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm sorry, it's that way but it's time for you to either quit your job or switch to BSD

135
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,060
Not because you're wrong about system D. You might be right you might be right

136
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,260
But it's just for the same reason that I think man Jaro is a chicken shit reason to not use arch

137
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,060
It's literally the same thing, right?

138
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,820
But you see the whole thing that people like to pretend is great about man Jaro is that theoretically there's millions of users

139
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,940
Using man Jaro testing and the man Jaro makes arch, right? It is it you could only have that when you have

140
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
millions

141
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,540
Millions of users using your software and all the different esoteric edge cases that find bugs that have

142
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,260
Unprecedented load on the network stack or unprecedented load on the disk IO or attackers hitting this thing remotely over

143
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,540
From Iran over the internet like until you are in those positions with your software. You're not production ready

144
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,060
That's why you have something like ZFS and you have something like butter FS

145
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,060
There's clear differences in which one's production ready one has massive enterprise deployment where people are making millions of dollars off of product

146
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,660
A year and one has a few enthusiasts that are trying out and losing data, but it is made of butter

147
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:12,140
So there's that it is it is is a common thread that we see and I totally understand where they're coming from

148
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,420
And you know, it would be great. It would be great if using Linux was a better way to do it

149
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,300
It would be great if using Linux without system D was going to be a viable option

150
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,700
But if you're in production if you're accepting real internet connections if it's a customer facing environment

151
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,500
It's time to step up and learn how to use your computer

152
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,820
And in this case, it means learn how to use system D

153
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,740
All of your complaints you have in there about system D resolve D and all this stuff

154
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,140
It's you not knowing how to use your computer anymore

155
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,180
You are now one of those people that doesn't know how to use their computer and you're blaming it on system D

156
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,100
Think about that for a second

157
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,380
You're no better off than all of those users who blame something because they just simply don't know how to use it

158
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,820
That's you now

159
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,740
And if that's how that's maybe you're right, maybe you're right. I'm not saying you're not right. I'm saying go use something else now

160
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,860
Because you shouldn't be running some crazy ass fork like this that isn't being properly maintained

161
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,820
Okay, I'm almost done I'm just gonna wrap it up

162
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,860
The reason why system D was launched is because some of the things that system D replaced are no longer maintained by anyone

163
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,660
You understand that right you understand that

164
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,540
System D started not because they're like, hey, here's a random ass idea. Maybe we should just do X

165
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
It was because they were sitting around going well fuck

166
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,180
Nobody's maintaining these super important open source projects anymore and this stuff's falling behind. We got to do something

167
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
That's why system D came about

168
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,500
And when you understand that or that origin and then you look at people saying well don't let's not use system D

169
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
What they're saying is let's use software that's no longer maintained

170
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,620
That's dangerous people packaging it for your distribution your dev one or your gen two doesn't make it maintained

171
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,700
That just means it's packaged. There's a big difference there and you have to understand that if you're running servers in production

172
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
especially customer facing

173
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,140
You got some desktop. You got some laptop. You got some personal home machine. I don't care right doesn't make any difference

174
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,780
But if you're selling to customers and you got a responsibility here to keep these things secure and patched

175
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,940
That's how I feel about it for me

176
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,140
The biggest problem I had it was mostly tone like I'm not gonna say they can't run a production grade facility on this operating system

177
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
Maybe they're very skilled admins

178
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,940
Give it a go. Absolutely. And if this had been a case study in hey, look we tried out dev one

179
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,340
We it scaled super well. We had no, you know, here's a here's an example of how this really worked for us

180
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,340
And we're it's successful in production. I would not have a problem with that. That's right, right

181
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,380
But to imply that you can't do that with system or to say that

182
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,820
Servers with system d don't boot or reboot. Yeah, right that which which is just insane hyperbole

183
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,380
And maybe you did have problems that it's not like system d is perfect

184
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,540
No one is claiming that in a real discussion, right?

185
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,180
It's just and it's fine if you want to run something else and you can do it in a maintainable sustainable secure way fine

186
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,100
Talk about that. Let's make that the story. I would love to learn more about that

187
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,300
That's not where we're at

188
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,100
That's how I feel and then it just gets me all fired up and i'm like well

189
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,140
Now you're just digging your head down and being a turd about it. Yeah, exactly that article is

190
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,620
riddled

191
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,860
Riddled with confirmation bias. Yeah, he's accusing others of having confirmation bias. That's true too. Good point

192
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,220
um

193
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,580
Yeah, yeah anyways, uh, I just can't believe it, you know before the show started we were talking about uh,

194
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,380
The stuff in 2017 that's really left a mark on us and linux. Well, we're gonna talk about it more in a future episode

195
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,700
so we were just sort of brainstorming and

196
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,620
Looking, you know, you could almost flip it around say what kind of things can you just not believe?

197
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,980
We're not done talking about in 2017. Yes freaking system d

198
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,580
Right. I mean, oh my gosh. Yeah things that should have been over with in 2017. Yeah

199
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,820
Yeah, also things that should be over with is frivolous lawsuits and trademark disputes

200
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
So the software conservancy

201
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,460
Has a trademark dispute, uh put against them from the software freedom law center

202
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,540
We talked about this on a previous linux action news and on this show in the past

203
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,220
And now we have some additional clarifications by bradley kuhn the president of the software conservancy the the group

204
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,780
that has the trademark action being taken against them from the law center law center being run by even moglen and

205
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,340
the conservancy being run by bradley m kuhn and then you have the

206
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,860
Executive director karen sandler. I forget her exact title

207
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,500
Um, and they uh, they started a blog post that sort of blew this thing out into the public a couple of about a month

208
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,900
ago that they were being shut down by the law center for their for trademark infringement of their name, even though the law center

209
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
was their

210
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,340
Law council for seven years and helped establish the software conservancy. So it was pretty weird

211
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
and uh

212
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,820
What's happened now is they've actually filed their motion to have this entire case dismissed and as part of that

213
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,540
In this judgment motion, they've had to put it all out there. They have the full filing. I have it linked in the show notes

214
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,580
It's long. It's 120 pages and I read it this morning

215
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,300
Oh, and uh, i've never read um so much legalese in one sitting

216
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,180
I usually have to take it in spurts, but I wanted to get it all in before the show

217
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,380
It was uh, who that explains the gray hair, okay, oh I tell you and um

218
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,340
There's there is nothing that we didn't speculate in there it uh, if you read the conservancy's filings

219
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,580
you'll see various examples of personal vendettas between even and

220
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,900
Or evan and bradley and karen

221
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,420
There is bad blood there. I think would be a way you could put it and uh,

222
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,260
It's all laid out in the legal filing in a very matter of fact way

223
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,940
and um this software freedom law center

224
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,740
Which are the aggressors here have a history of complaining to the conservancy complaints about the organization's name

225
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,220
We're never among them though in the years that they have been complaining each time the

226
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,240
The conservancy took the complaint seriously and each time discovered that they were generally

227
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Just sort of over the top threats

228
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,520
And the conservancy says bradley specifically says I hesitated for years to talk publicly about this bad blood historically

229
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I concluded that you know

230
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Unilaterally exposing privately made specious claims interferes with the essential jobs of promoting and defending software freedom

231
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:15,040
Um, despite our differences the law center is a fellow charity and I have no wish for them to cease to exist

232
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
Only did they stop attacking us a year ago

233
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,440
Morgan publicly described certain gpl enforcement work to which I have contributed since the 90s as a jihad

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,120
I was offended because I have dedicated my life to non-violent principled activism for social justice causes

235
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Even so I did not likewise assail in response. I sought to keep the discussion about policy

236
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,240
And not her not her uh hyperbolic rhetoric

237
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,560
But on finally on a meta issue and this is the point that I tried to make last time we covered this story

238
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,620
I've seen a lot of stories blogs stories and comments on linux or on lwn.net

239
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
And other venues in the last few weeks about this matter

240
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
It seems to have burned more electricity and time than it warrants

241
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,840
I do appreciate the statements of support that so many of you have made but I have a request

242
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,520
While I understand that this kind of situation generates an intriguing distraction and seemingly endless discussion

243
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,460
I encourage those of you who are otherwise software freedom contributors to temper your time investment

244
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,120
Faced with the petition to cancel our trademark conservancy must defend ourselves before the trademark board

245
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,640
But I loathe the idea the time wasted damage of the law center's action may extend to other software freedom

246
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,180
Contributors and activities in particular. I ask those of you who are conservancy project volunteers to avoid distraction

247
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,940
by this

248
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,980
The work of the conservancy member projects in the work is the work that the software freedom law center's actions seek to impede

249
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,460
So, please don't allow them to break your focus and succeed even just for a little bit

250
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,340
I completely agree that I hate when all of this um

251
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,660
Lawyer stanky bullshit distracts from actually creating code. I hate it

252
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:03,380
And what I respect about bradley and karen is they haven't been airing their dirty laundry with the law center

253
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,420
When even's been contacting them saying hey, I don't think you're doing this right. Hey, I think you ripped off some of our material

254
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Hey, I don't think that's properly creative commons

255
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,460
Hey, and every time they have they've been pretty receptive and they haven't come out and said

256
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,300
Yeah, these guys over at the law center keep giving us a hard time

257
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,140
They've never done that until this came up and they clearly state

258
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,020
In their legal filing that they never received any kind of preemptive warning that this was coming. No tweet. No email

259
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,500
No text message no phone call, right?

260
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,660
They didn't receive any kind of preemptive warning of this trademark dispute that was heading their way

261
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,260
And they clearly think and they position it

262
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,860
so in their legal filing that this is a vendetta a personal vendetta and the conservancy is

263
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,900
Is taking the heat for what is a personal vendetta between the people running the conservancy and the people running the software law center freedom

264
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,180
Anyways, the names are hard to say. Yes, and um, it's kind of hard to watch because it is creating behind the scenes

265
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,820
I guess the meta story here is behind the scenes. There's a lot of connections

266
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,780
The software freedom law center has connections to the linux foundation

267
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,940
There's obvious contributors that have their software projects that are being managed by either of these entities

268
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,860
People that have worked with both these entities together when they were partners on a middle ground here

269
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,780
There's a lot and it's it's awkward because it's filled with landmines and it's one of these things when you read the headline

270
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,540
You're like, oh lawyers are making money and then you realize well, one of these is an umbrella organization

271
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,780
That is essentially home to about 30 open source projects. And if they shut down those open source projects are screwed

272
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,780
So there's real ramifications to projects that we all use and at the end of the day. We just want to see them do well

273
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:44,180
Oh, man, we can't have nice things. Let's just this is why we can't have nice things

274
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,260
Wes, this is why right here. It's really extremely frustrating. Let's distract ourselves with a little gen 2 challenge. Just open up the challenge

275
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,740
Fascinating

276
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,860
It's gen 2 challenge time. Wes. How you feeling about today's gen 2 challenge?

277
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,460
Oh boy feeling system d right out of my life. Are you uh, how's your kernel build going?

278
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,460
That's where we left off last week. Oh, it's finished now. We got a kernel. So now we're doing our bootloader

279
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,100
You're doing grub? What are you doing? What's where you at right now? What's going on?

280
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,900
Yeah, well, we're setting up we're setting up uh network some f-stab all that fun. Oh, yeah

281
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,300
Uh, then we'll do the bootloader and then maybe maybe a little later today

282
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,020
We're gonna see if this whole thing will reboot

283
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,940
Fascinating. All right. I look forward to it. We will check back in just a little bit the gen 2 challenge continues on

284
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,660
Yes, it does. This is week two. I think so

285
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,900
Oh wow, so I wonder if within within two episodes if you're gonna get a graphical environment now, I wonder I bet you'll get booting

286
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,580
Yeah, that's what I bet you won't get x until next week next week. We'll get some x

287
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,300
Then we're gonna try to get some remote screen caps going and all kinds of stuff. So that's gonna be good

288
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,380
That is really gonna be good. So, um bashful. You're not running gen 2, right? I mean you're not running system d right now. Are you uh,

289
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,380
How are you doing this? How are you pulling this magnificent feat of engineering off?

290
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,740
I don't know. I was making a joke. I said you're about to reboot gen 2 and I said not if it's running system

291
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Yeah, that's right. You can't you can't so

292
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,540
No, you can't or reboot eric or configure your network feature

293
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,420
I am using the wrong system then I know I have been for months. I'm an idiot. I didn't even know

294
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,700
And here I thought I was rebooting booting and having networking. I am such an idiot to me

295
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm, sorry guys. I apologize. Well wes you continue on the good work. We'll check back in with you

296
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,900
Uh towards the end of the show. We do have much much much to get into including some community news

297
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Let's take a moment and talk about the perfect holiday gift ting

298
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,780
Go to linux.ting.com support the show and get 25 off a device

299
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,360
or

300
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,820
25 in service credits and here's why I say that because if you bring a device that's the way to go

301
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,780
They got cdma and gsm. This is how I got into ting

302
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,580
You following me? See I brought over an old evo 4g cdma phone

303
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,060
I got 25 in ting credit when I did that

304
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,940
25 I was like, okay. I'll play with this. I'll play with this right? What's 25 gonna get me like 15 minutes

305
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,500
You know paid for more than my first month paid

306
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:04,900
Yeah

307
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,220
The average ting bill is just 23 dollars per phone per month because it's six dollars for the line

308
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:15,700
And then just your usage on top of that your minutes your messages and your megabytes and then whatever uncle sam's gonna cut

309
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,820
That's sort of unique to your area, but you just pay for what you use

310
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,580
It's a fair price however much you talk however much text or data you use nationwide coverage. No contracts

311
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:31,220
No determination fees linux.ting.com you're in control you get to see usage you get to take uh alerts

312
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,020
You can set like hey, i'm you've used 15 megabytes

313
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,380
Send alert or hey, you've used 20 gigabytes send an alert. You've used 15 messages

314
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,460
You've used 15 000 messages. Whatever is your mark you can start generating alerts for you

315
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,140
They have a great dashboard to manage all of it fantastic customer service and a ton of good devices

316
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm gonna give a shout out though to the motorola moto g5 s plus

317
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:01,620
Ting's got it in stock and you can get it unlocked no contract nor the termination fee pay for what you use

318
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,660
Not interrupting your experience if there's an update you get it

319
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
254 dollars from ting

320
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,720
Pay for what you use nice now the stock thing the thing the downside like the downside to the g5

321
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
To me isn't that big of a downside?

322
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,560
So it where they save their money on the g5 s is the storage it comes with 32 gigabytes of built-in storage

323
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,920
But you can put up to 128 gigabytes of additional storage with the micro sd slot

324
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,800
And one of my favorite things about this series of phone is it has the turbo power charging

325
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,120
So you can get up to six hours of power in 15 minutes when you plug your phone in

326
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,560
So like just driving somewhere you get six hours of battery life and and it has a 401 ppi screen

327
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
and gorilla glass 3

328
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,720
This is a serious. Oh and uh fingerprint unlock. This is a really nice phone with a really clean android experience

329
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
under

330
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,000
300 unlocked pay for what you use motorola gs g5 s plus

331
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,460
254 dollars when you go to linux.com because you're gonna take 25 off the device that'll knock it down from 280

332
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,820
You need a new phone. Maybe you think a little present for the holidays. This is perfect

333
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,300
The other thing is is well, I don't know why the trend is is going in the wrong direction

334
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,100
This has a physical button just one physical button to take you back to the home screen and has headphone jack

335
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,820
Which uh, so you got you got micro sd

336
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:31,300
401 ppi screen gorilla glass 3 and you get six hours of battery life in a 15 minute charge all metal design and a fingerprint unlock

337
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,020
For 254 dollars pay for what you use. This is a great phone

338
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,480
This is and or you just bring your own just start by going to linux.ting.com

339
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,680
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com

340
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Go there go there and check out the blog, too

341
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,540
I want to give a shout out to mail spring

342
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm I've installed it this week on all of my systems and if you remember Nileus, I know you turned me on Nileus

343
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,860
Yeah, so thank you to that because this is the continuation of Nileus. I'm yet to try it

344
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,140
But we've talked about it

345
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,380
Yeah

346
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,960
You and I have talked about it for weeks and a mail spring works with all IMAP providers works with the mail and a lot of the

347
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,620
other online ones the thing that's that's nice about mail spring is

348
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,820
First of all, they have a pretty decent Linux user base over 10,000 active Linux users

349
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,260
So it actually matters to the developer

350
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,340
I like that but the other thing that's really nice about it is they've just this week patched it up as a snap

351
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,220
So check this out. Hey, you know, we can see it

352
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,180
I don't they have a see if you go to their website right now if you go to mail suit go to their mail spring website

353
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,220
They're with you go to the mail spring website

354
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,840
I know you're in the middle of installing gentoo

355
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,780
but if you go to get mail spring comm and then you go to

356
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:49,320
Download mail spring and you click on the gunu slash Linux option. Their first option here is Linux auto updating snap

357
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,880
Yeah, wow, look at that. How great is that?

358
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,660
I've got the traditional dab and RPM if that's for you. Yes. Yes. Yes, they do

359
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,500
Yes, an arch over here. So right snap sounds great

360
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,220
Well, and so here's what's so nice about mail spring

361
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:06,100
If you're using Thunderbird and you've been looking for another a local email client

362
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,380
Give it a look because it's it works super well with multiple accounts

363
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:16,060
So that for me is a killer feature and it supports unified inbox for searches. I like that a lot now

364
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,460
I don't have experience with mail spring

365
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,580
But I assume this is similar to the way in the latest did but the real frickin creepy magic that I love is

366
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,620
The read receipts link tracking and more it's like genuine

367
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,640
It's read receipts if you could redo the way read receipts worked in 2017 and it I don't know how they do it

368
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,120
But it's great because it gives me push notifications when somebody's opened my email to my desktop and it uses the gnome

369
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,260
Notifications systems and so it integrates in with my desktop or in this case unity and it's a

370
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,700
Brilliant way to know right before somebody's gonna email me because everybody opens up their last email that they got from you before they send

371
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,660
You another email. Yeah, right

372
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,140
So I get a good 30 to 30 second to 15 minute heads up before I get an email and I can just sort of mentally

373
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,660
Prepare myself for it. It's got great shortcuts super nice search

374
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,180
and it's got a dark theme that looks good on on Linux and

375
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,580
It it'll tie in with like it'll look at people's like LinkedIn profiles and it has

376
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,420
Multiple theme support it has a pro version

377
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:23,020
And the reason I mentioned that is because it actually has a monetization strategy that isn't like advertising or tracking you I was about to

378
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,420
Say I think you do need the pro to get some of those things like link tracking and the quick reply templates

379
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,220
Which is also great for somebody gets a lot of emails, but like you said like it's nice to see this this open-source project

380
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,180
Yeah, they've got they've got some you know some long-term stuff going out. They can actually get some good revenue exactly

381
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,980
So Ben is one of the lead developers of the project and I invited Ben on the show next week if it works out for him

382
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,100
It's crazy with the holidays and all that but I just I want to talk to him and say hey

383
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,820
did you did you expect such a big Linux reaction and

384
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,720
Does it change the way you're developing this and why why build it in the technologies you have?

385
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,500
And why are you continuing this when there's something like Thunderbird out there? Why not just contribute to Thunderbird and

386
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,620
I've got I've got my

387
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,260
Assumptions to those answers, but I'd really like to hear Ben's absolutely and so I sent him an invite

388
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,540
He was gonna try to make it today

389
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,540
but he had something come up couldn't make it today because it was kind of a last-minute thing and

390
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,100
Might be able to make it next week really any time. Yeah, really excited. I've been using it now

391
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,440
I've got it installed on all of my systems, so I'll just keep using it to have more things to ask him about it

392
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,620
now

393
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,340
You know every now and then Wes the mainstream media tries to cover something. That's our wheelhouse

394
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,580
This is CNN breaking news, and they just really blow it they really

395
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,100
So

396
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,220
Afronaut Mark Shuttleworth has become a billionaire from his bet on Ubuntu Linux software according to Bloomberg and

397
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,580
They have one of these pictures of mark where if if you have if you've seen mark in the last few years

398
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Mark doesn't look a lot. I mean

399
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,860
Mark looks fine, but mark doesn't look like this anymore. This is an old picture, right?

400
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,500
So it's like always funny when people go to like ten years ago and get like these really old 2002

401
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,240
Like what I know so

402
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
spaceman mark shuttleworth

403
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,880
Was interviewed by Bloomberg not a boom to creator not canonical CEO. No no spaceman spaceman mark shuttleworth

404
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,540
Is that like where you've served in a political office once and then you get that title as an honorific forever?

405
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
What do you go to space?

406
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,620
I guess kind of cuz like how many people have gone to space it's a handful of people so yeah

407
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,380
So the headline on Bloomberg comm is literally

408
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,940
spaceman shuttleworth finds earthly riches with Ubuntu software

409
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
Not the editor's best day oh

410
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,620
man, so

411
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,060
Why why such a why such a ham-fisted headline and why Bloomberg why Bloomberg well?

412
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:52,140
This is a messaging piece you see kids. This is canonical positioning themselves for a little investment

413
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
This is mark

414
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,960
Communicating to the investment community. That's what Bloomberg's all about. They're all about the investment community

415
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,520
So it's been written for that audience, so I'm gonna read a little bit of it keep it in mind though

416
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,640
This isn't really for us. This is this is for the investing audience and

417
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:18,500
It's it's pretty bad, so they say he's best known for being the world's first afro not but since returning to earth from his

418
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,540
2002 trip on the Russian Soyuz TM 34 rocket ship

419
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:30,120
Cape Town native Mark Shuttleworth set about with the conquest of much more lucrative universe the Internet of Things as

420
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,700
If in 2002 the Internet of Things was even some stupid term we were using back all over the place

421
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,380
Shuttleworth created a boon to an open source Linux operating system that helps connect everything from drones to thermostats to the Internet his company

422
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,820
canonical group makes money from about

423
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,820
800 paying customers

424
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,320
Which is the first time we've ever gotten a number publicly including Netflix Tesla

425
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,980
Deutsche Telekom they all pay for support services, of course

426
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:05,200
They don't mention HP Dell, you know any of those know its success has helped boost the network his network marks net worth to

427
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,000
$1,000,000,000, but mark says it is destructive to focus on that

428
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,400
It's just a distraction and you have to keep your finger on what's the pulse for next now?

429
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
It's funny how they position this

430
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:25,740
So they use terms again, you have to keep the market audience in mind here they use terms that are

431
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,780
Rough so marks marks Shuttleworth in this interview, which is the sort of the pull quote is the industry term for this

432
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,060
He has a pull quote that is pretty good

433
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,340
He did a really good job actually and the pull quote is

434
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,980
Open source is defining innovation in

435
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,100
2017 and or today he says it is the defining innovation of today

436
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,220
It says he could went on to say that it gives me the luxury of being able to focus on things that I thought were

437
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,780
Really meaningful and interesting and deep open source software is deep

438
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,120
You have to get under the hood a little bit then you realize it's everywhere. It's defining innovation today

439
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,260
What do you think of that?

440
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:09,460
Because I think if you ask the average Bloomberg consumer who's defining innovation today, they'd say Apple or Google. Yeah, or Amazon

441
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
It'd be a big

442
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,920
proprietary company of some sort

443
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,900
But I think this actually while obvious gives you the insight to the layer that Mark Shuttleworth works on

444
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:27,280
Because mark knows because he's an intelligent man that all of these companies that are making their billions of dollars right now are doing it

445
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,960
Essentially on the backs of open source. Do you agree? Oh, yeah, absolutely, right?

446
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,020
I mean these are these are the underpinnings in the engine house of a lot of these companies, right?

447
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,060
And it's always this like where you see about that

448
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah, the big managed services the things that the everyday consumer uses you hear a lot about those

449
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,620
But you don't hear about back-end infrastructure, right?

450
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:50,540
So you've got Google obviously very very dependent on Linux for everything from their ad platform to Android

451
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,140
You've got Amazon the entire EC2 infrastructure and the echo infrastructure and all of the things that support their e-commerce infrastructure

452
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,140
Linux you've got Apple everything that's in iOS and macOS is

453
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,420
BSD based it comes from so many open source developed applications and libraries

454
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,420
But you also don't hear about it, but you know what their cloud runs a bunch on Linux servers. Yeah

455
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,920
Yeah, so I guess he's kind of right. And so this is the area where I think investors read this and they go

456
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,620
Oh, yeah, so this is what shell worth is working on. Oh, okay

457
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:28,260
Now they also talk about how shuttleworth started programming Ubuntu years ago and stuff like that

458
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,660
So it's it's pretty bad. Mm-hmm, but there is one other quote in here that I thought

459
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Well, what the hell does that mean?

460
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
And I kind of want to get the mumbles take on this

461
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:48,300
The vision for canonical is to provide the platform that you see everywhere other than the personal domain

462
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,100
Other than the personal domain we won't make a dent in phone or PCs

463
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,780
But pretty much your entire data center runs Linux and every other thing in the room is running Linux

464
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
What do you think of that bashful

465
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,940
I mean you're working on a Linux desktop distro right now and Mark says we won't make a dent in phones or PCs

466
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,780
Is he talking just investor speak there? Or do you think he actually believes it? I

467
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,980
Think it's a bit of both. He's looking at what's profitable which I mean running a business

468
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,780
You can't really blame them but where they're making their dollars and cents is not on you know, the desktop and things like that

469
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,780
it's all you know server support or

470
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:36,060
The data center stuff there kubernetes, you know all of that stuff's where they're pushing hard as a quote-unquote company

471
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,020
You know and even the snap initiative really drives

472
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:46,260
That as well, you know, it's like availability of software their snappy core stuff for the IOT the desktop

473
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:53,060
You know, they obviously haven't bailed on it, but it's not their focus as a company. They're still heralding it, you know being a

474
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,660
Curator of sorts if you think about it, but isn't isn't the server a PC?

475
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Well, is it no I suppose not in terms it is in terms of platform and you know architecture

476
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,340
But I suppose not in the way the market talks about a personal computer. Yeah, right. It's not a personal computer

477
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
because he all right said it's not like

478
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:19,100
The consumer front right? He didn't say PC is in servers and underlying infrastructure

479
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,420
He's just talking about like, you know what Apple's doing or even to a degree some of the other vendors

480
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,340
You mean those guys are out in front in your home? Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. That's good point

481
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,860
I wonder if there's any signal into maybe more of some savvy investors that have followed the company for a while and were perhaps

482
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,580
Worried about some of their direction. Is this you know, a little bit like hmm reassuring that like, you know

483
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,500
This is this is our new this is our focus trimmed. We're not gonna be silly. Yeah, we're not gonna be trying any more phones

484
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,900
We're not really pushing to compete with Windows or Mac OS. I want to hear so. Hey citizen

485
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,500
What is your take on Mark's on Mark's quote here? Is it disingenuous?

486
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,700
I don't know. Do you feel like I really don't know. I mean to me it feels a little disingenuous

487
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,340
I'm gonna be honest. It feels disingenuous to me. It feels like well

488
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,860
I have these staff members and I know what they're working on and I know what they're working on

489
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,100
and I know what they're working on and I have these contracts with Dell and

490
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
HP

491
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,740
Lenovo and others and I'm I'm making a pretty good profit off them, but I don't want to talk about it

492
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,500
Doesn't that give you pause a little bit? Mr. Citizen?

493
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,460
I mean to me it does just as just a slight degree

494
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,060
Like I'm a little worried that I've just sort of switched everything over to a bunch of desktop. Just a tad

495
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Should I know it's hard to know

496
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,860
Like what the agenda is? Yeah, if there's the audience something not being told right something is being told that maybe

497
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
May or may not be true, right? I

498
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,540
I I kind of sit back and go. Well, you're right from a revenue standpoint

499
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:49,180
You probably never will and there's probably no other company that's gonna get in on this game at this point. It's not like

500
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,060
Samson is not gonna come along and launch the Samsung desktop

501
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,260
The Chromebook is the closest we've gotten to cracking the desktop duopoly in decades

502
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,740
But we're also like you and I we're in a different position in that like you maybe aren't looking to the same extent

503
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,300
For like this complete like a Windows 10 style desktop

504
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,820
I think like as we've seen maybe with Fedora and Red Hat as a parallel

505
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:17,740
There is enough like I think incentive to maintain the developer or power user focused desktop just in terms of like I

506
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Want to use Ubuntu to develop Ubuntu

507
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,740
Yeah, fair enough and that's all part of your ecosystem, right?

508
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,260
It's all part of your eco, but it is not the big thing that you're really pushing to the market. Mm-hmm

509
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,580
Mm-hmm. Well speaking of ecosystems

510
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,860
Well speaking of ecosystems steam has made an adjustment that I think Linux users should be made aware of just so that way they can

511
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,340
Vote a little bit to get developers to support more Linux

512
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,100
Development you may be hurt. Yeah, so valve has made a change to the developer side of steam that actually gives them more information

513
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:52,820
It gives developers a breakdown of the different platforms that people are choosing when they add a game to their wish list

514
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,780
You know, you might think that this is a small

515
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,100
Change, but I happen to know from a Netflix developer that this is how Netflix science

516
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,780
multibillion-dollar

517
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,500
content deals is

518
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,180
they they actually look at what's in your wish list what's in your queue versus what you're watching and

519
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:18,740
If they have if they have tens of thousands of users that have a show or a movie in their wish list

520
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,400
They work way harder to get that content provider to license it for Netflix

521
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,960
steam

522
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
developers can now take the same tact

523
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,720
See now platforms that don't currently or games that don't currently support the Linux platform

524
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,120
will at least get a vote to let the developer know that hey, there's some interest here to get your port over to that platform that

525
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,120
might not be Windows and

526
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,520
You know, it's also gonna be the same for Mac users

527
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
But now when you add something you say I want the Linux version

528
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,800
They're gonna get that metric back which may actually end up in getting us a few more Linux games

529
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,640
Yeah, who knows but from the developer perspective, it's pretty hard to be motivated

530
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,080
If you just have a big question mark, right?

531
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,440
Like maybe you don't even use Linux you've heard about it

532
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,880
Maybe some people emailed you saying they want it but right I don't get a couple of tweets

533
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,380
What percentage is there really any revenue here? I don't know and it means as Linux users

534
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,000
We need to start adding this stuff to our wish list. Yes, right. That's the thing we can do and

535
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
And then maybe the developers

536
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,040
Will sneeze

537
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,280
Maybe they'll sneeze and then when they sneeze lucky and they'll make a game

538
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,740
Yeah, they'll actually hit the export option for Linux. Yes

539
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,040
I'm gonna give a quick mention for Linux fest Northwest 2018 April 28th through the 29th West and I'll be there with our pants on

540
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,800
I'm so excited and we invite you to be there with your pants on as well. It's gonna be a good Linux fest

541
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,160
19 freaking years of Linux fest. That's that's stupid. Hey boy Wow Wow Wow, that's really something, huh?

542
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,200
And rumor has it and I thought Linux was just a fad

543
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,560
Rumor has it that Alan Jew that free BSD love and Alan Jude might make it again

544
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm trying to talk a couple other people into making it out here a few of our other friends from other shows that we do

545
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,880
I like that trying to get that all worked out. We'll lay the peer pressure on them

546
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,440
Yeah, and we're also already discussing party options

547
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,800
So if you could make it out of Linux fest Northwest 2018, I highly encourage it and go to Linux fest Northwest org for more information

548
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,440
I'm giving them a little plug because we're gonna be there and we're doing something totally different this year

549
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,600
I hope it's gonna be good. But now that we're not doing last like it's our opportunity

550
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,400
Yep to totally refactor the way we do Linux fest even more reasons for you to come

551
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,640
I remember I there used to be a time West when I used to go to Linux fest before I actually did any shows

552
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,400
and I would sit there with my notebook and

553
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Sometimes Angela would come with me and she'd take notes, too

554
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,120
And then I would sit there and I would go back and I would do all the cool stuff

555
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,720
That I'd learned at Linux fest at work nice and then I sat down and I did all that stuff and I went shit

556
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,000
This is so awesome. I got to do a podcast about this and that's how we got last here

557
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,560
We are today so I let express Northwest has a real special heart a real special place in my heart

558
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,880
Also, I guess while I'm sharing all

559
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,240
one of the cool things about Linux fest Northwest for me is that it was I

560
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,200
Had a I had a I had a teacher in high school. Mr. Bassett

561
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:10,000
Who made some really cool open-source software by the way this guy he helped me get into Debian and he wrote some really great

562
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,480
open-source attendance management and grade management software and

563
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,880
He and I used to drive up to Linux fest Northwest when I was you know

564
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,200
20 years ago when Linux fest Northwest was brand new and I was a young pup

565
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,320
I I was I was out of school, but not by much back then Jesus. I'm old

566
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,840
And I would go with my old teacher my old high school teacher

567
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,800
We go to Linux fest Northwest. Yeah, and so then it's just over the years. It's it's it's it's it's really

568
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,600
I mean think about the number of people even if even counting people have only been there once or you know

569
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,000
But just especially having been there and seen people who've just kind of wandered in from the community or weren't that big into it or came

570
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,360
Down from the local or just trying out Linux. They've heard this thing or hey, there's some event going on here

571
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,620
What is this? What are all these people doing? It's really touched a huge number of people

572
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,040
Speaking of touching people let's go over and touch our servers a little bit of touching servers right now

573
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,620
Nothing's better than touching servers getting getting your hands-on experience with some open-source software and West

574
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,100
You hear right here, you know what I have right here. Well, you got secrets. I got fresh secrets

575
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,400
I've got pages and pages of secrets. You want me to share them with you?

576
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,600
Oh, please you otherwise I'll have to steal them after the show understood understood digital ocean calm you go over there and

577
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,480
Learn about all of the secrets use our promo code do unplugged do unplugged

578
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,060
It's one word you get a $10 credit at digital ocean comm you get started in less than 55 seconds and spin up a system

579
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,960
on their awesome

580
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,760
Infrastructure everything's SSDs. They got a buntu fedora centOS core OS

581
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:46,840
I mean, they probably have uncle Joe OS and they even have free BSD. They got block storage. They got object storage now

582
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,400
What's the difference? What's the difference? How would you describe the difference between block storage?

583
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,080
I guess I would describe block storage as hey

584
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,840
You know how you can hook up a storage device to your Linux box and it shows up as like a dev slash SD device

585
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,920
That's block storage

586
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,160
object storage

587
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,080
It sounds it sounds too meta, but I would describe it as programmable storage. Yeah, right

588
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,520
It's a it's a higher level of abstraction where instead of thinking about blocks and having to format a file system

589
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,400
Yes, you're just saying hey

590
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,440
I want this file

591
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,400
Put it somewhere and the back end just manages all that stuff and generates the storage for you puts it somewhere on all those

592
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,320
And then you can destroy you can set time expirations. It's great. They got team support if you're an open source group

593
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:31,080
Are you working by yourself and want to bring somebody else and eventually and everything is super fast networking 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors

594
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,120
Monitoring and metrics to tell you how things are doing load balancing as a service

595
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,400
Firewall at the network level and an API that is simple and easy to use with tons of open source applications

596
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,840
Love that API. It is nice and the nice thing about it so much stuff's already built around it, too

597
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,240
You just use it. There's a ton of apps use scripts. It's supported with a bunch of things

598
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,840
You know all the tools terraform vacant all the stuff. You're already using yeah, yeah

599
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,000
But when I'm sitting by the fire at night West, and I'm rocking in my chair and sipping on a little whiskey I think to myself

600
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,560
Nothing's like that dashboard. They got a dashboard for days. It's simple. It's easy to use it's fast

601
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,880
It works on your tablet. It works on your phone. It works on your web browser

602
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,320
I don't care what you use and they don't either and they got apps on top of it. It's

603
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,120
It's so nice. It is it is so damn nice

604
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,040
I am so appreciative that they have really done this well, and I think that their interface is actually an API client

605
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,280
I'm not positive about that

606
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,720
But it seems to it seems to be as soon as they added something to the API the interface has it as soon as they

607
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,600
Add something interface the API has it so I think they're super good UI is actually an API client

608
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:38,920
Which is it's all dog food mind-blowing digital ocean calm create your account use the promo code do unplugged and

609
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,720
Go look at a couple of their different tutorials right now

610
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,880
I like this one

611
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,440
I mentioned this on Kota radio recently how to create a highly available setup with heartbeat and floating IPs on a boom to 1604

612
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,360
LTS

613
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,820
That's boss level right there and in look at this guide like even if you're not a digital ocean customer

614
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,820
Just shut up and go over here. Look at this thing. Look at this freaking chart. Yeah this diagram with animations, dude

615
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,720
Oh, and then you notice when you click on it to get a bigger version of the animations

616
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,160
It doesn't like take over the full screen. It just pushes the content below down a little bit

617
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,800
So considerate look how nice that is like this is so well formatted that if you

618
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,600
Literally had no idea what failover and heartbeat was you could read this and understand it

619
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,680
And if you'd set it up before and just need a refresher, you could jump around and set it up. It's

620
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,360
It's it's freaking magic West. It just kind of brings a tear to me

621
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,540
I digital ocean calm go over there create your account do unplugged is the promo code you get the $10 credit

622
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:37,040
You can try out their $5 rig two months for free. It's magic. I assume

623
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,880
I don't know. There's no other way to explain it ponies and fairies

624
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,160
It's the only way digital ocean calm promo code do unplugged and maybe a little Linux and open source in there as well

625
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Maybe maybe

626
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,920
No devil on though. Let's talk about platforms. Um, I

627
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Actually

628
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,760
This this paper I was making noises with here earlier I printed my statement out actually

629
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,640
I got a printed statement for you West. I got a printed statement laid on me

630
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,680
Mmm, a couple of things have happened this week that have pushed this topic. I think to the front of my mind

631
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,600
It's all about platforms. It's all about commercial proprietary lockdown closed source pain in my ass platforms pain in your ass, too

632
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Audience, let's talk about it for a second. So this is this is on the backs of a new YouTube and Amazon and Google War

633
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,200
This is on the backs of big leaks coming out about YouTube

634
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,620
Demonetization policies and the way they walk people through it. It's all about platforms

635
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:46,400
It's about building the biggest platform with the most engaged users with the most control over what they can and can't do

636
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,640
YouTube is a

637
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,400
platform

638
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
iPhone iOS platform

639
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,440
Patreon is a platform Libre pay is also a platform

640
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:06,360
It feels like the walls on all of these platforms are closing in tighter and tighter than ever before it's and then you combine

641
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:14,160
The the weight of net neutrality on top of all this as if it's about to lock all of these new regimes in all

642
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
of these platform regimes into place

643
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,560
early Linux users watch this as Microsoft used the position of their platform the Windows desktop to keep

644
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,800
Linux off the desktop to keep Linux off of hardware and

645
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:34,560
Now these platform wars that used to be the defining thing about the technology industry the Microsoft platform war now

646
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:41,360
They happen every single day at an exponential rate across every tech category

647
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:47,560
Just just recently Google has started blocking YouTube on the echo shows

648
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Because Amazon doesn't sell nest cameras in Chromecast on amazon.com

649
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,680
So everybody who's bought a Amazon echo show to watch YouTube videos. Yeah, screw you too bad

650
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,800
It's always the users who lose on these platform wars

651
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,160
the creators the users and a large corporation they don't care

652
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,800
There there's no there's no cost to the collateral damage for them the collateral damage being the end users

653
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,680
And we're starting to see some cracks. I think in these platforms

654
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,360
There's a couple of open source solutions coming, but they're not quite there yet

655
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,960
So I want to talk about where which ones we do have where they're at and how we could start using them as linux users

656
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Now if you're watching the video version right now

657
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,200
You're going to see women bending over and showing their asses

658
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,560
You're going to see a guy's junk in tight underwear, and you're going to see an Asian woman showing her breasts

659
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:43,840
What not Chris's background? No, I know it's tempting not yet, but what it what it is is

660
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
the YouTube guide on

661
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:53,680
How people should decide how they should flag sex nudity or other controversial topics?

662
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:01,640
And it's all very fucking subjective what they consider inappropriate and these heroes of YouTube who are answering these things

663
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,280
And this is a real problem

664
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,760
It really shuts down speech and that's the antithesis of what open source is about so I want to look at

665
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,320
solutions that we can take on as a group

666
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
to get rid of these platforms

667
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,600
What can we start using in place of YouTube for example?

668
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,760
I mean, there's nothing quite locked in yet, but there are some options on the horizon

669
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,080
And I think for a moment here

670
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:31,400
I want to talk about peer tube which I'm pretty excited about it's a federated video streaming platform using bit torrent

671
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,520
directly in the web browser with web torrent and angular and

672
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,760
Its early days is definitely a work in progress, but if you think about it legitimately guys

673
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:49,280
We have zero chance of some other commercial company coming along and offering streaming alternatives that are commercially viable to YouTube

674
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,920
Or daily motion or vimeo. It's not going to happen

675
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,400
They can't it's just the peering agreements in place and net neutrality rules that are about to change a huge backers involved

676
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,080
The massive amount of money the corporate interest

677
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:09,520
One organization alone doesn't have enough money to pay the bandwidth and the storage for something like this

678
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,760
It has to be peer-to-peer the next replacement for Facebook and Twitter and YouTube have to be peer-to-peer and decentralized

679
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
so we have to get this working and

680
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,140
you need something like

681
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,560
peer tube which is using peer-to-peer software on the back end and

682
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,400
Web torrent makes all the stuff. They actually have a demo

683
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
I'll link to it in the show notes and

684
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,220
They have a github page, but you can go to peer tube dot cpy dot re and you can actually start to watch

685
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,120
Demos and it's pretty nice

686
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,400
So I'm watching right now a video on peer tube and it shows how many peers are seeding it shows me my quality

687
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,680
All of that and you've got comments down here just like you would on you actually I don't see comments

688
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,480
But you it looks just like YouTube and it's streaming over web torrent in my browser. I

689
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:06,200
Mean the nice things about this is that they don't get they don't get punished if somebody's video goes viral or somebody gets popular because

690
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,360
The more people watching the more people distributing so it's an obvious replacement and there could be something else that comes along

691
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,940
I'd like to hear the audience's recommendations, but peer tube seems like a pretty pretty good replacement for YouTube who is

692
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,700
They allow these creepy like

693
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,940
Elsa videos have you seen this stuff like spider-man has sex with Elsa kind of stuff meanwhile

694
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,980
BSD now and Linux action news on and ask Noah on a weekly basis get demonetized

695
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,320
We're pretty extreme over here on JV. Yeah, we're super extreme

696
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,900
But meanwhile spider-man can dry hump Elsa and it's totally fine

697
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:45,140
It can make millions of dollars, but just good old-fashioned fun. God forbid Alan's you'd talk about ZFS

698
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,640
And we can't have that he does get pretty excited. Yeah, he gets oh yeah

699
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,380
He gets really excited, but this week the real cluster bomb has been patreon they

700
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,860
Really pissed off a bunch of people they changed the way the fee structure worked

701
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,140
They essentially raised rates on all of our patrons

702
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:09,440
They communicate in a way that was slightly disingenuous and it caused of as one would expect an internet outrage mob

703
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,480
Seeking justice and I I mean I can't I can't even tell you how many times it was demanded that I give a response

704
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,280
Immediately to what patreon has done as I record this I checked a day ago

705
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,040
We've had 17 people cancel their patreon accounts

706
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,000
No longer supporting Jupiter broadcast Wow because of a change patreon has made nothing something completely out of my control and

707
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,440
Ultimately a change that gives the creators more money

708
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,680
But people are pissed because they they were already at the line

709
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,120
They couldn't really afford more and something just changed on them

710
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,440
Now one of the number one solutions that I have had suggested to me is Libre pay

711
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,400
Libre pay is a reoccurring donations platform

712
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,560
Now the thing with Libre pay is it suffers the same problem that Facebook and YouTube and patreon and

713
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Twitter all suffer

714
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,040
It's a centralized platform in fact in fact because of all the attention

715
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,400
They've been receiving recently it wasn't until today that I could even load their web page

716
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,960
Couldn't even people have been telling me demanding screaming at me all week to switch to Libre pay I couldn't even get

717
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,960
Ian dot Libre pay comm to load until today in fact

718
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,320
I wasn't even sure if it would load for this show so I could show it to you on the screen

719
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,840
That's how there's they just aren't there yet

720
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,640
It's a centralized server that is that is kicking out a few hundred bucks a month to creators

721
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,800
There's nothing that's fundamentally different here. They still have to go through the banking system

722
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,680
They still have to do clearing of credit card transactions

723
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:47,520
It suffers all of the same damn problems as a centralized platform. Yeah, the server codes open source

724
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,680
But it doesn't solve the problem right there's still this middleman between you and the people you don't have any control as long as they

725
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,960
Do what's in your interest okay?

726
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,720
But as we see yeah, that is not always the case and sure you know I'm some podcaster, but what about the developer of your?

727
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,280
Favorite file system. What about the developer of your favorite Linux desktop application? What about the creator of your favorite distribution?

728
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:16,480
How do we fund open source software in a world where a platform can make a change that pisses off a huge percentage of your?

729
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,360
Users and in a world where the internet is ready to go to mob justice mode in two seconds flat

730
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:30,360
They go from zero to mob justice in two seconds the one it takes one tweet one Facebook post

731
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:38,180
One link in IRC full mob justice mode so how can a content creator or an open source developer?

732
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,600
Secure reliable development. I mean holy shit am I glad I'm not Ikey-Dorty right now am I so glad

733
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,320
I'm not Ikey trying to develop the soulless project right now because people are pissed off about patreon

734
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:54,800
He just went full frickin time off of patreon and people are pulling off. Yeah, I think he's I think he's something like on late night

735
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,720
Linux I think he said he had 22 people cancel their subscriptions

736
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,160
That's stressful. That is true. Yeah, right absolutely

737
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:08,120
We've got to build in a way to prevent this problem because as long as one central authority has control over the platform

738
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,040
They're gonna make changes users don't like especially as patreon begins to get more profitable

739
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,760
They start looking at larger creators who have people that are maybe donating more money

740
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,080
Ten thousand dollars more a month the creators. That's their real. That's the sweet spot for them

741
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,600
Yes, there's less incentive to work with people that are supporting one or two creators

742
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:30,520
So everybody says go to Libre pay but Libre pay has some of the same limitations and essentially has the same fee structure as patreon

743
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,980
What do you do? Yeah? You know it's other contexts. We talk about like with these services

744
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah, you just like you know you know you might have to move and that works okay for the personal use base

745
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,440
But when you're trying to run a small business

746
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,000
Or you're trying to write an independent creator that kind of churn

747
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,800
And ruins it the only long-term solution. I can think is you have to get rid of a centralized platform a

748
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
central point of failure

749
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:01,200
And you see it's it's funny that we're having all these conversations about YouTube demonetization or YouTube censorship net neutrality

750
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,360
or

751
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:09,900
Twitter being shit all of these conversations are happening at once and there's another big conversation. That's happening right now

752
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,700
They may actually be giving us the answer to the Libre play problem

753
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,680
To the patreon problem to the PayPal problem to the credit card transaction processing problem

754
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,420
Like I could build my own system for Jupiter broadcasting

755
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,060
Donation page a subscription model and just get rid of patreon

756
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,820
You know have somebody write something that uses stripe for the back end with a custom page

757
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,500
And all of it is managed by us internally maybe even hire another person to actually stay on top of all that like Philip

758
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
DiPranco has

759
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:50,240
But I'm still using stripe, I'm still using a central clearinghouse and stripe is still trying to do batch processing with banks

760
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,460
I'm still

761
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,540
Stuck to a platform that doesn't have my best interests

762
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,520
Or my users best interests at heart

763
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:06,520
But for weeks and months and years we've been talking about something that solves this problem today, it's free

764
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
It's open source

765
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,080
It's available to anyone on the internet

766
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,120
It's cryptocurrency

767
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,880
See cryptocurrency solves this problem. There's no bank. There's no central clearinghouse. There's no processor

768
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,480
There's no middleman you have your cryptocurrency and you send it to your creator now

769
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,480
I know it's too early days for this to actually take off and replace patreon

770
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:33,360
But again, a lot of this stuff is so is peer tube this early days and we've all talked about Bitcoin

771
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,840
But not a lot of discussions been had on these shows about dash now dash just as an example

772
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,840
I'm not saying everybody should go buy dash

773
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:47,920
But dash is an example of something that one day could replace PayPal could replace patreon could replace Libra pay

774
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,600
And they've done a couple of things that are better than Bitcoin

775
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:59,160
You know, do you remember do you remember one of the cool things about Skype before Microsoft bought them was they had this really nice

776
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,840
Peer-to-peer network that the FBI bitched that they couldn't get access to. Yes, I do. That was a big deal back. Yeah

777
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,840
Yeah, right and then as the Skype network grew

778
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,480
You had this problem over the peer-to-peer network was so large that you didn't know who was online

779
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,920
You couldn't really coordinate at all. So then you had these master nodes develop

780
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,720
which was still part of the peer-to-peer network and then and then that was sort of

781
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,560
That would sort of be like the master repository of information Dash sort of launches with that concept

782
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,280
They call it a next-generation p2p network at dash at dash

783
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:35,080
Its core is a unique fully incentivized peer-to-peer network where miners are rewarded for securing the blockchain and

784
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:42,280
Masternodes are rewarded for validating storing and serving the blockchain to users now. What does that mean?

785
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,960
What does any of that shit mean? It means they have a

786
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Reliable fast transactions that don't have a huge transaction fee and a huge leg like Bitcoin and it's anonymous as shit

787
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,960
That's the thing masternodes represent a new layer of network servers that work in the highly secure cluster called

788
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,320
quorums to provide a variety of decentralized services like

789
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,960
instant transactions

790
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,960
privacy and self-governance and

791
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,640
Eliminating the threat of localization

792
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,760
Privacy and self-governance and eliminating the threat of low-cost network attacks

793
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,240
So this is an area. It's a self-governing

794
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,800
self-funding protocol

795
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,360
that's anonymous it had it solved some of the

796
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,640
Tracking problems that Bitcoin has it solved some of the transaction

797
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,320
validation problems that Bitcoin has and

798
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,080
Currently as we record this episode the dash coin is at eight hundred dollars a coin

799
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,640
So it's it's also a pretty high functioning high value crypto. Yeah last year

800
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,520
That was that was big money in the cryptocurrency game. It still is really it really is

801
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,120
It's open source. It's it's fully open source. It has a

802
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,980
masternode system for fast transactions

803
01:01:53,980 --> 01:02:01,300
And you could see how open source developers and content creators could potentially build a funding model around something like this

804
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,840
It's gonna have guys. I know some of you out there hate cryptocurrencies. It's gonna have to be something like this

805
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,120
It has to be because anytime you come back to a clearing house

806
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:15,680
Anytime you come back to the banks you end up with your PayPal your square your patreon situations every damn time

807
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,560
There's no way around it and in particular in some of these cases

808
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,720
You're you're uniquely tied to US institutions as well

809
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,080
Which for 30% of you out there listen to this show is not applicable to you, right?

810
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,700
And we've seen a ton of problems with like maybe there's different laws

811
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,600
You're developing open source that's legal in your country, but not in the US. There's all kinds of things. Jeez that could

812
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:41,080
Think about this for a second think about all of the talk recently about installing backdoors into encryption and secure protocols

813
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,760
right about how all of that could change when if you are a

814
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,040
open-source rogue developer making software that doesn't have backdoor encryption I

815
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,700
Could see the federal government pressuring PayPal to discontinue your donation. We have seen that with WikiLeaks. Yep

816
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,620
Once it becomes political, I mean all things are out the window and again

817
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:08,900
The idea of this segment here is how do we create something that's truly decentralized that it's platform-free

818
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:16,500
That if you were today to have all of the time in the world to build all these different like a peer tube system

819
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:22,140
And it and a dash power donation system. You could really divorce yourself from these

820
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:28,420
Information silos on the internet, but there's one last piece that I think is fairly important

821
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:34,220
Not a big fan of social networking, but I can't deny the value it is useful and

822
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,100
This is another area

823
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,840
Where we have a pretty hard lock right now with Twitter and Facebook now we all know about mastodon

824
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,300
It's the world's largest free open-source decentralized microblogging network

825
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:52,260
Where you can really build a custom community, so now we're talking peer-to-peer

826
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,380
Peer-to-peer torrent based YouTube

827
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,260
Now we're talking dash peer-to-peer

828
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,020
decentralized funding models and

829
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,740
Now mastodon peer-to-peer decentralized federated

830
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,740
microblogging for communities

831
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,700
All kinds of aspect or or maybe instead of mastodon if mastodons because it's not my thing

832
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,380
It's not my thing if mastodons not your thing. Maybe something like matrix

833
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:25,180
Rocket chat something like these where we have individual components now that are getting pretty damn good

834
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,180
I've come a long way. Yeah, especially

835
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:35,060
Mastodon and matrix and rocket chat they could truly replace slack and Twitter and Facebook and Skype

836
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,680
Decentralized federated ready to go

837
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,860
open-source code

838
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,940
Nobody owns it. These components are coming together

839
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,780
Cryptocurrencies play a piece in this

840
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:53,040
Mastodon plays a piece in this web torrents and peer tube could play a piece. I don't know if a peer tube is gonna be it

841
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,940
But surely some of you thought around sat around and gone what the hell is it gonna take to

842
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:06,600
To replace Facebook. What's it gonna take to myspace Facebook? What's it gonna take to replace YouTube?

843
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,140
What's it gonna take to replace Google Docs?

844
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,780
it

845
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:16,540
seems like an in track like when we at the heart when Windows 98 second edition released and

846
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,380
Windows 2000 released I

847
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:26,500
Couldn't foresee a world where the entire industry wasn't completely dominated by Microsoft. Yeah, that was the future then

848
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,660
It was impossible to see it because Microsoft owned the entire landscape at that moment

849
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,340
That's what serious people did to get work done. Yes to make money

850
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:40,620
We're at the we're at the same point now where there's these open-source initiatives these p2p initiatives these decentralized initiatives

851
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,420
That are making cracks in these platforms

852
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,100
Nobody's giving you one solution that ties it all together

853
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:52,620
Nobody's just gonna give you a package where you can go create an account and link it with your Facebook account and get going

854
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,300
It's not there yet

855
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,500
But if you know how to spin up a few servers, you know how to set up a few systems

856
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,100
You could replace a lot of these information empires now with open-source software

857
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,940
I and I I don't know if it's yeah

858
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,620
I don't think any of it's quite there for JB because the the core problem

859
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:12,060
With people that are creating a lot of content or people that are writing a lot of code and open-source is

860
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,140
That's what you have time for that's what you have passion for and that's what you have time for

861
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,980
You don't have time to go build this stuff at the end of the day. We've tried to use matrix

862
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,900
We ended up back on slack

863
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
Because we don't have time to run matrix

864
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:30,460
But I feel good that it's close like it's so close that I could almost taste it

865
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:34,820
Like I could almost launch a podcasting network based on these technologies today

866
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,860
Almost and get somewhere with it. I wonder too does that open any room for you know small businesses, right?

867
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,540
Can you could you have a local IT firm that runs it for you?

868
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:46,660
But then you still have the option should they go out of business or whatever else

869
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,860
You could you could take that infrastructure and bring it in-house if you absolutely need I can't I can't say who but I was just

870
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,460
talking to a commercial

871
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:59,340
Company that wants to go they want to take something they've been developing for 20 years and they want to make it open source

872
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:03,500
And it's they're trying to avoid the whole throw it over the wall and now all of a sudden

873
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:10,220
Here's a huge open source code dump right because they want people to actually engage with them and improve it and maintain it and so

874
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,740
They're there at this stage right now like how do we build a community around this in a way?

875
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,980
That's genuine that gets them engaged that isn't tied to these these platforms people can just pull the rug out from underneath us

876
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,300
This is conversations. I've been having with them, and I'll talk about more when they go public

877
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,740
But it's it's a real problem, and it's something I've been thinking about in the context of Jupiter broadcasting recently

878
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,540
especially with all the patreon stuff going on

879
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,920
I'd really like to hear what the audience thinks is best what works best for them out of these solutions

880
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,140
We talked about right because that they're the other really important half of this whole puzzle totally

881
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,220
That's the whole point of this is that we don't want middlemen

882
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,580
We can't have these these kinds of fluctuations that really hurt the communication and the relationship between us and the audience

883
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,300
I want to build a business and I want to sit down here

884
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,140
And I want to work and I want to make shows and I don't want to be sitting here worrying about jumping funding

885
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,460
Platforms every two years or that just is not sustainable. It's dangerous

886
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:02,620
It's risky and that's in the way of you making making this awesome content at the same time

887
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,620
I got to be where the audience is

888
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,180
and I

889
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:11,060
The none of these answer the whole network effect problem other than perhaps people just understand

890
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,380
This is the way things have to go, but boy Wes

891
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,060
Look at this stuff. You know peer tube and whatnot. I am very excited about the future

892
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,380
It's not quite there yet

893
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:24,580
But geez if I'm not gonna be watching it every single week to see where it gets right and there are a lot of issues

894
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:29,980
as you as you just pointed out right that there's not that level of polish that level of integration the level of

895
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:34,300
Constantly everything wants you to use this account. It's tied in everywhere. If you have it, it's easy, right?

896
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,020
Or it's apps on every device, etc

897
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:40,540
There are a lot of those blockers and sometimes especially running a business. Those are enough where you're just like

898
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,660
I don't have time for this. It's not important enough

899
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,660
But a lot of those are ultimately I think surmountable problem

900
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:51,260
It doesn't isn't that and isn't that why it also has to start with the technical elite the the open source crowd like it

901
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:58,660
Needs some early adopters to start shaving down these rough edges and making this shit usable and productizable

902
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,220
like somebody has to do where we need to do better as a

903
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:08,580
Technological elite doing better interface with with people in design and we've talked about some of this on this show and other shows on the

904
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:16,060
Network, but bringing those people in, you know an open source version of a of the whole product manager design UX UI consultant

905
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,360
And so we can have this start with yes

906
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,860
It works for the technological elite something that ultimately can be palatable to to everyone

907
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,180
What do you think bashful is the network effect too much to get over?

908
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,720
You know cuz if if I build these things, it doesn't actually mean anybody will come

909
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,820
Well, that's always gonna be the challenge

910
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:37,800
I mean look at the same thing like even with the chat program if you break it down like unless your people are there

911
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,540
You're not going anywhere. So something something it's a chicken and egg. Something's got to be there first

912
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:47,260
That's gonna draw people over there whether it's people whether it's content. Maybe it's exclusivity

913
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:53,460
I mean a little hard to tell right I agree and and Eric the IT guy you were pointing out that yeah

914
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,700
This is all good. But then once you do all of this now, you're maintaining servers

915
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,740
You're like next cloud like if I go set up next cloud

916
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,820
I'm maintaining next cloud instead of just using Dropbox and that's that's a that's a split of my focus, isn't it?

917
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:08,700
Right and and I'm really torn on this particular issue

918
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,620
Because I've spent the last year separating myself from the from the Apple

919
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:19,220
The Apple walled garden. I've given up iCloud Drive and moved to next cloud

920
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,220
That's that's all well and good for myself

921
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,500
But what about what about my spouse who is right tied?

922
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:30,140
Very very concretely to her to our iOS and to our macOS devices

923
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,420
much less the rest of my family who are very tech illiterate and

924
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:40,580
And so do I just start walking over to them and animal Linux laptop with next cloud

925
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,100
And become like the IT guy for the whole family. You may have to be the admin and you're not getting paid for this

926
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,980
Yeah, that's a great point. And the thing is they don't have your moral convictions or your motivations, right?

927
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:55,140
So while they care about their technology working well, and they care about having power over it, you know

928
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,380
They just want their shit to work. Can I cast beer tube to my TV in the living room? It's time to watch TV

929
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,820
exactly exactly and

930
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,500
You're completely right

931
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,780
is it you sort of take the burden on as the as the advocate and that's why I feel like

932
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:14,620
Some places will be able to be early at like Jupiter broadcasting can be an early adopter of this before say

933
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:21,380
PewDiePie or some other large youtuber can because they're sort of tied down by the popularity of their YouTube platform

934
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,380
Where we have a technical audience

935
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:29,340
We've always just you viewed YouTube as one of the many publishing platform not our only publishing platform

936
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:35,620
Like maybe Linus tech tips does you know, they were they're all in on YouTube. We're like, yeah, we'll send our videos there

937
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:41,100
But really we're all in on our RSS doesn't define go subscribe to the RSS if you want the canonical versions of our show

938
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,060
without getting censored

939
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,720
But we'll publish we'll publish there because they got apps for days

940
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,620
They got every single platform if you got shitty balance situations like I do

941
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:55,020
YouTube's one of the few things that actually works like there's reasons to be there, right?

942
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,020
But yeah, it's really hard to sell it unless people understand the technical reasons

943
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,740
So Eric I take your point completely because it would be

944
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:05,540
Essentially our job to make all that happen

945
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:12,460
And then you have the fact that really it's a huge overhead for all of the projects or other content creators

946
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,460
It's it's not an easy solution yet

947
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,140
Do you have any follow-up thoughts Eric before we move on?

948
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:26,340
Well, I mean my family I could pull it off with but what about my neighbors and what about their family someone who doesn't have

949
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:30,140
An open-source enthusiast like a lot of us here at JB. Yeah, I

950
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,140
I don't know

951
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:38,180
Maybe they're unsavable just like the normals won't use encryption ever unless it's done for them automatically

952
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,620
I don't know. I wonder if there's any room for like

953
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,580
Local government or like small community run services, especially in some sort of mesh system, right?

954
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:52,520
You know your your community association perhaps has a few of these services maybe just for intra community communication

955
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:59,320
But possibly providing more, you know more actual services wouldn't that be something like a like a community mesh network? Yeah

956
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:05,260
I like that that connects out to a greater Internet at that point potentially to like retrieve other broader things

957
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,860
Yeah, and maybe maybe you pay a little bit

958
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,180
Maybe you've hired a local admin to help keep everything running

959
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:09,960
I don't know

960
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,500
I feel like I want to punt to the audience and ask them what they think about

961
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:18,220
solutions to replace these information silos these proprietary platforms and

962
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,580
What do you think about?

963
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,400
Linux users brunting this a little bit

964
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,000
you know like

965
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,980
You've got to go to a special website. Maybe you got to go create a mastodon account

966
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:34,540
Um, and I don't know not a big mastodon fan, but you know what I'm saying?

967
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,620
Like just from like a from a theoretical standpoint

968
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:42,620
should we should we be the ones to brunt this to help the rest of the web or

969
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,340
Do should we just get to sit back and enjoy just like everybody else?

970
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,260
Like why does that to be our fucking job? Why does it gotta be us that does this?

971
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:54,620
Why is it our burden that you know, I'm not Batman. I'd answer you but I'm busy watching YouTube over here

972
01:13:54,620 --> 01:14:00,980
Haha liar you're busy building gentoo right now. Actually, mr. West. Why don't we do a little gentoo checking?

973
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,180
How is it going over there got a thumbs up or a thumbs down right now? What are you thinking?

974
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,660
Well, it's going pretty well right now

975
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:09,420
We're emerging XFS frogs because I know how much you love XFS

976
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:14,260
I do but I couldn't build this thing on ext4 with you around. I mean, I would quietly judge you

977
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,200
I mean, I don't know if I would have vocalized it. I would have seen the look in your eyes

978
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:23,380
So we're doing that then we're gonna get some bootloading going and then later we're gonna see will it come back online?

979
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:28,140
All right, that's pretty good. So is that what I'm hearing in the back right now is XFS building. Oh, yeah, absolutely

980
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:34,060
It's nice. I didn't realize that if you output the terminal to the sound card, we could actually hear it right there

981
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,900
Yeah, that's nice. Wes. I think I could fall asleep to this

982
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,540
West building software you wake up. You feel really productive

983
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,700
All right, well speaking of feeling really productive

984
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:49,740

990
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:13,460
They got real human beings that are happy to help you and answer your questions. They'll spin up cloud servers on demand

991
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,420
They'll match the distribution you've chosen for your courseware. You're busy

992
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:22,300
I understand that and they got course schedulers for that and they got learning paths to go in deep right on a specific

993
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,300
like a series of content

994
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,300
Time to get up to speed on open stack

995
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,820
Let's say just as an example

996
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,400
They got learning paths that will do that for you

997
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,380
You you got you got a couple of days to get up to speed they got that for you

998
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:41,780
They got certification training if that's what your goal and they have practice exams and quizzes to help you get ready for all of that

999
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:45,700
so when you go in to take the big test, you kind of feel like it's old hat and

1000
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:49,020
That's invaluable. They also have nuggets. We're

1001

Thank you to Lynx Academy and as we record this here episode just two hours ago. They have announced new courseware

1019
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,380
They're always adding new courseware you constantly getting value out of the subscription

1020
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:07,340
but they've just added a whole bunch of new stuff on AWS on

1021
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:16,420
Serverless applications all of that stuff, so if you're hearing that stuff thrown around a lot definitely go check out Linux Academy Linux Academy comm

1022
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:23,180
Unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program so mr.

1023
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,180
Wes as we sit here today

1024
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:29,820
Many many of people have asked us about gentoo so it's time for us to do a little gentoo

1025
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,080
And we've been covering gentoo now for weeks on the show

1026
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:39,360
Building up to it some people thought it would never happen, but I'm happy to report for the last two weeks now going on three weeks

1027
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,280
Mr.. Wes Payne has been building a gentoo install

1028
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,780
And we've been checking in on that gentoo install now

1029
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,520
So mr.. Wes

1030
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,160
That's me

1031
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:58,400
Last week we decided going on sway this week you've decided on XFS oh

1032
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,480
Oh also last week you picked your kernel build options as well damn

1033
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,960
This is going pretty good kinds of fun unique options here, so what is next on your horizon?

1034
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,400
So you did a stage three install let's recap so you did a stage three install after we decide well

1035
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,400
What's the audience most likely to do so you did a stage three?

1036
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,240
Which is all pretty good, so what's next after we get XFS built?

1037
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:23,860
After that we're gonna make sure that it actually reboots. That'll be that's a that's a big step right there really

1038
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,760
Really, you know you never know I've been running it from the install environment

1039
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,360
So we've been a little privileged in that respect

1040
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,960
I'm pretty confident will I think the kernels pretty nice

1041
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,600
So it should just come right up a little mount all the file system now

1042
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,120
Have you have you done gentoo install before or is this your first is this your first year on the show?

1043
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,280
I wasn't like one not my first ever

1044
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:48,720
But the last time was probably like six years ago, and I was also building it to run on a Wii

1045
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:53,280
So it was a little bit different. I'm sorry what yeah, I'm so it was a little bit of a different environment

1046
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,680
Let me check up back checking here

1047
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,280
I

1048
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,240
Yeah, I just got a note from my producers here

1049
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,360
You can't install Linux on a Wii so turns out you can what that's right you put gentoo on it

1050
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,280
Yeah, and it worked super well. What did you do?

1051
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,480
We just like hooked up to the whole at the time

1052
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,800
I didn't have like a really good up it

1053
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,440
This is before like the Raspberry Pi was super popular or anything like that

1054
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,840
So it wasn't a great like streaming option

1055
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,760
But I got into that I installed M player and I could just like stream stuff right to it playing all around my house

1056
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,960
You it was awesome to see just a to the Nintendo. We did it have internal storage. You could write to like you got axe

1057
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,240
Like so you could put an SD card and and you're using this to watch videos on your TV watch

1058
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,840
Yeah, watch some videos play a lot of audio play live streams from the Internet

1059
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,000
Okay, I just I'm having a hard time understanding the use case where somebody goes to themselves

1060
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,720
Hey, you know what?

1061
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:47,480
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a Wii and I'm gonna put Linux on this thing and then I'm gonna use MPV

1062
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,560
To watch videos when you could just get a Roku or something like I just was before those days

1063
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,960
I mean, all right, it was maybe pretty primitive and I had an additional Wii sitting around so

1064
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:06,240
So I've never done like a full traditional PC based gentoo install. So it's been actually a lot of a lot of fun

1065
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,240
I gotta say I've been walking through the handbook

1066
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,920
It's really quite nice. I'm used to the a little more barren version of like the arch wiki style

1067
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,180
I've also installed oh, yeah thousand times. So I'm pretty familiar gentoo wiki does feel a little more verbose

1068
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,820
Yeah, it's not a bad thing. They've got they've got some it's a little harder for the like

1069
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,760
Hundred-foot view over you like quick like I know what this what's the key that I really need?

1070
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,120
Cuz I don't need to like I'm not configuring this one for all I can emerge plenty of stuff later

1071
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:38,240
If I need to I just want to know like what do I need? Yeah, there's a lot of really well commented configuration files

1072
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,360
There's obviously a lot of hair has been put into this in certain terms of just getting you start

1073
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,040
There's a lot. I think I still need to learn

1074
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,040
I'm excited to have the system around to play with it

1075
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,280
But so far it's been a pretty good experience

1076
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:52,480
Hmm, especially considering that I'm doing this while also trying to do the show now

1077
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,280
Have you there is a configuration file like the central configuration file in a jet in a gentoo install

1078
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,480
Which I don't remember if you get to at a stage three where you go in there and you add your use flags

1079
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,920
Oh, yeah. Have you done this already? Yes. I didn't configure them too much at this time

1080
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,280
I was trying to keep it pretty simple. Yeah, that is kind of like the

1081
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,960
the

1082
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,760
Maybe the best thing about you is it?

1083
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,160
Yeah

1084
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:19,400
After this thing is a little work because because you can put a couple things in there that everything you build on your system

1085
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,780
follows

1086
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:25,080
those build rules so maybe it's like certain optimizations for your processor or

1087
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,640
Your video card or or multiple cores or whatever it could be right?

1088
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,960
And then you add all that in there and then everything you build gets a slight

1089
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:41,820
Advantage just a little advantage and the idea is, you know, you do it for all of the things on the system from the

1090
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:45,920
most basic tools all the way up to your graphical environment and

1091
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,680
Every time maybe you get like a two to five percent edge

1092
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,680
You can actually target the architecture instruction set that you're actually running on

1093
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:53,880
Yeah

1094
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,760
and you get all that flexibility where like maybe you don't like that they've

1095
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,720
Configured this software with all the optional dependencies or maybe right, right, right

1096
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,040
You can start to choose those things like I really like this lean and mean or I like it really fat

1097
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,960
so that's the thing about

1098
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,960
Linux distributions, right is they're built for

1099
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,200
they're built for an Intel 64-bit compatible system and that's sort of the

1100
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,880
overall

1101
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,200
Large target that they go for but in Gentoo you can say well, yeah

1102
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:25,360
but I have this specific version of Intel processor with these specific features and I want you to build optimally for that or

1103
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:32,220
Or or close to it and some people believe it makes a big difference overall in your performance because every little thing has that edge

1104
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,640
I don't know if it's true or not, you know in my experience

1105
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,840
You almost don't notice it

1106
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,960
But one of the things that brought me to Gentoo early on and the reason why I ended up putting on a ton of servers

1107
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,960
Even though it doesn't seem like a good server OS

1108
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,940
Is those those use flags and those build time options?

1109
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,960
Allowed me to install versions of Samba and cups

1110
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,960
They could do stuff that none of the other distributions could do at the time. And so there is a place for that with Gentoo

1111
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:01,560
So I'll be really curious to see maybe we'll talk about that more like a future episode when you've gotten a little bit further down

1112
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,800
The road right and there's more things that you know, especially when you're getting your graphical environment applications

1113
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,440
That's really where it matters. There's the basic command line tools like how fast can they be?

1114
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,800
I will say that that's your point though

1115
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,100
Like, you know, it may not be it's not the server OS that you'd want to run just like hey

1116
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:20,680
I'm running a server but but if you're a large organization or you have very specific needs or you're targeting specific hardware

1117
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:28,320
It gives you this middle ground of control between I'm rolling my own full distribution and using whatever they've provided right you have this

1118
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:33,840
Ability that for some people is like is the right choice and it does kind of feel like your OS when you're all done

1119
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,000
Like cuz it's you know, like it's been built. Oh, yeah, that's right

1120
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,960
It's been built with this in mind because I always wanted to build with this

1121
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,280
Sorry, and if you're doing it on the server, you can probably also have you know

1122
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:47,360
Build farms and other things you can produce one big tarball artifact that gets pushed to server. So there's a lot of options

1123
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,840
Yeah, sure. All right, Wes. Well, it's been good to follow bringing back the old memories

1124
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,360
the day is when I

1125
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,440
actually bought

1126
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:03,280
Two Apple excerpts. Did you ever see the Apple excerpt? Yeah, you know about the Apple excerpt really actually

1127
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,520
Oh my gosh, nobody knows about the Apple excerpt

1128
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,680
I swear cuz they don't you know, they they didn't sell a lot and they don't make them anymore

1129
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,880
No, but the cool got right out of that market

1130
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,760
So in full disclosure, I came into I came into a shop that had two of these rigs

1131
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,200
and

1132
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,000
They were neat

1133
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,520
It was right when Apple switched over to Intel and one of the cool things that gen 2 supported about the Apple excerpt

1134
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,160
Was the CPU of meters right on the front? Did you do you see these?

1135
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,320
Did you ever actually see Apple excerpts in production? No, I've used them at SSH to them

1136
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,640
I didn't actually get to see him wrecked

1137
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:34,880
well

1138
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,280
okay

1139
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:40,360
so one of the great things about the Apple excerpts and I wish more servers would do this today because

1140
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,600
Go figure Apple did it is they had on the front LED indicators

1141
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,320
of

1142
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:52,480
CPU load so you could look just at your rack and see how hard all of your yeah

1143
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,440
And then they had this disk called the XServe raid

1144
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:00,520
Which you could manage the raid at a hardware level and then they would just show up to the operating system

1145
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:06,800
Linux included and so I walk in there and they had they had two XServes and an x-ray and the x-ray

1146
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:11,280
Also had a CPU meter on so you could see how hard your disks were working. That's awesome

1147
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,920
And I walked in there and I saw one day I saw these silver Apple servers in Iraq and I was like, what the fuck?

1148
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:21,560
Yeah, I see these little LED lights bouncing and I'm like what is going on?

1149
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,560
And of course they were crashing like crazy because they were running

1150
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,760
Something called Mac OS 10 never heard of it

1151
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,040
but I put Linux on there and I put gen 2 on there and it supported the LED indicators and

1152
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,600
Boy, did they start they stopped having problems and then I attached the x-rayed storage. It was pretty pretty neat actually

1153
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,680
I I went in thinking there's no way in hell

1154
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,920
I'm gonna get gen 2 working on this custom-ass Apple hardware and

1155
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,640
Sure enough it was it ran for three years in production

1156
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,400
I wish I had done that because because mine was running OS X and I was at the time I was writing C programs to run

1157
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:58,240
Like physics simulations and I had to like really carefully recompile them or get them ready because I was developing on Linux

1158
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,160
Yeah, of course. That's awesome. Yeah, it was pretty great

1159
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,440
It was pretty great because they were ready to toss these

1160
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,360
Machines out because the max just kept failing and the XServes were decently built to like

1161
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:14,120
One of the things that was it was kind of nice about them back in the day was that they they have these removable storage

1162
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,720
Drives that were actually pretty convenient now. This is pretty common stuff, but it was kind of nice back then

1163
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:24,560
Yeah, and so to be able to put gen 2 on them such gen 2 and then I believe I had 700 users

1164
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:31,180
That were printing daily at least sometimes multiple often often multiple times a day

1165
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:37,280
Through these two XServe printers or servers running gen 2 as CUPS servers

1166
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:43,880
just so these two XServes running gen 2 would run CUPS and Samba and they would provide all

1167
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,160
of the printing services to a

1168
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:51,800
700 user bank and every time you came in and you got it like a balance statement or you made a deposit and they gave

1169
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,040
You a receipt or anything like that?

1170
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:00,080
It was all being generated through these Apple XServes running gen 2 for a bank

1171
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,680
That's fast and it was one of those things where they would

1172
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:08,520
They would have customers that were sitting there waiting for the printouts and the printouts weren't coming. Oh, I'm sorry ma'am, you know

1173
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,920
Maybe if you come back tomorrow, we can give you a printout like stuff

1174
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,340
You just can't do in banking. No, you don't do that in banking

1175
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:18,800
You're a business and that was when they ran Mac OS and when we switched them over to gen 2 those problems went away

1176
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,680
It was pretty pretty good pretty good and then eventually having a little gen 2 love affair right here

1177
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,940
Eventually CUPS came to Mac OS, but it was that was much much much

1178
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:34,580
Much later. Anyways, keep up the good work to us. I'm glad you're going with XFS. And that is the little gentoo challenge update

1179
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,620
I'm having a ton of fun. So if anyone else has never installed gentoo

1180
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,500
You just want something fun to do play around with Linux. I recommend it

1181
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,940
yeah, I know we got a couple of people that are doing it along at home let us know how it's going and

1182
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:51,820
Let's see. I think now now is the time for people to start betting on if Wes is gonna have to reload at some point

1183
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,820
You

1184
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,120
So you start taking your wages on that right now

1185
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:04,860
Well, Wes Payne have to reload his gentoo installation stay tuned and find out but in the meantime, we're gonna leave you with that

1186
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,140
We'll be back next week. We got lots of stuff in store

1187

01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,100
Open source options options for open source

1208
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,480
My nose it just today. I was I was having some allergies

1209
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,000
I've had some of those too. It's been rough this year. I don't know

1210
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,360
Oh, I got a picture of the new dog on the Twitter's if you want to see

1211
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:42,400
Levi do you want to be my new best friend? He does he does he really does. Perfect. He's

1212
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,520
Rejection was gonna be pretty hard. Yeah. No, he wants to be your best friend badly

1213
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,040
My nose itches and I'm sick and tired of having allergies all episode

1214
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:57,480
I was basically rubbing scratching my nose and trying not to sneeze. You did a pretty good job. I had one sneeze

1215
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:03,640
I did have one sneeze. It was unavoidable. I couldn't I couldn't help it. What about long live the excerpt? There we go

1216
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,720
Yeah, right. I'm good. That'd be good

1217
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,800
It's like it. It's almost like it. It's like I don't know how to describe it

1218
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,900
It's like it it buzzes my nose is buzzing with itching right now

1219
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,840
And like no matter how much you touch it. It's not it's not gonna change. It's just more it doesn't matter

1220
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,540
It just constantly itches more and it's driving me crazy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for about the sniffing and sneezing in the show guys

1221
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:31,380
Punishing content creators. That's not bad. Where was that? Somebody submitted punishing content creators. That's not bad

1222
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,240
What do you think Wes what do you think

1223
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:48,680
Oh, that's perfect bashful. You had four excerpts. I didn't see any special. Nice. Yeah

1224
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,120
Yeah, it's quite a while ago, but we had them around

1225
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:57,760
Yeah, they ran OS 10 for a while and then they got repurposed to Linux and became a cluster. So yeah. Yes

1226
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,760
Yeah, which version of links do you remember?

1227
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,620
What were we running at the time I thought it was like yellow dot

1228
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:11,680
Yeah, pretty much I don't think there were any other were they Intel or were they actually powered PC now

1229
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,560
They think about it power PC. Yeah, the ones I had work. Yeah, no mine worked

1230
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,040
I don't even think they ever made them as x86. No, they think about it

1231
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,840
I think they were all power PC servers, which was what was so cool about them now that I recall

1232
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:28,160
Yeah, first thought when he asked me about the distro is gonna say oh it must be right at because I was thinking yum

1233
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,160
But yeah, no yellow dog

1234
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:42,240
Yeah, exactly gotta get that yellow dog update manager from somewhere after all. Yeah, that's right
