WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
I didn't think it would happen, but Microsoft is going to allow WSL2 distros to run on

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
Windows Server.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.240
I don't know, I thought they'd draw the line, because of course, once you allow WSL on

00:11.240 --> 00:15.200
Windows Server, why even use Windows Server stuff to start running it all under Linux?

00:15.200 --> 00:31.640
All the license fees, the same amount of Linux.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.640
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:35.640 --> 00:36.640
My name is Chris.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
My name is Wes.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.640
And my name is Brent.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.640
Hello, gentlemen.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.160
Well, coming up on the show today, it's one of my favorite episodes, we're going to go

00:43.160 --> 00:48.100
back in time and witness the early days of a tool that is just ubiquitous now, something

00:48.100 --> 00:49.520
we talk about all the time.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.720
But where did it come from?

00:50.720 --> 00:54.600
And then we're going to jump forward 15 years and join our buddy Brent on his journey to

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
learn that tooling.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.040
Well, they just got back from a family road trip to Bozeman, Montana.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.840
I got a couple of stories to share with you guys.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.440
And then we'll round it out with some great boosts and pics and more.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.400
So before we go any further, let's say hello to our virtual lug, time appropriate gradients

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
mumble room.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Hello, hello.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Hello.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Hello, everybody.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
That's great.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
Strong show in today.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
We got it.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
We got a great mumble show.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
We got all folks in the live chat.

01:18.400 --> 01:26.920
Of course, we're doing this on a Sunday around noon Pacific is usually when we get started.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.880
Whenever Wes shows up, you know, we'll just get the show going.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.440
I like to make an entrance.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
Yeah.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
Yeah.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
Oh, boy.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
Tell me about it.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
He's got a whole long list of stuff, too.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.800
So yeah, I just got back.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Welcome back.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
Every time you leave, I worry you might not come back.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.240
So I feel like we got to make it, you know, we're happy to see you.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.680
I am kind of still riding high.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.640
It's like we actually pulled it off.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.280
You know, gas prices are crazy.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.120
Plus, whenever you're whenever you're going about 800 miles each way, something could

01:53.120 --> 01:54.120
happen.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.120
Right.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.720
And indeed, a few things did happen.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.720
No.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
Is Joups OK?

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
Joups is all right.

02:00.720 --> 02:05.680
Um, Adia's car, on the other hand, oh, no, oh, no.

02:05.680 --> 02:10.120
Just as we were getting gas, we just started out and she was navigating around the gas

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
station.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.800
It was crazy.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.920
And they have these short like poles around a light post.

02:15.920 --> 02:22.880
And she backed up and and broke the that like the driver's side, you know, brake light.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.360
And that was kind of a rocky start because she's like, oh, you know, we've been on the

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
road for like 30 minutes.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.120
Oh, this was like as you were leaving.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.120
Yeah.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
Yeah.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
Oh, God.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
Is this a bad sign or what?

02:33.120 --> 02:35.440
But we got on the road and it was pretty good.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.960
Other than I'm pretty sure I had covid not positive, but I'm pretty sure I got covid

02:39.960 --> 02:43.360
a couple of days before about about five days before we left.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.360
Right.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.360
I was trying to do prerecord.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.280
So, of course, we couldn't prerecord, which meant we had to do some stuff on the road.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.420
Just had to be dealt with on the road.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.420
But I started getting better.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.900
Not one hundred percent, but I got enough, you know, to do this because it is a big deal

02:54.900 --> 02:55.900
for the kids.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.320
It's like a yearly thing.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.840
And so we get down actually.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.520
You got to actually drive them out there.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
Right.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
I'm the driver.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.520
You can't get around.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
It's up to me.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.120
So we get down there the first night and I'm like, I'm not feeling so good.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.200
He says, well, I'll take the kids over, we'll go swimming, we'll go for a few hours.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.280
You get like one night of quiet, like, OK, great.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
Thank you.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
That's that's thank you.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
That's so sweet of you.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
Really appreciate it.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
And so she takes the kids off.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
And I'm like, well, this is great.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
I'll chill out a little bit.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.400
I'll get caught up on my messages.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.720
Maybe I'll lay down because I'm still not feeling very great.

03:26.720 --> 03:34.120
And about 20 minutes into my super relaxing night, I I open up the bathroom door and I

03:34.120 --> 03:37.680
see a puddle of water at the foot of the toilet.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.680
Oh, no.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.680
Oh, no.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
This isn't a good thing.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.280
Either, you know, best case scenario, someone pissed all over the floor.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.280
Right.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
That's my best case scenario.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.280
Right.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
Fingers crossed for that.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.280
Yeah.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.280
So I'm like, OK.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
And I look at it.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.520
It doesn't it doesn't look like it doesn't look like it came from a human.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.200
It looks like clear water and it's coming right from the base of the toilet.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.420
And I think to myself, oh, no, my toilet is leaking.

04:01.420 --> 04:06.880
So I mop it up, make sure, you know, and shake the toilet a little bit.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.080
You know, like I just grab the bowl and I just shake it a little bit and more water

04:10.080 --> 04:11.080
seeps out.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.080
Oh, no.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.640
And I'm like, oh, and I got a thing with water.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.720
I got a thing with water in this RV right now.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.440
And I just I was devastated.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.800
Like my evening went from like, hey, I'm chillin to like, I'm getting rid of this RV.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.040
Everything is horrible.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.560
We're going to just get in the car and drive home.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.200
I'm going to burn this thing to the ground.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
Right.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
Wow.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
I just couldn't.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
Yep.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.160
And so I dried all up and I check in 20 minutes later and there's more water there.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
So, OK.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.160
All right.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.960
Shut off the water to the RV because, of course, I don't have a knob just for the toilet.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.760
So shut off all the water.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
And I sit there waiting, you know, for Hadid to get back so that way I can tell her the

04:50.080 --> 04:53.560
bad news, be like, we got to solve this because we don't have a functioning toilet on our

04:53.560 --> 04:55.440
family road trip.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.480
And so we go to bed, you know, we think on it a little bit.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.360
Next morning we wake up and we're like, OK, it's daylight.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.980
Let's take a look at this thing.

05:02.980 --> 05:09.520
And we realized that because these these RV toilets have a pedal to flush them.

05:09.520 --> 05:15.160
We realized that it was once again, the leak was actually coming from the pedal where the

05:15.160 --> 05:17.380
valve that actually turns the water on and off is.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.600
And then it was just running behind the toilet and coming out.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.380
And so we think, OK, well, we fix this before we start looking at it.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.280
Of course, there's no parts.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.280
There's no parts.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.320
And Hadid is like, well, there's pretty much nothing we can do but bang on it.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
Oh, my God, I can do that.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.920
So I bang on it a bit.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.920
Doesn't fix the problem.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.960
Surprise, surprise.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.840
So she heads out to try to find parts.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.840
Doesn't find anything.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.180
Ends up getting a whole new toilet, just a whole new one.

05:42.180 --> 05:47.080
So we had to do a toilet swab in Bozeman, Montana, which of course, the plumbing doesn't

05:47.080 --> 05:50.120
line up, you know, the plumbing doesn't line up.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.880
So like we're like cutting the plumbing and like rerunning the lines and like bringing

05:54.880 --> 05:55.960
that in.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.220
And of course, when you take the toilet out, there's just a hole in the ground that goes

05:59.220 --> 06:00.320
down to the black tank.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.000
So like we're trying to like keep that capped and not drop anything down in there because

06:04.000 --> 06:05.700
then that would be gone forever.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.660
So that's how you lose a kid right there.

06:07.660 --> 06:11.700
Basically lost an entire day to fixing the toilet in Montana.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.560
But now we got a better than ever toilet.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.320
Like whenever we upgrade and whatever we fix, we upgrade.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.520
So now we got a real premium model, you know, and one of your residential units.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.520
Oh, wow.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
Only with the pedal.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.520
Sure, sure.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.520
Yeah.

06:24.520 --> 06:28.200
So that was good, you know, but probably not the most frustrating, well, maybe it was

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
the most frustrating.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.560
It was probably the most frustrating, but not the most technical issue to solve.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.560
Right.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.400
It was just like a mechanical problem.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
Right.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.600
And these things happen, especially the plumbing as you're going down the road, they can shake

06:38.600 --> 06:39.840
loose a little bit.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.640
And if anything was just kind of on the verge of cracking or breaking, it does.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.640
That's what's going to happen.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.640
Yeah.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.640
Joop's a seven years old, too.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.640
And this toilet's a full time toilet.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.760
So it's seen things.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.040
Yeah, it has seen things.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.760
I mean, Brent knows we've been through things with our toilet.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
Oh, yeah.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.920
And of course, props to my wife.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.880
She's a she's a real like, just dive in and fix it gal.

06:57.880 --> 06:58.880
She goes out there.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.880
She hurts.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.800
She talks to the guys, even though she doesn't, you know, necessarily understand the language.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.280
She manages to break through that and get the stuff and we got it all connected.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.440
And what you want in a crisis is an idea.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.440
That's for sure.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.440
Yeah.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.080
So but on the on the on the side of like technical issues that I had to deal with on this road

07:15.080 --> 07:16.400
trip.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
Real quick recap.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.880
I've talked about my Starlink setup before.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.440
These are what I effing love about Starlink other than it brings internet to remote places

07:23.440 --> 07:26.680
where I couldn't get connected before is that it's Linux, right?

07:26.680 --> 07:32.560
These are Linux satellites and these are Linux dishes and they have it's just the whole stack

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
is Linux.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
And it's so great.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.760
Even their Wi-Fi router is also Linux.

07:36.760 --> 07:41.040
And so it's such an interesting implementation of the software that we've talked about for

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
15 years.

07:42.040 --> 07:47.080
You know, we've gone from arguing and debating if TVOization was going to destroy Linux to

07:47.080 --> 07:49.960
now I've got Linux powered internet.

07:49.960 --> 07:50.960
Right.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.040
And my circular dish, the little worm motor in there broke during transportation.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.320
And I ended up getting it replaced with a new square dish, which is easier to transport.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.560
And I got myself a sweet little crate that I have it all in there at Frankenstein kind

08:05.560 --> 08:11.480
of zombied up the box they used for shipping and I created myself a nice waterproof crate.

08:11.480 --> 08:14.120
So I get on location.

08:14.120 --> 08:18.480
This is the first time I've really used this new dish and putting it through the paces.

08:18.480 --> 08:23.840
I had to get their silly ethernet adapter because they've got this proprietary ethernet

08:23.840 --> 08:29.480
cable where they lop off the RJ45 and they put on there this proprietary like USB-C kind

08:29.480 --> 08:30.520
of looking connector.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.240
And there's a strange connector, super long weird connectors.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.040
And so you run the ethernet adapter in line.

08:36.040 --> 08:42.080
So you go you run from the dish to the ethernet adapter from the ethernet adapter to the router.

08:42.080 --> 08:46.840
And that's where I break off and I plug in the ethernet to my router, which is a peplink

08:46.840 --> 08:49.160
max transit duo.

08:49.160 --> 08:55.360
And this combines three different cellular connections, campground Wi-Fi and Starlink

08:55.360 --> 08:56.360
over my WAN port.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.240
And it brings it all together in one interface and balances it all.

09:00.240 --> 09:05.680
The idea with ethernet is to just take out any kind of possible introduced latency by

09:05.680 --> 09:09.480
Wi-Fi or any kind of drops because I want to be able to do remote streams and remote

09:09.480 --> 09:10.680
recording.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.880
And when you're doing these apps, you want good solid connectivity, lowest latency possible

09:13.880 --> 09:15.560
and you don't want to drop frames.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.040
So I chose to use the ethernet connection.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.920
And with this new square dish, you've got to keep the router in play and all that's

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
fine, whatever.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.640
But I was just dropping packets like crazy.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.820
And I look at the app and they have a nice app that lets you scan the sky and see if

09:28.820 --> 09:29.820
you have good visibility.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.520
I had great visibility in Montana.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.100
It's big sky country.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.240
And I had a great shot.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.720
The app says, you're good to go, bro.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.640
And I think, OK, well, then why am I dropping so many damn packets?

09:40.640 --> 09:43.920
I mean, it's like one in three, one in four packets I was losing.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.520
I couldn't use the Starlink for anything.

09:46.520 --> 09:51.760
But when I test the speed on the dish itself, I'm getting like one hundred and fifteen megabits.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.680
So the dish is getting good connectivity, the dish is getting good ping time.

09:55.680 --> 10:00.440
But when I'm using it on my LAN, I'm dropping packets like a maniac.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.080
Couldn't use it for anything, not even browsing the web.

10:04.080 --> 10:09.880
And I start doing troubleshooting and I discover that apparently there's some issue with my

10:09.880 --> 10:16.640
particular Peplink brand router and the Starlink Ethernet adapter.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.040
And you know, people don't really know what they're talking about online, so who knows.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.440
But it seems to be maybe like it's constantly renegotiating if it's a gigabit full duplex

10:24.440 --> 10:28.760
hundred megabit full duplex and maybe the max transit can't quite handle the gigabit

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
connection.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
I don't know if that's true or not.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.240
I'm only trying to push a hundred megabits or whatever.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.680
And people online tell me that if I put a hub and I'm curious if this if anybody else

10:37.680 --> 10:42.200
has heard of this, I put a hub between the Ethernet adapter and my router.

10:42.200 --> 10:47.200
So I go from the Ethernet adapter into a hub and then from the hub into my router.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
Problem solved.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.240
Well, I didn't have a spare hub, so I ended up connecting to the Starlink over Wi-Fi and

10:52.240 --> 10:53.880
it's been working fine.

10:53.880 --> 10:59.800
But it's one of these things where version one, the round dish, didn't have these kinds

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
of problems, right?

11:00.800 --> 11:05.280
I just ran Ethernet from the dish into my router and I was good to go.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.680
Straight from the dish itself, from the Linux host in that little dish right into my router.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.520
But now I got to go through this Ethernet adapter and this Ethernet adapter apparently

11:13.520 --> 11:15.080
has some sort of negotiation issue.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.920
And of course, they just launched the RV product and supposedly thirty thousand RV owners have

11:19.920 --> 11:21.240
ordered this.

11:21.240 --> 11:25.620
And this these Peplink routers are super popular in the RV community.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.320
So now now you're on the path to, right?

11:27.320 --> 11:31.160
It's like if most people are doing the Wi-Fi, this will be less tested, probably less well

11:31.160 --> 11:33.720
understood by the customer support staff, etc.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.440
Yeah, I don't like it.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.440
I don't like it.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.400
I think the big question for me becomes why even bother with the adapter?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.240
It sounds like they're putting this proprietary connector for reasons we don't understand.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.760
Like it is there an advantage to it in some scenario?

11:47.760 --> 11:52.680
Because it just seems like you're adding extra bits that are just causing potential issues.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.160
So if you could skip over that somehow.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.680
I'm trying to bypass using Wi-Fi, you know, that's why I want it.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.840
I don't want to use Wi-Fi for that last.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.720
You heard there was an option to not.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.040
But in my setup, it's all wired, you know, my machine I'm recording from is wired to

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
my router.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.280
My router is wired to my Starlink and then the Starlink is about as wireless as it gets.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.600
Let's be honest.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.200
Starlink is it's pretty great.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.480
Audio listeners, you can't see this, but he's holding like an RJ45 crimping tool in his

12:17.480 --> 12:18.720
hands right now.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.200
So it's pretty dedicated.

12:20.200 --> 12:26.040
You know, they've got reportedly now 500,000 users in 32 countries now.

12:26.040 --> 12:30.220
15,000 Starlink terminals have been sent to Ukraine.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.560
They are beginning to launch the 1.5 version of the satellites.

12:33.560 --> 12:38.120
Those have the optical terminals and they should be online by the end of the year.

12:38.120 --> 12:43.720
They're about to run a test using laser links to provide connectivity in polar regions where

12:43.720 --> 12:46.120
there's no ground stations, of course.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.640
And this is really good news.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.000
Version two of the satellites will be 10 times dimmer.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Hopefully.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.280
Principal engineer David Goldstein says that they're working on a technology that will

12:57.280 --> 13:01.600
make version two satellites 10 times dimmer than Vantablack paint.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
I guess that must be it.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.440
Oh, you haven't heard of Vantablack.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
That's for later.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.440
Oh, yeah.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.440
OK.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
It sounds cool.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.440
Oh, yeah, it is.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.120
On the user side, Starlink as a service is sort of a life changer.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.420
Unfortunately, everywhere I go, it's oversubscribed now.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.760
Even in Montana, it was not I wasn't kidding speeds I initially got five months ago.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.760
And I think what's happening is people in residential areas are ordering these RV versions

13:24.760 --> 13:28.000
and they're over and they're using them in overpopulated cells where they'd otherwise

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
have to wait.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.600
Sounds like you're in that sort of awkward territory, right?

13:30.600 --> 13:36.040
You got the like initial experience when it was new and limited and more technical, perhaps.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.640
And now you're in the like the starts of optimizing for a more general audience.

13:39.640 --> 13:44.160
And then that has some backtracking on some issues which will surely get fixed down the

13:44.160 --> 13:45.160
line.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
It's just going to take time.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.600
Well, and you and I were kind of debating this earlier, but I sort of feel like unlike

13:50.600 --> 13:55.640
traditional telco infrastructure, they sort of build out and then that infrastructure

13:55.640 --> 13:57.440
sort of what they use for like 10, 20 years.

13:57.440 --> 14:02.140
Like look at cable internet, look at DSL, like our area where they rolled out fiber

14:02.140 --> 14:06.020
even they sort of stopped about 30 percent of the rollout way.

14:06.020 --> 14:10.720
And then they've just never gone back to it for like a decade with a few exceptions here

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
and there.

14:11.720 --> 14:16.200
But with Starlink, they can keep launching satellites, they can keep building ground

14:16.200 --> 14:19.960
stations and kind of scale it away that I don't think you see traditional telco operator

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
scale.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.920
Assuming they get Starship worked out.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
Yeah.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
Right.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
That's the big thing here.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
Yeah.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.920
And you know.

14:27.920 --> 14:28.920
Which I mean that's progressing now.

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
So.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
Also, it appears that they're about to go to or they already are.

14:31.920 --> 14:37.200
There's a Cold War that's getting hot right now between Dish Network and Starlink.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.560
So first of all, Dish is like trying to get Starlink busted for selling the RV version.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
Yeah.

14:43.560 --> 14:49.160
Specifically trying to go after Elon for promoting the RV version because he didn't explicitly

14:49.160 --> 14:52.920
state that you can't use it while in motion because Elon didn't tweet that you're not

14:52.920 --> 14:54.080
allowed to use it on motion.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.600
They're trying to get him in trouble because the FCC doesn't give them a license to use

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
Starlink in motion.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.640
It does seem to be technically possible.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.880
You can actually use it in motion, but you're not supposed to.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.000
And so they are making a case to the FCC to shut Starlink down.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.480
They're going after SpaceX on this.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.760
Of course, what's really happening is Dish is about to launch their own 12 gigahertz

15:19.760 --> 15:23.360
5G only wireless network.

15:23.360 --> 15:31.280
And that 12 gigahertz radio spectrum will interfere significantly with what start with

15:31.280 --> 15:35.320
SpaceX is a 77 percent of their customers.

15:35.320 --> 15:41.960
And so Dish Network has been lobbying the FCC for access to the 12 gigahertz band.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.120
SpaceX is trying to get it to stop.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.600
They're trying to show the data to demonstrate how it could be an issue.

15:49.600 --> 15:55.080
And I'm really torn on this because, of course, I'd love more 5G network.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.120
And I'd be interested to see what Dish could do in this area because they're kind of a

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
new contender.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
Right.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.720
But at the same time, I've been doing this for a while.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.480
Nobody's got it across the line like SpaceX and Starlink have.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
Like nobody has.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.360
And it's not 100 percent of a product yet.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.240
I don't know if I'd even consider it out of beta truly yet, but it is pretty phenomenal

16:14.240 --> 16:18.440
to get a box and within 10 minutes you've got you get a box, it's got a cardboard insert

16:18.440 --> 16:22.640
with three instructions, you know, you connect the wire, you put it in the pole, you connect

16:22.640 --> 16:28.600
the router, you connect your app to the router and you're talking to space and you can go

16:28.600 --> 16:31.480
places and get Internet access.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.800
And that can be, you know, a lifesaver for some people.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.520
Like if I, you know, if I ever get my dream of like living in some off-grid property where

16:37.520 --> 16:40.680
I can do podcasts, how am I going to do without something like Starlink?

16:40.680 --> 16:45.280
And so it kind of sucks to see Dish playing these games of like trying to go after Elon

16:45.280 --> 16:49.000
personally or trying to go after SpaceX because they didn't implicitly tell you not to use

16:49.000 --> 16:52.360
it while moving just so that way they can get the FCC to crack down on them.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.160
So that way they can then use the 12 gigahertz spectrum for their own thing.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.520
At the same time, I'm like, well, I'd like to see more competition.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.080
Amazon is also going to launch their their Internet thing.

17:03.080 --> 17:07.800
So there's more to come in this space just as I start to really get reliant on it and

17:07.800 --> 17:11.920
I start to use it for work and these shows and become very happy and feel like I finally

17:11.920 --> 17:14.000
got high speed Internet in my home.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.840
You have this sort of degradation of the service itself as they sort of oversubscribe.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.000
And you also have, of course, these corporate interests that are going to go after it now

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
too and, you know, play a little dirty so that way they can advance their agenda.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.440
It's just such a go figure.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.440
Yeah.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
I mean, this one happens, right?

17:30.440 --> 17:34.760
It's a new it's a new area to explore, a new way to offer services.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.720
There's going to be some competition.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.800
And as you so often learn, sometimes being an early adopter kind of bites.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.800
Mm hmm.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.800
Yeah.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.920
There's usually a little downside just the way it goes.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.660
We hinted on our dev one episode about one of you having it during the trip.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.280
But I was never it was never clear who got the dev one this week.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.520
So can you update us what who got the dev one and what to do with it?

17:58.520 --> 17:59.920
It does a lot of pressure.

17:59.920 --> 18:00.920
I've had the devil on.

18:00.920 --> 18:01.920
But I didn't do anything crazy.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.680
I've just been using it like a laptop is using it right now, actually.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.480
I think your version of normal things on a laptop is probably crazy to most of us.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.200
I didn't do anything crazy with it because I kind of just wanted to see how it would

18:12.200 --> 18:16.760
fit into my existing you know, if I got a dev one, what would it do?

18:16.760 --> 18:19.720
So I would like to play a little more with the dev side of it.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.720
I did.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
I set up a little bit of a dev environment.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
That was fine.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
It's just a normal Linux machine.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.980
But I didn't really push it to the limit or anything.

18:25.980 --> 18:31.080
But it's been a really nice throw it around and bring it wherever I'm going laptop.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.840
You know, I've been impressed with that because the battery life has been really quite decent.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.640
So I didn't have to worry about sort of like being tethered to a charger.

18:38.640 --> 18:44.080
Plus that you can do USB-C as well as it's the proprietary version meant that like I

18:44.080 --> 18:46.760
already had USB-C things hanging around my house.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.920
So if I did need to top up the battery, that was easy, you know, and it was and it was

18:50.920 --> 18:52.240
just right there.

18:52.240 --> 18:56.440
I also did notice at one point I kind of forgot that I had unplugged a charger that I you

18:56.440 --> 18:59.580
know, I plugged it into the laptop forgetting that I'd unplugged that from like I'd changed

18:59.580 --> 19:04.280
out my power splitter situation and it made a really cute little beeping sound.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
It was going to die.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.440
And here I'm like listening, I'm cooking in the kitchen.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.280
I just see this little like it wasn't scary, it wasn't like alarming, but just a little

19:11.280 --> 19:17.480
cry for help from the laptop reminding me, hey, I'm here, plug me in.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
That sounds nice.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.160
And Chris, I know you had some success with your ThinkPad, but did you miss having it?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.160
Yeah, I did.

19:23.160 --> 19:28.360
I didn't get a chance to game much, but that's an area where I really would have missed it.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.240
Dylan brought his laptop and if I would have had a gaming laptop, I think we probably would

19:32.240 --> 19:33.760
have done a little bit of gaming.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.680
So that's I was like, OK, I miss it for that.

19:36.680 --> 19:41.000
The ThinkPad otherwise did did really do the heavy lifting for this trip.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.020
But the APU on there, I mean, it's essentially it's a Steam Deck only with a 1080p screen

19:47.020 --> 19:48.960
and in a laptop form.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.480
So you can play pretty much anything on there.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.480
Yeah.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.480
Yeah.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.480
You know, yours is here.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.480
It arrived while I was in Texas.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.480
Brent.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.480
Whoa.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.480
That's exciting.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.820
I forgot to arrive as well at the same time.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.040
So we'll have to figure that out.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.600
We still have to figure that part out.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.680
That's for sure.

20:03.680 --> 20:09.080
But in between shows, listener Jeff, who you guys may remember, he's he's been on the show

20:09.080 --> 20:11.280
before, of course, but also he helped me out at the junkyard.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.960
He helped us build out some power setups for Lady Jupes.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.520
He's in the Mamba room right now.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.640
And he chipped in on a nice pack of RAM.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
What was it?

20:19.640 --> 20:20.640
I don't know.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
What was it?

20:21.640 --> 20:22.640
How much was it?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
And has it arrived?

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
It certainly has arrived.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.660
So I've received the RAM for the Dev1, but I have not received the Dev1, which is kind

20:28.660 --> 20:29.820
of a funny situation.

20:29.820 --> 20:35.060
But Jeff was kind enough to we did a back and forth to try to find RAM in Canada.

20:35.060 --> 20:40.660
That was a reasonable price and available, which seems difficult right now for some reason.

20:40.660 --> 20:46.780
But Jeff, you're kind enough to max the Dev1 out whenever I get it, which is about 64 gigs

20:46.780 --> 20:50.280
of DDR4, which is super generous.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.680
I don't even know what I'm going to do with all that.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.160
So open to ideas.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.200
So, Jeff, thank you so much.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.800
That is very, very, very super kind of you.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.800
It's absolute pleasure.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.240
Hopefully you can put it to good use, have some real compute power.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.720
Think of all the quick EMU VMs you can have.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.220
Oh, yeah, we'll find uses for that RAM.

21:08.220 --> 21:14.440
But not only that, Jeff went the extra mile because, you know, Jeff is Jeff and he's wonderful.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.440
And he also...

21:15.440 --> 21:16.440
A kilometer.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.920
I thought this is in Canada.

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
Which, right.

21:18.920 --> 21:19.920
Sorry.

21:19.920 --> 21:20.920
Sorry.

21:20.920 --> 21:21.920
Be inclusive.

21:21.920 --> 21:29.320
He also apparently sent a box filled with a NanoStation M2 from Ubiquiti and an AC1200,

21:29.320 --> 21:34.520
which is hopefully going to solve my network problem here locally.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.900
So I just got to say, Jeff, you're amazing.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.900
Thank you.

21:38.900 --> 21:43.400
We have the best listeners ever, the best friends ever, and I really appreciate it.

21:43.400 --> 21:50.720
We do have a couple of housekeeping items we wanted to update you on.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.140
Probably we should start with meetups.

21:53.140 --> 21:58.600
The J.B. London meetup, August 5th, is, I guess, is that the new time and date, 6 p.m.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
London time?

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
We have that information now.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
That's good.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.400
It turns out we were saying 6 p.m. GMT previously, and apparently that's wrong.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.960
I guess us North Americans, we don't, oops.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.720
So a few listeners, Paul and Richard, kindly corrected us.

22:13.720 --> 22:18.800
So 6 p.m. London time, which is not GMT, but something else, BST or something like that.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.660
Well, here's what we're doing.

22:20.660 --> 22:26.380
Because these things happen, they're dynamic situations, we have set up a J.B. meetups

22:26.380 --> 22:27.560
matrix space.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.660
It's early days, but we have a dedicated room in there for the London meetup.

22:31.660 --> 22:35.800
We have a Pacific Northwest room in there, and we have a Mumble meetup room in there.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.160
So this is a space that contains multiple rooms, and we can create more, and then we'll

22:40.160 --> 22:45.880
have standing chat rooms for events that we can jump into and participate and coordinate.

22:45.880 --> 22:50.360
Yeah, meet other folks that are going, coordinate around rides, whatever you need.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.200
Yep, like the next time we do a Raleigh meetup, we'll make a Raleigh room, and if you'd like

22:55.200 --> 22:57.280
to participate in there, just contact me on Matrix.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.280
We can get you set up.

22:58.280 --> 23:03.000
But the rooms are available to the public, and we will have them linked in the show notes,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.640
and you can start coordinating your London meetup in there.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.640
We already made one for London.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.720
If you needed one more reason to get a Matrix account set up, here it is.

23:10.720 --> 23:15.620
And of course, details and any time changes, location changes, that'll be on our actual

23:15.620 --> 23:20.040
meetup page at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

23:20.040 --> 23:25.160
There we go.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.360
lino.com slash unplugged.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.960
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
show.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.040
GeeksCloud with 11 data centers around the world.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.120
It's what we've been using for more than a couple of years now, and they've been at it

23:39.120 --> 23:43.240
for over 19 years, and I have friends personally who've used it for over a decade.

23:43.240 --> 23:46.640
It's a really, really nice way to host your applications.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.800
It's like the best way.

23:47.800 --> 23:52.440
Personally, I wouldn't run my stuff anywhere because I feel like the speed and reliability

23:52.440 --> 23:57.740
of our infrastructure is part of the overall package, and so you just really couldn't convince

23:57.740 --> 24:03.040
me to go with a better performance, reliability, support, and price ratio.

24:03.040 --> 24:07.560
In fact, they're 30 to 50% cheaper than some of the major cloud providers out there.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.760
And Linode's been rolling out features since I've been a customer that just keep making

24:10.760 --> 24:11.760
it better and better.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.760
If you've got a minute, you've got to go check it out.

24:13.760 --> 24:21.840
They just recently announced hosted database support for Postgres, MongoDB, and MySQL.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.720
And I'll put a link in the show notes.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.680
Just a few days ago, they released a guide to migrate your Postgres database to their

24:27.680 --> 24:31.740
managed database solution, which is something I'm going to look at.

24:31.740 --> 24:36.420
And then they've also recently released an infrastructure as code ebook by Justin Mitchell.

24:36.420 --> 24:40.640
It's a step-by-step infrastructure as code guide for Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef

24:40.640 --> 24:42.320
Salt, and of course, some GitHub.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.800
Love is in there as well.

24:43.800 --> 24:44.800
It's totally free.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.200
You don't even have to put your email address in there to get this thing.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.680
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well because that is like a super valuable

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
thing.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.600
If I started in IT, I would have had to go to the library and pay 35, 45, 65 bucks for

24:57.600 --> 24:59.120
something like that.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.020
You kids these days and your great deals.

25:02.020 --> 25:04.880
It's the same thing with deploying infrastructure now at Linode.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.400
Stuff that literally would take me two weeks at best, maybe a month, I can now do in 30

25:09.400 --> 25:10.860
seconds on Linode.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.140
And the performance is just so great.

25:13.140 --> 25:16.980
The beast of a system we have running our matrix box has just been killer.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.740
It's totally absorbed the growth.

25:19.740 --> 25:23.060
It's really so nice to be able to just kind of incrementally upgrade that stuff too because

25:23.060 --> 25:26.040
we didn't start at that high end of a machine.

25:26.040 --> 25:30.160
We just kind of slowly built to that as user demand required it, and Linode was there the

25:30.160 --> 25:31.160
whole way.

25:31.160 --> 25:36.240
There are so many great options, so many great things to try on Linode, but fundamentally,

25:36.240 --> 25:41.760
it's just the best way to run applications in the cloud under your control with the best

25:41.760 --> 25:42.840
support in the business.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.680
So why not get $100 to try it out and support the show?

25:45.680 --> 25:48.600
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:48.600 --> 25:53.960
Well, I've been lazing about playing with the Dev1.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.520
Chris has been learning basic plumbing skills, turns out.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.920
Brent, what have you been up to while we've been away?

26:00.920 --> 26:06.720
You know, I've actually been spending a ton of time on my drum kit, but also I have been

26:06.720 --> 26:13.760
diving into Git, which is something I'm slightly embarrassed that I don't know yet and have

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
skills in.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.720
I'm like, hey, any time to try is now, right?

26:18.720 --> 26:24.080
And the reason I've been doing that is that a few episodes ago, we talked about the new

26:24.080 --> 26:29.240
Jupiter broadcasting website that the community is kind of putting together with us.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.200
And Stefan is working super hard on that.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.300
I think he has a little tracker of how many hours he spent on it yet.

26:34.300 --> 26:39.080
So far, I think he's up to like 13, which to me is impressive what he's got done in

26:39.080 --> 26:40.200
that time.

26:40.200 --> 26:45.400
But I thought I could help with that effort, but in order to do that, I would need to learn

26:45.400 --> 26:46.680
Git.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.200
Better reason than to use the new website to do that.

26:50.200 --> 26:56.240
So I have been diving into Git, trying to understand how it all works, pinging Wes at

26:56.240 --> 27:01.000
all times of the day to try to, you know, how does it give me more?

27:01.000 --> 27:06.780
I don't quite wrap my head around it, but it's been super fascinating to dive into the

27:06.780 --> 27:11.360
history of Git, and I only have like a little tiny understanding.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.860
But you guys have been around a little longer than I have, at least in the Git world.

27:14.860 --> 27:17.280
So can you can you inform me a little bit?

27:17.280 --> 27:18.720
Yeah, stay a while and listen.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.380
You know, I love that you're doing this, Brent.

27:20.380 --> 27:23.760
First of all, it's just great to have your help with the new website.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.380
Not everybody's willing to like, understand that there's a bunch of bunch of first principles

27:28.380 --> 27:31.200
they have to go learn first before they can participate.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.120
And so we thought, all right, well, let's go back in time about 15 years to the real

27:35.120 --> 27:41.560
early days of Git, which is now just this super important tool that is used to manage

27:41.560 --> 27:43.880
so many, so many, so many projects out there.

27:43.880 --> 27:51.040
But back then, it was kind of considered like this hard to use, confusing tooling.

27:51.040 --> 27:56.460
And so Linus Torvalds was invited to do a talk at Google back in 2007, and I wanted

27:56.460 --> 27:58.280
to play a little bit of the introduction for Linus.

27:58.280 --> 28:03.720
You can kind of hear the general attitude towards something that today it's like ubiquitous.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.280
Yeah, we just take it for granted, man.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
Yeah, but back then, it wasn't.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.880
Thank you for coming, everybody.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.560
Some of you have probably already heard of Linus Torvalds.

28:14.560 --> 28:19.480
Those of you who haven't, you're the people with Macintoshes on your laps.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.120
He's a guy who delights in being cruel to people.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.000
His latest cruel act is to create a revision control system which is expressly designed

28:27.000 --> 28:32.080
to make you feel less intelligent than you thought you were.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.160
Thank you for coming down today, Linus.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.120
I've been getting emails the past few days from people saying, where's Linus?

28:37.120 --> 28:38.840
Why hasn't he merged my tree?

28:38.840 --> 28:39.840
Doesn't he love me anymore?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.800
I only walked into my office this afternoon.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.480
What are you doing here?

28:43.480 --> 28:45.400
But thank you for taking the time off.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.560
So Linus is here today to explain to us why on earth he would write a software tool which

28:49.560 --> 28:53.360
only he is smart enough to know how to use.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.360
Thanks, Linus.

28:56.360 --> 29:02.360
A real comedian, this guy, right, cracking the jokes about Git.

29:02.360 --> 29:08.560
And Linus goes up there, and it's a classic younger Linus, it's prime Linus, and he explains

29:08.560 --> 29:12.400
kind of why he likes using Git by explaining why he hates the other stuff.

29:12.400 --> 29:17.120
So I want to give a few credits before I start.

29:17.120 --> 29:27.440
I look at CVS in a very, very negative way because I, in many ways, when I design Git,

29:27.440 --> 29:33.920
it's the what would Jesus do except it's what would CVS never, ever do kind of approach

29:33.920 --> 29:36.680
to source control management.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.640
I've never actually used CVS for the kernel.

29:40.640 --> 29:46.440
For the first 10 years of kernel maintenance, we literally used tarballs and patches which

29:46.440 --> 29:53.460
is a much superior source control management system than CVS is.

29:53.460 --> 29:58.720
But I did end up using CVS for seven years at a commercial company, and I hate it with

29:58.720 --> 30:00.780
a passion.

30:00.780 --> 30:06.480
When I say I hate CVS with a passion, I have to also say that if there are any SVN users

30:06.480 --> 30:11.960
in Subversion, users in the audience, you might want to leave.

30:11.960 --> 30:16.800
It's just a classic, it's his classic presentation style.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.400
Really his point was these other tools are just not good enough and especially they weren't

30:20.400 --> 30:25.640
good enough for a project at the scale of the Linux project, the kernel, which is what

30:25.640 --> 30:26.640
he had to solve.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.640
Well, yeah, right.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.200
I mean, it's still a unique project, but then especially then, like throughout that talk,

30:31.200 --> 30:37.120
you kind of get a bunch of questions of folks sort of asking, okay, I guess I can see why

30:37.120 --> 30:41.120
you'd need that for a weird project like the kernel where you have all these distributed

30:41.120 --> 30:45.200
people working, you know, working in different time zones and across the world and with different

30:45.200 --> 30:46.200
connectivity.

30:46.200 --> 30:50.520
But do we really need Git for our like central corporate repo?

30:50.520 --> 30:54.360
It's just wild to be reminded that people were skeptical, naturally skeptical of a new

30:54.360 --> 30:56.280
paradigm and a new technology.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.280
Right.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.600
And this was, at the time of this talk, this was a year before GitHub launched.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.080
The tooling was different back then, so people are a little more skeptical.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.920
There wasn't that kind of easy to use front end that added that whole social collaboration

31:08.920 --> 31:10.360
aspect as well.

31:10.360 --> 31:16.360
There's also something that he seemed to kind of hone in on that was important to him early

31:16.360 --> 31:18.560
on that I thought was interesting.

31:18.560 --> 31:23.760
And it's like just something I take for granted about Git, but it's the offline distributed

31:23.760 --> 31:24.760
nature.

31:24.760 --> 31:30.420
I say it's so much more than just offline work, but the offline work part is actually

31:30.420 --> 31:36.600
maybe the most obvious thing, which is that you can take a truly distributed source control

31:36.600 --> 31:37.920
management system.

31:37.920 --> 31:43.480
You can take it on a plane and even if they don't offer a Wi-Fi and satellite hookups,

31:43.480 --> 31:44.920
you just continue working.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.280
You can look at all your logs.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.280
You can commit.

31:47.280 --> 31:51.940
You can do everything you would do even if you were connected to a nice gigabit ethernet

31:51.940 --> 31:54.540
directly to the backbone.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.560
And that is really important.

31:56.560 --> 32:02.760
It is doubly important when you have hundreds or thousands of people working on the same

32:02.760 --> 32:11.400
project and they may not be literally disconnected, but in practice they aren't really well connected

32:11.400 --> 32:12.860
either.

32:12.860 --> 32:17.320
So part of distribution is this offline work theme.

32:17.320 --> 32:21.560
Even if it's not completely offline, it is important to be able to do everything you

32:21.560 --> 32:30.440
want to do from any location without having to be able to access a server.

32:30.440 --> 32:39.920
What that basic fact actually results in is that you effectively have a lot more branching

32:39.920 --> 32:46.880
because everybody who has a complete repository and can do commits on his own will effectively

32:46.880 --> 32:51.400
have his own branch even if you don't realize it.

32:51.400 --> 32:56.480
Even if you think of your project as just having a single branch, every single time

32:56.480 --> 33:00.080
you disconnect your laptop and start working with it.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.300
You are on your own branch.

33:02.300 --> 33:08.520
And this is really, really important and is very different from anybody who's used CVS

33:08.520 --> 33:14.480
where branching is considered something that only true gurus do.

33:14.480 --> 33:19.040
This is probably something coming into GitHub and Git, you kind of just take for granted

33:19.040 --> 33:22.880
right now that you can pull a copy down to your machine and work on it locally.

33:22.880 --> 33:31.720
I think that's kind of maybe because I'm jumping into it at this time in Git's history.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.880
But back then, it sure does sound like that was not the norm.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.520
From kind of some of the research that I did, it seemed like it was always a server client

33:39.520 --> 33:44.280
relationship where the source of truth and we're not that far from it, but the source

33:44.280 --> 33:45.960
of truth was always on the server.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.880
I would imagine in a corporate office, you know, that wouldn't be so bad.

33:49.880 --> 33:54.100
But Linux seems to have changed the way that projects work.

33:54.100 --> 34:01.400
And so the concept of having the entire Git tree on your, you know, laptop or local computer

34:01.400 --> 34:06.200
and thousands of people might have that or, you know, in the case of the project I'm working

34:06.200 --> 34:10.300
on them, you know, I think we have like 10 people that are doing that and but everybody

34:10.300 --> 34:12.980
has their own copy, and you're doing your own independent thing.

34:12.980 --> 34:17.640
And then the ability to merge that later, I think is kind of really where all the magic

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
is happening.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.520
It took me a little bit to wrap my head around the concepts, but man, are they ever elegant

34:23.520 --> 34:26.720
once you really dive into it a little bit.

34:26.720 --> 34:32.800
And well, I think it's pretty obvious to say that it's been working fairly well, considering

34:32.800 --> 34:35.680
the accomplishments that Git has helped with.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.720
So pretty cool.

34:37.720 --> 34:43.040
Another part, though, I think is that is maybe not obvious is, you know, when you have this

34:43.040 --> 34:46.880
distributed system, and you're not really privileging one branch, it means you have

34:46.880 --> 34:50.880
a lot of different flexible working constraints, because you don't have this one sort of central

34:50.880 --> 34:55.080
coordination point that everyone has to check in on, you can go off on your own for a while.

34:55.080 --> 34:59.600
So like, you know, Chris, you're finally you get your RV parked up in Canada next to Brent,

34:59.600 --> 35:02.880
and you guys are hashing out this new, a new theme for the website, and you have this whole

35:02.880 --> 35:06.320
you want to go off on a tangent, you try out some new stuff and introduce some new things.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.680
But maybe you know, the internet's not great, you don't want to be bothered, you don't have

35:08.680 --> 35:11.680
to check in all your things, you guys can both be working independently, and then come

35:11.680 --> 35:15.920
together and then at some later date, go meet up with folks with other repos, or the you

35:15.920 --> 35:19.200
know, what we consider the source of truth that we happen to have chosen to host on GitHub

35:19.200 --> 35:20.200
or something.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.680
And then all of those can happen without anyone having to worry about what else someone else

35:23.680 --> 35:26.600
is doing until you actually have to go do that merge at the end.

35:26.600 --> 35:31.400
Yeah, that was the magic really to get brought and you could see for a guy like Linus, who's

35:31.400 --> 35:35.560
working on a project the size of Linux kernel, bringing in all these different changes, trying

35:35.560 --> 35:38.960
to figure out what changed what needs to be reviewed.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.520
That kind of stuff was magic for him and was absolutely essential.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.960
And you kind of get a taste of that where he describes what he loves the most about

35:45.960 --> 35:46.960
Git.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.600
Somebody sends a bug report, which bug reports are usually not very good.

35:50.600 --> 35:56.100
But maybe the bug report is good enough that you can pinpoint, okay, SCSI subsystem.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.760
That's the command line.

35:57.760 --> 36:04.560
You can't say which file, but you can do this and say, okay, that will cut it down to from

36:04.560 --> 36:12.400
the 15,000 commits we've had since last week, it will cut it down to 50.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.240
That's a huge deal.

36:14.240 --> 36:20.360
That is something that nobody else can do, I guarantee you.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.760
So that's the reason you want to use Git.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.900
That's what it all boils down to.

36:23.900 --> 36:25.100
It's safe.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.520
It is so fast that he can do things that nobody else can do.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.720
It does things that nobody else can do even slowly, and it's distributed.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.480
So go and spread the word.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.560
Go and spread the word, he says.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.000
We'll have a link to the full talk.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
It is great.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
It is great.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Just go back to 2007.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.640
Of course, a year after that talk, 2008 is when GitHub launched.

36:47.640 --> 36:53.160
And in that talk, Linus talks a little bit about how the tooling is going to get easier

36:53.160 --> 36:56.400
for people to use, and as the tooling gets easier, you'll have more and more people adopt

36:56.400 --> 36:57.400
it.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
And then a year later, GitHub.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
Right.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
GitHub drops.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.400
You just could.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.400
Yeah.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.840
How much that has changed things, I don't think you could necessarily have foreseen.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
Yeah.

37:05.840 --> 37:10.400
So Brent, I'm curious to know what it's been like, what you've learned.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.880
And if you're adopting any changes to your workflow.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Have you cursed at Git yet?

37:14.880 --> 37:17.000
I will actually say it's been fairly smooth.

37:17.000 --> 37:24.080
I'm in like the first minute of my Git journey, I would say.

37:24.080 --> 37:31.600
But there's a great tutorial that I found from a gentleman called Tech with Tim.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.200
And what I appreciate about it is just like super straightforward, and yet really well

37:35.200 --> 37:36.200
explained.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.560
So I'll make sure to link to that as well.

37:37.560 --> 37:44.040
I think sitting down and just wrapping your head around how everything interacts is probably

37:44.040 --> 37:45.800
worthwhile before even jumping in.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.860
I think the last time I tried to learn it, which I think was about two years ago, I tried

37:50.860 --> 37:53.120
to dive into the tooling right away.

37:53.120 --> 37:58.400
And because it has its own nomenclature, you know, branches and merging and I don't know

37:58.400 --> 38:04.480
if there's like probably 100 of that I don't know yet, but diving into the tooling first,

38:04.480 --> 38:10.160
I think was my mistake initially, because I didn't understand the whole concept and

38:10.160 --> 38:16.360
how that independence happens and how it all comes together, and how Git relates locally

38:16.360 --> 38:21.120
to something like GitHub or GitLab, you know, the other options out there.

38:21.120 --> 38:26.280
So I would really if someone's going to dive in, I would recommend learning the concepts

38:26.280 --> 38:33.360
first and wrap your head around the nomenclature and then those tools will come super easily,

38:33.360 --> 38:34.680
hopefully like they did for me.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.460
So I'm I think I had some really nice success so far.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.520
Hopefully I don't run into some roadblocks that kind of get me frustrated.

38:41.520 --> 38:48.440
But what it's meant is that I could do my first pull request on a project within, you

38:48.440 --> 38:56.640
know, a few hours of sort of diving in, which feels pretty darn great and has been for me,

38:56.640 --> 39:03.020
which I would imagine as many listeners, but kind of a goal is to give back to open source

39:03.020 --> 39:04.420
related projects.

39:04.420 --> 39:09.120
And I hope that this is kind of an enabler for me to just keep giving back.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.480
It's that value for value stuff we keep talking about.

39:11.480 --> 39:17.280
Yeah, you know, the that's part of the distributed and common nature of Git these days is it's

39:17.280 --> 39:21.920
the sort of lingua franca of being able to interact and to share with other developers

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
out there.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.640
You got to, you know, once you once you know Git, and it's a tool you can use to help Yeah,

39:26.640 --> 39:29.680
make updates, even if you see those updates until you can actually speak the language

39:29.680 --> 39:33.480
and help the tools share and, you know, interact and make it an easy way that someone can go,

39:33.480 --> 39:36.680
oh, yeah, I can I can accept these changes into my branch.

39:36.680 --> 39:41.560
That changes the game and like all good free software infrastructure, you can, you know,

39:41.560 --> 39:46.120
you could deploy something like GitLab on your own VPS or on your own LAN and keep it

39:46.120 --> 39:49.420
all local and use that and be perfectly happy.

39:49.420 --> 39:55.000
You could just use Git on the command line, or you know, you can use something like GitHub.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.480
And there's a lot of a lot of nice tooling built on top of this now, I don't want to

39:59.480 --> 40:04.240
step on office hours, because we kind of go in depth in office hours, but the new website

40:04.240 --> 40:10.160
will probably use Git for information updates that, in theory, one day, the audience could

40:10.160 --> 40:15.840
make a pull request on an episode of Linux Unplugged and add links or make modifications.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.320
And then we could merge that back in.

40:17.320 --> 40:22.240
And then we would regenerate the Hugo page automatically with a GitHub action.

40:22.240 --> 40:27.520
And it's a way to keep our links relevant and fresh and have people add content.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.120
And, you know, the only barrier to entry, you can be any audience member in the world

40:31.120 --> 40:35.160
out there, the only barrier to entry is you would have to know how to interact with Git

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
and GitHub.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.920
But that's a pretty low barrier to entry.

40:37.920 --> 40:42.040
And it could mean that something like, it's just sort of bringing our production one step

40:42.040 --> 40:45.960
closer to sort of being completely open, modifiable by the audience.

40:45.960 --> 40:52.440
And you can use Git and GitHub for tooling for show production, for website generation,

40:52.440 --> 40:53.800
obviously for projects.

40:53.800 --> 40:58.240
Well, Casey over in the Mumble Room points out it's not just for developers either.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.360
You can do stuff like a cookbook, say.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
Yeah, we've done that.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.040
We've done open your mouth recipes on there.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.400
We also have used it for bug tracking for some of the Jupyter broadcasting stuff.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.400
That's true.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.400
Notes.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
It's another area we've used it.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.360
So it's a really powerful tool.

41:12.360 --> 41:16.080
And you know, as time has gone on, Linus has kind of changed his tune.

41:16.080 --> 41:20.000
He was such a, he was really in cell mode back in 2007.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
But now he doesn't really need to.

41:22.000 --> 41:27.120
In Linux Action News this week, this past week, we covered the fireside chat that Linus

41:27.120 --> 41:29.200
had at the open source summit.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.280
There was a clip in there we played.

41:31.280 --> 41:36.600
And he talks, he kind of jokes that in some areas Linus is better known for creating Git

41:36.600 --> 41:37.600
than he is for creating Linux.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.840
And he's kind of joking about that.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.640
And then we cut the clip off.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.400
But I want to play the extended version of that clip because I think it shows you sort

41:44.400 --> 41:49.240
of the transformation Linus has had as a public presenter and sort of a more humble attitude

41:49.240 --> 41:50.240
he takes now.

41:50.240 --> 41:57.880
Linux is kind of my baby and I've been doing it for 30 years plus and it's what I do.

41:57.880 --> 42:07.240
My oldest daughter, when she went off to college and did computer science, I didn't push her.

42:07.240 --> 42:15.840
She emailed me back like a few months, a few weeks later and was laughing at the fact that

42:15.840 --> 42:24.400
I was known for Git at the computer science department even though I only did Git for

42:24.400 --> 42:25.400
six months.

42:25.400 --> 42:32.320
I mean I'll take credit for it but Git, it's not my baby.

42:32.320 --> 42:39.060
It was a side project that I just had to start to actually do Linux development.

42:39.060 --> 42:42.560
So all the actually credit for Git goes to Junio Hamano.

42:42.560 --> 42:50.720
So if you ever see Junio and you're a Git user, buy him a beer or something because

42:50.720 --> 42:56.480
he's been a great maintainer for Git and my name comes up much too often when it comes

42:56.480 --> 43:13.080
to Git.

43:13.080 --> 43:29.720
So

43:29.720 --> 43:31.280
itself is open source.

43:31.280 --> 43:35.040
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, organizations

43:35.040 --> 43:38.120
and many more worldwide for secure password and storage.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.680
And I don't just put passwords in there.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.800
I'll put credit information there for my credit card.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.320
I'll put, you know, like the numbers.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.160
I'll put my two factor authentication codes in there.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.720
So that way I can do passwords and two factor autofill.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.240
There's recovery keys I'll put in there for some software

43:52.240 --> 43:54.640
because I really trust the Bitwarden system.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.840
I trust the way they do the encryption, the security.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.680
I love the fact that it's open source.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.880
And I also love the fact that if I ever want,

44:00.880 --> 44:03.200
I could self host it as well with fault warden.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.440
And one of the things that I think gives people a lot of confidence

44:05.440 --> 44:07.560
is that sort of back out option.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.680
Maybe you've already tried Bitwarden,

44:08.680 --> 44:10.280
but you weren't aware of some of the new features.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.640
I wanted to kind of reach out to some of you out there

44:12.960 --> 44:14.720
that are already using Bitwarden.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.200
I want to suggest you try out the new username generator

44:17.720 --> 44:20.040
because, you know, I've I've used Bitwarden for a couple of years now.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.840
And I think this is one of the coolest updates they've done in a while.

44:23.080 --> 44:26.360
And they've just recently added like the one to punch.

44:26.360 --> 44:30.120
And now they can also create email aliases that work with things

44:30.120 --> 44:32.080
like simple login or Firefox relay.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.760
You just put the API key in and then they'll generate the username.

44:36.160 --> 44:39.360
They'll generate the password and they'll generate the email address.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.920
All unique to that side of that service.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.160
There's really no better way to manage your security.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.000
That's like the number one thing right there.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.720
You do that and you're just really protecting yourself from information

44:49.720 --> 44:53.080
leaks or even malicious types of activity.

44:53.080 --> 44:56.840
It's it's like the one thing and it's it's so simple

44:56.840 --> 44:58.600
and so straightforward with Bitwarden.

44:58.600 --> 45:01.520
Even if you've already set yourself up to maybe you have a family member

45:01.520 --> 45:04.600
or a friend or maybe a working environment

45:04.600 --> 45:06.800
that could use a little Bitwarden password hygiene.

45:07.120 --> 45:10.760
Send them over to bitwarden.com slash Linux, which is a great way for you

45:10.760 --> 45:13.400
or someone else to try it out for free or for a business.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.520
And of course, support the show.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.480
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.440
Well, the feedback bag is getting a little full in the corner.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.400
We better take a few off the top.

45:23.400 --> 45:29.560
And this first one, our buddy Tim from JPL and our favorite Linux copter.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.760
He's got a bit of a correction for us.

45:34.160 --> 45:38.440
Linux on the Linux copter is not real time.

45:39.080 --> 45:42.920
The kernel is too modified for us to be able to apply the real time patches

45:42.920 --> 45:44.800
to make it more real time.

45:44.800 --> 45:48.600
But as I mentioned in the first episode, the processor is just so dang fast

45:48.600 --> 45:51.080
that not being real time didn't really hurt us.

45:51.560 --> 45:56.040
And we also built some robustness into the design to mitigate when it might happen.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.920
I double checked. He's right.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.960
He didn't say it was a real time kernel.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.920
Yeah, he said that the hardware ended up being fast enough that they didn't need to.

46:03.400 --> 46:08.960
But I just remember being so like blown away by the fact that I was not even

46:08.960 --> 46:11.800
I didn't even consider the fact that, you know, for space operations,

46:11.800 --> 46:15.000
they might want a real time kernel. That was really what stuck out there. But it's interesting to know.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.680
It's just a it's not real time.

46:16.680 --> 46:20.680
Well, and I think maybe this underscores that the work getting the patch set

46:20.680 --> 46:23.920
more into the kernel that's been happening recently means that perhaps in the future,

46:24.400 --> 46:26.680
it won't be so much of a conflict here.

46:26.680 --> 46:29.120
You know, as they said, right, they had patches, merge conflicts,

46:29.120 --> 46:32.240
as we're talking about get this episode where they couldn't apply those two things.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.760
So as it becomes more standard, maybe that will make it easier.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.120
And even if they don't necessarily need it, but might help by the time they're building

46:38.120 --> 46:43.720
the next Linux copter, it might just be. Mainline, you know, we should also mention,

46:43.720 --> 46:48.440
Brent, that there is a really fantastic brunch coming up with Tim from J.P.O.

46:48.440 --> 46:53.960
Yeah, I got the chance to sit down with Tim a little while ago and record a wonderful conversation.

46:53.960 --> 46:57.800
Tim, it sounds like you're probably listening, so that'll come out.

46:57.800 --> 47:03.400
I think the weeks of the week of three, four, five July.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.680
We don't know the exact date, but keep in mind that it's going to be a little bit later.

47:06.680 --> 47:10.280
We don't know the exact date, but keep your ears open soon.

47:10.280 --> 47:13.000
Not this week, maybe next week. We'll see.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.760
And also, there is another episode of Brunch with Brent sitting in the tubes.

47:18.760 --> 47:22.360
If you're looking for it, I did a chat with Quentin that got released last week.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.120
So that's worth checking out, too.

47:24.120 --> 47:28.040
Extras.show for those right now. Go over there and get your brunch on.

47:28.040 --> 47:35.080
Dian wrote in about the Dev1 mentioning, does it come with the BIOS option to limit battery charge

47:35.080 --> 47:39.720
to say 80 percent to preserve the health of the battery while it is plugged in for long periods of time?

47:39.720 --> 47:43.400
This feature is sadly missing on most cheap laptops.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.640
I do remember seeing a limit somewhere when I was looking at it.

47:45.640 --> 47:49.480
Oh, did you? Because I just checked before and did not see one in the BIOS.

47:49.480 --> 47:53.000
So it's not in the BIOS, sounds like, which would be really nice to have.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.400
Of course, you could do it with several different projects.

47:55.400 --> 47:58.360
That's probably there. I hadn't really decided how I would do it.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.920
I still use TLP on my on my ThinkPad.

48:00.920 --> 48:01.720
Right.

48:01.720 --> 48:02.840
That could be one.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.560
Paula wrote in with podcast management between Linux and Android.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.680
I think he's got in the strugs.

48:06.680 --> 48:11.320
He says it would be nice and you think it'd be simple, but no, I'm using G Potter and a Tenopod.

48:11.960 --> 48:14.280
The G Potter dot net doesn't seem to be very stable.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.800
Do you guys have any suggestions?

48:15.800 --> 48:19.640
I think because they're using G Potter dot net for the back end on the podcast.

48:20.200 --> 48:24.760
You know, I'm going to toss a link in the show notes for an interview I did with Mitch from Podverse.

48:24.760 --> 48:31.720
And you can go to Podverse dot FM and it's a GPL podcast client that's available for Android,

48:31.720 --> 48:33.480
iOS and the Web.

48:33.480 --> 48:38.440
And its core feature is that it syncs between all three of those platforms on the Web version.

48:38.440 --> 48:39.960
It does support boosts.

48:39.960 --> 48:43.160
The boosts are still in beta development for the mobile version.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.200
There are beta versions of the apps floating around that have it, though.

48:46.760 --> 48:51.960
But the nice thing about Podverse is that you can finish what you're listening to on your desktop

48:51.960 --> 48:53.880
kind of like you can with Pocket Cast Web.

48:53.880 --> 48:56.360
But it's it's all just sort of inherent to Podverse.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.800
It's sort of the default.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.960
So I did an interview with Mitch, who's the developer.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.200
And I'll put a link to that in there.

49:02.200 --> 49:08.360
And you can, of course, search for Podverse in your in your play store or in the Apple App Store

49:08.360 --> 49:09.960
or go to Podverse dot FM.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.160
That sounds too radical.

49:11.160 --> 49:14.680
It does look like the back end for G Potter dot net is open source.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.840
So you could consider self-help in that.

49:16.840 --> 49:20.200
Isn't there I thought there was a way to also I've never tried that.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.920
I thought there's a way to sync you antenna with next cloud.

49:23.640 --> 49:24.440
Oh, that does sound right.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.720
I'm just not an antenna pod user.

49:25.720 --> 49:26.680
So I don't know.

49:26.680 --> 49:31.480
I don't know, but if you out there do send us a boost and we'll pass it along because

49:32.120 --> 49:33.800
a lot of people love that antenna pod.

49:33.800 --> 49:38.600
And if you could take that thinking and self-hosted, I think that'd be the way to go.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.000
What podcast do you think there's an app in the next cloud?

49:41.000 --> 49:41.800
Yeah, that's what it was.

49:41.800 --> 49:42.040
Yeah.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.800
So there's a G Potter app in next cloud.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.760
That's what it was.

49:44.760 --> 49:46.760
Brent, what podcast app are you using these days?

49:47.640 --> 49:48.760
That's a personal question.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.240
Yeah, I know.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.640
That's a very I don't know if I want to say.

49:51.640 --> 49:52.600
No, I'm just kidding.

49:52.600 --> 49:58.920
Antenna pods, the thing I've been using for a very long time, probably five years, and

49:58.920 --> 50:02.760
I haven't felt like changing ever since.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.080
Well, until some of these boost things came out.

50:05.080 --> 50:10.760
So I'm secretly hoping that they're sort of boost integration is going to speed up a little

50:10.760 --> 50:10.920
bit.

50:10.920 --> 50:11.400
We'll see.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.680
But I've been super happy with it.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.960
I will say it does just about everything I want.

50:15.960 --> 50:19.480
And now you're adding the sync functionality to that, which is news to me.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.000
So I don't know.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.720
I'm I feel pretty darn happy.

50:23.720 --> 50:28.440
We'll drop a link to the next cloud G Potter app so you can just think to your next that

50:28.440 --> 50:29.320
I'll say this.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.720
Fountain FM recently did an update and they have got me now.

50:33.720 --> 50:37.800
It's one of those where I initially with this update, I was like, that sounds like a scam.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
I am I am out.

50:39.800 --> 50:40.760
And then I started using it.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.000
I'm like, this is the only app I'm using now.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.520
So on my road trip using Fountain FM, I don't know if you can see that brand.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.160
Probably not.

50:47.160 --> 50:51.160
I earned 3000 sats listening to podcasts now.

50:51.160 --> 50:55.880
So what they've done on Fountain for most podcasts when you're listening, you earn sats

50:55.880 --> 50:56.680
in the background.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.920
They do this by two ways.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.920
One, the podcaster can help subsidize.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.680
So like I could incentivize listening.

51:02.680 --> 51:07.400
But the way they actually do it is they have just a couple of low key promoted clips that

51:07.400 --> 51:11.880
Fountain FM has a really active clips ecosystem where people are clipping podcasts and sharing

51:11.880 --> 51:15.800
them and you can follow each other and I clip and share podcasts and a bunch of the audience

51:15.800 --> 51:18.360
follows me and they clip and share their podcast.

51:18.360 --> 51:21.960
And I've discovered like a whole new I've got like three or four new podcasts and listen

51:21.960 --> 51:23.960
to on the regular now through this feature.

51:23.960 --> 51:27.960
And one of the things they've done is at the very top of Fountain FM, they now have a promoted

51:27.960 --> 51:29.000
they make it really obvious.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.320
These are very clearly promoted clips.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.040
They do stand out.

51:32.040 --> 51:32.600
And you know what?

51:33.320 --> 51:33.960
They're really not bad.

51:33.960 --> 51:39.160
They're either like, you know, two minutes of a of a podcast or it's essentially like

51:39.160 --> 51:44.600
a host read ad like not your keys, not your coins.

51:44.600 --> 51:50.680
Kasa pairs self-custody with best in class, but I mean, it's not bad, right?

51:50.680 --> 51:52.040
It's like eight seconds.

51:52.040 --> 51:54.840
And by listening to it, I just earned one hundred and seventy six sets.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.960
So that's how they're generating the revenue for the sats.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.280
And then by listening, you don't have to listen to ads to get the sats.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.400
You can listen to podcasts.

52:01.400 --> 52:05.480
I suppose that does help as a onboarding if you then want to use those sats to send out

52:05.480 --> 52:06.920
to some of the podcasts you listen to.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.040
So this is the advantage, right?

52:08.040 --> 52:11.160
It's an open system so I could send them to my wallet and I could just keep them.

52:11.160 --> 52:14.280
But now we've got three thousand sats, I could boost one of the podcasts I listen to.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.040
Hey, that's a whole sixty five cents almost.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.840
So it's actually legit.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.240
I thought it'd be, you know, he's streaming me sats.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.200
It actually is really good.

52:22.200 --> 52:29.880
I'm going to put my referral link in the show notes because then I get credit for you using

52:29.880 --> 52:30.360
it.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.640
And I'm Chris Lass over there if you want to follow me and hear my clips and stuff like

52:33.640 --> 52:33.880
that.

52:33.880 --> 52:35.400
You're taking some clips over there.

52:35.960 --> 52:37.320
I'm dropping clips every now and then.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.120
You know, sometimes Wes Payne says something real insightful and I put it on Fountain and

52:40.120 --> 52:43.640
then the other nice thing about Fountain is once you clip it, you can generate an audio

52:43.640 --> 52:46.920
file, you can generate a video file or you can generate a web link if you want to send

52:46.920 --> 52:49.080
somebody a link to listen to it.

52:49.080 --> 52:52.760
I just podcasting, it's been missing this and it's they've done a really good job.

52:52.760 --> 52:57.400
And it's actually fun to earn the sats just as listening to shows I would listen to anyways.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.800
And now I've got three thousand sats I can send to somebody.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.320
And here I am making clips for my family members with Reaper like an animal.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.520
Yeah, same.

53:04.520 --> 53:07.960
And now it is time for the boost.

53:07.960 --> 53:11.000
Mr. Adam Curry, the Podfather boosted in again.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.400
He says, boosting for Helipad, pew, pew, pew.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.120
Helipad is the tool.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.640
It is the tool.

53:19.640 --> 53:22.600
So thank you, Podfather, and thank you, Dave Jones, for working on Helipad.

53:22.600 --> 53:23.160
Indeed.

53:23.160 --> 53:28.120
It is a front end that pulls in all of the boosts and gives us information like what

53:28.120 --> 53:32.280
episode you were listening to, what app you used to send it with all the right information.

53:32.280 --> 53:35.400
What app you used to send it with all the right icons.

53:35.400 --> 53:39.080
It also has a fun confetti and sound effect that it creates.

53:39.080 --> 53:41.800
It's a real experience and it's a real time updating dashboard.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.720
So I can leave Helipad up on my screen.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.840
I think Adam does the same.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.600
That's what got you hooked right there.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.040
Yeah, and I just see the boost coming in.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.560
I just I totally love it.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.200
It's really great.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.640
412 Linux boosted in five days ago with 500 sats.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.240
This is my vote for the airwolf theme as the stream starter.

53:59.240 --> 54:03.880
Yeah, okay, we've been debating a song inspired by the Podfather.

54:04.440 --> 54:05.080
Here's what I'm thinking.

54:05.080 --> 54:08.920
I was listening to their live stream and I noticed that they play a song before the

54:08.920 --> 54:10.840
show every time and it's the same song.

54:11.400 --> 54:15.720
And then I realized like this is genius because it kind of probably gets them in like a mental

54:15.720 --> 54:16.760
head space.

54:16.760 --> 54:17.960
You know, you could be having a bad day.

54:17.960 --> 54:19.400
Maybe you're fighting a lot of the tech.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.080
Maybe it's 90 degrees in your studio.

54:21.080 --> 54:23.000
You forgot a pre-show again.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.720
And like if you could program your brain to get in the head space every time you hear

54:27.720 --> 54:29.800
the song, you hear the song and it's go time.

54:29.800 --> 54:30.760
It's showtime.

54:30.760 --> 54:34.760
And so we've been debating in our pre-show what song could we listen to over and over

54:34.760 --> 54:36.760
again that would get us in the right head space.

54:36.760 --> 54:40.680
And so 412 Linux is he's voting for airwolf.

54:40.680 --> 54:41.480
I want to sample it.

54:41.480 --> 54:44.520
So those that don't listen to the live stream get a little idea what airwolf sounds like.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.720
I'll just play a little bit.

54:45.720 --> 55:01.720
It's a classic like 80s style television show intro.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.080
It's pretty good, right?

55:07.080 --> 55:08.120
It's not great.

55:08.120 --> 55:09.720
It's not epic necessarily.

55:09.720 --> 55:15.320
But I realized wouldn't it be great if we picked a song that had different remixes?

55:15.320 --> 55:18.200
You know, so it has to be popular enough that there's different remixes.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.400
And you guys, this is where airwolf shines.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.200
Check out this remix.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.000
This is killer.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.160
Little helicopter sound effect.

55:32.040 --> 55:32.540
Right?

55:33.080 --> 55:36.040
Elite podcasters air dropping in to do our thing.

55:37.000 --> 55:37.560
Picture it.

55:38.680 --> 55:40.840
Podcast mercenaries talking about Linux.

55:43.000 --> 55:43.880
Yeah, right?

55:43.880 --> 55:45.320
Oh, it hits.

55:45.320 --> 55:57.080
Oh, yeah.

56:03.080 --> 56:13.080
Linux!

56:13.080 --> 56:16.120
Yeah, and it doesn't stop there.

56:16.120 --> 56:16.840
I got one more.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.800
See, airwolf has got one more remix that I think is a serious contender.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.240
Yeah, synthwave version, baby.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.360
They even sped it up a little bit.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.440
So I think airwolf could be a contender.

56:42.440 --> 56:47.000
I don't know if it's the right note, but I feel like it's got some serious range.

56:48.520 --> 56:51.880
I do think having remixes available is a strong plus.

56:51.880 --> 56:52.680
That's for sure.

56:52.680 --> 56:53.400
Yeah, yeah.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.320
And something we should consider in other contenders.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.240
Boost!

56:57.240 --> 57:01.720
Retro Matt boosted in six days ago with 9,250 sats.

57:01.720 --> 57:02.840
Chris, you got any guesses?

57:03.560 --> 57:04.920
9250.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.120
9250.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.600
I feel like it's almost a zip code.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.080
Is that the right amount of numbers for a zip code?

57:11.080 --> 57:11.800
That's a good amount, though.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.880
Nope, not the right amount of numbers.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.400
So I don't know.

57:15.400 --> 57:15.880
Good try.

57:16.680 --> 57:17.080
I don't know.

57:17.880 --> 57:18.920
Retro Matt, you'll have to tell us.

57:18.920 --> 57:19.880
We have zip plus four.

57:19.880 --> 57:21.080
That's zip minus one.

57:21.080 --> 57:21.880
Right, right.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.040
Maybe it's the last four digits of a phone number.

57:27.080 --> 57:27.720
Or they're soc.

57:28.440 --> 57:29.960
Yeah, yeah.

57:29.960 --> 57:30.440
They're right.

57:30.440 --> 57:35.640
During my freshman year at RIT, I learned of a band called The New Deal.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.960
This was also the year I first used Linux.

57:37.960 --> 57:42.200
To this day, I can still remember hearing their self-titled album for the first time.

57:42.200 --> 57:46.520
I've been listening to you guys debate over your new intro song and wanted to suggest

57:46.520 --> 57:49.080
a song called Receiver by The New Deal.

57:49.720 --> 57:53.240
It's off their self-titled album release in 2001.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.520
I think it's vibe is right.

57:54.520 --> 57:55.560
First boost.

57:55.560 --> 57:55.880
Whoop.

57:57.080 --> 57:57.640
All right.

57:57.640 --> 58:09.400
Tell me what you guys think.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.200
Now remember, you gotta listen to this every time before we start the show.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.320
It's not the new intro.

58:13.320 --> 58:14.840
It's the new pre-show start song.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
Gotta get you in the show mood.

58:17.960 --> 58:20.120
And you gotta be willing to hear it like a thousand times.

58:20.120 --> 58:21.640
Imagine we're doing a live event.

58:21.640 --> 58:23.160
We're sitting in front of an audience.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.200
We're playing this song.

58:25.160 --> 58:25.640
Okay?

58:25.640 --> 58:26.920
We're gonna use it forever.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.840
You're really frustrated because pipe wire somehow broke on you right before.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.760
I will say, right as I'm about to bail on this song, it drops into a new gear and I

58:34.760 --> 58:35.720
like it again.

58:35.720 --> 58:39.320
So it's about, like, right at this point, I start to get burned out and it's about to

58:39.320 --> 58:40.600
hit again and then I'm in again.

58:42.200 --> 58:43.320
I can see you burning out.

58:43.320 --> 58:44.200
I can see you burning out.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.160
I can see you burning out.

58:45.160 --> 58:46.040
I can see you burning out.

58:46.040 --> 58:46.840
I can see you burning out.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.640
I can see you burning out.

58:47.640 --> 58:48.680
I can see you burning out.

58:48.680 --> 58:49.720
I can see you burning out.

58:49.720 --> 58:50.520
I can see you burning out.

58:56.280 --> 58:56.760
Here we go.

58:56.760 --> 58:57.000
See?

58:58.200 --> 58:58.920
Just as I was done.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.720
I think we'd need to have, like, a phone prop with us so we could sort of, like, pick up

59:05.720 --> 59:06.200
the phone.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.080
Yeah.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.240
Yeah.

59:11.240 --> 59:14.280
And then if that phone was connected and it sounded like a phone and you could talk

59:14.280 --> 59:14.780
into it.

59:15.720 --> 59:16.440
Hey there, Wes.

59:16.440 --> 59:17.240
How's it going?

59:17.240 --> 59:17.740
You know?

59:17.740 --> 59:22.060
Be a sweet way if you had, like, audience questions too, like, you're, like, hanging

59:22.060 --> 59:24.060
on this, like, old corded plugged in phone.

59:24.620 --> 59:26.140
I don't feel like I could hear it again, though.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.940
I've heard it three times on the stream now and I feel like I'm done with it.

59:28.940 --> 59:29.900
Yeah, I was going to say the same.

59:29.900 --> 59:30.700
It's a good song, though.

59:30.700 --> 59:31.260
I enjoyed it.

59:31.260 --> 59:32.460
I enjoyed it the first time around.

59:32.460 --> 59:33.100
I enjoyed it.

59:33.100 --> 59:38.700
But I noticed that, well, because we are lucky to have this video thing that I'm not trying

59:38.700 --> 59:44.380
not to refer to, but I noticed that we were really getting to it with that Airwolf remix.

59:45.180 --> 59:45.740
And-

59:45.740 --> 59:46.700
That's true, yeah.

59:46.700 --> 59:50.780
I observed that we weren't quite into this this time playing this song around.

59:50.780 --> 59:52.940
So just an observation.

59:52.940 --> 59:53.440
Yeah.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.100
We were dancing.

59:55.740 --> 59:58.620
We are live video streaming over at JupiterTube these days.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.460
Bond boosted in six days ago.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.900
B-O-O-S-T.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.940
Thanks for the in-depth review on the Dev 1.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.460
I wasn't even thinking of it as an option until I listened to the episode.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.180
I've been using Pop!

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.580
OS exclusively for around two years now.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.580
I'm waiting for the Lamer Pro update to drop on June 23rd.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.020
I'll compare the two laptops and pick the one that may be my new main computer.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.220
Bond, I was the same way.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.260
I would never have considered buying an HP before this.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.860
No offense to people who enjoy HP.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.660
I just had a bad experience with several hundred of them.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.260
So I would never have bought one.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.780
But this, we've bought one.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.700
So like, there's one right here.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.420
Brett's got one.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.260
Like, yeah, yeah.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:35.980
Infestation.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.860
They did it.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.980
They actually did it.

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.780
Michael B boosted in.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.020
That B must be for boost, surely, right?

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.740
Two days ago with $6,000.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.020
Thanks for the review.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.380
I wouldn't consider an HP laptop otherwise as a good Linux machine.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.020
How about that?

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.060
OK.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.340
Well, you're not crazy, I guess.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:53.580
Yeah.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.580
But this is a good point that things can change.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.220
And surely, some of the partnership with System76 helps get some of those things right,

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.380
or at least make sure they don't go too far off course.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.140
It's nice to see.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:06.940
It is nice to see.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.140
I bet they were really nervous trying to crack that market, too.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.780
I could see that.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:18.540
Cdubs boosted in with a super geeky boost because he used the Boost CLI tool.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.040
Boost.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.100
That is really geeky.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.940
And he sent 10,101 SATs.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.140
Looks like binary to me.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.700
Yeah.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.140
I wonder if that's a binary message.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.140
There's a couple of bigger boosts in here.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:34.460
And I just wanted to say thank you, guys, because SATs are on sale right now.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.140
Probably going to be on sale for a little bit.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:39.980
And we still consider them, you know, they're the same SATs to us.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.100
So this is a great opportunity to boost the dip a little bit.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.980
And if everything works out, who knows?

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.820
But in a couple of years, you know, this 10,000 SAT boost may be something that helps the network.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.340
You know, like that could be something that it is a dollar amount that increases over time.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:02.140
So you can kind of boost today for something that continues to drive value for a long time.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:06.620
And that's one of the things I think is the most interesting about using lightning for the value

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:12.060
for value model is potentially there is an opportunity for an audience member to sort of get

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.700
some SATs on the cheap, send them to a podcaster, that podcaster or open source project.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:22.220
They sit on them for a couple of years and, you know, they're worth maybe twice what they were

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.260
worth or something like that.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.700
And, you know, what, you're out 10 bucks.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.380
The podcaster gets 20 bucks in a couple of years.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.500
I mean, it's an interesting it's an interesting setup.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.020
It's an interesting setup.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:31.660
That's all.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.940
I think it's a neat opportunity.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.740
Cdubs writes, boosting the NixOS router project.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.740
I'm going to I'm not going to use it on a Pi, though, but I have a question for you guys.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.500
Do you have a dedicated monitor or mouse for your router setup?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.140
I looked into tinypilotkvm.com and it requires a network, which I might not have where I'm working at.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.660
Thank you for the show.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:51.980
I think.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.460
Thank you.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.740
Yeah, I don't know what that acronym stands.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.260
T Y F Y C.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.740
We've thought about using like Pi KVM.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.500
Alex and I have talked about that quite a bit on the show.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.180
Yeah, totally.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.300
I think it is really nice.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.900
What I like to do, at least when we're setting up, is I like to have a table with a monitor,

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.420
mouse and a keyboard and a network hub just kind of there for the build.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.500
But then once I deploy it, no, I typically haven't had a monitoring keyboard on my routers.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.900
Yeah, same sort of if I if I'm careless enough that I really break it, then the punishment

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.180
I get is dragging a monitor over there, which is not the best system.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.780
KVM would be much, much slicker, but it in practice hasn't been too bad.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.460
And I imagine, especially with the NixOS set up, you know, it's going to be especially

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.260
resilient.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.340
I want a serial console.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.500
Yeah, is there a carrier board out there that has a serial console?

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.020
I could probably do USB to serial.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.380
That's the way to do it.

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.420
That's the way to do it.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:47.340
OK, but if we get that, that's the only way you're allowed to connect.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.980
Anonymous wrote in five days ago with 360 sats.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.980
Here's some sunshine and confetti.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.860
Thanks for another great episode.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:04.940
Kostpilin boasted in boasted in with 3690 sats as he do boos.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:10.460
There's a lot of critical opinions about the Umbral 0.5 release, which we mentioned recently

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:15.100
in their telegram groups, some downgrades of potential security or Bitcoin client versions.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.820
So I've heard a lot of folks that are sad after updating.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.220
I'm still on the old version myself, and I'm looking to manually update specific containers

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.580
and maybe do Docker overrides.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.460
Thanks for the show.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:30.620
Oh, so Umbral is this application platform you can use to self host a lot of really great

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.740
open source applications.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:41.020
Chat apps, Vault Warden, Photo Prism and Bitcoin node and Lightning nodes, and they've separated

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.980
them out of separate apps.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.260
And I think there's some growing pains.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:49.500
You know, I wonder, Wes, what would you recommend somebody backs up before they upgrade something

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.140
like Umbral?

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.220
So, you know, there's lots of tools.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.500
So it's using Docker containers under the hood.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.900
What do you the data directories?

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.740
I mean, what do you need to back up to be safe?

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.540
I almost feel like we should try this after the show and just see how it goes.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:09.260
See how I see if Umbral might be a motivation for if you don't, if you are using something

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.900
like an appliance, maybe you want it in a virtual machine that you can usually, you

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.340
know, easily snapshot.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.140
That sort of thing.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.580
Otherwise, yeah, you probably want to look at how it's set up specifically.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.900
Is it mounting things in directory wise?

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.380
Is it just using Docker volumes directly?

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.740
I don't actually recall, but that would be a place to start looking.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.620
Yeah, perhaps we'll dig into it.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:29.980
Break some things.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.860
I like it.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.420
The Golden Dragon wrote in again.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.060
Thank you very much.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.700
Three days ago.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.820
Two, two, two sets.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:36.940
Small duck row.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.620
Thanks for the double episode.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.060
I'm a duck.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:40.860
D.U.K.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.020
Duck loaded with talent.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:48.380
Grounded grid boosted in a week ago with 2600 sats.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.940
I'm late, but just installed Nix OS.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.100
Having a config file that defines my system reminds me of my other favorite operating

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.700
system, Emacs.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.500
I thought he was going to say FreeBSD because that's what Alan Jude used to go on all the

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.380
time about.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.980
You know, I've got that RC.com.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.020
Everything's in there.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:03.980
He was right.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.860
It's a nice thing to have.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.620
It is a nice thing to have.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:11.660
I love that Grounded Grid decided to keep doing the Nix OS challenge, even though we

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.700
kind of have stopped.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.220
I love that it's continuing on.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.340
I think that's awesome.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.300
Carry that torch.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.620
Grounded Grid also gave us a double boost.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.180
2600 sats.

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.540
Thanks for the great Jupiter content.

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.020
After listening for several years, I still get excited when new episodes are released.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.380
That's A so sweet.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.820
I think that's a goal, right?

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.380
So do we.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.020
Yeah.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.740
Well, we do, don't we?

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:36.860
We are very excited when they publish and they download.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.220
It's a nice relief, actually.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.860
So we agree with you on that.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.140
We also got some thank you boosts.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:54.220
100 sats from Tim B, 500 sats from User 412, 500 sats from IT Guy 05, and 500 sats from

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.740
User 95.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.940
Way better than the User 94.

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.980
Let me tell you what.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:03.980
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.180
Or maybe you're an antenna pod user.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.620
You love using antenna pod.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:11.580
You can grab Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology, and then you just add the podcast in there

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.580
and you can send in a boost without having to switch your podcast app.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.980
Or be extra nerdy with Boost CLI.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.220
Our picks this week are kind of on theme.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:28.140
We had to do the obligatory Get Kraken pick, which is, well, it's a gooey interface to

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.660
use GitHub, but do any of us actually use Kraken?

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.300
Get Kraken?

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:37.580
I find most of the utility if I'm trying to review like a complicated tree, you know,

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.940
like there's been a lot of branches going on or some complicated merges in the recent

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.140
history that I'm trying to review, like just what's happening or what the status of things

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.660
are day to day.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.460
No, not really.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.980
Yeah, I found it to be overwhelming.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.940
It was just too much for me.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.500
It's too much.

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.340
Too gosh darn much.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.300
But Brent suggested, and I think he's totally right, we should just include the awesome

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:02.380
Git list, which is on GitHub itself, which just includes some of the best tools for Git

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:02.860
out there.

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.140
It's kind of a meta pick.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.620
And we could go in and pick one or two, but the list is worth perusing.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.460
Yeah, send us some boosts about the tools that you liked or what it's missing, something

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.020
like that.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:18.220
Yeah, I'd love some suggestions on what I should use to make it either easier or better

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.620
or maybe resources on how to learn best practices, something like that.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.460
Padawan, stick with the command line.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.260
Come on.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.300
If you'd like to join us live, we do the show on Sundays around noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:30.940
Eastern.

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.340
Our Mumble Room is always up and going.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:37.820
You get a high quality Opus audio feed and you can jump in and share your thoughts as

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:38.460
we go along.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.580
Details are at linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.340
Jupiter.tube is where we're streaming the video version of the show, and it's available

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.420
for replay over there as well.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.940
And last but not least, if you're not checking out Linux Action News, well, then you're

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.460
missing on what the heck's going on.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.260
You're missing on it.

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.220
You should probably check it out.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.340
It's probably worth checking out.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.420
Linuxactionnews.com, go over there.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.260
Give it a listen.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.940
We got our matrix chat rooms if you want to join.

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.780
There's a LUP feedback chat room over there.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:09.660
There's a, okay, we got a whole whole rash of matrix chat rooms.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.380
What else?

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.340
Well, stay tuned for those exciting new brunches in the extras feed.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.500
You could just subscribe to the all shows feed and get all the shows.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.940
That's probably worth mentioning.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.540
I think that's all the stuff that's worth mentioning really.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.660
I can't really, if I can't think of it, how important could it be?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.540
There's probably more, but I'll just say join us live.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.340
See you next week.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.460
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.580
Yeah, good enough, right?

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.180
Links to everything we talked about today.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:37.180
Those are over on the website, linuxunplug.com slash, what is it, 464?

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:38.940
That's how it works.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.580
You just go there.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.500
Episode number, and you go there, and these are the links.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.060
Suspicious.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.500
At least until we screw it up.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.540
Yeah, it's that easy.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.900
Maybe we'll break it one day.

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.180
Of course, over there you can find our contact form if you want to send us your feedback that way.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.340
You also can join the gosh darn matrix rooms by the links over there.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.140
That's all there.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.220
We made it real easy for you, linuxunplug.com.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.140
A lot of those links should probably be on our main website.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:04.060
Yes, maybe branch will do a pull request to get that fixed up.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.340
In the meantime, thanks so much.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.460
We'll see who learns what it is.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.020
Yeah, right.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:07.340
Sure.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.220
Just almost there.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.500
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:30.620
See you next week.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:48.380
Well, we had ourselves a little bit of a technical challenge.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.140
Our OBS machine overheated during that shutdown.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.260
It is having a day over there.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.740
It did itself a little thermal throttle over there.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.060
Well, we're pushing it harder than ever these days.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:58.700
I know.

01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.100
I know.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.620
Well, it's because we're doing it's Brent, really.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.900
It's Brent's high quality face.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.460
Oops.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.500
Sorry, guys.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.300
Sorry, guys.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.060
It's that whole photography background.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.460
I had a follow up question for you.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.460
Both, actually, and maybe even the mumble room.

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.140
I talked a little bit about my teeny tiny Git journey so far.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.380
But Wes, I would imagine you've been using this for years and maybe even a different

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.100
versioning tool.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.860
And Chris, I'm curious about your history, too.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.060
So could you guys inform me, please?

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:26.620
What's your Git history?

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:32.940
You know, I've dabbled with the GitLab, but I've never had a real use case myself personally.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.980
I've thought about it for my desktop config management.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.100
I thought what a cool setup that would be is like my own hosted GitLab.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.460
And then like I'm checking in my dot files and all that kind of stuff.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.140
And then I started thinking, oh, I could do that with my next config and all that.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.860
But ultimately, I just use GitHub.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.740
I always have.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.700
I used it.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.980
I've been a member for a long time because I had private repositories on there.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.660
And that was sort of the way you did it back in the day.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.060
And it's always been sufficient for me.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.700
But I've never used it in like a day to day development practice.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:08.300
So I'm kind of like, I'm the most casual user possible with that kind of stuff.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.780
Do you interface with it much for the day job?

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.500
And is it actual GitHub or using Git?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.940
Is it local stuff?

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.860
Well, I use Git locally, of course, and kind of a hybrid.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:23.740
I do enjoy the support built into VS code is quite nice.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:28.780
Especially for if you're trying to resolve a tricky merge conflict, rebase, that kind of thing.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.300
The highlighting built in is nice.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.900
But otherwise, often just use the command line client as well.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.380
And then we've got a GitLab hosted internally.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.420
But no, I mean, that's kind of the output of my work.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:44.620
At the end of the day, it's a merge request or pull request that is attempting to make

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.900
changes to a repository.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.260
And that's the way I communicate.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.380
That's the way I exchange ideas and stuff with my co-workers.

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.300
So it's kind of fundamental to my job.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.740
Yeah, it's like the tangible thing that you produce at the end of the day.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.140
That's it.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:56.780
Yeah.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.300
How many of those have you made?

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.500
Between that and, you know, sadly, Jira tickets, that's kind of how it goes.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:01.980
That's weird.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.500
That's probably so true for so many people, too.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.260
And then maybe that'll be us.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.340
You know, one day when we're done, the end result is going to be an episode that we put

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.260
up on GitHub and the details and stuff like that.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.660
And then it goes out and it's a powerful idea.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:29.020
Ah, the dream.
