1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
A nice open source alternative to Google Hangouts, jangouts, did you know there's an open source

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,580
alternative to Google Hangouts?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,100
Alright, hold on, before you look it up, hold on, stop, here's my prediction, okay?

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,280
It will be something that is slightly less reliable than Hangouts, offers no real actual

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,980
production value over Hangouts, but will be open source.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,180
It's just kind of like the same thing with, like when the guy was like, there was that

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,000
web version of Jitsi, and yes, it exists, the web version of Jitsi exists, it sucks,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,220
it's totally unusable and really gives us nothing that Hangouts didn't give us, but

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,220
yes, it exists.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,220
It does exist.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,220
So now let's go look at jangouts.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,100
So this is a video conferencing software based on WebRTC and the Janus Gateway with a UI inspired

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,420
by Google Hangouts.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,620
It's called jangouts, it's Janus Hangouts, is what it stands for, it's a solution for

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,180
video conferencing on WebRTC, there you go.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,800
It's a JavaScript application running exclusively client side, the server simply needs to provide

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,740
a bunch of static files through the web server.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,620
You have to have a Janus Gateway set up, then you configure jangouts by checking it out

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,780
from the git server, then you install the required things like node.js and npm, and

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,180
then you get up and running, you get the node.js server started.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,580
Okay, so it's definitely more work than Hangouts, so what do I get for...

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,380
Yeah, your own self-hosted Hangouts.

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Okay, so how is that...

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
So it's a WebRTC...

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,540
So hold on a second though, we can already do a WebRTC.

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
I know, I don't get it.

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,360
And WebRTC doesn't offer me the ability to specify codecs or video resolution or audio

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,740
codecs or audio settings, I can't do that yet either, to the best of my knowledge, right?

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,100
I don't know, let's go to...

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Yeah, you're right.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,820
You might, well, see, this is why I'm surprised you're concerned, but don't you think you're

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,060
never gonna get those options unless it's something open?

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,060
No, I don't...

34
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,140
Well, no, I think they'll eventually get there, but until they do, there's no...

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,420
Here's the thing, I'm all for using an open source solution, I'd be the first one to say

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,420
I want to stop using Hangouts if an open source solution exists, but the problem is, it's

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,540
not even that the proprietary solution is better, it's that an open source solution

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,140
doesn't even exist.

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
It's not even that...

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,140
Well, Jitsi.

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Yeah.

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,620
I can get Jitsi to work, I am 100% confident of that, and when that works, then...

43
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,820
Can I tell you something though?

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Please.

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Please.

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
I don't even...

47
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I have a problem with that, even.

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
I don't even want it...

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
It's not perfect.

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
I don't want it even in the web browser.

51
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
I don't...

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
That's why I'm not...

53
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Well, Jitsi isn't.

54
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,740
I know, well, WebJitsi is, and this is, like all these WebRTC things are all in the web

55
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
browser.

56
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,700
I don't want it in the web browser.

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
You know what?

58
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,460
On its surface, I agree with you, and for the same reason that I think that...

59
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,540
For the same reason I haul around a laptop with me everywhere, because I'm just stuck

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,620
back in the time where that's what you did, but I think to some degree that as your and

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,740
I's perception of...No, hear me out.

62
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,180
Your and I's perception that a native application is more responsive, is more reliable, is more

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,700
stable than a plugin that runs inside of a web browser, because that's just a hacked

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,940
together solution to accomplish what we should be using a native client for.

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,500
I agree that there is...

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,060
I do carry a bit of that bias, and it does make me inclined to think that.

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,460
However, I'm now going to just say I'm basing this on empirical data.

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,620
You look at all of the video teleconferencing we do in this network to make remote host

69
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,020
possible, and unquestionably, the least reliable solutions are always the web-based ones.

70
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah, but you've also shoehorned a solution that was never meant to be...

71
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,100
Hangouts is great for you and Angela to sit there and chat.

72
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,740
No, Hangouts is meant for group chat.

73
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,340
Okay, fine, fine.

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,420
Great for you and Dylan and Angela and a couple other people to sit inside of a Hangout and

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,420
chat.

76
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,140
It is not meant for transmitting broadcast quality content from one location to another.

77
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,420
It's not what it's there for.

78
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,180
To be fair, neither is Jitsi, and we're shoehorning that into a solution as well.

79
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,920
But I think that the differentiating point is that Hangouts is that it wasn't designed

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,540
for it, not the fact that it's web-based.

81
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,960
I don't think it'd make any difference if Hangouts was a native application.

82
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,060
I think it would be better suited to broadcast.

83
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,580
In terms of the video codec quality and the audio codec quality, connection quality, and

84
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,260
maybe even UI design.

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,340
Maybe UI design, maybe not.

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,860
All of that doesn't matter that's in the browser.

87
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,060
The browser doesn't change any of that.

88
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,460
What the browser introduces is instability, because it is one more huge, gigantic piece

89
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,340
of software that has all of the strategy attacks associated with it that Google has with Chrome,

90
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,180
or that Mozilla has with Firefox, or that Apple has with Safari, or that Microsoft has

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
with IE.

92
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,680
There's all of this strategy attacks that's associated with these browsers that all get

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,480
tugged and pulled in different ways that the market wants them to go, well, you kick that

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,620
guy out of the room.

95
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,860
They want us to all go in different ways.

96
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,500
They want to build a platform on their web browser.

97
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,740
They're building in things like remote desktop and WebGL, all this really great technology

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,780
that I don't need in my video communications program.

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,460
I just need something that makes calls and does video.

100
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,540
I don't need this entire runtime.

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,980
The browser is feeling like the Java runtime to me.

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,620
The browser is feeling like this entire massive virtual environment I have to have now to

103
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,980
run these web applications.

104
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,380
I don't want that much dependency and that much room for failure and that much room for

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,900
software bugs to sit between me and my call.

106
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,460
There is something to that is that we do introduce a lot of unneeded overhead to get done what

107
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
we want to get done.

108
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,340
The advantage to that though is that we get access to a wider variety of applications

109
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,900
on this common platform, which is the web browser.

110
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,140
But I think that whatever we do, if we plan to do this on Linux, I think we have to accept

111
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,500
that we're going to have to shoehorn some solution that wasn't really meant for broadcasting,

112
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
kind of shoehorn it in.

113
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,540
But I think that between you and Rekai and I, I think we can figure out how to do that

114
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,600
so that most of the people won't notice.

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,060
When Jitsi worked, it worked great.

116
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,060
I know.

117
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
It's just getting it to work.

118
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,420
I want to see more effort behind native apps.

119
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,420
I really do.

120
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,700
But you're right, there's less incentive for a lot of these people to make stuff natively

121
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
for Linux.

122
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,060
So a good web app is our best next option.

123
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,500
And I don't think we shouldn't have web apps.

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,580
I just wish it wasn't like, it feels like, I guess maybe this is more to my point, to

125
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,720
nuance down what I'm trying to say a little bit is I feel like all of the really interesting

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,060
development in video conferencing right now is all happening in the web browser.

127
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,500
And there's really nothing happening on the native app.

128
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,980
You've got Skype, you've got Jitsi, you've got telephony apps, Ecogea, things like that.

129
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,340
But there's nothing really interesting happening in the native client-side application for

130
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
video conferencing.

131
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,220
All of the interesting things, all of the development, all of the energy, all the time

132
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,540
is being focused on these web-based solutions.

133
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,980
And WebRTC is a huge part of that.

134
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,380
And I'm just, here we are, years into WebRTC, and I'm still not super impressed.

135
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
It does...

136
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
But it is getting close.

137
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,020
And if you just want to hang out with some buddies while you're playing a game, it's

138
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,740
like it could be a real easy replacement for Mumble.

139
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Right.

140
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,940
And Mozilla, Firefox, Hello, whatever, like things...

141
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Which is an RTC solution.

142
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Yep.

143
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,940
And it works great for that.

144
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,740
So it's not that I don't want that to continue, because I absolutely want that to continue.

145
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
I just also want...

146
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
For a different reason.

147
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
I want native apps to continue, too.

148
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
I don't...

149
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,260
I wish we wouldn't just chase the shiny so much.

150
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,500
I wish we could continue to invest in technologies that have some good fundamentals behind them.

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,380
So and you know, Palasso asks a question in the chat room, and we've gotten this in numerous

152
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,260
times in the feedback, which is why don't we use a separate video stream and an audio

153
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
stream.

154
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
And the reason for that is very simple.

155
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,260
When you send two different pieces of information from one location to the other...

156
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Especially over the internet.

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,820
They arrive at different times.

158
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,860
And not only do they arrive at different times, that time changes.

159
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
It drifts.

160
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Yeah.

161
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
And so sometimes the audio is ahead, and sometimes the video is ahead.

162
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Yeah.

163
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
And to make Rakai sit there...

164
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,420
You would employ a full-time person eight hours a day just to do a show where they have

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,980
to sit there and line that up.

166
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
It's just not practical.

167
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
We just wouldn't do video.

168
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Yeah.

169
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
It's just not practical.

170
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Yeah.

171
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
But yeah, I give you my vote.

172
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,340
You may not...You may not always...Everyone may not always agree with...Attack the same

173
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,620
problem the same way, just like I probably wouldn't solve the same problems that you

174
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
would solve the same way.

175
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,540
But I can tell you this.

176
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
I have a strategy.

177
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
I have an idea.

178
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,180
And once I think I put it down, I think we'll have a reliable Jitsi solution that will work.

179
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,380
You just have to approach that box as if it's...Just pretend I am production co, and I just sold

180
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,380
you a $5,000 video conferencing box, and you don't know what software is running on it.

181
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
It's a magic box.

182
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,380
Yeah.

183
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
It's a magic box.

184
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
And you just click on the button, and then it works.

185
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Yeah.

186
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,660
That makes...That makes you make an appliance, and it stays reliable, and you don't use it

187
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
for other things.

188
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Right.

189
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Yeah.

190
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,180
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 102 for July 20th, 2015.

191
00:07:51,180 --> 00:08:07,340
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting really hydrated.

192
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,060
Because we've got some beer drinking to do tonight.

193
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
My name is Chris.

194
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
My name is Noah.

195
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Hey, buddy.

196
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
What are you doing in studio?

197
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
I don't know.

198
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,420
This is the show I belong on, though, because even if it's unplugged, I still like Linux.

199
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Yeah.

200
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Yeah.

201
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
You were on Coder Radio early today.

202
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
I appreciate that, being a non-developer and all that.

203
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Yeah.

204
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Yeah.

205
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
You did good, man.

206
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
You did good.

207
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah.

208
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
We've got a great show coming up today.

209
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
We're going to do a quick update on the latest news for Ubuntu Touch in a little bit.

210
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,380
And also, our friends over at Ubuntu Matei Project have an update.

211
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,620
They're just asking people to test.

212
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,180
We'll do a little coverage on that.

213
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,600
The Free Software Foundation and the Software Conservancy have announced a deal with Canonical,

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,140
a little change to the contributor agreement.

215
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,340
We're going to talk about that today, because we've covered that before.

216
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,260
AMD has a dirty secret.

217
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
And I'll tell you it.

218
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
It'll make your Linux games actually work a lot better.

219
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
It's very easy.

220
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I'll tell you about that.

221
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
If you've got an ATI card.

222
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
This is them?

223
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Yeah.

224
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Right.

225
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Ouch, dude.

226
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,680
And then, your good buddies, your friends over at Dell, they just took a crap on Linux

227
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
users again.

228
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh, no.

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,280
Right after they released that computer.

230
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
That's the problem, actually.

231
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh, no.

232
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
No, it's not.

233
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Yes, it is, actually.

234
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
That's not the problem.

235
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,420
So, we're going to talk about that in the second half of the show.

236
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,220
And then, there's also something that I have been predicting for like two prediction episodes,

237
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,500
you know, like we do them at the end of the year in Linux Action Show.

238
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah.

239
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,220
Two years in a row, I've been predicting something.

240
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,540
And we haven't really seen it take off today.

241
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
So wouldn't that mean it's wrong?

242
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
No, it was delayed.

244
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
It was delayed.

245
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Oh, okay.

246
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
All right, all right.

247
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Delayed, delayed.

248
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
All right.

249
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
I hate you, no.

250
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,780
I hate you, no and why Linux users will run and scream in fear, because look at that.

251
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
They're actually...

252
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Don't look at what it is.

253
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Don't look at what it is.

254
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Okay, all right.

255
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm not.

256
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
I'm not.

257
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
I'm just looking at the price.

258
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
I'm just going to say it was a Kickstarter.

259
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
They had a goal of $50,000 and they've already raised $530,000.

260
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh, my goodness.

261
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
And it's going to replace the Linux desktop.

262
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
Don't look.

263
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Not looking.

264
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
All right, fine.

265
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
All right.

266
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
So, before we get into that, I wanted to start.

267
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,580
Hugo Sylvia, who we've met, I think, at one of the conferences before, writes for opensource.com.

268
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,920
And he did a pretty interesting write-up about different open hardware platforms that

269
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,700
are out there right now, and I just wanted to show you this one, Noah, because I think

270
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
you're going to like this one a lot.

271
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,660
Now, there's a whole list.

272
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,740
This one, though, from Old Spice.

273
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,560
This is an open hardware platform.

274
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,380
This is Old Spice muscle music.

275
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,380
Have you seen this?

276
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
No.

277
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
You have not seen this?

278
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
Okay, good.

279
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,740
So, can you describe to the people listening what's going on right now?

280
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,220
Well, I'm looking at a mostly naked man.

281
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,020
He does seem to have something covering his band bits, and now he is flexing his muscles,

282
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,580
and drums are going off.

283
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Oh, my goodness.

284
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Yeah.

285
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Muscle, muscle, muscle.

286
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:39,060
So, he's flexing individual muscles, and each muscle correlates to another instrument.

287
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
So he's able to-

288
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Well, those are all drums, I would say.

289
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
By flexing his chest, his gut.

290
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
And here's his keyboard solo.

291
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Okay, all right.

292
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Never mind.

293
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Not just drums.

294
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Nope.

295
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Oh, my.

296
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Yeah.

297
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:55,140
So, this is the advantage of open hardware.

298
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,140
You can build things like this.

299
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Yeah.

300
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
Now he's playing flame sax.

301
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,540
Those are saxophones that are blowing fire.

302
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
For you audio listeners, you really do have to watch this.

303
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,940
This might be worth sharing even online, because this is actually pretty funny.

304
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,540
Now they have a view behind him, too.

305
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Would you mind explaining what this has to do with Linux?

306
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Open hardware, buddy.

307
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Open hardware.

308
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,840
So, this is over at opensource.com, and this is just to sync you.

309
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
This is just to hook you.

310
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm going to recommend the rest of you go check out the article.

311
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,700
They actually have a whole list of different types of hardware and different projects.

312
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,780
All kinds of stuff, like neuro knitting, error writing.

313
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,460
This will work if your body isn't made out of stone and then chiseled, right?

314
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Yes.

315
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
How about this one?

316
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
This one we've talked about before.

317
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,060
And they're actually developing this under Linux.

318
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,000
We've talked a little bit about it, but it's about controlling your devices using x-ray

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,060
and sonar and stuff like that.

320
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,380
So it's like for people that have a lot of different disabilities, or just another way

321
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,100
to interact with the computer, and they're developing all of this under Linux.

322
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,800
And they have, so you don't even have to touch the device in order to move the cursor and

323
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
things like that.

324
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,260
They're going to try to build them into laptops.

325
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
There's another example.

326
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,740
There's a whole bunch over at opensource.com that was written up.

327
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,220
I just played the old Spice one because I thought that one was kind of funny.

328
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
It was amazing.

329
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
It was.

330
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,860
And if you got to watch the video version, you know why I played it.

331
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,420
So just before we went right on air, Popey jumped in the room, and I was just starting

332
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
to pick his brain.

333
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,100
I saw, I think it was you, Popey, that tweeted, you're getting a new update coming out to

334
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
your MX4.

335
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,780
And it looks like this is the fifth over-the-air update since the device shipped.

336
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Is that right?

337
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Absolutely.

338
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Yeah.

339
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Tell me about it.

340
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
Yeah.

341
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,460
So I've just pasted the link to the release notes in your IRC channel.

342
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,220
Thank you, sir.

343
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,580
And so this update went live.

344
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,700
It was tested over the last couple of weeks, and it went live today.

345
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,020
And that goes straight out to MX4, Mazer MX4 users, and the BQ phone users in 4.5 NE5.

346
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
So wait a minute.

347
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
Hold on.

348
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,420
You're telling me you can push out updates.

349
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,540
Hold on now.

350
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,300
Now the carriers are going to hold on to these updates, and the BQ is going to get it in

351
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,460
a couple of months, right?

352
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
That's how this works?

353
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
No.

354
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
Yeah.

355
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
So that's why.

356
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,500
I mean, I've mentioned this before on the show, but we split the updates up.

357
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,740
The bit in the middle that you have to worry about, the Ubuntu stack, we update that, and

358
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,340
we put those updates out.

359
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,700
We do partner with BQ and Meizu, and those guys do a lot of testing as well.

360
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,180
So we don't just push out updates to their customers, because they are effectively their

361
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,180
customers.

362
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,300
We get it validated first, and it went out today.

363
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,300
And usually we do phased updates, where it goes out over a 24-hour period, and you may

364
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,380
get it straight away, or you may get it later on, or you may get it tomorrow.

365
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,700
But this time we did it all in one hit, so everybody got the update at the same time.

366
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Yeah.

367
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
It's cool.

368
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Isn't it?

369
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
It is really nice.

370
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,460
And UI improvements, new icons, a new theme, but the big thing is shell rotation, which

371
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,780
everything was mostly locked in portrait mode, but now we've made it so that you can

372
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
use it in portrait and landscape.

373
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Ah.

374
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
You know, there's something else.

375
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,340
And I thought maybe it was just my Nexus 5, and I still kind of write it off as just something

376
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,340
on my Nexus 5.

377
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,980
I've heard now from a couple of different folks that have, I think maybe they're using

378
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,780
the BQ, I'm not sure, but huge, huge ranges in battery life.

379
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,180
Like some battery life is like unbelievably long, and some battery life is unbelievably

380
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
short.

381
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
What's going on there?

382
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
Is that something?

383
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah.

384
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
So some of it is device-specific.

385
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,660
So the BQ ones that we worked on early on and discovered some ways in which we can improve

386
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
battery life.

387
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,260
And they can go for days and days and days on standby, just sat on your desk and not

388
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,260
plugged in.

389
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Yeah.

390
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
These phones are on standby for like three days.

391
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,060
They're getting battery life of three days on these Ubuntu phones.

392
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
One standby.

393
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,820
And then you turn it back on, or you wake it up and it's got 50% battery left, or some

394
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,020
crazy amount of battery.

395
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,460
Whereas the Meizu, we've got some known problems with it at the moment, and that's a critical

396
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,100
bug, a high-priority critical bug that's being worked on at the moment.

397
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
And I'm not sure the status of it.

398
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,660
I've been on vacation for the last week, so I'm not sure the status of it right now.

399
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,380
But I know there was talk of, you know, networking issues, holding, you know, chewing up.

400
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,020
And I was almost wondering if it was just the display sensor, it almost seemed like

401
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
a display bug too.

402
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,500
Like maybe it just wasn't reading the first time.

403
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,420
No, there's stuff going on in the background, and it's, you know, it's not necessarily,

404
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,100
I don't know the technical details, but it's, yeah, it's being worked on.

405
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah, it's cool.

406
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,980
I'm waiting for Noah to get one.

407
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,300
Yeah, here's the thing.

408
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,420
I get more and more convinced every time I see them, when we were at Self, I get a chance

409
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,020
to play with the Ubuntu phone, and there was a couple people there that were using it as

410
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,980
a full-time device, which back at Scale, which mind you was just six months prior, they were

411
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
showing them.

412
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,260
They were like, no way would we ever carry these as a full-time device, it's just not

413
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
there yet.

414
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
That's in six months.

415
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,660
And do you remember at Scale, like they had to borrow somebody's phone.

416
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, to come over and do the demo.

417
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,500
And now itself, like people are using those full-time phones, just in that amount of time.

418
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Yeah, it is.

419
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
It has crazy cool development.

420
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,700
You know, and I guess I have two concerns.

421
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,300
One is, my one concern is, will there be a competitive advantage that you'll be able

422
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,880
to leverage against things like iOS and Android?

423
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,700
But past that, if that can be solved and we can get actual decent apps on it, I'm all

424
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,900
in for a Linux, for an actual Linux-powered phone.

425
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Hmm.

426
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
You know, let's open this up to the whole Mumbroom.

427
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Time appropriate greetings, Mumbroom.

428
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,600
Do the rest of you have any thoughts on the future of maybe you?

429
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,180
The whole world, I'm not asking about everybody else, I'm not asking about all this different

430
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,220
platform wars.

431
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
Just you.

432
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,100
Is anybody in the room waiting for a device to come on sale in their country, or is almost

433
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,180
ready to pull the trigger now?

434
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,700
Anybody speak up if you are, because I'm really curious to know if anybody else in the Mumbroom

435
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,780
is walking the same fence that Noah is, and is willing to maybe try taking a plunge.

436
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm buying the MX4 as we speak.

437
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,300
Who's that?

438
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,060
Who said that?

439
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
That's great.

440
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
At the beginning.

441
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
That's great.

442
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Oh, well, will you come back?

443
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,660
Will you let us know your opinions on it and how it goes for you when you do get it?

444
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Sure.

445
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,740
I'll be on the whole experience now to have a laptop on desktop running Ubuntu 15.04 as

446
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
well now.

447
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Ooh, very nice.

448
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
Very nice.

449
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,100
You still can't use the MX4 in the US, right?

450
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,940
On anything greater than 2G or whatever it was?

451
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
I think, yeah.

452
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,620
Like, you only get like a couple of the bands or something, I'm not sure.

453
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,100
In the UK, so it's not so much of an issue, because we're pretty much stuck on 3G and

454
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,580
hints of 4G.

455
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah.

456
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,780
Razer, you want to try getting one?

457
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,300
Yeah, you're in the UK, could you pick one up?

458
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,620
Yes, but for me it's just finances at the moment, so I'm keeping an eye on eBay and

459
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,780
seeing if I can pick up a Nexus 4 cheap.

460
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,780
Oh, yeah.

461
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,780
Oh, yeah.

462
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
The Force, yeah.

463
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
My phone is a Nexus 4.

464
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,020
I do actually have one, but it's my primary unit, it's Android at the moment.

465
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
Yeah.

466
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,820
It's a bit of wear and tear, so I would like to pick up another one just for a few quid

467
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,220
and then root it and run it and see what it's like.

468
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,540
You know, I've had a lot of fun with my Nexus 5, but I know it's not really, you know, I

469
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,780
don't really use it to judge the quality of the release of the OS because I know it's

470
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,540
not a target platform, so I use that on Ting.

471
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:09,100
If something that was better than Nexus 4 and compatible with Ting's GSM network, I

472
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,760
think I would get a dedicated device.

473
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,100
If I could get like maybe something that worked, I want to have all the bands available, because

474
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,700
I don't want to be out there and be like, oh, this thing's so slow and have it affect

475
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,140
my opinion of it.

476
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Right.

477
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
Yeah, and it would.

478
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
It would.

479
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
And that's been my hesitation too.

480
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,340
And I'm still waiting for it to get kind of get, I guess, a little more.

481
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,500
It does get more time in the oven.

482
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Yeah, right.

483
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,340
But here's the thing that is so crazy to me is how fast things are maturing.

484
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:41,060
How fast things are going from not usable to usable to totally replaceable.

485
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Yeah.

486
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,540
I guess we didn't say this early in the show, but Noah's in studio today because we're

487
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
going down to OSCON tomorrow.

488
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Did we mention that?

489
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Are we going to OSCON tomorrow?

490
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Yeah.

491
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Oh, that's good.

492
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,740
We're going to be there Wednesday, and that's why we're recording on a Monday today for

493
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,060
the Linux Unplugged show.

494
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,220
And I'm going to keep an eye out.

495
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm going to be seeing like what is, you know, we always do this anyways, but I'm going to

496
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,500
keep an eye out and see if we see what.

497
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,940
You think we, Noah has a red book prediction that we'll see zero devices that are not Android

498
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
or iPhone.

499
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Maybe.

500
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
We'll see.

501
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
We'll see.

502
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Android.

503
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Did you say Android or iPhone?

504
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Yeah.

505
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Okay.

506
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
I think they're all going to be Android or iPhone is my bet.

507
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
You think we'll see any Firefox?

508
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
Well, except for presenters.

509
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,300
I think presenters might have some there.

510
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Yeah.

511
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Hmm.

512
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
All right.

513
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,880
Well, I think you'll see, depressingly, I think you'll see a whole lot of MacBook Airs

514
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,500
and MacBook Pros at OSCON.

515
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, we do.

516
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Sadly.

517
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,460
Well, that's true for a lot of conferences too.

518
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Yeah.

519
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Yeah.

520
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,660
That is, but so that's true for, I think that's true for the, for the conferences that are

521
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,860
very business oriented.

522
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
I think that MacBooks tend to dominate that.

523
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,340
I think for the community oriented ones, I think that's very much not the case.

524
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,160
So for example, the email that went out to the presenters were, if you bring some freedom

525
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,980
hitting device, bring your own adapters because we won't provide them for you and we won't

526
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
help you set them up.

527
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,580
I, the irony though is the, is the ThinkPad really any less freedom hating?

528
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,620
I think that Apple has a prescribed incentive.

529
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,660
Remember that wireless thing you talked about?

530
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,980
Yeah, yeah, which apparently has gone away on the X series, which I told you.

531
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Okay, good.

532
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,860
But, so Apple has a prescribed, a prescribed advantage to having people keep Mac OS on

533
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
the laptop.

534
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I agree with that.

535
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,260
Whereas I don't think Lenovo really cares what OS is on the laptop as long as you're

536
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
buying their hardware.

537
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,140
But I do agree that Apple in that regard, and I just meant from a totally like, from

538
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,420
a fundamental standpoint.

539
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
No.

540
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,140
From like a, from an actual like.

541
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
No.

542
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,580
No, and I don't think I've ever said otherwise.

543
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,260
Unless you're buying a System76, I don't, or the Librem, I don't think you can, or the

544
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,780
ThinkPenguin stuff, I don't think you can truly make an argument that you're significantly

545
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,340
better one brand over the other.

546
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,220
That said, if you have a glowing white Apple on the back of your computer, I feel like

547
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,020
even if you're, yeah right, even if you're running Linux on that, I feel like you're

548
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,500
advertising to everyone else that you don't, that you're not particularly a fan of Linux

549
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
on the desktop.

550
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I heard you, I heard you speak up for a second.

551
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,060
Did you have thoughts, is the ThinkPad maybe more freedom respecting than the MacBook,

552
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,940
or is it a silly metric, or what do you think?

553
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,420
It's, yeah, I think it's a bit daft, because they've all got non-free blobs in them somewhere

554
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,020
or other, unless you like go full RMS and get a MIPS like funky laptop.

555
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,300
But the difference is you're paying with your dollars.

556
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,900
You know, if you're buying an Apple laptop, then you're giving money to Apple.

557
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,860
You are funding that system, whereas if you go and buy a System76 machine, you are fundering

558
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:30,700
the smaller guy who is producing laptops which are more open, more free, and...

559
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,820
Well, there's also the aspect that they contribute to the community in regards, and that they

560
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,020
maybe help further development of that platform.

561
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,820
So in the vendors of ThinkPenguin and System76, they, even if they have a proprietary blobs,

562
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,020
and they have, you know, they're not using some core boot or something like that, they

563
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,620
are still contributing to Linux in a greater capacity.

564
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Well, not only that, I think you're underselling that.

565
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,500
When you buy a ThinkPad, you're buying a vote for a Windows license.

566
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,340
I think you're underselling that a bit in that it's more than just that.

567
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,860
I mean, there may be proprietary blobs in there, but they're not hindering proprietary

568
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
blobs.

569
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,740
So, I can get to my BIOS and boot UEFI or native BIOS boot if I want to.

570
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,580
That is actually, as it turns out, pretty difficult to do in some of the newer computers.

571
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,580
That is a nice thing to be able to turn on.

572
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,620
Yeah, I mean, and so there are a lot of, I think there's a lot of little things like

573
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
that.

574
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,260
And I think that ThinkPad gets its reputation, its positive reputation from Linux users

575
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,820
in that all the things I want to do on the ThinkPad, I can, even if it's not totally

576
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,740
a free computer, I can guarantee you, I'll go on record and say right now, you find me

577
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,380
any ThinkPad, I'll plug a thumb drive into it, I'll boot into it, and it'll let us work

578
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
on the box.

579
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
And it's been like that for a long time.

580
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Right.

581
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
And I think that's what's built that reputation up.

582
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Right, right.

583
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,060
Not necessarily that they care about freedom, it's just that you can get Linux to work on

584
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,260
it almost as if it was right out of the box.

585
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,220
And that is exemplified by the fact that Red Hat issues ThinkPads to all of their employees,

586
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
right?

587
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,380
Yeah, I mean, I think the end practical result is you can't deny you're going to have a better

588
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,740
bet if you just go to Best Buy and you have to buy a laptop at Best Buy, you're going

589
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,020
to have the best chance with a ThinkPad.

590
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I don't necessarily know.

591
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
If you can buy ThinkPads.

592
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,700
If that's enough, though, for me.

593
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Yeah, in a perfect world, it wouldn't be.

594
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,980
Because I'm asking about personal use, not like what you recommend to people or businesses,

595
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
just for my personal use.

596
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,060
Yeah, so personal use is you want to go with a computer that you're going to have the least

597
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
amount of trouble.

598
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,620
So then you would go with something like System76, but there are some hard limits of System76

599
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,620
in that, for instance, screen size.

600
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,540
I don't like anything bigger than a 13-inch laptop.

601
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,980
And I can't buy a 13-inch laptop from System76.

602
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,980
So I like, there are a lot of people that like aluminum chassis.

603
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,220
To the best of my knowledge, System76 doesn't make a laptop with aluminum chassis.

604
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,700
What size screen is your Lemure?

605
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
A 14.

606
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Oh, okay.

607
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Yeah.

608
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,540
Yeah, I mean, so, yeah, I think, I guess what I, to come back to sort of bring this all

609
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,860
together is I think there's not a great option either way.

610
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,620
And I guess what I kind of want to get to is I don't like that we sometimes shame people

611
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
for the hardware choices.

612
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,060
I just rather they run Linux.

613
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
No, I agree.

614
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,540
This is actually what I told the Mozilla girl when we were at scale.

615
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,300
She had a MacBook Air, but she never actually booted, she never even booted Mac OS on it.

616
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
She got it, she opened it up, she formatted it, wiped Mac OS totally off and put Linux

617
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
on it.

618
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,640
That's, to me, that's 98% effective.

619
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,380
The only thing is, is when I walked by the Mozilla table for the first two days, I assumed

620
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,780
she was running Mac OS because she had a glowing white Apple on the back of her laptop.

621
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,620
But that's, like I said, in the grand scheme of things, that's like 2% out of the 100.

622
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,580
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

623
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,420
Whereas when I was at FOSDEM, there were people from Mozilla giving talks at the FOSDEM, Free

624
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Open Source Developer European Meeting, giving talks from their MacBook in OS X.

625
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,620
Yeah, I called people out like that.

626
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Yeah, I did as well.

627
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,580
And I asked the question, do you not think it's hypocritical to tell us to use this freedom-loving

628
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,500
software like Firefox, yet you're telling us that from that device running that OS?

629
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,460
Do you not think you should be dogfooding your own stuff?

630
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,980
And her answer was, I bought this myself, I like this product.

631
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,740
So you can't argue with that, can you?

632
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,300
So the most ridiculous answer I heard was, this was a couple years ago, this was probably

633
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
four or five years ago.

634
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,780
There was somebody from the Free Software Foundation running a Mac.

635
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,860
And I thought that was particularly funny, and so I went up and said something to him.

636
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,940
Here was his answer to me.

637
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,620
His answer was, I volunteer and work for the Free Software Foundation because they care

638
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,460
about users' freedom to be able to choose whatever they want, and so I chose to run

639
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
a Mac.

640
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Really?

641
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Really?

642
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Really?

643
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,460
Here's the sticker.

644
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
That's not an answer.

645
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
That kind of is an answer, though.

646
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
That's not an answer.

647
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
Come on.

648
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,900
If you are part of the one organization that literally just brutally badgers people for

649
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,500
not running the most perfect lack of binary boxes, then you're not only going to show

650
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,740
up running not Linux, he's running Mac OS on proprietary.

651
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Come on.

652
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
Yeah, that's a little weak.

653
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
That's a little weak.

654
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,860
That was the most pathetic answer I think I've ever heard.

655
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
I don't know.

656
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
All right.

657
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,140
See, I was trying to get us away from judging people for the hardware they run, but it's

658
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,340
just run whatever you want as long as it's Linux.

659
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,900
That's kind of where I was going, but I will be curious.

660
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,660
The only reason we even bring it up is it's just always such an interesting thing we observe

661
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,700
before we go to OSCON or any other convention, any convention.

662
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,260
It is a little bit of practice what you preach, a little bit of dog-fooding like Popey was

663
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,380
saying, and it's a little bit of if you are in free software because of these, like with

664
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,180
these Firefox developers, their argument would clearly be, well, I don't develop Linux.

665
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,940
I develop Firefox, and I'm running Firefox on my Mac.

666
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,100
That's the argument, but isn't it come down to, well, don't you believe in the philosophy

667
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
behind Firefox?

668
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
No.

669
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,780
Well, maybe Firefox, yes, but you know what the reality is?

670
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,580
I think a lot of people at OSCON, I don't think they do.

671
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,020
I don't think they care about the philosophy.

672
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,540
I think what they care about is I want to make money.

673
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
I'm serious.

674
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,300
I want to make money, and I think that a large part of making that money is catering to the

675
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,100
solutions that people want, and a lot of those solutions, open source has a lot of advantages

676
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
that you can leverage.

677
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
So it's a business perspective.

678
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
That's what I want to do.

679
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
I think that's as far as they look into it.

680
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,020
I think that's a huge portion of the people at OSCON, but then you do have like open source

681
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,380
hardware alleys and stuff like that.

682
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,940
Well, Brian's going to be at OSCON.

683
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,100
So Brian, from the guy, the gentleman we spoke with that, yeah.

684
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
So I mean people...

685
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
The hardware and the laptop guy?

686
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,180
You're talking about the hardware, the wood laptop guy?

687
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,700
No, no, no.

688
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,500
We had an interview with him at Self, and he was, we were talking about the core...

689
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I remember.

690
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
He writes for opensource.com.

691
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Yeah.

692
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
I don't think so.

693
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,460
I think it was somebody else.

694
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,180
But the point is that there are, certainly there are people that are there, but I think

695
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,580
that the conference is primarily towards marketing open source, and to be fair about it, I value

696
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,380
that because I make a living off of selling open source software, and so if I didn't have

697
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,380
those conferences...

698
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,260
And the reality is, when I'm going to make my living, whatever hardware they're using

699
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,060
to present on, or whatever hardware they're using to develop on, as long as I get a solution

700
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,660
that I can sell, I can put food on the table.

701
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,760
Now, I might not be particularly happy about how that food got there, or the sacrifices

702
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,740
had to be made for that to happen, but the end result is the same, right?

703
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
Yeah.

704
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
That's deep, man.

705
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
That's deep.

706
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
You know what that deserves a little bit?

707
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,100
That was so inspirational that I just want to give you a little...

708
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Thanks, man.

709
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
That was nice.

710
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
No problem.

711
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
That was real nice.

712
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm here for you.

713
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
All right.

714
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
We've got to talk about...

715
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Well, actually, probably if you're going to stick around, maybe you have some thoughts

716
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,820
on this too, the change that the Free Software, Canonical, and the Software Conservancy just

717
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
recently announced.

718
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,540
But first, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

719
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Go to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

720
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,180
Noah, that's one word lowercase, so don't mess that up.

721
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
I won't.

722
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,340
You know, you can go there and apply to your account right now and get a $10 credit, because

723
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,700
if you probably forgot to it, check out, so you should go do that.

724
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,060
So go to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

725
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,020
Now, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

726
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,320
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

727
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,420
And of course, you can get started in less than 55 seconds, and pricing plans start only

728
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
$5 a month.

729
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,020
That'll get you 512 freaking megabytes of RAM, which Linux is a boss at managing.

730
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
It's really...

731
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,940
It's one of these things where you think, geez, 512, I would never put that on my machine.

732
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,420
And then you realize, of course, if I'm running it headless, I'm running services on it, and

733
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,380
I take advantage of the Linux kernel's memory management, I can get a hell of a lot of work

734
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,620
out of 512 megabytes of RAM.

735
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,740
On Sunday, I was using 512 megs to do my X2Go client.

736
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
Nice.

737
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,340
So that was my desktop, had 512 megs, and I had Thunderbird, Telegram, Firefox with

738
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,340
a couple of tabs open, and it was all performing flawlessly.

739
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
And of course...

740
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Not to mention the Core OS.

741
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,860
And a big part of that is, you know, it's because you're running on top of SSD drives.

742
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,240
They're all SSDs, so that gives you a ton of performance.

743
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,780
They have really, really good I.O.

744
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,180
Like for example, their data center in Germany, each hypervisor has 40 gigabit E connections.

745
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,060
40 gigabit E, right to the hypervisor.

746
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
That's smoking fast.

747
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,620
They've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and like

748
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,660
I mentioned, Germany and London.

749
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,940
They have a really simple interface to manage all of it.

750
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,180
So this part is sort of the thing that keeps you coming back.

751
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,980
Every time Noah and I are like, oh, I need a server to do this.

752
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,060
In the past, just the process of setting up the system, getting the OS loaded, getting

753
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,500
the updates installed, getting everything configured, you know, that's a couple hour

754
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
job.

755
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,900
DigitalOcean really has boiled this down to like 55 seconds.

756
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,700
It sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

757
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,580
And it's part of it is they're super intuitive and awesome control panel.

758
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,780
And if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you're going to try it out two months for

759
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,300
free when you get the $5 rig.

760
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,540
It's a very simple and intuitive control panel, and then you can replicate the functionality

761
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
of it with their API.

762
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,140
A lot of people in our audience that are smarter than me use it for like really nice things.

763
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,100
Like I don't remember the exact details, but I think what he did is he set up, so you know

764
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,140
an app, when you're installing packages, you can actually have it run pre and post scripts.

765
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,460
And he set up a pre script and a post script that uses the API, and he didn't even write

766
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
all of the code for it.

767
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,860
Like there was already an example bash script out there.

768
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
I think maybe it's a Python script, I can't remember.

769
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,140
And it goes out and it uses the DigitalOcean API to create a snapshot, and he can make

770
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,180
iterated snapshots of it so he can iterate back to different versions.

771
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,860
It installs all of the packages and then does a completed snapshot.

772
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,580
So the guy's got pre and post snapshots that are all taken advantage of the DigitalOcean

773
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,260
API, and if anything goes wrong, he just clicks one button and he's right back to where he

774
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
left off.

775
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,660
That's a really nice piece of mind.

776
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,260
And you know they have one click deployments for all kinds of great applications.

777
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,180
They got CoreOS, they got Fedora, they got Ubuntu, they got Debian.

778
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,620
They even have free BSD.

779
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,700
Just use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED over at DigitalOcean and try it out.

780
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,820
Go create yourself a droplet, put something cool up there, like an own cloud rig, a mumble

781
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,060
server, Minecraft server, GitLab, ghost installation.

782
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
I mean...

783
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
X2GO.

784
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
X2GO is a great solution.

785
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
That's what Wimpy uses too.

786
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Yeah.

787
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Wimpy's up there.

788
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,060
You know, if you really want to get nuts, dude, you should consider doing this, is in

789
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,840
DigitalOcean there's an option for private networking and the transfer of a private networking

790
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,420
doesn't count against your terabyte.

791
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,740
And so one of the things Wimpy has done, and you could do it too, is he has another rig

792
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,140
on a private network that acts as a file server.

793
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,580
So he X2GOs into his machine and then he's got like file servers and all stuff all over

794
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,100
private networking, all up on DigitalOcean, all crazy fast speeds, and he's only, only

795
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,460
one machine's got the public IP and he's only paying for transfer on that, and it's one

796
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,180
terabyte, so it's like it's going to last forever.

797
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
Right.

798
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
But you know what?

799
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,580
I have never once been hit with the transfer charge.

800
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
No, no, never.

801
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Ever.

802
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
No.

803
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,900
So I'm just going to continue putting them on the internet and tell something bad happens.

804
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,300
It's just, it's a neat idea to like...

805
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
From a security perspective.

806
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Yeah.

807
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,180
Like a droplet that is private networking that is your file server and all this backend

808
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,460
stuff all up in the cloud.

809
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,460
But I mean...

810
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
For $5 a month.

811
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,700
Think about self alone, how much data I moved over, you know, for all those footage.

812
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,260
Even then I didn't hit a transfer limit.

813
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,700
And that again is on a $5 a month droplet.

814
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,700
I know, it's great.

815
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
I don't know.

816
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,180
Promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

817
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
program.

818
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,300
You guys are busting it up.

819
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,100
So I'm going to, I'm going to read this.

820
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,220
I'm not a lawyer.

821
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,900
I'm not a lawyer, but I know that everybody was really upset about the contributor agreements

822
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,420
around Canonical and licensing stuff and conflicts with the GPL.

823
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,860
So the Free Software Foundation and the Software Freedom Conservancy have both put out statements

824
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,980
about a change to Canonical's intellectual property policy that was negotiated over,

825
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,500
they say, the last two years.

826
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,940
Effectively, Canonical has added what they call a Trump Clause that clarifies the licenses

827
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,700
of individual packages that override the Canonical policy when there is a conflict.

828
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
I want to read that again.

829
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,300
The Trump Clause means that the Canonical policy is overridden if it's conflicting with

830
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,180
another license, like say the GPL.

831
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,740
They say, while the Trump Clause is a reasonable way to comply with the GPL in a secondary

832
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,700
licensing document, the solution is far from ideal.

833
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,020
Redistributors of Ubuntu have little choice but to become experts in the analysis of Canonical's

834
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
policy.

835
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
That's their opinion.

836
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,420
They must identify on their own every place where the policy contradicts the GPL.

837
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,100
If a dispute arises on a subtle issue, Canonical could take legal action.

838
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,820
Arguing the Redistributors' interpretation of the GPL was incorrect.

839
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,380
Now this is all could be woody, would Canonical even do this, they're speculating.

840
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,140
Even if the Redistributor was correct that the GPL trumped some specific clauses in Canonical's

841
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,820
policy, it may be costly to educate the issue, you know, take it to court.

842
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,900
While backing the change made, both the Free Software Foundation and the Software Conservancy

843
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,380
recommend further changes to make the situation even more clear.

844
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,100
There has been a very, very wide range of reactions to this, from elated to some folks

845
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,340
like Jonathan from Kubuntu saying it's not enough.

846
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,720
Benjamin saying it's a good start, it helps developers, there's a lot of different takes

847
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:53,160
on this, but to me, it seems like a really smart move, because essentially what this

848
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,920
allows is, if there's ever a conflict between a Canonical contributor policy and the GPL,

849
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
the GPL wins.

850
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,300
And it's kind of like this trump clause that at the end of the day, the GPL wins.

851
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,180
And that to me seems like a pretty big step forward.

852
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,300
Popi, if you have any opinions on this, am I missing any of the details?

853
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,420
Is this about, am I sussing it out quite right, from what you know?

854
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,580
I feel uncomfortable talking about this because I'm not a lawyer and I work for the company.

855
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,660
That's how I feel, I'm not a lawyer either, so that's fine, I know.

856
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,060
You don't have to say anything if you don't want to.

857
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:29,380
The only thing I would say is that I think people think that this is used for more nefarious

858
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,820
purposes than it really is.

859
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,020
It sounds like it.

860
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,800
And I don't think there's any way in which we would use it for the ways in which many

861
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,140
people think we would.

862
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,260
And it's difficult because you can come up with a hundred different hypothetical scenarios

863
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,560
where Canonical will be the bad guy, yet for the last 10 years arguably we've been the

864
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
good guy.

865
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:01,980
We have been contributing, we have a very open trademark policy, and it's unfortunate

866
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,220
that it's taken a lot of backroom conversations between Canonical, SFLC, and FSF that's resulted

867
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,020
in one paragraph change at the moment.

868
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,180
I guess there may be more changes in the future, but I'm not party to those discussions, so

869
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,660
I just don't know.

870
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,100
Yeah, that's kind of where I think a lot of us sit.

871
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:26,280
From the outside to me, watching this as an observer, it sounds like a lot of upset about

872
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,260
what could happen, what Canonical may have the legal authority to do if they were so

873
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,100
inclined, had the money, had the time, and wanted the bad PR, they could in some cases

874
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,380
go after somebody for using a package in their redistribution of Ubuntu or something like

875
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
that.

876
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,940
It's more, from my perspective, while I work for Canonical, I'm kind of an outsider to

877
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,280
this because I don't take part in any of these conversations.

878
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,760
So from my perspective, it seems more that this policy is more to say, look, if you go

879
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,980
to a vendor of whatever type, whether that's a hardware vendor like System76 or a cloud

880
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:08,100
vendor providing cloud images, if they say to you what we're providing is Ubuntu, then

881
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,020
that should be something that is verifiably Ubuntu, and it's not been monkeyed around

882
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,260
with in particular ways that would make it not Ubuntu.

883
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,460
When I say not Ubuntu, I mean it might have nasty proprietary stuff added, or they may

884
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:28,540
have changed the configuration massively, or it might have backdoors in it, or it might

885
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,020
talk to some other server that you wouldn't want, and you would trust us not to do in

886
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,780
official Ubuntu images.

887
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,780
So it's more, if you think about how this might be used, that's more how it would be

888
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:47,580
used is to say, well, you're supplying hardware and you're saying it's Ubuntu, but actually

889
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
is it?

890
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,380
Or you're providing cloud images and you're saying that is Ubuntu.

891
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,780
That gets in a weird spot for the brand and for Canonical and user expectations, yeah.

892
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
And I can see that.

893
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,260
Derek Devlin, you wanted to jump in on the Canonical defense side real quick?

894
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:10,780
Yeah, just honestly, I think Bobby then finalized it and expressed what I felt about the situation,

895
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,780
but overall, yeah.

896
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,140
Yeah, I do too, and I kind of come at it from a more pragmatic standpoint, like I actually,

897
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,340
I'm really happy to see this much movement, and I'd love to see more movement on the issue.

898
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,780
It just seems to be something that is a big hangup for some people.

899
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,380
Yeah, lawyers don't work quickly, do they?

900
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,100
Well, it's not in their interest, is it?

901
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,820
I have always felt, on one hand, I've always felt that if somebody isn't going to use a

902
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:42,220
power for, if the argument is, well, the CLA would never be used for anything bad, we would

903
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,620
never actually force that on anyone, then I would ask why is that power necessary?

904
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:52,140
I think what that is, is there's only so many tools in the chest, right?

905
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,660
And you have to write it in a way where you can accommodate for future scenarios.

906
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,260
Yeah, I mean, I've always been a little uncomfortable, but on the other hand, here's the other side

907
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
of that.

908
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,980
Canonical is a company, and they exist to make money.

909
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,900
They have to pay employees, they have ongoing expenses, and let's face it, their biggest

910
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,420
product, Ubuntu, they give away on the website for free.

911
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,300
So there was a post a while back where somebody talked about the dynamic of open source and

912
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,060
how if you're a paid developer, then you're given a paycheck and you write code and then

913
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,540
the company owns that code, and they don't give anything back in this, that, and the

914
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
other.

915
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,140
Where it's open source, there has to be a two-way exchange for that to be a profitable

916
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,060
relationship, right?

917
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,780
And I guess my instant thought when I heard that as a business owner is, I think, aren't

918
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:43,060
they giving back the finalized product of Ubuntu constantly away for free?

919
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,460
I mean, it's not in the free as in beer, not as in free as in freedom sense.

920
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,500
I see that there's a very clear distinction there.

921
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,680
But I think to some degree, what Canonical does is says, we need to be able to protect

922
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,660
our ability to make money, and so we find something we can profit on.

923
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,780
Maybe, but only in a broader sense.

924
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:09,460
I think what it is, what Poppy was just saying, is think about what's the main reason that

925
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,040
Google hates it when the carriers take Android and they muck it up?

926
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,580
Carriers come in with one expectation.

927
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,580
Somebody else takes that.

928
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,580
They change it.

929
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,460
They still call it Android, but the buttons are in a different place.

930
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,060
The things do different things.

931
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,740
My phone gives me a volume warning about my hearing every time I turn up the volume, but

932
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,900
my Nexus doesn't.

933
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,160
There's different changes.

934
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,180
And as a user, I want to know that if I go in and I get brand A of phone, I'm going to

935
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,060
get the things that brand A has.

936
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,920
It's the same reason why I like to buy Heinz ketchup, because I always know what Heinz

937
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,900
ketchup has, and it always tastes the same.

938
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,700
And I want to know, as a customer, Heinz ketchup will always taste the same.

939
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,420
And I, as the Heinz company, if somebody else comes along, takes my Heinz bottle, empties

940
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,820
it in a new bottle, and adds a bunch of salt and sugar, and calls it something else, or

941
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,900
still calls it Heinz, that's even worse.

942
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,500
That's much worse, actually, if they still call it Heinz, than me as a company.

943
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,220
I've got to do something to protect what people expect when they buy Heinz ketchup.

944
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,420
So, and again, excuse my ignorance if I'm missing this here, but doesn't open source

945
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,780
provide for exactly that?

946
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,780
If you fork a project, you can't use the original product.

947
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
I mean, those...

948
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,420
Well, that's where these tools and copyright and trademark come in.

949
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
Right.

950
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,100
My understanding was, the beef of the CLA was essentially that people were upset that

951
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,660
they could make contributions to Canonical, and then those wouldn't necessarily be submitted

952
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
back up street.

953
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,980
They could potentially be re-licensed, actually.

954
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,900
This isn't really related to the CLA.

955
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Yeah.

956
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,020
This is more the intellectual property policy that is on every website about using Ubuntu.

957
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,500
And so this is more about, yeah, okay, so the CLA, still in effect.

958
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,420
A lot of projects have contributory license agreements.

959
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
A lot.

960
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,260
Like, a lot of them have it.

961
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,380
So this intellectual property thing, this is more about like, I mean, honestly where

962
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,420
I can see this coming up, and we could just, let's just use our buddy Wimpy because he's

963
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,220
not going to get any trouble.

964
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,420
But you know, a distro like Wimpy's Ubuntu Mate's project comes along, gets a hardware

965
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,580
vendor and they start calling it an Ubuntu machine, but yet it's not an Ubuntu experience.

966
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Right.

967
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Yeah.

968
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Yeah.

969
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
It's Ubuntu Mate.

970
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,220
So at some point, like, what if a really big company came along and did that?

971
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,020
They've got to have the tools possible to protect, because they could just become irrelevant

972
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,780
if they didn't defend that.

973
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
So I think that's what this is about.

974
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,780
But if you relicense it, doesn't it then become the potential for not being able to contribute

975
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
that back upstream?

976
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Mm-hmm.

977
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,800
And so then, isn't it, so then I guess, and I realize we're getting further and further

978
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,420
down the rabbit hole of what if, but...

979
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,180
Yeah, I really, because I don't know, I'm not a lawyer, but yeah.

980
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,180
But it just, I guess the concern I see is, I could potentially write code and think I'm

981
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,020
contributing to all of these projects, and in the end, Canonical could, as the way it's

982
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,820
written, just take it and say, no, we own that.

983
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,780
Well, you are, again, that's, you're confusing the life of the contributor agreement with

984
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Ubuntu.

985
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Yeah, maybe I am, yeah.

986
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,780
But even the CLA doesn't say that.

987
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,340
You get to keep the rights over your work, you just grant us the ability to redistribute

988
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
that work as well.

989
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
Okay.

990
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
That's the difference.

991
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
So you...

992
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Which does include a relicense, though.

993
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
By contributing to us.

994
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,540
Like, you could, like, isn't it, it does allow to relicense to, like, Apache or it doesn't

995
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,980
allow for some relicensing to of code?

996
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,580
Doesn't mean they can't contribute to their own code still, though, right?

997
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,500
Potentially, but you still get to keep the rights over your code, so you could still

998
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,180
distribute it under the GPL or whatever license you had it under.

999
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,220
Yeah, so they haven't changed the code then, or they haven't changed the licensing then,

1000
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,220
right?

1001
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,500
I mean, so they forked it and changed it.

1002
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,940
They would fork it, relicense it, now Canonical could continue to develop that version that's

1003
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,340
under a different license, and you would continue to have your version under your license.

1004
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:32,540
That doesn't seem egregious to me, because at the end of the day, there is no way that

1005
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:37,220
somebody else can take a software and say, this is Ubuntu, if it's not in fact Ubuntu.

1006
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,340
And at the same time, you're not hindering the efforts of people contributing.

1007
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
Right.

1008
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:48,340
So I think the thing that people find egregious, but not separate from the whole legal discussion,

1009
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:54,220
is that potentially you as a manufacturer, you could make a phone, right?

1010
00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:01,260
And you could go and get all the pieces that make up Ubuntu, the brand, the distro software,

1011
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,260
you could go and get all those pieces and put them on a phone and say, hey, look, we've

1012
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,540
made a phone and it runs what you would normally call Ubuntu, but you couldn't sell that and

1013
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,900
call it Ubuntu until you talk to us, until we have a conversation with you about licensing

1014
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,340
that brand, that trademark.

1015
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,260
And once you do have that conversation, we're all golden, but you can't until you've done

1016
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
that.

1017
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,260
And that's fair.

1018
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,260
The same with laptops and cloud.

1019
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,700
That's why I think it's a little silly that such, I mean, I do totally get where people

1020
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,740
are coming from, but I don't really think it's as huge of an issue as we made it out

1021
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,120
to be, because the only time it would become a really, really huge issue is if Canonical

1022
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,340
got to the size of Google, Microsoft, or Apple.

1023
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,580
But even then, I guess I'm still seeing where, even if they did get to be that big size,

1024
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,700
and even if they did have nefarious ideas, what could they do?

1025
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
What could they-

1026
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,180
Okay, then we're gonna, I think we gotta move on.

1027
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,420
I'll just give you the worst case, total, not-gonna-ever-happen scenario.

1028
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,600
Let's say Canonical, in 20 years, they buy Apple, they're so big, right?

1029
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,500
They're so rich, and let's stick with this.

1030
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,780
Say Apple buys CUPS, this printing system that all Linux boxes use, right?

1031
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,260
They get this program called CUPS, they take it, and they decide to really make iOS and

1032
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,100
Macs really integrate super well together.

1033
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,140
They're gonna fork and re-license CUPS, and they're gonna continue to develop CUPS separately.

1034
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,060
They're not gonna take away CUPS from the rest of the community, because that remains.

1035
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,780
They'll just languish on GitHub or whatever.

1036
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,980
But they take CUPS, and they drew in a whole new direction that adds a whole bunch of really

1037
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,340
neat printing features.

1038
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,040
Now the rest of CUPS doesn't get any of that stuff.

1039
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,500
And so the CUPS developers are like, oh man, you took our code, and you made it way more

1040
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,260
awesome, and you never contributed back.

1041
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,260
That's the total waste-

1042
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,620
But they're doing that on their own dime.

1043
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,860
In today's world, in the way the world is set up today, if Canonical did that, a few

1044
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,180
million people would use that.

1045
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,160
The rest of the entire industry would still use the open standard, regularly licensed

1046
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,100
product that everybody else is using, and it doesn't really change the technology landscape.

1047
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,240
It doesn't really change anything.

1048
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,640
So the only reason why this agreement on the CLA and all this stuff I think really would

1049
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,720
matter is if Canonical was so huge that they would be able to deprive the original source

1050
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,620
project from really any innovation, which is very unlikely to happen.

1051
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Right.

1052
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Right.

1053
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,620
Yeah, that makes sense.

1054
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,540
So you could potentially stifle innovation, but even then-

1055
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,900
But you'd have to be at such a scale that essentially all of the majority of users in

1056
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,700
development would move to the other project.

1057
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,780
And then who's going to want to do that if you're relicensing it in the first place?

1058
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,780
It's just not very-

1059
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,020
It just doesn't seem like a super critical major problem.

1060
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,840
I guess the whole concept of open source to begin with was the idea of having a license

1061
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,260
to begin with was that you couldn't change the license, and if the license can be changed

1062
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,220
at any time, then it kind of defeats the entire purpose of take a share and redistribute.

1063
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,900
Now that we've got the software license, I just-

1064
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,860
The lawyering stuff and the licensing stuff, man, it's just not my-

1065
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Yeah, because let's be fair.

1066
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Neither of us really have a clue.

1067
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,300
And we don't really care either.

1068
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,220
I know a lot of Linux users do, and I totally respect that I'm not downplaying it, but

1069
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,020
me personally, I've never been-

1070
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,420
That's not the first reason I jump in.

1071
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,100
Because we've got so many other more critical problems to deal with long before we ever

1072
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
get to that.

1073
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,100
I'm glad.

1074
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Some people are worried about it though, that's for sure.

1075
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,620
And some of you, and that's good, and it's good to see some results too.

1077
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,300
I think that's also really good, and it took them a couple of years, but some people made

1078
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,580
some, some lawyers made some good money, and some donations were well spent.

1079
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,840
All right, now in the meantime, let's spend a little money on ourselves.

1080
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,820
Let's get a little more in our toolbox, a little more educated, a little better at something

1081
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,300
that could make us maybe more competitive in the workforce.

1082
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,660
I'm talking about Linux Academy.

1083
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,380
Go to Linux Academy right now, won't you, and go get our discount.

1084
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,340
In fact, if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get our 33% discount.

1085
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,340
Boom, Noah.

1086
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,340
33%.

1087
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,340
That's a big discount.

1088
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
That is.

1089
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
That is.

1090
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
Are you a Linux Academy user, Noah?

1091
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,340
Of course I'm a Linux Academy user.

1092
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,340
Yeah.

1093
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,260
One of the things I learned about Linux Academy when I signed up was how well it worked for

1094
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,540
the way I work, like I log in, and I was like, oh man, do I really want to take, do I really

1095
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,100
want to tap, like this case it was Ruby, do I really want to tackle this topic?

1096
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,260
Like to me, the idea of learning Ruby is like a commitment.

1097
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,860
Like I'm going to, I'm going to, this is a life journey I'm going to take.

1098
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,220
I'm going to go learn Ruby, and when I logged into Linux Academy, and I looked at the Ruby

1099
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,780
course, and I was able to take this huge, ginormous, nebulous topic of learning a new

1100
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,300
programming language, and I was able to put five hours and 35 minutes on it, I was like,

1101
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,980
holy crap, you mean I can learn Ruby in five hours, that is something my brain can not

1102
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,980
only process, but I know how to fit that into my life, like that is something I can wrap

1103
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,980
my head around.

1104
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,360
It's no longer this huge thing that's an unaccomplishable task.

1105
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,980
It is all of a sudden, it's very laid out, it's step by step, what I'm going to do, how

1106
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,060
long each section is going to take me, and it's like, ugh.

1107
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,180
Because why even start a project if you know that halfway through it or even a tenth of

1108
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,180
the way through it, you're going to run out of time and you're not going to be able to

1109
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
finish it anyway.

1110
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,180
So why even bother starting?

1111
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,100
Because they have availability selectors, you're going to tell them how much time you

1112
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,820
have available, they have seven plus distros you get to choose from, so all of the courseware

1113
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,980
will match that, and the servers that spin up during your courseware match that as well.

1114
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,140
It's really nice, you get to keep track of your progress, ride as you go and pick up

1115
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,780
right where you left off when you come back.

1116
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,700
They have so many great new OpenStack Essential courses, the best AWS courses out there with

1117
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,180
scenario based labs, Docker, Vagrant, I mean the list goes on, I go through this list all

1118
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,580
the time, and it's like, I could just sit here and go off, but you don't need to.

1119
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,580
Go to Linux Academy and go look at the courses, go look at the nuggets, they've got so many

1120
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,580
different things up there.

1121
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,860
DevOps courseware, I don't ever really talk about that very much.

1122
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,500
Learning Vagrant, Docker Deep Dive, Chef DevOps Deployment, Learning Puppet, all this kind

1123
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,740
of stuff is extremely, extremely handy, and it's not just Linux, it's all the stuff built

1124
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,740
around Linux.

1125
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,780
You know, things like Puppet too, Chris, are one of those things that's a very difficult

1126
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,780
thing.

1127
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,780
It's very dry.

1128
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,700
If you're reading a tutorial, my god, to go through things like Puppet inside of a

1129
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,500
written tutorial, it's painful.

1130
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,740
And you can download the guides and stuff, and the audio, and listen to it like in the

1131
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,740
car and stuff.

1132
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,740
You can get that.

1133
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,740
They have the videos.

1134
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,740
They demonstrate how they do it.

1135
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,260
And you know, when I can hear a person explain, now we're going to do this, and he breaks

1136
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,220
up that just monotonous block of text, that's hugely helpful.

1137
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,380
And there are certain things that I've learned on Linux Academy that I would have never been

1138
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,020
able to get through if I was going out and searching tutorials myself.

1139
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,580
And on top of that, they hold QA sessions through Hangouts and stuff, which is really

1140
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,580
nice.

1141
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,580
So you can ask the instructor questions.

1142
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,620
They have a good community you can follow on, which are stacked with JB members if you have

1143
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,060
any tough spots or a success story you want to share.

1144
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,060
And they have team accounts if you are a small business or a group of people that want to

1145
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,100
work together.

1146
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,580
And they're adding new labs all of the time.

1147
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,580
All of the time.

1148
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,340
It's such a great system because it's built by true Linux and open source enthusiasts

1149
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,140
who want to help spread the platform.

1150
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,220
And the way they want to help contribute to Linux and open source is by creating something

1151
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,420
that helps more people take advantage of it.

1152
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,140

1155
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,580
You guys are the bestest.

1156
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,380
Now this one I don't really know if we're going to get a lot of conversation about,

1157
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,420
but I pretty much buy NVIDIA cards if I'm going to have a debt.

1158
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,220
It's either Intel or NVIDIA for me most of the time.

1159
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,220
Right.

1160
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Does somebody else make graphics cards?

1161
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,220
Well, ATI AMD's got.

1162
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
Do you have any rigs with AMD?

1163
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,220
No?

1164
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,220
No.

1165
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:54,220
I bought one AMD or one ATI card, whatever it was, eight years ago, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,260
And I had such a pain in the rear trying to get the stupid thing to work with Linux.

1167
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,340
And even today, even like this is, you know, that was back in 1204 days.

1168
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:07,220
Even on like 1404, 1410, I go to install it and it is such a pain to get drivers working

1169
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,220
for ATR.

1170
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,420
I feel like they keep teasing us with like new driver models, they're going to fix all

1171
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,420
of this.

1172
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
Here's what you have to do.

1173
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Nobody's ever done this.

1174
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,740
You have to kill X, go into the, go to the command line, take the dot run file, modify

1175
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,940
the permissions so you can run it, run the stupid thing.

1176
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,940
Then it's just a huge thing.

1177
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,940
Yeah.

1178
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
They don't even market executable.

1179
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,940
They don't even market executable.

1180
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,340
So I go to NVIDIA, I click on the little checkbox that says enable NVIDIA drivers and restart

1181
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,620
my machine and then I have NVIDIA drivers until I don't even have to do that.

1182
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,820
Anybody in the mumble room want to become an AMD ATI video card defender before we move

1183
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,820
on?

1184
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,820
I know some of you have success with the open source drivers.

1185
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,420
So what he means to say is, does anyone want to get kicked out of the mumble room?

1186
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,420
No.

1187
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
No, does anyone have a counter?

1188
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:50,100
I'm just waiting for the ARM cards also to get real.

1189
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,500
I mean the ARM space is coming along.

1190
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Yeah, yeah.

1191
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
That's very true.

1192
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,780
And I really want to see that to become an also a platform for competition with the desktop

1193
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,780
market.

1194
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,780
Yeah, that would be very interesting.

1195
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,780
All right.

1196
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,780
So here is the pro tip.

1197
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,060
If you're not getting enough performance out of your AMD card Linux users, I have something

1198
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,060
for you.

1199
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,020
This was discovered as you would probably not be surprised to learn.

1200
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,180
I believe over at the Ferronix forums, surprise, surprise.

1201
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:22,380
But and it's been tested now, AMD Catalyst Linux drivers perform wildly different based

1202
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,820
on the file name of the game you're playing.

1203
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,820
What?

1204
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,820
Yeah.

1205
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,860
So in the past years, AMD Catalyst driver has yielded a better performance of naming

1206
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,020
the executable Doom 3.86 or Compass, like if you just named it that.

1207
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,800
But these days, the application profile concept is made more absurd with games that are coming

1208
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,340
to Linux all the time.

1209
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,820
So the latest example, you can get a 40%, I'm going to say that again, a 40%.

1210
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,940
People do massive hardware upgrades to get a 40% improvement, right?

1211
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,940
Less than that.

1212
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
Yeah, yeah.

1213
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,060
They get a 40% better performance by renaming Counter-Strike Global Offensive on Linux.

1214
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:01,220
If you rename the CSGO underscore Linux binary to HL2 underscore Linux for Half-Life 2 within

1215
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,620
Steam, the frame rates suddenly increase across the board.

1216
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,800
This is with the latest Catalyst 15.7 Linux driver, while CSGO has been on Linux for nearly

1217
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,340
a year now.

1218
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,180
Is this a thing on other graphics cards or is this ATI specific?

1219
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,020
Well, it's not totally uncommon.

1220
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,980
You know what it is, is like it's a cat and mouse game because the video card manufacturers

1221
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,940
are trying to compensate for crappy developers and developers are trying to compensate for

1222
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,780
crappy video card manufacturers.

1223
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,160
And so they're writing profile specific settings for games, and the only way they can really

1224
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,540
figure out how to do it is by looking at the file name.

1225
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,380
But the question is, should they even be doing this at all anymore?

1226
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,380
It's a clown show.

1227
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,380
Yeah.

1228
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,380
Yeah, it really is.

1229
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,380
What do you think, Daredevil?

1230
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,820
And you think it's for maybe benchmarking?

1231
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,820
Not just benchmarking.

1232
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:51,020
I think actually this has potential agreement between the graphics video card companies

1233
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,020
and the game companies.

1234
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,020
Oh, dirty play.

1235
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,940
Some games are successful and not others.

1236
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,380
And this raises the question if they shouldn't be probed about this.

1237
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:05,260
Yeah, I mean, you've definitely, like, Samsung got busted last year whenever you would run

1238
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,860
a benchmarking app on Android.

1239
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,540
They would detect that and overclock the CPU during the benchmark app's process time.

1240
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,420
And then when you close the app, they de-clock the CPU.

1241
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,420
Very nice.

1242
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,420
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

1243
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,420
Maybe.

1244
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,340
And, you know, some game manufacturers do get a little money from Nvidia to put the

1245
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,260
Made for Nvidia splash screen that comes up.

1246
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,260
I don't know, though.

1247
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,940
I think it's more like AMD trying to be too smart, and I think it's also a little bit

1248
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,500
of a hit and miss in 3D applications under Linux over the last few years, because these

1249
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,780
guys have a whole history of, you know, writing drivers for Linux for a long time.

1250
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,500
They've been through the bad days where this maybe was kind of needed.

1251
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:44,900
These situations have been targeted before for market competition laws.

1252
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,020
I pretty much think this sounds extremely illegal.

1253
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,020
You know, you could be right.

1254
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,900
Because they should be focusing on making the driver for the graphics card to work,

1255
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,420
and the program should be doing the calls, not the driver.

1256
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,460
But if you're ATI and AMD and you're getting all these reports about this game crashing

1257
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,380
only on your card, and the developer of the game isn't releasing any patches to fix it,

1258
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,660
don't you feel some pressure to fix it on your end if you know how to give your card

1259
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,660
a better name?

1260
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,420
Because you don't want the internet going, oh, man, this Half-Life 3 game is so amazing,

1261
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,540
it finally came out, except for on ATI cards.

1262
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,860
Like, that's not the story you want.

1263
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,860
So I guess, let's start with...

1264
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
Here's what you do.

1265
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,860
Here's what you do.

1266
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,620
You do an update system that is transparent to the user that it says, NVIDIA is providing

1267
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:31,580
a special configuration for this game, and, you know, so that it's clear.

1268
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,980
You go to notify the users instead of trying to manipulate the driver.

1269
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
Exactly.

1270
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,700
So, I guess let's start with this.

1271
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:43,660
I guess I'm still back lost at what is the ATI market nowadays.

1272
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,660
Because there was a...

1273
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,660
Okay, hear me out.

1274
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,660
Price, dude.

1275
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,660
NVIDIA was...

1276
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,220
No, that's Intel to me.

1277
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,640
To me, Intel integrated graphics is what AMD used to be, which is that you can do reasonable

1278
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,300
amount of games with a little less performance, but it's at a drastically better price point.

1279
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,900
And if I want a really good graphics, I'm going to go with NVIDIA.

1280
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,740
So I mean, I suppose that ATI tries to split that down the middle, but...

1281
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,740
Yeah, exactly.

1282
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,740
They're kind of...

1283
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,220
They're more powerful than Intel's by a large margin.

1284
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,580
I think they're cheaper than NVIDIA's.

1285
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,580
And nothing says...

1286
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,260
I mean, nothing says NVIDIA isn't necessarily doing this either.

1287
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,260
Right?

1288
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,540
And they could be doing it on Windows just as easily as they're doing it on Linux.

1289
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,940
This is something that driver manufacturers have done for a while.

1290
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,740
It's just that when they tested, they only found ATI doing it, but it could be NVIDIA

1291
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,740
too.

1292
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,740
We don't know.

1293
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,740
So we can't totally slam ATI.

1294
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,740
I agree.

1295
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,860
I don't know if you're a primary Linux user what the main advantage to an AMD video card

1296
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,860
is.

1297
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,180
Although they do have a pretty new cool open source driver model they're working on where

1298
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,460
there's going to be most of it in user space, and it's going to be a lot easier to update,

1299
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
a lot easier to install.

1300
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
You know what?

1301
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,420
Even the Windows guys I know.

1302
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,700
They're just sold on NVIDIA.

1303
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,100
I haven't met an ATI fan guy, a fanboy, in a long time.

1304
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:55,380
If I'm not mistaken, and I could be wrong, please, I read a while ago that there was

1305
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,740
some probing between NVIDIA and Intel or something on market dominance.

1306
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:09,020
And I think ATI is being given a market share naturally because of these instead of a fine

1307
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:16,500
is being applicable as per as many laptops as go in an X brand will have to go with ATI

1308
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,940
as well or something like that as competition laws, at least in Europe's side.

1309
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,380
But I'm not 100% sure.

1310
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,820
I need to recheck that, but definitely I remember reading something about this.

1311
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,660
It's definitely an interesting take on this.

1312
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,260
I hadn't thought of it being a conspiracy, but that's how I like that.

1313
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,820
It's fun nonetheless either way.

1314
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,340
I just, yeah, it is right now, it doesn't appear to, these particular profiles also

1315
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,800
don't appear to be affecting Windows users, and it comes down to if you're going to do

1316
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,700
crap like this, and I'm talking to you, AMD, if you're going to do crap like this and you're

1317
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,220
going to have specific application profiles, then it is incumbent upon you to keep that

1318
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,500
crap updated.

1319
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,620
You keep on top of it.

1320
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:00,860
If you're going to limit my games by 40 effing percent, then it is your gerb because now

1321
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,580
they have the opposite of problem.

1322
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,020
Now they're crippling all my games.

1323
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,540
So seriously, if you're going to do this crap, you got to stay on top of those application

1324
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,540
profiles.

1325
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,540
I don't think that's realistic.

1326
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,020
And also give me an option to turn it all off.

1327
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,660
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think that's realistic.

1328
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,860
I don't think it's realistic that you can stay on top.

1329
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,860
I mean, think about what you're saying.

1330
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,860
Right.

1331
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,860
They just come out so fast.

1332
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,860
There's so many indie games.

1333
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,860
Exactly.

1334
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,860
Steam's got, yeah.

1335
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:22,860
It's not practical.

1336
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,860
There's no hope of them actually, there's no realistic.

1337
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,860
Not to mention open source games they've never even heard of.

1338
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,860
Yeah.

1339
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,860
There's no realistic expectation to be able to do that.

1340
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,860
I like your idea.

1341
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,940
Give me a button to turn it off.

1342
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:35,980
Call it a game optimization for select games that we know about, blah, blah, blah.

1343
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,460
That I think is the way they should do it.

1344
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,460
We'll see.

1345
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,460
We will see.

1346
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,300
And if you are an ATI user, or I'm sorry, AMD, and you want to defend them, or you got

1347
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,980
a really good reason, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact, or go find 102 or in the Linux

1348
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,180
Action subreddit, or even better, the Mamba Room.

1349
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,180
Yeah.

1350
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:56,780
They still get royalties, by the way, guys, on the x86, 64 architecture and a couple of

1351
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,340
their APU models, which is money.

1352
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,460
Yeah, that is their source of money, isn't it?

1353
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,460
Yeah, I can't blame them.

1354
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,660
They got a good thing going there.

1355
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,260
They helped develop a good technology.

1356
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:12,340
All right, Mr. Noah, let's talk about our next sponsor as we round out to the last minutes

1357
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,340
of the show, Noah.

1358
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,700
And what we're going to talk about is that Dell situation that we mentioned at the top

1359
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,500
of the show, and also my prediction that's finally coming true.

1360
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Finally, that's good.

1361
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Yeah, I know, right?

1362
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Linux.ting.com.

1363
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Go there, won't you, friends?

1364
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,180
Linux.ting.com, and go get yourself a device with no contract, no early termination fee,

1365
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,860
and you only pay for what you use.

1366
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,980
No BS here, guys.

1367
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,980
This is really slick.

1368
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
I love no contracts.

1369
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,500
I love only paying for what I use because it allows me to have a couple of phones to

1370
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,500
experiment with.

1371
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,000
You heard me mention earlier, I have a Nexus 5.

1372
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,540
I'm able to keep that and use that and not feel bad about having a phone sitting on my

1373
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,460
desk that cost me $50, $60, $70, $80 a month.

1374
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,460
Yeah.

1375
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
It feels really good.

1376
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,460
You know how many phones I brought with me?

1377
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,460
Ting phones I brought with me?

1378
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,460
No.

1379
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,460
Little Noah has one.

1380
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,460
I have one in my backup.

1381
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Sarah has hers.

1382
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,460
We have a little hotspot.

1383
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,460
So that's like five devices?

1384
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Yeah.

1385
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,980
We brought like five out of the nine that we have.

1386
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
Yeah.

1387
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
It's nice.

1388
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,460
The Mi-Fi is a great way to go with Ting because if you don't need a ton, you can just turn

1389
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,780
it off when you don't need it, and then when you do need it, you just pay for what you

1390
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,780
use.

1391
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,420
You know what my backup for my SIP system is?

1392
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,460
They sell this.

1393
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:18,300
It's a home device that connects to the cellular network, and then I have a jack on this Ting

1394
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,940
box that plugs into the FXO jack of my SIP server.

1395
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,860
So if my SIP line ever goes down, if I lose the internet, I can still make phone calls.

1396
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,860
That's awesome.

1397
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,420
As long as my local network is working, I can make calls.

1398
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,420
Which it always is.

1399
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,420
Yeah.

1400
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,420
And it'll just send them out over Ting.

1401
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,420
Now do I really care?

1402
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,540
Since I'm not using any minutes most months, it cost me six bucks to have that box connected.

1403
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,540
That is a great idea.

1404
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,540
Yeah.

1405
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,880
So if anyone ever thinks they're going to be clever and like they're going to cut my

1406
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,140
phone lines or they're going to cut the internet line, go right ahead.

1407
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,140
I can still call out.

1408
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,580
My alarm system can still call out because it's all going through.

1409
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,860
That's a slick backup, dude.

1410
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,620
We should set that up here at the studio.

1411
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,580
So this is really nice because when you go to linux.ting.com.

1412
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,580
I want that, Noah.

1413
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,100
You want more backups for your phone?

1414
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
Is that what you're telling me?

1415
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,100
No.

1416
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,100
What I want is-

1417
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,100
You're not interrupted enough?

1418
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,100
We've had it.

1419
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,780
We had a situation, it was a year ago now, but Comcast went out all day and we brought

1420
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:06,220
in my, I think I was at Nexus 5 at the time.

1421
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
With Allen, right?

1422
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,220
Yeah.

1423
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,220
I remember this.

1424
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,220
We hotspotted off that.

1425
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,220
Got the show done.

1426
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,220
And I was like, gosh.

1427
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,220
But then of course, Rekai couldn't do it.

1428
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,580
It'd be nice to have something that was whole house wide and I'd pay $6 a month to have

1429
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,580
a backup internet connection.

1430
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,580
Heck yeah.

1431
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,580
That's genius.

1432
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,580
Of course, I wasn't streaming on it.

1433
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,580
I'm making phone calls.

1434
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,140
Actually, here though, I get 20 up, 20 down over Ting here in the studio.

1435
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,140
Well, no.

1436
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,140
I'm not saying the speed wouldn't be good enough.

1437
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:31,180
I'd be a little concerned if you were going to do internet broadcasting all day.

1438
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,180
Oh, yeah.

1439
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,820
All we did is we just recorded locally and just did the audio stream and it was flawless.

1440
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,820
Oh, yeah.

1441
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,820
Yeah, just the audio stream.

1442
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,820
It worked fine.

1443
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,020
And actually, if you think about it, with all the money you'd saved, because I saved

1444
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,060
$2,000 somewhere around there.

1445
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:48,460
If you add that up, even if it cost you $400 or $500 to have your show on the air, that's

1446
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,460
to you that you're lively.

1447
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
One time.

1448
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
Yeah.

1449
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
That's no big deal.

1450
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
Right.

1451
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,460
So now you're saved.

1452
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,460
If you average it over the two years.

1453
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Yeah.

1454
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,460
Now you save 25% less and you still save 75% of your money.

1455
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,460
Yeah.

1456
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,460
Yeah.

1457
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,460
And actually, this might go away, because Ting is awesome.

1458
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,740
Ting is changing up mobile.

1459
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,580
They're hopefully going to break up the duopolies over time, but they're not stopping there.

1460
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,380
And this is kind of exciting.

1461
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,300
Ting is rolling out fiber internet too, and they have it now in some locations.

1462
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,540
And I think a lot of you have heard me talk about this, you're probably wondering what's

1463
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,860
going on next for Ting's fiber internet service, because man would I not just freaking love

1464
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,980
to have the Ting model come to my wired internet connection and have it be fiber.

1465
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,580
So yeah, I'm interested to see what's coming up next and they're going to tell us.

1466
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,060
They have a little video about it.

1467
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,660
Nicholas K asks, for internet, are you more likely to expand outward from Charlottesville

1468
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,620
or step into cities in different parts of the country?

1469
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,460
I think that we're more likely in Charlottesville just to focus on the existing city area for

1470
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,460
the time being.

1471
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,540
You know, we think there's so much opportunity inside the city itself and there's a lot of

1472
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,740
different places we can go with the network and that's what we're really focusing on there

1473
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,140
for the time being in Charlottesville.

1474
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,660
At the same time, we want to really expand into new markets in the U.S.

1475
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:02,720
So while we're doing that in Charlottesville, you'll see us looking to get into new cities

1476
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,740
across the U.S. as well.

1477
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:06,740
Man that's going to be crazy.

1478
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,740
Seattle, Seattle, Seattle, Seattle.

1479
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,740
Come on Ting.

1480
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,740
Seattle, please.

1481
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,740
Grand Forks, North Dakota.

1482
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,820
I can send you a map so you can figure out where it is.

1483
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,460

1484
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,020
If you don't have one, if you have a Ting compatible device and they have CDMA and GSM

1485
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:24,700
networks, they'll give you a $25 service credit, which paid for more than my first month.

1486
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,940
So go to linux.ting.com and change up your mobile service and start saving money right

1487
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:29,940
now.

1488
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,340
Tons of great devices unlocked from like $60 feature phones all the way up to the latest

1489
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,340
and greatest Android devices.

1490
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,340
They got the OnePlus there too.

1491
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,340
Do you mind if I check out?

1492
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,340
Yeah.

1493
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
I've been watching it.

1494
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,340
Yep, yep, yep.

1495
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,340
I know, yeah.

1496
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,340
That's why I mentioned it.

1497
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,340
Keep thinking about it.

1498
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,340
All right.

1499
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,500
So your good buddies, your friends over at Dell, have suspended the XPS 13 developer

1500
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,500
edition.

1501
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Which computer?

1502
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
That's not what you're talking about.

1503
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Oh, I'm talking about that.

1504
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,500
No, I know.

1505
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,500
But that wasn't the one.

1506
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
Oh, which computer were you talking about?

1507
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,500
I was talking about that cheap 340.

1508
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Yeah.

1510
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,500
That is nice.

1511
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Well, that actually might be on suspend too.

1512
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
Hold on.

1513
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Okay.

1514
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,980
So those of you who know, the XPS 13 developer edition ships with Ubuntu 14.04 from Dell

1515
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,340
and they're currently putting it on suspend.

1516
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,300
Once again, we want to thank our entire community, they say, for your posts containing feedback

1517
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,420
and questions to the Dell Tech Center forum and this blog regarding the Ubuntu-based XPS

1518
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,980
13 and the M3800.

1519
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,980
Is that it?

1520
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,980
No, no, no.

1521
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,980
The M3800.

1522
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,980
That's the decision series.

1523
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,980
Okay.

1525
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,980
Yeah.

1526
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,980
So that cheaper $300 one is not being stopped.

1527
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,780
But the M3800 and the XPS 13 are being suspended.

1528
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,140
Last month, they posted four knowledge base articles addressing wireless drivers, keyboard

1529
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,140
repeats, suspend and resume, and cursor freezes.

1530
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,620
And they feel that they need to temporarily pull the plug on this laptop while they work

1531
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,460
these issues out and try to resolve the problem.

1532
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,540
So here's my initial thoughts on that.

1533
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,620
One is, if there is a problem and they're actively going to work on it, then it's a

1534
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,620
great thing.

1535
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,420
Now personally, I kind of see through that and I kind of get the impression that you

1536
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,220
do too, that that's not really what this is.

1537
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,900
Well, I own one and I don't have those problems.

1538
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,800
So here's the other side.

1539
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,040
If Dell decided to pull the plug on that particular model, I would say that that is a totally

1540
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,660
justifiable decision in that a lot of times we say that they didn't really commit to it,

1541
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,180
they didn't really push it, they didn't really – you can't really say that about the XPS.

1542
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:16,740
The XPS – because I had the older version of the XPS and I thought they completely contributed

1543
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,820
– I mean, they totally dove in on Linux.

1544
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,900
I mean, that was a Linux laptop.

1545
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,860
It was a good Linux laptop.

1546
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,220
And if the market doesn't respond, if people don't buy those computers, then yeah, Dell

1547
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,220
is going to pull the plug.

1548
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,340
Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with any of that.

1549
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,700
Where I feel like Dell went wrong and why I'm a little upset about it – not all that

1550
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:38,900
upset, but I had this impression when I got the XPS too, but – and it's undeniable.

1551
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,660
It was first and foremost designed as a Windows laptop.

1552
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,660
They looked at the specs and went, well, I think we could also make Linux run on this,

1553
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,500
but we have to – you know, you had that Broadcom thing, we have to accommodate for

1554
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,940
this, we have to accommodate for that.

1555
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,940
It was first and foremost built to run Windows 8.

1556
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,500
And then they later retrofitted – I mean, that's why it has a touch screen, right?

1557
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,140
I mean, why ship a Linux laptop today with a touch screen, right?

1558
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,500
It has all of these things that – like the 4K screen resolution didn't really work very

1559
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,780
well except for now it's a lot better since the time I've owned it, but at the beginning

1560
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,780
of this year, 4K support under Linux was really shitty.

1561
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,540
And now it's gotten to a point where it's actually usable, and thank God Chrome's high

1562
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:18,140
DPI and things like that, but they shipped a product where the applications on it didn't

1563
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,580
even look right on the display.

1564
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,500
The touch screen didn't really have a use.

1565
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,700
The mouse requires a special driver.

1566
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,300
The wireless card requires a special driver.

1567
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,780
They didn't – I don't feel like – if they really wanted to go all in on building

1568
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,500
– I think with that first Sputnik, that was better.

1569
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,060
Like they – it felt like that was maybe from the original drawing board, this is going

1570
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,140
to run Linux.

1571
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,260
This one felt like, hey, it's been a long time since we updated the Sputnik.

1572
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,100
This laptop's pretty close that we're building with Windows 8, so let's make that

1573
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,100
our Linux one.

1574
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:49,020
So, but at the time that they actually released the Linux version, did it – were those problems

1575
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,620
still persistent?

1576
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,380
Because remember when you – okay, all right.

1577
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,820
I mean the first – for the first few weeks, they had some issues, but they had some updates

1578
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,020
that fixed – that resolved pretty much everything.

1579
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,400
And then Dell released two BIOS updates, and then after they released those two BIOS updates,

1580
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,060
they also released it for the original XPS 13 that was shipped with Windows.

1581
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,260
After between – after they did those BIOS updates and the latest Linux kernel, I've

1582
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,420
never had a problem anymore.

1583
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,420
Wireless works fine.

1584
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,420
Sleep and suspend works fine.

1585
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,420
Key repeat issue's gone.

1586
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,420
Mouse issues are all gone.

1587
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,900
All that stuff is cleared up.

1588
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,660
So there were problems.

1589
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,660
And they fixed them.

1590
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,420
Through BIOS updates and stuff and kernel updates.

1591
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,380
But I feel like if they had gone at the approach where everything in this component needs to

1592
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,380
be – every component in this machine needs to be Linux compatible, they wouldn't have

1593
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,360
ended up where they're at right now.

1594
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,260
And the reason what I – the reason I don't like it is because, I mean, I'm super glad

1595
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,260
they're testing it.

1596
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,660
But I just wish – I wish if you're going to pull back on it, like, they're sort of

1597
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,180
playing to all these stereotypes about Linux on the desktop.

1598
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,780
Oh, you got weird issues here.

1599
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,780
We got weird issues here.

1600
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,940
In fact, they're so bad, we have to stop selling the product.

1601
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:52,180
And it just puts this message out there to other OEMs that this is a train wreck that

1602
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,780
you are going to get – it's a quagmire you're going to get pulled into if you try

1603
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,780
to ship this product.

1604
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
Boy, that's the truth.

1605
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:01,060
And the thing is, I believe, and I have believed for quite some time, that there is a market

1606
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,060
for a high-end, well-built Linux laptop.

1607
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,060
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,060
You can find the XPS.

1609
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,060
You and I –

1610
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,220
I actually think it's still a pretty great laptop.

1611
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,220
No, I agree.

1612
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,860
But I guess what I'm saying is I think that there's a lot of people that would say, well,

1613
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,900
Chris and Noah, you guys are the exception.

1614
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,900
Most people don't want that.

1615
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:21,700
Where Linux fits in is the crappy Celeron with 1366 by 768 and 120 gig SSD and 4 gigs

1616
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,700
of RAM.

1617
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,700
And you can sell that for –

1618
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,700
Or a spinning 5400.

1619
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,700
Yeah, right, right.

1620
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,500
And you can sell that for $300 or $200 at Best Buy.

1621
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
That's where Linux fits.

1622
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,500
And I don't agree with that.

1623
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,500
I think that that is one market.

1624
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
There's a range.

1625
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,500
I think there is a market for that.

1626
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,660
I also think there's – I think there's a big market for those Chromebook users that

1627
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,660
you were talking about.

1628
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,500
I think that there is a subset of those, and I think it's a fairly large subset, that

1629
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,780
would spend three or four times the amount of money on a laptop if they could keep it

1630
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,380
for the next seven or eight years, and it would work flawlessly.

1631
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,380
Yeah.

1632
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,920
Popey, have you looked at the XPS 13, and what do you think?

1633
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,140
Is this sort of bad PR in a roundabout way?

1634
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,140
Oh, no.

1635
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,140
He's lit up.

1636
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,140
Sorry, Popey.

1637
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,140
Go ahead.

1638
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,140
Oh, yeah.

1639
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,140
On my device.

1640
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,140
What?

1641
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,140
I'm sorry.

1642
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,140
I cut off the first few words you said.

1643
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,140
Oh, okay.

1644
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:08,140
It's a shame the quality assurance wasn't higher on the Linux shipping devices, because

1645
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,820
I know a bunch of people who bought them, both canonical and non-canonical, people who

1646
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:18,520
bought them and experienced the same kind of issues as everyone else and were just as

1647
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,540
frustrated as everyone else.

1648
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:28,260
And yeah, I agree that probably if it had been a Linux machine from the get-go and everything

1649
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:33,860
was made to work on Linux on day one, maybe things would be different.

1650
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:39,340
But the problem with that is you have such a small market for, you know, really relative

1651
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,080
to the Windows market, a very small market.

1652
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,740
So making a one-off specific machine, given the low profit margin that Dell make on every

1653
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:53,460
machine anyway, on any machine, that's a huge amount of engineering investment in order

1654
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,900
to make a one-off machine that you know will work well with Linux.

1655
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:04,580
So what generally happens with OEMs is from our perspective at Canonical, we work with

1656
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,020
them to build the image.

1657
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:13,460
So that image that went on the Dell XPS 13 that was shipping was a collaboration between

1658
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,840
Dell and Canonical.

1659
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:20,220
So we take some of the blame for that not being as shiny as it could have been as it

1660
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,220
went out the door.

1661
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:26,100
And, you know, we talked to Dell a lot about these kind of issues, and there's a lot of

1662
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:32,060
feedback that goes back to them, and clearly they've decided that they need to stop selling

1663
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:37,380
the thing temporarily just so that they can integrate all these fixes so the ones that

1664
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,340
go out the door are the best that they can possibly be.

1665
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:45,820
But Popey, I mean, so I can accept that to a certain extent, but the reality is like

1666
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,960
that you're shipped with a Broadcom card, right?

1667
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,620
If you are building a computer to run Linux, that's almost the worst possible card you

1668
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:56,540
could put in there, save the ones that Dell themselves make.

1669
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,540
Here's I guess so...

1670
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,540
Sure.

1671
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,500
Like name a wireless card that's fantastic on Linux and Windows.

1672
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Intel.

1673
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Well, the Intel's are pretty good.

1674
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Intel's.

1675
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,500
No, that's bullshit.

1676
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,500
No, no, no, no.

1677
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,500
I've never had an Intel card.

1678
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,180
Popey, I've never ever had an Intel card that didn't work right out of the box with Linux,

1679
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,180
ever.

1680
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,180
Well, well done you.

1681
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,180
But I have.

1682
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,700
Can you give me a model?

1683
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:18,880
For the last two years, for the last two years, the IWL Wi-Fi driver, you've had to blacklist

1684
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,760
N to even stay on a wireless network.

1685
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,860
It's ridiculous.

1686
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:28,620
So making out like one wireless wireless card is somehow blessed by the gods and is way

1687
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:32,740
better than all the others is just bull because they are all shit.

1688
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,340
I respectfully disagree with you.

1689
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:39,660
I in like and I don't mean like the one or two or three laptops had I've had over the

1690
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,660
year.

1691
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,900
I mean like 50, 60 different computers, all of that Intel cards, and I've never had an

1692
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,900
issue.

1693
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,900
So I am.

1694
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,320
Well, that's nice for you, but you're not you're not alone.

1695
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:55,540
And I get people PMing me saying, hey, what's that thing I put in etc modules dot D or whatever

1696
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:00,420
that disables wireless N on Intel cards because I'm at a customer site and I can't get on

1697
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,740
their Wi-Fi.

1698
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,500
And this is a common problem.

1699
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,980
Can you give me a model that I can put in my computer?

1700
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,700
Whatever's in my whatever's in my X220.

1701
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,260
I have one Intel card I had I have had issues with, but for the most part, they've been

1702
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
pretty good for me.

1703
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,260
I have an X220.

1704
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,260
Right.

1705
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,260
And I don't have a problem with my wireless card.

1706
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,060
I love I love Intel as much as the next guy, right?

1707
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:27,260
But you you can't put them up as hold them up as being the panacea of perfection because

1708
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,740
there are issues with it with their wireless drivers and there are issues with their X

1709
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:37,260
drivers and to make out like they're somehow way more perfect than ATI or Nvidia is just

1710
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,260
missing the point.

1711
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,260
I can't speak.

1712
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,260
I can't speak to graphics.

1713
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,260
But I'll tell you this.

1714
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,940
If you order 10 Intel Wi-Fi cards off of Amazon different models and you order 10 Broadcom

1715
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:50,060
cards, I'll make a bet right now that 10 of the Intel ones will work on Linux right out

1716
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:53,220
of the box and nine out of the 10 of the Broadcom ones won't work out of the box.

1717
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,340
I wonder five of those.

1718
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,340
You'll never get to work.

1719
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,860
I wonder if the differences you guys are talking about is Noah's talking about actually turning

1720
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,180
the card on and connecting like the driver seeing it.

1721
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:03,980
And I think he's talking about like reliability of connection of the wireless network.

1722
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:09,060
Oh, that might be actually, you know, that might be here's the thing I will deal with.

1723
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,500
So to that here would be my answer.

1724
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,900
My answer would be I'll take the card that is less reliable than the card that gives

1725
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:14,900
me no Wi-Fi whatsoever.

1726
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,020
Well, I think Wi-Fi is unreliable.

1727
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:21,300
I wanted to address that so that I think probably made a pretty fair point in that, you know,

1728
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:28,580
Dell doesn't really have the time, resources or motivations to make that XPS laptop Linux

1729
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:33,860
first because really they're selling way, you know, probably 99 percent more Windows

1730
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,080
laptops than they are going to sell the Linux version of that laptop.

1731
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,020
So from an entire company orientation standpoint, it makes a lot more sense, a lot more practical

1732
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:46,620
sense to put your resources behind the product that's going to go to all of your profit.

1733
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:51,500
However, I think you could apply that same logic model and say that's why it's critical

1734
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,220
that they make this machine their focus.

1735
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:57,060
They make it so important to get it right because they're coming into a new market hat

1736
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,760
in hand, humble, saying this is our entrance into the space.

1737
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,060
We want this to be the developer edition.

1738
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:06,460
People that are developing software for Linux, this is a machine for you.

1739
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,540
And if you want to come into a new market and you want to bring a new group of people

1740
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,740
into your product and you want to show them that when you launch a product for them, you

1741
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,860
can do it right, it's absolutely important that you get all of the small details right.

1742
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:21,300
And I hate doing this, but let's be honest, if Apple made this machine, they wouldn't

1743
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,300
care about that.

1744
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,740
They would say if we're going to build a machine for these people, then we have to build it

1745
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,740
with all of these components.

1746
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,500
Just like, and of course for us, it wouldn't match, it would have one port and it would

1747
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
be horrible.

1748
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
We wouldn't like it.

1749
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,500
That's how they get the MacBook One.

1750
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,180
But they start at that spot and they say what does this group need?

1751
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,180
What do these people need?

1752
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:38,620
And they build the entire machine, even if it's going to be a tiny, tiny fraction of

1753
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,780
their business because it's actually more important, right?

1754
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,420
Because you're introducing yourself to a new set of people, a new set of potential buyers

1755
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,780
and you're trying to carve out a new space in the marketplace that potentially in the

1756
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,920
future as this market grows, they will come to you as one of the people that builds the

1757
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,700
best product for that.

1758
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,220
And I think if you don't come at that with that perspective, you will never break into

1759
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,220
that market.

1760
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:04,200
You always end up with what Dell has, a pretty solid attempt, but the end execution just

1761
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,200
isn't right.

1762
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,300
And then what unfortunately happens, even though they worked so hard and you know, there's

1763
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,180
people in the Dell Linux team that they just work with the best that they've been given.

1764
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,940
I've talked to them and they're good people, but the reality is the product ends up not

1765
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:16,940
being good enough.

1766
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,980
And over and over and over again, despite their hard efforts, Dell under delivers.

1767
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:24,500
And then when they have to retract, they do it publicly in a way that is embarrassing

1768
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,760
to Linux.

1769
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,660
And that's super unfortunate.

1770
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:30,580
So if you have three options, given the state that they're in right now, right?

1771
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:35,620
They've got one part of the company, the significant part that's making these, manufacturing these

1772
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:40,520
laptops designed for Windows 8.1 or 10 or whatever the latest thing is.

1773
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:46,900
And a tiny, tiny Sputnik team who are doing their best to get Linux working on these machines

1774
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:53,020
and shipping from a global company like Dell and trying to get all the divisions of Dell

1775
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,220
around the world shipping those things because not every division sells it.

1776
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:03,500
You know, as you've seen, you can find it on dell.co.uk, but not on dell.com, for example.

1777
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,460
And they're doing their absolute best and they get to a situation where, where they

1778
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:11,340
are now is a laptop that is not good enough to have the Dell brand name on it, right?

1779
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,340
So what do you do?

1780
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,300
Do you completely scrap that project and just forget it?

1781
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:21,140
Or do you carry on shipping those devices knowing that they're crap and that they shouldn't

1782
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,700
have the Dell name on them?

1783
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:28,420
Or do you stop shipping them, stop the line, fix it at the factory and make sure that every

1784
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,460
machine that goes out from that point onwards is right?

1785
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,580
And I think that is the right option.

1786
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:37,060
Yes, they could have made different decisions in the past, but they are where they are and

1787
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:39,580
where they are right now, I think they've made the right decision.

1788
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,580
And I agree with you.

1789
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:44,240
If that's what actually ends up happening, I guess what I'm afraid of is that they're

1790
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,940
not going to keep shipping them, that they're just pulling the plug and that's a polite

1791
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:50,140
way of them doing that.

1792
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,540
And if that's not the, I hope to God, I'm wrong about that.

1793
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,340
I think that part almost doesn't matter because it just feels like it's been fist-hammed so

1794
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,340
far.

1795
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,340
I don't know.

1796
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,980
Barton George is the head of the Sputnik team and he tweeted, it's on pause.

1797
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:01,980
Yeah.

1798
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,980
They say pause.

1799
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:03,980
They say pause.

1800
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,980
I believe it's a pause.

1801
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,980
I believe it is.

1802
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,980
That's not what I have issue with.

1803
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,580
I have issue with, the damage is done.

1804
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,580
That's what I have issue with.

1805
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,580
I don't know.

1806
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:13,580
Here's the thing.

1807
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:18,460
I think that exactly what Poppy just said, I mean given the environmental variables that

1808
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,300
they're put into, I think they did the best job possible.

1809
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:25,720
I don't think it's cost-effective to build a 1200 – when you're a company that makes

1810
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,540
all of your money off of selling Windows laptops, I don't know that it makes a business

1811
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,540
…

1812
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,100
How much money is selling Windows laptops?

1813
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Servers?

1814
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,100
No.

1815
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,100
Do you have another guess?

1816
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,100
Sand storage?

1817
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
It's not a piece of hardware.

1818
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,100
Oh.

1819
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,100
Dell doesn't … no.

1820
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,060
Then I have no idea.

1821
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,060
Now this was 2014 and this is 2015, I don't know if you knew that, so I don't know if

1822
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,100
this is still true or not, but I'm actually looking at the financial analysis of Dell

1823
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:51,100
and HP right now as we record this show and Dell makes primary the bulk of its income

1824
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,140
from financing.

1825
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,140
I guess that's not surprising.

1826
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,140
But financing what?

1827
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,140
Computers?

1828
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,140
Yeah.

1829
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,140
And servers.

1830
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,140
But that's actually what they make their money from is off the interest rates that

1831
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,140
people are paying when they finance Dell computers.

1832
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,140
Yeah.

1833
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,140
But they have to buy those computers to begin with.

1834
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,140
So the argument is …

1835
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:05,700
It's just something to kind of think about when you think about it, like what they actually

1836
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:06,700
make money from is being a bank.

1837
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,700
It's kind of fun.

1838
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,700
Yeah.

1839
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,700
It's funny.

1840
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,700
But they have to make computers compelling enough for people to want to finance them.

1841
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,700
Yeah.

1842
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:18,820
But given those variables, then I agree – I'm inclined to agree with Popey that the best

1843
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:24,100
possible solution is to halt production, fix the problems, and then pick it back up.

1844
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,980
That's the responsible thing to do.

1845
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,460
And giving the available options?

1846
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,460
Yes.

1847
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Right.

1848
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,580
And I think – and it's hard for me to kind of convey this perspective.

1849
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,140
But the perspective that I'm worried about isn't what you think or I think or consumers

1850
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,140
think.

1851
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,540
I'm thinking Lenovo and HP are watching this and they're thinking, boy, look at that

1852
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:40,540
shit show.

1853
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,540
I'm not going to do that.

1854
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,540
Yeah.

1855
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,540
Maybe.

1856
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,540
That's what I'm worried about.

1857
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,540
Maybe.

1858
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:49,300
But then you look at the way that Samsung has rolled out Chromebooks and really other

1859
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,300
than the …

1860
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,880
That just validates that statement.

1861
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,420
In order for Linux to be successful, it has to be wrapped up in Chrome.

1862
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,420
It has to be Chrome OS.

1863
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,100
If you try to ship actual Linux, you get this.

1864
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,620
You get a product, you have to pull off the market.

1865
01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,620
Yeah, but here's the thing.

1866
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,900
Samsung – and maybe this is just because – you really don't think that Lenovo sees

1867
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,900
that though?

1868
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,460
I mean, Samsung built a computer specifically to run Chrome OS.

1869
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,460
You know what I mean?

1870
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,540
And so did Acer and so did HP and whoever else …

1871
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,260
I think they very closely watch their competitors and see how their different products do in

1872
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,260
the marketplace.

1873
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,260
Yeah, but …

1874
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:20,260
Well, I think HP shipped Chrome first but they subsequently shipped them with Windows

1875
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,300
like cut down Windows and Linux as well.

1876
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,820
I guess my point was that I don't think that Lenovo is going to look over and say,

1877
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,820
oh, that laptop failed.

1878
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,940
I don't think that the people at Lenovo are that dumb.

1879
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,940
They won't be able to figure it out.

1880
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,940
Maybe.

1881
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,940
Oh, you know …

1882
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:32,940
I don't.

1883
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,540
I think they do watch their competitors and they see what products do really well and

1884
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,500
then they execute based on what other markets are doing.

1885
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,500
Oh, right.

1886
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,900
So Lenovo probably won't take an existing Windows product and put Linux on it and try

1887
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,900
and sell it.

1888
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,900
Or maybe they'll spend a little more time on Q&A.

1889
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:46,460
I mean, because really Dell could have avoided a lot of this with some proper QA.

1890
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,460
I mean, not that they didn't.

1891
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,460
I know they QA'd it.

1892
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,460
Yeah.

1893
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,460
But they could have avoided a lot more.

1894
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,460
Yeah, that's true.

1895
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,460
Harm.

1896
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,740
I mean, they are potentially poisoning the well for their own future products too, a

1897
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,740
little bit.

1898
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,740
Yeah.

1899
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,740
No, I think there's a market.

1900
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:01,780
But don't forget, this is just one of the Sputniks.

1901
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,780
This is like, I don't know, the third or fourth generation of the Sputniks and this

1902
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,780
is the only one that's had these kind of significant issues.

1903
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,780
Yeah, that's true.

1904
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,780
The first two.

1905
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,980
There have been multiple Sputnik devices that have been shipped to many people.

1906
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,220
I have no idea what the sales numbers are, but it's quite a lot of people.

1907
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,260
I would love them to tell us.

1908
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,260
Yeah.

1909
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,260
Yeah, I don't know.

1910
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,260
It's commercial data.

1911
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,260
I guess they probably won't.

1912
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,260
Yeah.

1913
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,660
Yeah, they probably will never will.

1914
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,660
But yeah.

1915
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:26,660
So here's why.

1916
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,660
This is true.

1917
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,660
I think this is, you know, you've got Chromebooks.

1918
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:33,300
Now, I'm surprised we haven't really seen this, but this is an Android PC that is actually

1919
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,780
doing pretty well on Kickstarter.

1920
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,900
It's got 8,161 backers.

1921
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,260
It's tiny.

1922
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:41,340
It's got, it's made $533,000 in 39 days.

1923
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:42,340
I'm just going to play a little bit of it.

1924
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,960
We'll just play a little bit of it, just because it's sort of a good capper to this

1925
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,100
conversation where we keep going back between Chrome OS and getting Linux right.

1926
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,580
The way we think reflects the world we live in.

1927
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,960
Ideologies change with the times.

1928
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,580
In the past few decades, a thought evolution has happened.

1929
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:06,820
We've gone from expecting excessively more to embracing sustainably less.

1930
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:11,980
At Jai Technology, we're innovating the next evolutionary leap in personal computing that

1931
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:21,020
embodies less can be more.

1932
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:29,220
Less cost, more value, less design, more functionality, less wasteful, more sustainable, less waiting,

1933
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:39,180
more doing, less power, more performance, less Windows, more apps.

1934
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:44,900
Introducing the Remix Mini.

1935
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,660
The world's first true Android PC.

1936
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:55,180
Finally, less can be more.

1937
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,180
Starting at $20.

1938
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,020
I fundamentally disagree with everything that video just said.

1939
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,340
Also, could it get any more pretentious?

1940
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,340
I know, right?

1941
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,940
Like, okay, so let's start with this.

1942
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:11,220
I cannot believe that somebody would make a video to talk about how you should expect

1943
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,220
your computer to do less.

1944
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,220
Oh yeah, you can.

1945
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:14,220
No, okay.

1946
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,220
That's where I'm starting there.

1947
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,220
Okay, all right.

1948
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,220
All right, go ahead.

1949
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,220
Keep going.

1950
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,220
You know what?

1951
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:22,860
For any of the advantages that that stupid piece of junk offers, my Linux box has done

1952
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,540
for the last 20 years.

1953
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,900
So why do I care again?

1954
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:30,220
So because finally, less is more.

1955
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,860
It's what they're selling is the subtext.

1956
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,580
The subtext is it's simplified.

1957
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,580
It's easier.

1958
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:38,140
Because if you tell an end user, look at computers, it's complicated.

1959
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,140
Too much going on.

1960
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,140
There's too much.

1961
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,740
Like, remember I was telling you about that user who's like, why do I keep getting notifications

1962
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:43,740
about updates?

1963
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,740
I don't care about updates.

1964
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,740
These apps I never use.

1965
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,740
Why do I keep getting them?

1966
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,120
To them, it's too much.

1967
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,060
So if you tell them it's simple and you can do more with less, the subtext is this is

1968
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,500
a computer that's just going to do the bare what you need it to do.

1969
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,500
That's the subtext.

1970
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,500
Here's what I hear.

1971
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,980
What I hear is here's a computer that you can spend less money on and it'll do less

1972
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:06,900
because the application environment is just so spread up and we can't decide if we want

1973
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:07,900
to write for Windows.

1974
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,900
But everybody knows Android.

1975
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,900
Who knows what Windows is happening?

1976
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:10,900
No, dude.

1977
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,900
Android has apps, man.

1978
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,900
You can get apps now.

1979
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,900
Yeah, Android has apps.

1980
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,700
Some of them are crappy apps and even the ones that people use in business are so bad

1981
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,300
and we just shoehorn them into fits.

1982
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,260
I watched a guy, Chris, I watched a guy, this is like three weeks ago, and he's going to

1983
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:25,260
do his go-to meeting.

1984
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:30,460
Okay, so he has a stupid Android tablet and he sets it up and the thing falls over.

1985
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,460
Of course.

1986
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,980
Okay, so then he picks it back up and sets and then he's trying to edit.

1987
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:34,980
He's tapping it.

1988
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,980
He's tapping it.

1989
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,980
Knocking it over.

1990
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:37,980
They're going to edit this Excel sheet, right?

1991
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:42,460
So he's trying to maximize the thing and he's in the middle of explaining this.

1992
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:43,460
He's in there painting and zooming while he's talking.

1993
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,460
Yes, yes.

1994
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:48,740
He's giving this business presentation on selling a $500,000 hotel and I'm like, you've

1995
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,740
got to be kidding me.

1996
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,740
You look like a dog.

1997
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,740
Get a desktop.

1998
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,740
A laptop.

1999
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,740
Get a laptop.

2000
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,740
Like, why are you doing this on your tablet?

2001
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,580
And then he gets done and this is what he says to me, he goes, man, isn't technology

2002
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,580
amazing?

2003
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,580
I can do all that from my tablet.

2004
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,140
And I'm like, you're kidding me right now.

2005
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,140
That was horrible.

2006
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,140
That was horrible.

2007
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,140
That was a mess.

2008
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,340
That was a disaster.

2009
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,380
How can you say, I can't believe we can do that right now?

2010
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,900
I needed to brag about it afterwards.

2011
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
That's classic.

2012
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,220
That's what this commercial embodies to me.

2013
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:16,020
Is this idea that we're okay just not caring about our computers.

2014
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,900
You know what I was thinking about the other day on the flight over here?

2015
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:23,100
The way that ham radio works, in order to actually use the ham radio, you can go buy

2016
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,100
one.

2017
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,820
You have to get licensed before you can do that, right?

2018
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:30,340
Now imagine this, what would happen if we required a license before you could purchase

2019
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,340
a personal computer?

2020
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:35,240
You had to understand the basics of memory management, of hard drives, of how the file

2021
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,240
system works.

2022
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,240
Nobody would use them, dude.

2023
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,220
You'd have as many, just like you'd have as many computers as you have hams.

2024
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,220
That's right.

2025
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:46,540
You'd have two people that used it, but the people that used it wouldn't be so stupid.

2026
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,460
You would have people, users would understand the technology they're working with.

2027
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,380
I'm not actually advocating for that.

2028
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:57,900
It's kind of an interesting thing to think about, but the reality is that this just embodies

2029
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,420
how silly users have become.

2030
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,780
Well, Daredevil, don't you think it's a matter of just the systems are honestly too complex

2031
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:04,780
for the jobs they want to get done?

2032
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,780
No.

2033
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,260
Look, Android, people have the perspective that it just works.

2034
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,260
Yeah, it's easy.

2035
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,260
They get their phone, that it works.

2036
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,260
Sure, it's easy.

2037
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:17,340
But it's not just the easy part, it's the not set up part.

2038
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:23,260
It's no virus issues, it's the update, it's the one button press, when it happens, it's

2039
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,020
like you're talking an app, it's an app store.

2040
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,020
Yeah, all your apps are updated.

2041
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,820
It's a much easier paradigm for users.

2042
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,460
That has been sitting in my pocket.

2043
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,460
It's burning up.

2044
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,500
Why is that so hot?

2045
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Your phone's on fire, dude.

2046
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,500
My phone's on fire.

2047
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,100
So what do you mean it just works?

2048
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,620
I pulled it right out of my pocket.

2049
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,140
I have not touched that phone in the last 40 minutes.

2050
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,900
And now you just charge it and your battery's down to 30%.

2051
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,900
That's right.

2052
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,780
30%, down from 100 when we started the show, not 60.

2053
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:50,380
What the heck is this thing doing?

2054
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,020
So don't tell me Android just works.

2055
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,020
Come on.

2056
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,940
I mean, you're forgetting all the sensors and all the NSA probing the data.

2057
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,940
Right, right.

2058
01:24:58,940 --> 01:24:59,940
Come on.

2059
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,940
You have to discount that information.

2060
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:03,060
What I love about it, and I don't know if it has to be a simple computer, I love the

2061
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:07,300
idea of a cheap computer that's functional, that gets people online, because that opens

2062
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,260
the door up to a whole lot of people, opens up to kids, schools, libraries, third world.

2063
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,260
How much is that thing?

2064
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,260
What?

2065
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,820
Well, they say they'll eventually be able to sell it for $20.

2066
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:21,220
So assuming that's right, how is that more advantageous than the Raspberry Pi?

2067
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,220
Because it's all set up.

2068
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,220
Yeah, that's true.

2069
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,220
That's true.

2070
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,220
You get it out of a box.

2071
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,220
I don't know.

2072
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,220
This isn't the solution.

2073
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,020
I think what we're seeing here is there's something here.

2074
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,020
This isn't it.

2075
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,460
Raspberry Pi isn't it because it's too manual.

2076
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,920
But there's something in this area that I think some... And in order to get the price

2077
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,780
down here, it's going to have to be Linux based, I think, for the world's first true

2078
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:39,780
Android PC.

2079
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,340
I don't actually think that's true either.

2080
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,980
Yeah, Nate points out you can make it a $20 Plex client.

2081
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,020
So I tried using both Raspberry Pis.

2082
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:54,020
I've tried using Chromeboxes and flashing different... Yeah, and so here's what I found.

2083
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:58,460
Eventually what I found was the drawbacks to doing that, it just makes more sense to

2084
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,940
buy the Celeron Note for $140.

2085
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:03,300
And I'll tell you what, this is not, like Popeys pointed out to him, this is not the

2086
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,300
first Android PC and I think the reason is they're not taking off.

2087
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,900
I joke about me predicting this because I actually thought somebody would get it.

2088
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,980
I thought somebody could nail it.

2089
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,020
It seemed like you have a great base OS, you've got some great apps, you just tweak it a little

2090
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,620
bit, everybody likes to put a custom UI on there.

2091
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:22,500
Here's the other part of that too is that if I take a small ARM computer that's going

2092
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,780
to run Android, why would I bother putting that into a tower?

2093
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,060
I'll just build that into an all-in-one.

2094
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,100
And there are Android all-in-ones.

2095
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:33,340
And really if you think about it, the desktop, the mobile operating system that just basically

2096
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:37,580
gets you online that is built into a desktop or a tower, that is Chrome OS.

2097
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,620
I mean that is the market that Chrome OS is, right?

2098
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,620
And it's got the brand.

2099
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,620
Yeah.

2100
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:42,620
Yep.

2101
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,620
There you go.

2102
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,420
And of course that does, I think that means there may be room for conversions one day

2103
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,420
though.

2104
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,420
Could be.

2105
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,100
I think if you don't want something like this but you want also something mobile, I don't

2106
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,100
know, what you say?

2107
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,100
We'll save that debate for a future episode.

2108
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,620
You can make that prediction, maybe in three years that won't come true.

2109
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,620
Yeah.

2110
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,620
Thanks man, thanks.

2111
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,620
All right.

2112
01:26:58,620 --> 01:26:59,620
So that's going to wrap it up.

2113
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:00,620
We are going to be at OSCON.

2114
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,580
If you're listening to this and you're going to be in the Portland area, meetup.com slash

2115
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,900
jupyterbroadcasting.

2116
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:08,620
For more information, we're going to be there Wednesday, July 22nd hanging out and we'd

2117
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,360
love to see you guys there.

2118
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,380
So meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

2119
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,340
If you have any feedback or comments for this episode, you can go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2120
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,140
or the contact form if you want to email us or just join us in the Bumble Room.

2121
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:25,300
We usually do the show on Tuesdays, but this week, this week to make room for OSCON we

2122
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,700
recorded on a Monday right after Coda Radio.

2123
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,420
It was a back-to-back edition.

2124
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,420
So I'm really thankful that you guys in the Bumble Room were able to show up on the Monday.

2125
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,620
I really appreciate it.

2126
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,620
Good turnout.

2127
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,620
Noah, thanks for coming in studio.

2128
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,620
Hey, anytime.

2129
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:40,580
And you know, have a great time at OSCON.

2130
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,580
Maybe I'll see you there.

2131
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,580
Yeah, maybe.

2132
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,580
Maybe we'll bump into each other.

2133
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,580
All right.

2134
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:45,580
Cool.

2135
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,580
Also, you can follow Noah.

2136
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,580
He's on Twitter.

2137
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:48,580
Noah, give him your Twitter handle.

2138
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,580
My Twitter handle is at Colonel Linux.

2139
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,580
Yep, yep.

2140
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:51,580
This guy over here is at ChrisAlias.

2141
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:52,580
That's that.

2142
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,580
You know what?

2143
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,580
You changed it.

2144
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,580
All right.

2145
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,580
Let's see what you're up to now.

2146
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:57,580
It's like not that much.

2147
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,580
It makes me feel bad.

2148
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,580
Okay.

2149
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,580
I don't know.

2150
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,580
It's like a thousand.

2151
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,580
All right, everybody.

2152
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,580
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode.

2153
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:25,580
I hope you have a great day, and I'll see you next week.

2154
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,580
All right, did you look?

2155
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,580
What is it?

2156
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:28,580
Is it a thousand?

2157
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,580
Twelve hundred.

2158
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,580
Twelve hundred?

2159
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:31,580
All right.

2160
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,580
Not bad.

2161
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:38,260
I think so, especially because I've had the same Twitter account for seven years, and

2162
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,260
I'm up to 835.

2163
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,260
All right.

2164
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:41,260
JBtitles.com.

2165
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,260
Let's pick our title for this week's episode of the Unplugged Show.

2166
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,820
I was watching those little airport, you know, they have the little videos that play over

2167
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,580
and over again that want to make you kill yourself because you hear them so much.

2168
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,980
There's one about Twitter, and it was saying the way to get more Twitter followers is to

2169
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,980
tweet, and I'm like, wow.

2170
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:54,980
What a revolutionary concept.

2171
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:55,980
I never thought of that.

2172
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:59,580
Actually, it is true, and reply, and it really does, because I don't tweet very much.

2173
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:00,580
I just do not.

2174
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,580
Like, when I have a free moment, my first thought is, ooh, let's update Twitter.

2175
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,780
Yeah, actually, so here's been my thought on Twitter.

2176
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,780
Twitter's concept has always been, what are you doing right now?

2177
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,780
Here's my answer.

2178
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,780
I don't care.

2179
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:14,060
I mean, most people, let's face it, I don't care what you're doing right now.

2180
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:19,540
All right, JBtitles.com, a lot to pick from, a lot to pick from, GPU hacks, the canonical

2181
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:26,660
Dell and AMD games, that's not bad, GPL gets trumped, that's not, CDL gets trumped, Noah's

2182
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:34,300
Home Ting Shop, Doo-Wop, Doo-Wop, Doo-Wop, JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com.

2183
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,820
Any post-show topics for the Mumble Room you guys want to talk about before we get out

2184
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:37,820
of here for the day?

2185
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,500
We didn't have a mumble unplugged, but what happened to a tight show?

2186
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Not sure if you guys saw the biofuel, new thing that they discovered, like they can

2187
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,860
use some energy from your sweat and also from your organ.

2188
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:58,420
Well, I could power the shit out of some stuff in the studio right now.

2189
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,420
It is hot in here.

2190
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,420
It's getting warm, right?

2191
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,100
Hey, maybe you could power an air conditioner with your sweat.

2192
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,100
That'd be amazing.

2193
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,100
Oh, man.

2194
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:11,540
Well, you could at least charge your watch that is always discharging.

2195
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,540
Yeah.

2196
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,540
So what do you guys think?

2197
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,300
Do you think we'll have sweat-powered watches one day?

2198
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,300
No?

2199
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,300
Okay.

2200
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,020
I think you're going to have, I think there's a lot more longevity in either.

2201
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,020
I think there's more longevity.

2202
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,020
Good.

2203
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:33,100
I think there's going to be a lot more, I think there's going to be a lot more longevity

2204
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:39,460
in either solar-powered watches or, I forget the name, but the thing that, yeah, right.

2205
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,460
There's a name for that though.

2206
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,460
Yeah.

2207
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,460
Kinetic.

2208
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,460
Yeah.

2209
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,460
Yeah.

2210
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:45,460
What do you guys think?

2211
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,460
Canonical Dell and AMD games.

2212
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,460
You like that title?

2213
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,460
Love it.

2214
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,460
It's not too bad, really.

2215
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:50,460
The best one ever.

2216
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:51,460
Yeah.

2217
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,460
Sure.

2218
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:57,420
On the whole Dell XPS thing though, I got the 2015 developer edition and one of the

2219
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:02,300
things I want to highlight is currently in the Linux world, there aren't too many laptops,

2220
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,300
high-end laptops.

2221
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,820
Well, not even that, it's the appliance, it's the laptop that just works.

2222
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:13,220
Oh, you just mean like, yeah, like I was able to get a tiny laptop with an i7 processor,

2223
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:16,820
an SSD drive, an Intel Iris graphics and a 4K screen.

2224
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,860
Like there's not a lot of Linux laptops that check all those boxes.

2225
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:24,620
Yeah, and that have the support from someone like Canonical and Dell behind it that are

2226
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,620
managing the update process.

2227
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,620
Hey, man.

2228
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,620
And you just use it.

2229
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,620
Hey, man.

2230
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,620
That's why I bought it.

2231
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:30,620
Dude, that was like right up.

2232
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,620
Yeah.

2233
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:36,540
And so that's why, but I don't, I run Arch, probably not too surprising.

2234
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,180
And I literally don't have any of the problems that they were talking about in that article.

2235
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:45,380
I ran Arch online for a period of time and I switched back to Ubuntu.

2236
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:50,460
Now I had to do that too until a kernel update and I got the latest version of the BIOS.

2237
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,860
And then after that, I went back to Arch and I've had no problems.

2238
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:53,860
Oh, that's right.

2239
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:54,860
Yeah.

2240
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,860
Yeah.

2241
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:56,860
It worked a lot better for me.

2242
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:57,860
That was, yeah.

2243
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:58,860
Hey, Chris.

2244
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,620
When do you arrive at OSCON?

2245
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,180
We'll be down there Wednesday morning.

2246
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,180
We're going to be in the area Tuesday evening.

2247
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:07,180
Are you going to be doing any interviews or anything?

2248
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,180
Oh yes.

2249
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,180
Oh yes.

2250
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,180
You have somebody we should talk to?

2251
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,180
Yes.

2252
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,180
Oh, tell us.

2253
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,180
Yeah.

2254
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:19,180
Hey, can you, you have me on Telegram, right?

2255
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,180
Unfortunately you do.

2256
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,180
Yes.

2257
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,180
Well, you loser.

2258
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,180
When do you have a chance?

2259
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:28,820
If you could send me the contact info, I actually, we have a, I have a, I have a tentative schedule.

2260
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:32,740
I think we're going to be doing the interviews on Wednesday and I have a tentative schedule

2261
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,220
of people that have asked to speak with us and tentative times.

2262
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,620
If you could get me his contact information.

2263
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,620
Totally Adam.

2264
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,620
That'd be great.

2265
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,620
Yeah.

2266
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,620
Yeah, sure.

2267
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,620
Thank you.

2268
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,620
We'll set something up and we'll make it happen.

2269
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:43,620
Okay.
