1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,240
Oh my god, Wes.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,200
You're waiting for WWDC.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,040
You know it.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,400
You're waiting for WWDC

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,720
to see what the new MacBook Pros

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,680
are gonna look like, aren't you?

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,080
I'm hoping it's just all touch bar.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
It's just one giant touch bar, Chris,

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,080
and then that's it.

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,080
No more keyboard, no more track pad.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,960
It's the touch pad.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,800
Wow.

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,720
I mean, cause I'm really done

14
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,880
with this whole Linux thing anyway, you know.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,240
I want that, I want something stable.

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,000
And it makes sense, you know, Dan's on the Mac,

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
so that way when you guys are doing TechSnap,

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,320
you're on a common platform.

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,160
Yep.

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,980
That makes a lot of sense.

21
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,040
And you know that OS X is like the homeboy for Skype.

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,880
That's just where it shines.

23
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,600
Right, that's his predominantly used platform.

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,160
And then, of course, the studio here

25
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
is switching all to Macs.

26
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
Yes.

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,320
So, you know, we just recently made a transition to Linux,

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,680
and now that we've made that transition,

29
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,140
obviously we'll be making a transition to Mac OS.

30
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,980
So.

31
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,160
Like when that new Mac Pro comes out.

32
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,040
Right, so when you consider the fact

33
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,480
that the studio's gonna be on the Macs,

34
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,440
Dan's on a Mac, you should probably get a Mac.

35
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,720
And I plan to release a Jupyter broadcasting touch bar app.

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
Oh.

37
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a touch bar app.

38
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,060
So it's got like, it's got the, right on there,

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,900
right on the touch bar.

40
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,740
Yeah, that's one of the buttons.

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,560
Some Stallman things.

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah, yep, just three things actually.

43
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,000
Stallman, the DING, obviously.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Obviously.

45
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,660
Of course.

46
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,200
And then just a button that loads our webpage.

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,520
You just push that button and it just loads our webpage.

48
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
Oh yeah, jzlive.tv, right there.

49
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
Yeah, cause you know, nobody's buying keyboards

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
with the custom buttons anymore,

51
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
but touch bar apps, people be desperate for those.

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,660
And with all the switching over to Macs,

53
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,760
it just seems to make a lot of sense.

54
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,420
And you can monetize.

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 199 for May 30th, 2017.

56
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:57,080
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

57
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,320
that's been trying out so many different projects this week.

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,480
It might be time for a nuke and pave.

59
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,360
My name is Chris.

60
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,200
My name is Wes.

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
Hello, Wes.

62
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
I hope this is one of those episodes

63
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
where people will walk away

64
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,860
and they're going to want to try at least something

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
that we talked about today,

66
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,680
because goodness knows I have,

67
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,520
I have been trying out some really great projects this week

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,660
and I got just a couple of them that we're going to share.

69
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,320
I've also got like a whole list of things

70
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,960
I could talk about for future episodes,

71
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
but we'll get into all of that

72
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,320
because before we can get there,

73
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,840
there are some big updates in the open source community

74
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,460
and in Linux that we want to talk about.

75
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,320
I've been going through the list today, Wes,

76
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,180
and I was like, geez, how do we even,

77
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,720
how do we even sort through these things?

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,260
So what I've tried to do this week

79
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,340
is we're going to start with some of like

80
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,680
the official newsy stuff.

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
And then I'm going to gush about our community

82
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,400
for a little bit.

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,760
Then we're going to replace Evernote once and for all.

84
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,580
Yes!

85
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,040
And all your other apps.

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Those of you who need to improve your focus,

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
well, there's a GNOME extension for you.

88
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,000
And finally, we'll solve the problem

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,300
of old smartphones not getting update.

90
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,960
Then we'll talk a little bit about Chaos Bot,

91
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,920
the huge improvements coming to the Plasma desktop.

92
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,720
And then finally, finally, my friends,

93
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
you can stop hating Docker now

94
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,080
and we can all have a little fun with KiteMatic.

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
I'll drink to that.

96
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy.

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
Speaking of which, Wes brought us in some IPAs this week.

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,040
And these are some serious ones,

99
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,060
some local brews from Seattle

100
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,000
because beer matters in Seattle, it says.

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,820
That's right, it does.

102
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,880
I like that, that's pretty good.

103
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
That's pretty good.

104
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,040
When it rains as much as it does here,

105
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,680
you gotta have something to lift your spirits.

106
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Wes, you know, really though, you're a gentleman

107
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,600
because you've had a heck of a weekend.

108
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
It's true.

109
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
You did the thing this weekend

110
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,440
that I hope I never ever have to do, and that's move.

111
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I hate moving.

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
It's really the worst.

113
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,360
I mean, there's so much excitement and other things,

114
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,240
but you can't get there

115
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,760
because of all the other bullshit right in the way.

116
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,600
Yeah, not only is it just tons of physical work

117
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
and disruption to your life,

118
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
it is so much coordinating of little details

119
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
that are extremely obnoxious.

120
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,660
And then it is so many things not coming through

121
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,680
that you then just have to like,

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
well, we're rolling with that bunch.

123
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Exactly, yes.

124
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,880
We're gonna roll with that bunch.

125
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,360
So it's really cool.

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Not only am I glad you could make it,

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
but it's really cool that you're able to

128
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
bring us in a couple of local brews.

129
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,880
The worst part is I don't even have internet yet

130
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,720
at the new place.

131
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,400
So it's like the backwoods.

132
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,440
So are you like tethering or what are you doing?

133
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
Yes, I did buy myself a new Unifi access point.

134
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Oh, cool.

135
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,460
So that's set up.

136
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,480
I got it piggybacking on one of those Xfinity Wi-Fi's,

137
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,560
but it's so slow.

138
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
So yeah, I've just been tethering, which is.

139
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
Yeah, yeah, I know what that is.

140
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,520
Because it's one of those things you have to schedule

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,580
and then they're gonna be there, of course,

142
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,240
between 8 a.m. and noon or something like that.

143
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,680
So good luck.

144
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Yeah, I'm like, well, how are you gonna work from home

145
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,640
if you don't yet have internet to wait for the guy

146
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,360
to show up to install the internet?

147
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
So go ahead, take advantage of the JB1 connection

148
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
while you're here, Wes.

149
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,280
It's so sweet.

150
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes, yes.

151
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,920
Well, we do have some news, quote unquote,

152
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,200
to get into this week, but before we do,

153
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
we gotta bring in our log.

154
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

155
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,440
Greetings, Mumble Room.

156
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

157
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,040
Woo, but now, you know what, I swear,

158
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,760
if we did a little pre-planning,

159
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,720
our virtual log there could do like a little harmonious,

160
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
hello, hello, hello, hello.

161
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
We just gotta tune it.

162
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,460
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,300
Hello.

164
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,760
Hello, some lads.

165
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,120
And then we'll put like an auto-tune filter on there.

166
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
That would be amazing.

167
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,040
If anybody knows that's possible with the X32,

168
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
at Chris Elias, let me know.

169
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,080
All right, so let's start with a semi-serious story

170
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,480
that's not really getting a lot of discussion

171
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
in any of the Jupiter broadcasting shows

172
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,560
or any of our friends really,

173
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,640
it's not really huge to those of us

174
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,160
that are just daily desktop Linux users,

175
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,240
but it's something that I think

176
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
is worth making people aware of,

177
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
and it's a seven-year-old Samba flaw

178
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,340
that allows attackers to access

179
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,080
thousands of Samba systems remotely.

180
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,080
It's a CVE-2017-74-94, and it affects all versions of Samba

181
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,680
that are newer than Samba 3.50,

182
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,880
which was released in 2010.

183
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
Ouch.

184
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,220
Yeah, all versions onward are vulnerable

185
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,400
to remote code execution vulnerability,

186
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,960
allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library

187
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,240
to a writable share,

188
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,620
and then cause the server to load and execute it.

189
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,000
Yep, pretty much exactly what you don't want to happen.

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Now, this story didn't get a ton of attention

191
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,320
until WannaCry came along,

192
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,300
and then everybody was like,

193
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,920
well, if this could happen with WannaCry,

194
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,200
maybe it could happen with SambaCry.

195
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,000
It didn't take off, but they tried to make it SambaCry.

196
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
They tried to, and you know, the thing is,

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
is by the time we're hearing about this,

198
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,200
the reality is that your distro

199
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
has already sent out patches.

200
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
So I was talking with some people who are like,

201
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
people I know who are casual Linux users,

202
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,680
and they'd had some problems with their work computers,

203
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
and they'd been like told that,

204
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
oh yeah, no, Linux is usually more secure,

205
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,300
and they were kind of like asking me about this and this,

206
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,480
and they'd heard about WannaCry,

207
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,360
and so I was having to try to explain this,

208
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,320
and it really struck me that like, yeah, you're right.

209
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,040
You know, if you just like, the update thing,

210
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,960
a bunch of you, update comes up, you hit update,

211
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,920
you're probably gonna be fine,

212
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
but really it seems like where this is gonna bite us

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
is like everything in the Linux ecosystem

214
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
is all of those embedded devices

215
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,760
that will never, ever get patched,

216
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,400
or if they do, how many people are ever going

217
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,440
to actually update that firmware?

218
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Yep, and that's why I wanted to include it

219
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,280
as a discussion piece,

220
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,600
because I think that is the part that matters,

221
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,080
is the reality is many of us probably have routers

222
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,240
that have Samba built in,

223
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,880
because we got a USB port, you can hook a USB.

224
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
Exactly, yeah, there's a lot of those.

225
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
Yeah, there's so much Samba out there in the wild.

226
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,880
In fact, it's one of the little statistics

227
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
that the Samba, I always shouldn't say little,

228
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't mean to demean it,

229
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,200
it's one of the statistics that the Samba project

230
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
is very proud of, is that Samba is one

231
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,640
of the most widely deployed open source projects.

232
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,640
DVRs use it, and some applications have Samba baked in.

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,160
So the issue, the flaw, I guess,

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,800
is really in the way Samba handled shared libraries.

235
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,120
So the remote attacker could use

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,320
the Samba arbitrary module loading vulnerability

237
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
to upload a shared library to a writable share,

238
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,600
and then cause the server to load the malicious code

239
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
and run it.

240
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,440
Just one line of code is required

241
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,920
to execute malicious code on the affected system.

242
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,000
And then, of course, when it's an open source thing,

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,160
I mean, this happens with Windows,

244
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,120
but it happens at a really kind of amazing rate

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
with open source stuff.

246
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,280
Metasploit and others already have created

247
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,600
penetration testing frameworks to take advantage

248
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,440
of this exploit. Of course.

249
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Just like within days, like just within days.

250
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
I will say, that is kind of handy, though.

251
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,140
I'm always, you know, whenever these comes out,

252
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,880
sometimes it's not easy to be able to repro on your side.

253
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,800
And I'm always kind of curious, you know, like,

254
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
hey, is this like, am I vulnerable?

255
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
How do I test that?

256
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,460
So it's nice if you can get an easy to use framework

257
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,660
and you're like, yep, I just hacked myself.

258
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,960
All right, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,760
Samba's already issued patches,

260
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
so that's sort of how this,

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
the information doesn't get really released

262
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,240
until the upstream projects have had a chance

263
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
to look at the vulnerability and potentially come up

264
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
with a fix, and they usually have a timeline.

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,960
So you're saying we live in the age

266
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
of responsible disclosure?

267
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,880
I believe this is generally how it goes these days.

268
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,620
Yeah, not always, and sometimes projects

269
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,540
don't meet the timeline that they're given

270
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,860
and it gets disclosed.

271
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,760
That generally happens, though, more with Microsoft

272
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,400
than it is with open source projects tend to get it,

273
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,440
they tend to get it done in remarkable time, actually.

274
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,500
But anyways, the issue isn't so much

275
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
how fast the upstream project gets it done,

276
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,520
it's actually the issue is how fast the distributions

277
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,720
get it out the door.

278
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Or if you're using a distribution that's still maintained.

279
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,120
So Samba has patched versions 4.64, 4.5.10, and 4.4.14.

280
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Now, you might notice that three dots

281
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,880
are missing in that list,

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
and so after a couple of days of discussion,

283
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
Good Guy Samba decided to actually also,

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
I kind of love those problems,

285
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Good Guy Samba also decided to release patches

286
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
for Samba 3.0.37, 3.2.15, and 3.3.14.

287
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
So even though they're no longer officially supported

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
by the Samba team, they decided to release patches.

289
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
That's really nice.

290
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
They're clearly very busy,

291
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,120
so if you appreciate the work they're doing here,

292
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,880
maybe go help them redesign their website.

293
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,640
Oh, man, yeah, you know,

294
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,840
somebody who used to go to that Samba project,

295
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,920
it's so funny, when you first get into this stuff,

296
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,000
at least for me, when I didn't have any idea,

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,240
I got, one of the ways I got into Linux

298
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,280
was through the Samba project.

299
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,960
Yeah, you're like, oh, suddenly I don't have to have

300
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,640
this horrible Windows file server?

301
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,480
Yeah, yeah, and we were, that's funny,

302
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
you and I were just talking about remote profiles

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,720
in the pre-show, we were hosting a bunch

304
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,240
of terminal servers users' remote roaming profiles,

305
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,280
which caused a ton of open connections

306
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
to the NT4 server when users would log in.

307
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Right, anytime anyone logs in.

308
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Yeah, and so when you have 700 users logging in at once

309
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,920
across 120 terminal servers,

310
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,560
it causes a massive, massive issue,

311
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,140
and Samba was capable of handling that load,

312
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,000
NT4 and even Windows 2000 were not,

313
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,620
and so I got in as a way to solve problems

314
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,920
we were having, limits we were having

315
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
with our Windows servers in many areas,

316
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,120
in network proxying, but in storage,

317
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,640
and Samba was part of that storage solution,

318
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,760
so for me, obviously, the place to get the best

319
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,840
documentation was gonna be Samba.org.

320
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Obviously, you go to Samba.

321
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Right from the source.

322
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,160
And they did have great documentation for a long time,

323
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,800
but it's so funny now, a decade later,

324
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,520
no way in hell would I do that.

325
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,440
I would go look up the documentation

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,360
that was the most current, that was the most applicable.

327
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,400
If it was Arch, I would go to the Arch Wiki.

328
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,280
If it's Ubuntu, I would go whatever resources

329
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,960
were Ubuntu-specific or Fedorae.

330
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,280
I would go to a distro-specific outlet,

331
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,560
and I would make sure that the date was relevant

332
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,480
and all of this stuff.

333
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a totally different approach.

334
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,720
Now understanding the complexities of the ecosystem

335
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,520
that I would take, and so the Samba website,

336
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,300
even back then, it really hasn't changed much.

337
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,400
It was horrible back then, and it's still pretty awful.

338
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,640
It's got a little better, but it's still pretty bad.

339
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Anyways, so go patch your Samba, guys.

340
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,160
Don't be like a bunch of Windows XP users sitting around.

341
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, it does affect Samba 4.3.11 XMM.

342
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,620
Now, let's talk a little bit about the community

343
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,560
for a second here.

344
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Oh.

345
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,360
A few weeks ago, we talked about Caster Soundboard.

346
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm giving you updates on it.

347
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Caster Soundboard has been driving

348
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,280
all of the sound effects in this week's show,

349
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,520
and last week's as well, and all of the shows,

350
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,660
and holy crap is it great.

351
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,500
It is really something that,

352
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,340
if you ever needed a soundboard for anything,

353
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,760
for a presentation you're giving

354
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,520
or for a podcast you're recording,

355
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
holy shit is it great.

356
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,580
And one of the things they've done

357
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,080
is they've implemented remote control support,

358
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,960
the open sound control protocol into Caster Soundboard,

359
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,920
and so Oscar wrote this amazing how-to

360
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,680
on how to remotely control the Caster Soundboard

361
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,480
using an Android, or I think iOS,

362
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
but using an Android device.

363
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah, iOS too, yep.

364
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,800
And really look at this thing.

365
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Like first of all, it's amazing you can do this,

366
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,800
but second of all, the amount of work and passion

367
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,920
that is going into this Caster Soundboard is.

368
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
This is some documentation too.

369
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,480
Like, not only just making the features, but then.

370
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
It's super good documentation.

371
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Yes, I know, with really good layout,

372
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,760
and screenshots, and structure,

373
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,020
and easy to follow and understand,

374
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,200
and JB references throughout.

375
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
I just, I can't believe what I'm seeing here.

376
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,880
And also the Python visualizer that we use

377
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,120
for User Air and Linux Action News,

378
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,080
also been getting some love from the community.

379
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,520
Huge improvements coming.

380
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,280
I've already heard from other podcasts

381
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,840
that are thinking about trying it.

382
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,820
It seems like a great tool for audio podcasts,

383
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,160
it really does.

384
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,200
It's so awesome that anything we can do,

385
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,320
working with the OBS project, or doing projects like this

386
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,480
to make media production under Linux better,

387
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,520
just really excites me.

388
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,040
And so to see the community just,

389
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,400
like this, where we're at with Caster Soundboard

390
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,320
would never have happened without the community.

391
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,960
And now I really think that Linux podcasters,

392
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,560
and other platforms, you can use it on other OSs too,

393
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
are really gonna have an amazing tool going forward.

394
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
And then to combine it with documentation like this.

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,160
And the thing is, is like being able to control

396
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,240
the soundboard from your remote system.

397
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
Here he has an example of on a Galaxy Tab 4,

398
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,560
like imagine you have like an old tablet sitting around.

399
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,820
Wes could have a tablet there.

400
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,840
We've talked about this before,

401
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,560
but Wes could have a tablet there on the table

402
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,920
and say he went to a conference.

403
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
He could come back with a few sound clips loaded up,

404
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,400
and you could kick him off as we're talking about it.

405
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,360
Wouldn't have to do any post editing,

406
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,840
or any, just have it right cued up.

407
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
That would be amazing.

408
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,520
Yeah, or if we're doing like a,

409
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,760
if we're doing like a, more of like a morning zoo show

410
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,040
where we had a lot of sound effects,

411
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,240
you could have access to the board,

412
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,080
I could have access to the board.

413
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
It would really be cool.

414
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,640
Anyways, thank you to Oscar for making that awesome write up

415
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,920
and thank you to the whole community

416
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
for working on the caster soundboard.

417
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,320
You can get it at github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

418
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,040
Also, it's just great to see that repo grow,

419
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,480
you know, the organization.

420
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,520
Yeah, yeah, let's go look at some of the, let's go.

421
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
Can we get to a.

422
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
We talk a lot about open source on the network.

423
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,320
So it's cool to see some open source stuff in the network.

424
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
101 commits.

425
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
Nice.

426
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah, 13 contributors.

427
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,880
That's actually awesome.

428
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,000
How do you, okay, insights.

429
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Here we go.

430
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,720
So let's get some graphs on it.

431
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
What does that tell us?

432
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,820
What does that tell us?

433
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,660
Cause you know, it's all been,

434
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,400
it's all been relatively recent, right?

435
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,840
So, so let's take a look at some of these stats.

436
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,360
So looking at just like at the last month

437
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,200
from April 30th to May 30th, we've closed 20 issues,

438
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,920
13 new issues, merged 25 poll requests.

439
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,480
Gosh, look at these guys involved with this.

440
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,720
This is so awesome.

441
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,720
13 authors, 71 commits, 156 files, 12,980 additions,

442
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,120
and 1,642 deletions.

443
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
Thank you everybody who's been involved

444
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
with Caster Soundboard.

445
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,080
It is such a cool project.

446
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,880
Thank you to Oscar for doing that right up.

447
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,960
That looks, looks kind of amazing.

448
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
It really does.

449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
It's pretty cool to see that, Wes.

450
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,120
It's pretty cool.

451
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,960
Also, I want to mention,

452
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,040
speaking of community involvement,

453
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,840
Linux Unplugged has a Reddit now.

454
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,120
You can go to reddit.com slash R slash Linux Unplugged

455
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,780
to submit stuff in here.

456
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,960
I want to say thank you to Reg Gaster.

457
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll be talking about one of the things

458
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,400
you submitted here in a little bit this week.

459
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,880
Also, this is a cool one.

460
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,740
Didn't really think it was worth putting in the show,

461
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,740
but Chaotic Kernel submitted this GPS share utility,

462
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,980
which is a utility that lets you share

463
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,240
your GPS device location information

464
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,920
over the local network, and it's written in Rust.

465
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,120
So it replaces some cloud provider stuff

466
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,880
if you just want to do like a small little GPS sharing thing.

467
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,720
That's pretty neat.

468
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,560
Mm-hmm.

469
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,840
And you know we have a soft spot for Rust.

470
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
That's right.

471
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,080
Also, if you didn't know, like you know,

472
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,300
say you're Popey and you haven't been here for a while,

473
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,140
welcome back, Popey.

474
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,960
It's good to see you.

475
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,800
Welcome.

476
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,620
Hello, sir.

477
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,460
Hello, hello, hello.

478
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,280
Hello.

479
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,120
Hey, you smell great.

480
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Yeah.

481
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,520
Thank you.

482
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,560
I do, actually.

483
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,400
I do.

484
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,220
All confirmed.

485
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,080
It's mostly IPA I smell like,

486
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,680
but anyways, it does smell delicious.

487
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,800
Popey, I know it's been a little while,

488
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
so I didn't know, I don't know if you're aware,

489
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
but we're almost episode 200.

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
Good Lord.

491
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,720
I know, I don't.

492
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,600
It's shocking.

493
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,040
Is that metric or imperial?

494
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,800
No, no, I measured it with both systems,

495
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,680
and it checks out.

496
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,800
It actually checks out.

497
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,960
It's the one number where the two systems converge.

498
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,800
It's beautiful.

499
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,140
I've actually constructed a lab

500
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,800
where I'm watching the decay of an atom

501
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,720
just to confirm, because I can't believe it,

502
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
but so far it seems to check out.

503
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,140
And as is proper style,

504
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,220
I don't really have anything prepared for 200 itself,

505
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,480
which is next week.

506
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Oh my God!

507
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,720
Oh my God.

508
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,760
So we don't really have anything planned.

509
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,080
Except a great show, as usual.

510
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,920
Yeah, of course.

511
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,480
Duh.

512
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,860
Come on, Chris.

513
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,160
But what is coming up here soon is America's birthday.

514
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
The greatest day in the world.

515
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,360
Which we will be taking over and renaming.

516
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
Deluxe Unplugged's birthday.

517
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,760
So for the fourth.

518
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
How old is America now?

519
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
Hey Wes, Google that real quick.

520
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,180
Hey, let's see.

521
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,960
Alexa, how old is America?

522
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
Let's see what she says.

523
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
What'd she say?

524
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,280
240 years old.

525
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,120
Oh, she knows.

526
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
And don't we look just fine for that?

527
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,480
Okay, let's see if Siri knows.

528
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,560
How old is America?

529
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,720
Okay, I found this on the web for how old is America.

530
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
Totally worthless.

531
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh my God.

532
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,340
Way to go, Siri.

533
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,520
I love how it starts being like,

534
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,540
listen, I don't really know.

535
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,560
So here's where I got it.

536
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,400
You shouldn't trust me, but this is the thing.

537
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
It's so couchy.

538
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,100
It's so couchy.

539
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,480
Yeah, can't wait to put that in a tube.

540
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
That's gonna be a real successful product, Apple.

541
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
Go ahead, put that in a tube.

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
All right, so let's ask the Google Assistant

543
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,640
just really quickly.

544
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay, Google.

545
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
How old is America?

546
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,240
United States of America was founded in 1776.

547
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Well, so she didn't really answer the-

548
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,440
You're making me do the math here?

549
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,260
Yeah, so the-

550
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,100
Come on, Googs.

551
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,240
So the Echo is the only one that successfully

552
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,640
really answered the question.

553
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
And also, did you notice though

554
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,560
that they all allowed me to say America?

555
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,400
They never, like none of them got confused.

556
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Well, actually, hold on, maybe that was.

557
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,700
How old is the United States of America?

558
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,040
Okay, I found this on the web.

559
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,760
Nope, Siri's dumb either way, it doesn't matter.

560
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,920
It doesn't, nope, Siri's just stupid.

561
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,800
So anyways, for America's birthday,

562
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
and for America's birthday,

563
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,200
and for Linux Unplugs 200 episode,

564
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,720
which will be 200-ish,

565
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,040
we're gonna have a barbecue here in the studio.

566
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
I've only heard from like three people

567
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,200
that are gonna make it.

568
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,120
So right now it's you, me, the beard,

569
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,520
and three other people that are getting burgers and dogs.

570
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,240
And maybe we should do like a chicken.

571
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,400
Oh, Wes, you were gonna do ribs.

572
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,240
Yeah.

573
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,920
The Wes, gosh guys, if you want the Wes Payne ribs,

574
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,120
you should probably come to the studio.

575
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,160
That's true.

576
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,040
I mean, we can do other things too, I'm open to ideas.

577
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
I just wanted, I thought we needed

578
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,000
some sort of non-standard grill item, something special.

579
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
Yeah, yeah, so if you're gonna make it,

580
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
let me know, at ChrisLAS,

581
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,980
or, this is where I was building,

582
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,240
join our new official Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group.

583
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
It's official now.

584
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,080
It is.

585
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,900
Are you in there?

586
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,740
You're in there, aren't you?

587
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah, it's pretty crazy these days.

588
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,440
It is pretty crazy.

589
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,400
But it's crazy like in a good way.

590
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,240
It's like when Twitter was good.

591
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,560
I'm still kinda trying to figure out

592
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,880
exactly how to use a Telegram group, you know?

593
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,440
I use it like I use Twitter.

594
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,280
I really do.

595
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,100
You should ask, you should ask.

596
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,200
It's like somewhere between Twitter and IRC and.

597
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,740
Bit.ly, bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

599
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,280
Bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

600
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,520
Wimpy, you're in a few groups.

601
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
How do you manage all of that?

602
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,280
Well, the first thing you do is,

603
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,040
every time you join a group, you mute notifications.

604
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,520
Yeah, absolutely, yes.

605
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,120
And yeah, I don't know how to use Twitter,

606
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,600
but I think what you're driving at

607
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,980
is how I should use Twitter,

608
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,220
which is you don't read everything.

609
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,580
Obviously, you read everything

610
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,120
in the Ubuntu Podcast Telegram group.

611
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Obviously.

612
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,840
Because it's all excellent content.

613
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,600
But the other groups, you read what you can see

614
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,620
whilst you're in there,

615
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,420
and then when you wake up in the morning,

616
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,420
you just fly by the 500 notifications that you've missed.

617
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,200
And that's sort of, I dip in.

619
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,680
It's like a river, and I dip in for a swim,

620
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
and then I dip out.

621
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,160
And pinned messages can be nice.

622
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, that's true.

623
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
So, Popey, what happened when you asked Mycroft

624
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
how old America is?

625
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Should we find out?

626
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah, yeah, oh yes, yes.

627
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,640
Mycroft, how old is America?

628
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,320
Not as old as England, so it doesn't matter.

629
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,760
That is pretty much on point.

630
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,040
All right, good, very good, thank you.

631
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,840
Yeah, Mycroft makes a good point.

632
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,120
This weekend, the village I lived in

633
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,440
celebrated our 900th birthday.

634
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Wow.

635
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
Now listen.

636
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,120
Yeah.

637
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,160
And you don't look a day over 799.

638
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,420
We've got some old trees in my neck of the woods.

639
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,260
Does that count?

640
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,180
Can I, no, no, no, it doesn't, does it?

641
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,620
Well, very good.

642
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,240
Bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

643
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,260
Oh my gosh, guys, there's so many things

644
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,000
I wanna talk about today.

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,720
Let's mention real quickly before we go crazy.

646
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,640
Wimpy, how do you feel about talking,

647
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,920
teasing a little bit about your recent shenanigans

648
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,320
with eGPU testing?

649
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,340
Are you ready or do you wanna save it for a little longer?

650
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
I can tease some stuff.

651
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Yeah, do, okay, so hold on a second.

652
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,560
Let me do a little teasing here.

653
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,080
Let me tease DigitalOcean.

654
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,660
DigitalOcean.com, go over there,

655
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,940
create your account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

656
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,280
It's one word, it's lowercase, it's easy,

657
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,120
you put it together, you smoosh it together,

658
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,640
you create the account, and you get a $10 credit

659
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
when you apply DOUNPLUGGED.

660
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,040
Now, once you've got the account set up,

661
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,620
I'm not gonna tell you how to do your business.

662
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
But if I were you, if I were you,

663
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,480
take a couple of things we've talked about

664
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,660
and just say the last two weeks on this show.

665
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Just take what your favorite one

666
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,540
and try it out on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

667
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,600
It's so fast, it's so easy to use.

668
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,680
The interface is super simple.

669
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,380
The SSD storage is lightning fast.

670
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,300
Faster than lightning.

671
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,380
I don't even know how fast it is, it's too fast.

672
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,340
I'm making pew-pew, right?

673
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm making pew-pew, it's like pew-pew fast,

674
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
that's how fast it is.

675
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,460
Presidentially fast.

676
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,900
I don't really know what that means.

677
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,100
I don't know what that means either.

678
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,420
That's how fast it is.

679
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,060
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

680
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,880
They have an API that's really easy to integrate

681
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,740
with desktop applets for your Linux desktop

682
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,980
or for Android applications or your own code.

683
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,820
I really like it for that.

684
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,280
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

685
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,260
Earlier, you were talking about how

686
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,180
you wouldn't really go to the Samba website.

687
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,660
And you were like, I'd go to some distro,

688
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,480
I'd go to the Arch Wiki.

689
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,780
I think you were just trying to be polite though,

690
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,640
because in reality, you would go check out

691
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,940
the DigitalOcean documentation.

692
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,780
I sure would.

693
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,820
In fact, check out this post from May 26th.

694
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,980
How to use GPG encryption in signed messages.

695
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,260
This is an example of a DigitalOcean how-to

696
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,940
that crushes it, because it's not necessarily

697
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,600
specific to DigitalOcean.

698
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,380
I don't mean to tell them something

699
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,600
that maybe they're not aware of,

700
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,060
but guys, I could read this and use this anywhere.

701
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,260
But go over there, check it out.

702
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,440
It's a great guide on how to use GPG on Linux.

703
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,340
It's not even, look at this, look at this.

704
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,540
It's not even distro-specific.

705
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,140
This guide works for Ubuntu, Debian,

706
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,620
CentOS, and Fedora.

707
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,460
Fedora.

708
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,580
Fedora.

709
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,400
Fedora?

710
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,240
Fedora, is that how you say it?

711
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,620
I'm not sure.

712
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,200
You know, if Matthew ever stopped by the show,

713
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,040
he might remember.

714
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,080
Oh yeah, he could tell us.

715
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,220
Anyways, go over to DigitalOcean.com.

716
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,300
They got great tutorials.

717
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,460
They have a really great dashboard.

718
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,860
They have a service that's super, super nice.

719
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,360
Not only do you get up and going in no time,

720
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,720
which is what they like to emphasize,

721
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,740
but the pricing's amazing,

722
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,580
because they have $5 rigs a month,

723
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,000
they have hourly pricing,

724
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,160
they have a bunch of different distros

725
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
you can choose from,

726
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,220
and one of my favorite features

727
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,920
is they have an HTML5 console

728
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,340
that works on everything from your tablet

729
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,460
to your Linux desktop,

730
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,020
and there's a lot of stuff you can do

731
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,600
when you get access to that console.

732
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,780
A lot of stuff you can do.

733
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,780
DigitalOcean.com, you go over there,

734
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,260
take advantage of all of that stuff.

735
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,220
Plus, if you're in a team, they support that.

736
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,580
40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors,

737
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,860
highly available block storage

738
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,660
when you need to grow your rig,

739
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,900
monitoring, alerting, when you wanna look like a boss

740
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,140
and know about things before your clients even do.

741
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,200
DigitalOcean.com.

742
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Playing around or putting it in production.

743
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,260
Try it out and just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

744
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
And thank you to DigitalOcean

745
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

746
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,220
So Wes, one of the things that I'm thinking

747
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,940
more and more about these days

748
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,580
is a future where I buy a really light and thin laptop

749
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,520
that is using an embedded Intel GPU.

750
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,360
Right.

751
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,980
That is supported under Wayland really well.

752
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,020
And mind you, I'm thinking about this, too, as like.

753
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,580
Because you wanna run Trisco, right?

754
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,880
That's the motivation here.

755
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,740
I wanna run Wayland is what I wanna run.

756
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,180
And I want it to run smoothly.

757
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,740
And I'm really trying to think about

758
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,760
how to do this in the future

759
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,840
where maybe I'm taking a rig

760
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,180
between the studio and the RV a lot.

761
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,940
And one of the things that's jumped out at me

762
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,140
is if we could really nail external GPUs right,

763
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,820
so I could have a laptop that is thin, light, and portable,

764
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,640
but when I need to edit

765
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,700
or I wanna play video games from time to time,

766
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I can buy a box that's a PCI3, like Thunderbolt,

767
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,580
or what, a Thunderbolt 3, that's what it is.

768
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,660
Thunderbolt 3 connected device.

769
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,480
You put a GPU in there.

770
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,060
Then I could hook it up to a laptop.

771
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,380
I could have a lot more horsepower.

772
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,220
But beyond that, I could take this one video card

773
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,140
that I spent all my monies on, this one video card,

774
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,580
and I could move it between my laptop

775
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,860
or a desktop that has Thunderbolt 3

776
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,940
or another laptop or your laptop.

777
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,020
And it's like you invest once in a great graphics card

778
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,620
and then the three or four times a month that I need it,

779
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,900
I've got a plug-in go-to graphics card.

780
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,220
And all the other time,

781
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,700
I've got a super portable, lightweight,

782
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,740
great battery life laptop.

783
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,340
So Wimpy stopped by that official bit.ly

784
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,060
slash JB Telegram group the other day

785
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,660
and was teasing me with a little information

786
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,580
that he's gleaned.

787
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,020
So you've been doing some testing, Wimpy,

788
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,020
on eGPUs, external GPUs, over what,

789
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,820
like Thunderbolt 3 USB-C style connections?

790
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,100
That's right, yeah.

791
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,680
So I've got a Razer Core,

792
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,680
which is the box of tricks that is the external enclosure.

793
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,900
And I've got an Nvidia card in that.

794
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,700
And I've been putting it through its paces

795
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,940
on a number of computers I have

796
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,380
that are Thunderbolt 3 enabled

797
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,740
to see does it work and how well it works.

798
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,740
And this is on modern Linux, like version what?

799
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,900
Well, I've tested Ubuntu 16.04 and upwards.

800
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,460
Okay, so stuff that's easily available.

801
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,360
So like I don't have to be running

802
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,860
some crazy development version of Linux

803
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,520
to get support for this.

804
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,300
No, you can, so in the Ubuntu world,

805
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,420
you will need Ubuntu 16.04.2,

806
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,100
which comes pre-shipped with the hardware enablement stack.

807
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,140
Ah, okay, okay.

808
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,940
And if you don't have,

809
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,940
if you've just upgraded from.0 or.1 of 16.04,

810
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,420
then you have to enable the hardware enablement stack

811
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,580
and that will do the good stuff that you need.

812
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,860
So there must be a downside, right?

813
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,980
I mean, there must be a downside to having an external GPU.

814
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,040
There must be something that is inconvenient about it

815
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,860
other than, I mean, I'm just trying to fathom,

816
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,700
like what would be, I imagine you can't hot swap it, right?

817
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,300
So you can't just be running an X session

818
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,220
and going about your business

819
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,020
and just connect this thing to your computer

820
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,540
and all of a sudden be connected to your eGPU, right?

821
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,500
Yeah, you can do that.

822
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,060
You can hot plug the GPU.

823
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,100
No, see, the folks at Dell told me

824
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,660
that wasn't a possibility.

825
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,340
Well, you can do it under Windows.

826
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,100
It's built into, well, in Windows with additional drivers

827
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,220
on the Razer laptops, it's doable.

828
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,060
You can hot plug the GPU.

829
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,260
And if you know the right incantations,

830
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,380
you can then bring that GPU up

831
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,020
without having to do anything.

832
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,020
The best route that I've got is you can hot plug it,

833
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,460
then use Nvidia settings to switch to that GPU.

834
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,040
And then you have to log out and log back in.

835
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,140
And that's like the safest way

836
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,500
to handle it.

837
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,100
That's not so bad.

838
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,500
So you don't need to do a full reboot.

839
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,860
You can, you know, log out, log in, so that works.

840
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,260
Now, Bash, you had a question in the mobile room.

841
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,100
Go ahead.

842
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,340
I think it was about cost.

843
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,280
Mostly just bringing out,

844
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,820
you were talking about some of the downsides.

845
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,020
I was mostly just talking about cost of them.

846
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Yeah, cause it's like a $500 box.

847
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,380
US greenbacks, right Wimpy?

848
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:23,220
Yeah, yeah, the Razer Core itself was 499 pounds.

849
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
And then you've obviously got to put the GPU

850
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,300
in that as well.

851
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,780
So yes, expensive.

852
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,460
Or, you know, the way that I did this was with Bitcoin.

853
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,420
So the combined cost of the core and the card

854
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,180
was half a Bitcoin.

855
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,420
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,260
And it's crazy to think that you can get something

857
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,780
as expensive of that for a fraction of a Bitcoin now.

858
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,220
It's just mental.

859
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,780
Yeah, I mean, it looks like it's well built.

860
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,460
I mean, it looks like it's a good metal body.

861
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,260
It looks like it's like a solid piece of equipment.

862
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,140
Does it feel good?

863
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,180
The Razer Core is extremely well constructed.

864
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,460
Integrated power supply?

865
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,140
Yeah, it's a 500 watt integrated power supply.

866
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,100
It's got fancy glowy, glowy lights and all of that carry on.

867
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,740
I'm not into all of that, but if you like your things

868
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,300
flashing and blinking at you, you can do all of that.

869
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,100
Is it loud?

870
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,620
No, not really.

871
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,180
When it's just in general use, it's barely audible.

872
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,420
If you're playing a game, then yes, the fans kick up.

873
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,900
I think you can negate that to some extent

874
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,020
by buying graphics cards with different cooling strategies

875
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,300
and what have you on them.

876
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,700
But maybe that's a downside for some.

877
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,820
My experience is that any gaming PC that's competent

878
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,020
makes some degree of fan noise.

879
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,020
So have you been able to accomplish my dream world

880
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,540
of having several machines that have this Thunderbolt 3

881
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,260
connection and essentially have one great GPU

882
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,540
that you can move between them?

883
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,940
That's exactly what I've got.

884
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,540
So I've now got a hot stinking GPU

885
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,900
that I can move between four devices at will.

886
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,620
Wow, and it just works under Linux fairly well.

887
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,220
Yeah, there's one caveat, which is right now

888
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,580
in the Linux kernel, it doesn't support

889
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,740
the Thunderbolt security profiles.

890
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,500
So consequently, it will only work on a computer

891
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,740
where you can disable the Thunderbolt security model

892
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,020
or enable what's known as legacy mode.

893
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,380
Once you've done that, it works.

894
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,380
But as I was doing some research,

895
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,580
there's fixes coming for that fairly soon in Linux.

896
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,500
So you can actually keep that enabled

897
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,980
in something that you want enabled, right?

898
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,580
Because this is a device you're plugging

899
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,460
into the bus of your computer.

900
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,140
And that's a BIOS, so you have to have a BIOS.

901
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,020
It's a BIOS setting at the moment.

902
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,300
So I've got three laptops that supported that in the BIOS

903
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,460
and one that doesn't.

904
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,980
So I've got one laptop that's got Thunderbolt port

905
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
where you've seen it, it's that HP Spectre.

906
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,820
It's got Thunderbolt ports coming out the Wazoo,

907
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,420
but I can't use this device on it

908
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,740
because Linux just doesn't see it.

909
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,460
Well, it sees it, but it doesn't know how to manage it.

910
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,020
So when those new kernel patches drop,

911
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,900
I shall be testing that with interest.

912
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,220
But the performance games are considerable.

913
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,900
You know, like significant.

914
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,340
So I've got an intro where Athena,

915
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,100
which has got a GTX 980M in it.

916
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,780
And if you're familiar, there's a Unigine

917
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,980
have got a new benchmark tool called Superposition.

918
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,220
And this was recommended to me by Pedro Matos

919
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,020
from Linux Gamecast, because by and large,

920
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,700
this tests the GPU performance

921
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,420
rather than taxing the CPU overly.

922
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,220
So you get a fairly fair comparison of the GPU performance.

923
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,500
I know there are other factors,

924
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,420
but as best as you can manage,

925
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,540
this is a good reflection of GPU performance.

926
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,100
So that 980M can run the Superposition benchmark,

927
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,220
which the default settings are medium 1080p,

928
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,700
and it can conk out a consistent 45 frames per second.

929
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,380
And then when I stick my Razer Core

930
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,340
into the various laptops, that goes up to,

931
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,740
well, on the least performing device

932
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,700
at 80 frames per second and the highest performing

933
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,300
at 107 frames per second.

934
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,860
And this is a really graphical intensive benchmark.

935
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,860
And the gaming for Linux community,

936
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,420
gaming on Linux, they have a benchmark forum.

937
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,980
And in there, they're currently running a,

938
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,980
run the ultra test using Unigine Superposition

939
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,660
and post your benchmarks.

940
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,220
And one of my systems with the Razer Core attached

941
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,460
is the number two placed.

942
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,300
Wow.

943
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,340
Box in that list and top placed.

944
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,580
What was the host system?

945
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,460
Mine.

946
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,060
It was the Entraware host system?

947
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,540
No, my one was a Skull Canyon NUC

948
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,180
with the Razer Core. A NUC, a NUC.

949
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Yeah. Ooh.

950
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,580
Yeah.

951
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,300
I do want one of those, those look sweet.

952
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,220
So you hooked it up, you hooked this eGPU up to a NUC

953
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,660
and you ranked number two in the benchmarking positions

954
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,500
on Linux gaming.

955
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,380
Yeah, uncomfortably number two.

956
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,260
So this has got a 1080Ti, this Razer Core.

957
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,460
And the number one position that it's behind

958
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,460
is a Ryzen 1700 with an 1080Ti on a 16X bus.

959
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,540
And I'm only just slightly behind.

960
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,380
Wow.

961
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,420
So it shifts some data, yeah.

962
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,780
So we've defined good enough.

963
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,140
Well, to me it suggests that perhaps, hmm.

964
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,820
So you're telling me that these, yeah,

965
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,060
cause you're comparing this to machines that have,

966
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,500
you are comparing this to other systems

967
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,700
that have these video cards snapped

968
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,540
into like a 16X PCI slot.

969
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

970
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,260
And my Skull Canyon is four PCI lanes

971
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,060
are exposed over the Thunderbolt port,

972
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,060
but they're shared with the NVMe drive

973
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,940
and several other components on the board.

974
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,180
So it's not dedicated for lanes by any means,

975
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
but it's still right up there.

976
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
Wow.

977
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,860
Well, will we hear more on the Ubuntu podcast?

978
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,540
Yes, on Thursday this week, Ubuntu podcast is out

979
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,700
and we discuss this at the top of the show.

980
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,860
Ah, attaboy.

981
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,780
I'm looking forward to it.

982
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,620
Me too.

983
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,460
I'm looking forward to it.

984
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,220
I will follow this topic with much interest

985
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,740
because it seems like it could unlock

986
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,700
both portability and a lot of power.

987
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,660
I'm very excited.

988
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,180
Mr. Popey, it's good to have you back.

989
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,580
I noticed recently you've been tweeting away these days

990
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,420
and I followed the story you were, where was it?

991
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,260
Where was it?

992
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,420
Hold on, wait for it, wait for it.

993
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,340
What to expect and not to expect from Linux Universal Packages

994
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,580
which is the next story in the show.

995
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,420
So I kind of wanted to get your thoughts

996
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,660
on the state of Universal Packages and whatnot.

997
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
What do you think, Popey?

998
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,500
Uh-oh.

999
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,740
This post from The New Stack

1000
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,780
that I think you tweeted a few days ago, if I remember.

1001
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,100
I can't, I can't, that's how it showed up in my list.

1002
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,480
Yeah.

1003
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
What was your takeaway?

1004
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Yeah, so it's Bruce Bifield who spoke to a bunch of people

1005
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,980
who are involved in these new packaging systems.

1006
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,540
Yeah, so look at Bruce.

1007
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,020
You know, Bruce should come on this show too.

1008
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah, that would be awesome.

1009
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,180
That would be really good.

1010
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,540
Okay, anyway, sorry.

1011
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,460
He spoke to us about snaps and he spoke to people

1012
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,020
from the Flatpak project and AppImage

1013
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,320
and also people from traditional distros

1014
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,100
like our good friend Richard from OpenSUSE

1015
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,300
to get everyone's hot take on what the new packaging formats

1016
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,620
mean for Linux desktop.

1017
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,580
And yeah, I think it's fairly fair and balanced

1018
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,460
and covers everyone's perspective.

1019
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,860
I don't think everyone agrees on this,

1020
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,820
but yeah, I think it's pretty fair.

1021
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,860
Yeah, and Wes and I were just chatting recently

1022
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,820
as in like 45 minutes ago about Visual Studio Code

1023
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,660
just recently announced that they have a snap available.

1024
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,500
Right.

1025
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,340
That's pretty cool.

1026
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,980
And I also saw like a Qt-based Flatpak manager

1027
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,940
that people are working on.

1028
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,600
It's like a graphical Qt-based Flatpak manager.

1029
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,060
So the Universal Package March,

1030
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,820
even though we're not talking about it as much these days,

1031
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,340
is continuing, it continues on.

1032
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,940
So yeah, check out the new stack.

1033
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,800
Although, I mean, people mention it as wars,

1034
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,980
but I really don't think the people who work on it

1035
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,580
see it as war as such.

1036
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,420
Yeah, okay.

1037
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,060
I think we're all working on our own thing,

1038
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,860
but the Flatpak developers are working on a great way

1039
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,740
to deliver the GNOME experience and GNOME applications

1040
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,700
to their users and tailoring it specifically

1041
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,900
for their needs.

1042
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,780
AppImage developers are working on their system

1043
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,780
for making sure that it's super easy for people

1044
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,900
to just download a file and then run it

1045
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,660
and get the application.

1046
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,620
And we're working on our unique selling points

1047
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,820
that make ours slightly different.

1048
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,700
So I think they've all got their own selling points

1049
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,540
and they're all slightly different.

1050
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,380
I don't think we're all really seeing each other as war.

1051
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,580
I think you're underselling Snap's competitive advantage

1052
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,520
in this space.

1053
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,800
So I would phrase it as this.

1054
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,960
Flatpaks are a reinvention of PPAs that nobody needs

1055
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,820
and ain't nobody got time for that.

1056
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,100
AppImage is what's already being done on Mac OS

1057
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
and then developers have to create things like Sparkle,

1058
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,180
which are their backassword workarounds

1059
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,340
to get users to update their applications

1060
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,380
after they've already been dropped onto their file system.

1061
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,540
And Snap package brings us sort of the best of both worlds

1062
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,880
where we can have a centralized store and an index

1063
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,760
where it's easy for users to search, it's easy to install.

1064
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,060
And on top of that, it's particularly well suited

1065
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,180
for not only server side, but graphical applications.

1066
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,540
So in my opinion, if one of them could win out,

1067
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,980
I would absolutely want it to be Snaps

1068
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,580
based on all lessons we've learned

1069
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,040
from all other operating systems

1070
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,160
and things we've tried on Linux before.

1071
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,920
After that, I'd want it to be AppImage

1072
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,180
because at the end of the day,

1073
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,820
I just want the damn application.

1074
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,340
And then the very number three on my list

1075
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,460
would be Flatpaks because honestly, I think PPAs suck.

1076
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,340
Beside outside of a limited scope for testing applications,

1077
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,820
for users to maybe like beta test applications

1078
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,200
before they're put in the repo or something like that,

1079
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,160
PPAs are fine.

1080
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,780
But as a way to distribute software to everybody

1081
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,780
in the world and then have random people who have lives

1082
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,180
and they maybe have children and a job

1083
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,100
to then maintain a repo, it's ridiculous.

1084
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,520
And Flatpaks don't seem to solve

1085
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,220
that particular problem at all.

1086
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,060
And Snaps do, and also AppImages do.

1087
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,260
Out of any of them though,

1088
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,100
if any of them take off, I'd be happy.

1089
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,380
I would be satisfied if any of them are successful.

1090
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,300
It just seems to me that right now,

1091
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,140
things have slowed to a crawl.

1092
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,180
And I don't know what exactly I was expecting,

1093
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,020
but I was-

1094
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,840
Has slowed in what way?

1095
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,240
I mean, we spend all our days talking to developers

1096
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,080
about what they want.

1097
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,900
So like, we developed Snappy and SnapCraft,

1098
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,100
and we think we know what developers need,

1099
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,980
but because we are essentially a company full of engineers,

1100
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,920
but we speak to developers who create things

1101
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,720
in new and interesting and different ways.

1102
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,460
And these can be proprietary software vendors

1103
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,880
who just want to get their code out there to Linux users,

1104
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,920
or they could be open source software developers,

1105
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,740
or they could be proprietary companies

1106
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,180
who are making open source software

1107
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,340
like Microsoft with Visual Studio Code.

1108
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,620
And some of those people have very specific requirements.

1109
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,080
So what we're doing is spending time listening to them

1110
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,860
to find out what it is they want.

1111
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,580
I'll tell you what I was, I'll tell you,

1112
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,660
the only way I can answer your question is tell,

1113
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:55,660
I can tell you what I was hoping for by about now-ish was,

1114
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,820
so say Visual Studio Code is announced as a Snap package.

1115
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,500
Hooray, that's great.

1116
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,060
You go to download Visual Studio Code for Linux

1117
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,220
and nowhere on their website

1118
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,020
does it mention that as a possibility.

1119
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,660
It's not a download link.

1120
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,500
It's not like, hey, by the way,

1121
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,180
if you're a Snap package user,

1122
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,060
they've obviously, they can't be bothered

1123
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,900
to update their website.

1124
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,140
You're talking about the marketing level and the...

1125
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,940
Well, I'm sorry, so let's just do a little less.

1126
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,000
So let's just Visual Studio Code.

1127
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,740
So you want to go get Visual Studio Code.

1128
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,500
Let's just say you want to get Visual Studio Code for Linux.

1129
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
So I'm gonna Google search Visual Studio Code for Linux.

1130
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I would imagine this is how most people would find this.

1131
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,460
And then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna,

1132
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,140
well, boy, that's not the right link.

1133
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,100
The first link's no good.

1134
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
The second link's what you want.

1135
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,900
It's code.visualstudio.com slash download.

1136
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,940
And then when you go to that,

1137
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,020
I don't know why it's not loading,

1138
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,620
but when you go to that, they have devs and they have RPMs.

1139
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,840
You can download and things like that,

1140
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,260
but they don't have a Snap package

1141
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,020
or they don't have a link.

1142
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,580
I understand.

1143
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,660
And that was the benchmark

1144
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,460
I was hoping we would be at by now.

1145
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,140
And that really depends on the developer

1146
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,980
because some developers have embraced it fully

1147
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,260
and some, I could point you at a website

1148
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,340
where you go to download the application

1149
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,580
and the first thing it says is go and get the Snap

1150
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,720
rather than here's Windows, here's Mac,

1151
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,300
and Linux, and oh, by the way, there's a Snap.

1152
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,220
So it really depends on the developer.

1153
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,360
And some of them are at an early stage.

1154
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,380
So Visual Studio Code only recently landed in the store.

1155
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,920
And you think about the size of the company

1156
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,700
behind Visual Studio Code,

1157
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,260
these companies don't move super fast.

1158
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,580
Whereas little agile developers

1159
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,280
who throw their code on GitHub

1160
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,140
and just wanna get it out there,

1161
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,540
they will accept a pull request that says,

1162
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,660
here's how you install a Snap

1163
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,340
and you can just provide a pull request

1164
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,580
and fix it for them.

1165
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,340
Like cost a soundboard, for example.

1166
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,180
Yeah, and that's nice.

1167
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,740
I guess it's starting to feel like

1168
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,600
we're not landing on a universal package format,

1169
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,260
we're landing on a couple of universal package formats,

1170
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,500
which is not the right fucking thing, it's not.

1171
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,980
Because what I want is,

1172
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,540
oh, you wanna develop software for Linux,

1173
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,340
you use X to distribute software.

1174
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,020
And I don't even want it to be like a,

1175
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,900
let me go read an internet war

1176
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,860
about which particular one is better.

1177
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,600
Let me go read a bunch of users' comments

1178
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,620
about why Flatpak isn't the next PPA,

1179
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,440
and then I'll go base my decision off of that.

1180
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,500
I just want it to be so fucking obvious

1181
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,660
that if you're gonna make software,

1182
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,280
it's like, you're stupid if you don't release it this way.

1183
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,180
That's what I want.

1184
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,780
Right, like from hearing some of your discussions

1185
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,020
with Michael and Coder,

1186
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,180
that seems to be like, if it's not that,

1187
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,840
then you really lose a lot of people

1188
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,420
who can't put that much time in for a niche platform.

1189
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,900
Yeah.

1190
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,920
And for some developers,

1191
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,740
packaging is like the least interesting thing.

1192
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,580
Yeah, exactly.

1193
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,800
That's, I think, what Wes is saying is like,

1194
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,780
I barely even wanna waste my time on Linux to begin with.

1195
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,020
Oh, it's Electron?

1196
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm not even gonna bother to make the Linux version.

1197
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,260
Like, these people, as they start to like,

1198
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,460
well, maybe I should target Linux.

1199
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,420
Maybe I should publish.

1200
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
And then they start to actually invest time.

1201
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,940
The last thing we want is,

1202
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,060
oh, but I can't figure out how to distribute the damn thing.

1203
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,900
Right, which is exactly why today,

1204
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,620
if you go to insights.avante.com,

1205
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,300
our most recent blog post is about build.snapgraph.io.

1206
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
We wanna make it easier,

1207
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,900
so you don't have to learn the intricacies

1208
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,700
of packaging devs or RPMs

1209
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,620
or whatever weird esoteric format it is.

1210
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,060
You just blop a YAML file in the master branch

1211
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,700
of your project, hook it up to build.snapgraph.io,

1212
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,500
and every time you land an update, it goes in the store.

1213
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,220
So you just don't have to worry about it.

1214
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,060
Yeah, nice, nice.

1215
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,880
It just goes in for you.

1216
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,720
That is nice.

1217
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,500
So do you think that it's a give the market time

1218
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,340
kind of thing, let the universal package...

1219
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,260
I don't wanna call it a war because I...

1220
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,100
So we go back.

1221
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,980
So this is why...

1222
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
This, Popeye, I think is why it gets described as a war

1223
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,380
is because to get to the goal that I stated earlier,

1224
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,180
rather passionately,

1225
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,060
you kinda have to have one thing win out.

1226
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,980
And that's where the war context comes from.

1227
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,140
But if you take the more practical approach

1228
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,960
and say, well,

1229
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,020
Flatpak is a great way to distribute a lot of software

1230
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,900
and snap packages are gonna be a great way to distribute

1231
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,420
a lot of software and app image.

1232
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,820
Well, then shit, that isn't actually what people want.

1233
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,660
But at the same time,

1234
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,380
it is the more realistic thing of what's gonna happen.

1235
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,740
But on a daily basis, when I'm talking to a developer,

1236
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,900
a typical developer will be writing something

1237
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,220
either in Go or Rust or with Node.js,

1238
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,340
it might be electronic, it might not.

1239
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,940
It might be a command line tool.

1240
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,140
It might be some amazing utility

1241
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,020
that gathers system metrics and puts it in a central place

1242
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,300
and you get a lovely web-based dashboard.

1243
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,180
Is app image the right way to distribute that software

1244
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,700
and deliver updates to their users

1245
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,020
on a thing that runs on a remote server?

1246
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,940
No, is Flatpak the right thing to do that?

1247
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,100
No, it snaps, yes.

1248
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,340
So there are certain situations where you can just

1249
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,420
really easily show a developer,

1250
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,100
this is the right tool for the job

1251
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,780
to distribute your software to as many users as possible

1252
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,120
and make sure that they're all running

1253
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,940
the very latest version of the software as possible.

1254
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,260
And each of the others have their niche as well.

1255
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,900
So if I was talking to a GNOME application developer,

1256
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,580
if I could find one, there aren't actually that many.

1257
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,220
When you look at how many projects there are on GitHub

1258
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,460
or Bitbucket or GitLab,

1259
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,100
there aren't actually that many GNOME native projects.

1260
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,900
Most of them I would imagine are known

1261
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,700
to the GNOME upstream developers.

1262
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,240
So they know who their target audience is.

1263
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,300
We're looking at everyone outside that bubble, right?

1264
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,620
Which is a huge number of people.

1265
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,260
Which is why I think snap packages

1266
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,900
have probably the best long-term chance

1267
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,900
because you are solving real problems

1268
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,860
with distributing server-side software,

1269
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,140
which is an obvious strength that Linux

1270
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,180
and particularly Ubuntu have.

1271
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,340
And so people will get familiar with that package format

1272
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,900
on the server side, right?

1273
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,740
Yep.

1274
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,060
And then by the time you're looking at distributing software

1275
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,340
for the desktop, you're like, well, we're already doing snaps

1276
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,140
for the server side of this, so why not?

1277
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,340
Like if I'm Nullius and I'm making my Nullius server

1278
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,860
and I'm making the Nullius for the desktop,

1279
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,780
well, if I start distributing Nullius server

1280
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,480
in a snap package and I get really familiar

1281
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,860
and I have say 15,000 users downloading my snap package,

1282
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,460
then it seems like it would just be the next obvious choice

1283
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,380
to then use snap package format for the desktop client

1284
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,140
that we start officially supporting.

1285
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,700
Yeah, I mean, I think in that case, right,

1286
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,300
the biggest hurdle is getting the build chains

1287
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,420
and familiarity with the packaging format and all that.

1288
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,360
So if you've already done that hurdle

1289
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,600
and it works on the desktop, then yeah, why not?

1290
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,220
Yeah, and I guess I suppose at the end of the day,

1291
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,600
if I can install support, if I get support for flat packs

1292
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,020
by installing GNOME and whatever distro I'm on,

1293
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,620
I have a pretty good chance I can install snap support

1294
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,660
and app image is sort of the way it works

1295
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,460
and you can just get it.

1296
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,020
So what you're saying is we need snap

1297
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,300
to be distributed in an app image and then it'll be fine.

1298
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,780
No, I'm just saying like the end result

1299
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,260
is if I only have to install these

1300
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,900
or if I only have to install these two things to get this,

1301
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,620
it's not that bad as an end user experience.

1302
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,460
It's not so bad.

1303
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,820
Yeah, that's true.

1304
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,940
I wanna give a little attention to standard notes.

1305
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,980
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote about this eight hours ago

1306
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,100
and holy crap, if it doesn't just look great.

1307
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
So it's a simple note killer, really.

1308
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,700
I teased it as an Evernote killer

1309
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,100
but it's really a simple note killer

1310
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,660
which is even better in some sense

1311
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,540
and it's totally open source.

1312
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,020
It does have a server side component

1313
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,400
although you can run the server yourself

1314
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,160
but you can get a free sync account.

1315
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,860
So calm down, calm down.

1316
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,700
I know.

1317
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,820
And when you do that, you get end to end encryption

1318
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,800
and it encrypts on your device

1319
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,700
before it uploads to their system.

1320
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,660
So that means you don't have to worry

1321
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,860
about them sharing it with like a government request

1322
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,460
or something like that if you're super paranoid.

1323
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,880
It also means if you lose your password,

1324
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,720
you're totally screwed.

1325
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,620
So make sure you don't lose your key

1326
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,740
because it's encrypted on your end.

1327
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,620
It's AES-256 encryption.

1328
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,300
They have Mac and Windows, iOS and Android apps

1329
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,780
as well as their Linux app.

1330
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,620
Automatic sync with no limit on data.

1331
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,960
It has web access and if you decide to pay,

1332
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
you get some nice stuff along with like a new like dark theme

1333
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,580
and fancy stuff like that.

1334
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,780
You get what's called an extended account.

1335
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,600
Oh.

1336
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,440
Ooh.

1337
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
How extended?

1338
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,620
Well, it's so extended it unlocks access

1339
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,100
to additional features like the ability

1340
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,540
to go back in time on your notes.

1341
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,200
Up to 100 years.

1342
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,220
Which feels pretty optimistic.

1343
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,060
I'm not sure what that means.

1344
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,580
Like I'm never gonna test them on that.

1345
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,660
I'm never gonna test them on that.

1346
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,500
You give me, you know what,

1347
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,780
you give me a good solid 50 years

1348
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,380
and I'm never gonna, I'm never gonna question.

1349
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,660
See if your kids are still using it.

1350
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,740
Yeah, yeah, they're really gonna care.

1351
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,100
And performs real time backups of your notes

1352
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,660
to drop Bizzle and Goog drives if you want that.

1353
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,380
Also with that extended account,

1354
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,620
you get access to additional editors like a markdown editor.

1355
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,660
So this is where it becomes relevant.

1356
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,900
Markdown editor, that's pretty cool.

1357
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,020
So it's standard note.

1358
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,980
You could host it all yourself like an animal

1359
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,100
or you could pay a slight gentleman's fee

1360
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,900
and get access to their extended.

1361
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,480
I will say I like the note or the name.

1362
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,980
It sounds so antiquated in a way.

1363
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,300
Standard, it's like Standard Oil but standard notes.

1364
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,260
Actually, I particularly like that.

1365
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,740
I got a question for you.

1366
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,240
If you're trying to get in the zone,

1367
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,720
you may be writing a little code.

1368
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,580
For me, it's editing or it's writing.

1369
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,120
Sometimes in the past, what I used to do

1370
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,940
is I used to play a podcast, maybe like the Ubuntu podcast.

1371
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,860
But those guys, they're making such great points.

1372
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
It turns out it's so good now, you have to listen,

1373
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,020
even if you're trying to ignore them.

1374
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,280
It's distracting.

1375
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,460
So I have to find something else.

1376
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,880
So I've been trying stupid Spotify playlists.

1377
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,020
I've been trying all these different things

1378
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,860
to try to give myself some background noise.

1379
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,940
So that way my lizard brain can relax and I can focus.

1380
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,340
What do you do?

1381
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,060
You know, I'll put things like public radio or some podcasts.

1382
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,260
Some NPR that talks like this all the time.

1383
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,500
Yes, exactly, because it's all the same tone.

1384
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,540
There's no dynamic range there.

1385
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,700
Perhaps you should check out Focacil.

1386
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,180
It improves your focus and increases your productivity.

1387
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,860
Sounds like a prescription drug.

1388
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,700
Yeah, I know, right?

1389
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,540
Focacil.

1390
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,420
Yeah, I'll take that, sure.

1391
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,960
It's a gnome extension.

1392
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,260
I don't normally share gnome extensions on this show,

1393
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,140
but this is just too good to pass up.

1394
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:05,580
It is a gnome extension that plays different nature sounds.

1395
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,300
So it's like a white noise or sound machine type.

1396
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,940
Oh, you could do rain, you can do wind,

1397
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,980
you can do the vibes of the earth,

1398
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,940
you can do people chatter, you can do system hums.

1399
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,900
It comes with some built-in sounds.

1400
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,540
Of course, you can add your own by dropping them in there.

1401
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,820
Just make sure you're ready to edit the JSON file.

1402
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,220
And it just needs to be MP3.

1403
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,020
And then you get a slider built into the gnome menu.

1404
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,300
In fact, I have the extension right here.

1405
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,060
Yeah, I can't really see it.

1406
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,980
I got a screenshot of it though.

1407
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,340
And it provides you with background noise.

1408
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,020
Do we get a sample of what that noise sounds like?

1409
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,860
Do you have that set up?

1410
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,100
I have, I couldn't get it.

1411
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,700
I apparently I'm missing the dependency,

1412
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,000
but they do have a sample.

1413
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,500
They do have one here you can listen to.

1414
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,620
Here, I'll turn it up a little bit so you can.

1415
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,900
Right?

1416
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,540
Are you feeling focused?

1417
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,380
Very nice.

1418
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,820
Yeah, man.

1419
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,220
Yeah, super focused right now.

1420
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,300
Focused on getting out of here.

1421
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,780
Here's the people chatter, which would be the last one

1422
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,340
I'd ever use.

1423
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,500
It's like you're working in a coffee shop,

1424
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,380
but without the coffee.

1425
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,700
Here's the nature of the earth sounds.

1426
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,220
And this is right there in the film show.

1427
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,380
I'm sorry, Wes.

1428
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,900
I don't mean to make fun of it, but out

1429
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,060
of all of the extensions I've ever seen,

1430
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,020
that has to be both the most useful and most hilarious

1431
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,620
extension ever.

1432
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,340
Can I share?

1433
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,700
I want to share something with you real quick

1434
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,460
before we move on.

1435
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,060
Just a little secret.

1436
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,700
I've talked about it before in my vlog.

1437
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,220
It's MyNoise.net.

1438
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,700
And let me share with you one of my favorite go to bed.

1439
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,540
This is when I park Lady Jupes at a rest stop

1440
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,500
and the semi-trucks are idling really loud.

1441
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,020
I put this on my Bluetooth speaker,

1442
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,500
and this is what I listen to.

1443
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:53,900
MyNoise.net I like it so much I'm a patron.

1444
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,620
Wow, I could listen to that for hours.

1445
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,180
I know.

1446
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,380
It's really great.

1447
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,700
And they have so much more.

1448
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,180
You want to check out another one?

1449
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,660
This is rain on a tent.

1450
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,460
Wow.

1451
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,620
Isn't that great?

1452
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,820
Isn't that so great?

1453
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,340
So what do the sliders do there?

1454
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,500
Well, oh, thank you for asking.

1455
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,380
Thank you for asking.

1456
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,980
Because what you're actually hearing

1457
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,380
is not a single audio stream.

1458
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,740
You're actually hearing a seven channel audio stream

1459
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,300
being composed in real time in your browser.

1460
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,260
And so you can, in real time, tweak different elements

1461
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,900
of the stream.

1462
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,740
Now, this isn't a particularly good one.

1463
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,460
So let's go back.

1464
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,940
So for example, of course, I have my favorite one.

1465
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,740
I have it bookmarked so that way I can fire it up at any time.

1466
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,980
So you see how I have these different ones tweaked?

1467
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,860
So if I were to move some of these dials,

1468
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,620
I can add more sound effects.

1469
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,900
So here's more interface sound effects.

1470
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,260
Oh, wow.

1471
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,740
Yeah, and here's another one.

1472
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,980
And I can pull that away because I found it.

1473
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,700
Let's hear it right in the engine room.

1474
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,100
And here's like a, this one is kind of interesting.

1475
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,220
This is like a more like a 60s sci-fi sound.

1476
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:06,700
Oh, yeah.

1477
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
Look at that.

1478
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,660
It's like beats.

1479
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,780
Yeah, and then here's another one that I think is.

1480
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Isn't that interesting?

1481
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,260
And here's one that I have completely turned off

1482
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,540
because it distracts my fiance.

1483
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,420
And you can mix it all in real time in your browser.

1484
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,140
And they have also, they have ones

1485
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,180
that other people have created.

1486
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,540
And they have all kinds of stuff.

1487
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,020
They have so many interesting different sound effects

1488
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:32,540
you can get.

1489
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,660
So that is a real thing.

1490
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,260
And I do find it helps me focus.

1491
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,820
Having it as an extension in the GNOME desktop, though?

1492
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,740
No, I don't think so.

1493
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,020
I'm going to install that one after the show.

1494
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,980
Post Market OS, aiming for a 10-year lifecycle

1495
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,020
for smartphones.

1496
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,700
I love this project because why the hell can't we do this?

1497
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,700
If you go get a PC from 2007, and you

1498
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,540
put a basic, minimal Linux, you put that,

1499
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,020
or something classy like Ubuntu Mate on there,

1500
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,860
you're going to get a real nice system where

1501
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,620
you can do basic computing tasks.

1502
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,060
A 2007 PC could surf the web.

1503
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,180
It could read emails.

1504
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,460
It could listen to podcasts.

1505
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,820
It could do IRC chat.

1506
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,900
It really would be fine.

1507
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,700
And it would even be able to get security updates.

1508
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,220
But even a three- or four-year-old Android device,

1509
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,460
screw you.

1510
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,540
And part of this is because Android's architecture

1511
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,040
is in some ways really based on forking the entire code

1512
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,740
base for each and every single device out there

1513
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,620
that these OEMs come up with.

1514
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,260
And there's things like LineageOS,

1515
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,620
which do provide even weekly updates, but they're really

1516
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,700
based on Android, which means they're always catching up

1517
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,260
to whatever Google's doing.

1518
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,660
And it's not really great for the root cause of the problem.

1519
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,860
So post-market OS thinks they have a solution.

1520
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,940
Now, this is just early days, big dreams here.

1521
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,420
But they're going to bend an existing Linux distribution

1522
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,340
to run on smartphones.

1523
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,500
Bend it, Wes.

1524
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,700
They're going to apply the necessary changes as small

1525
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,020
patches, Wes, upstream, Wes, where it makes sense, Wes.

1526
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,940
It's an Alpine Linux-based distribution

1527
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,500
called post-market OS, which each phone will

1528
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,660
have only one unique package.

1529
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,500
All other packages will be shared amongst the devices.

1530
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,420
Wow.

1531
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,020
Popey, can I ask you what you think of a project like this?

1532
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,780
Sounds like Ubuntu Touch.

1533
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,900
What do you think?

1534
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,060
It's Alpine Linux, and they're not even

1535
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,880
going to try to make it all that fancy with a touch UI,

1536
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,580
I don't think, right now.

1537
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,380
I think they're just going to basically try

1538
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,620
to throw some Linux on there and give you some updates

1539
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,020
and get some basic use out of the machine.

1540
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,140
Do we need another one of these?

1541
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,100
Part of me says yes.

1542
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,500
It does feel like we have these.

1543
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,220
Well, I guess we need one successful one.

1544
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,380
Well, I do feel like we should be

1545
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,980
able to get more than three or four years out of these devices.

1546
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,860
So part of me says yes.

1547
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,820
Oh, I completely agree.

1548
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,980
Yeah.

1549
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,380
Who else is going to solve this problem if not the Linux

1550
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,940
community, though?

1551
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,580
You know what I mean?

1552
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,740
So you're saying that Tizen isn't going to do it?

1553
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,660
Maybe.

1554
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,820
Maybe.

1555
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,580
I end our updates on ChaosBot.

1556
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,380
This is so fun.

1557
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,780
The beard found this one.

1558
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,140
We might talk about this more on news area,

1559
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,220
depending where it goes.

1560
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,460
It's a social coding experiment, and it's pretty neat.

1561
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,860
It's ChaosBot.

1562
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,820
It's an experiment to see what happens

1563
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,780
when absolute direction of a software project

1564
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,100
is turned over completely to the open source community.

1565
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,340
So here's how it works.

1566
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,900
You fork the code, and you make any changes

1567
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,980
that you want to make.

1568
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,500
Have at it.

1569
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,220
You open up a pull request.

1570
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,700
If there is general approval from the community,

1571
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,140
the pull request will be merged automatically by ChaosBot.

1572
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,380
ChaosBot will automatically update its own code

1573
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,020
with changes and then restart itself.

1574
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,740
And then the process repeats itself.

1575
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:45,660
Here's some things they feel like this might accomplish.

1576
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,420
Number one, it could provide some useful service to people.

1577
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,220
And number two, it could be malicious.

1578
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,580
Yep.

1579
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,540
Number three, it could recreate itself

1580
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,580
in a different programming language.

1581
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,540
Very likely.

1582
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,940
And number four, probably the most likely,

1583
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,020
it could break itself and die.

1584
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,220
There's no set purpose.

1585
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,820
It's up to the community.

1586
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,300
Have at it.

1587
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,620
I think it's kind of interesting.

1588
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,220
What do you think, Wes?

1589
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,180
Can we see some interesting results from this?

1590
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,100
I mean, it's interesting just as an idea.

1591
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,420
And yes, it does seem like it's either going to break,

1592
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,100
or the internet is going to evolve itself

1593
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,580
another malicious bot.

1594
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,340
I'd like to see it.

1595
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,300
I'd like to see it.

1596
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,820
So go contribute.

1597
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,140
Yeah, help it not be evil.

1598
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,180
Be part of the chaos.

1599
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,140
Go make it download Jupiter Broadcasting Podcast.

1600
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,620
Oh, yeah, that's what we need.

1601
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,060
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1602
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,780
All right, linux.ting.com.

1603
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,860
Go there to sign up.

1604
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,820
Switch to Ting.

1605
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,780
It's mobile done differently.

1606
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,780
In fact, if mobile had to start all over again,

1607
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,060
this is how they would do it.

1608
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,460
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

1609
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,100
$23 per phone per month.

1610
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,820
It's because Ting does mobile differently.

1611
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,700
It's $6 for your line.

1612
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,300
And then it's just your usage on top

1613
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,860
of that for your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1614
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,100
You pay for what you use.

1615
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,180
However much you talk, however much you text,

1616
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,900
and however much data you use, that's what you pay for.

1617
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,420
They have nationwide coverage.

1618
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,580
There's no contracts.

1619
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,580
There's no quote unquote agreements.

1620
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,740
And they have a really nice control panel

1621
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,580
that gives you your usage, that lets

1622
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,180
you turn specific features on and off,

1623
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,540
set usage alerts.

1624
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,500
They have great customer service.

1625
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,900
And one of my favorite features, and I've

1626
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,220
been a Ting customer for like two and a half, three years,

1627
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,380
two and a half years at least, two and a half years,

1628
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,500
and like eight, I don't know, a long time now.

1629
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,420
One of my favorite features is they

1630
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,580
have a CDMA and a GSM network.

1631
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,540
A CDMA and a GSM network means you

1632
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,580
can pick whichever one works better in your area.

1633
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,700
Or it also means if you inherit a device,

1634
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,220
you've got something sitting around,

1635
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,340
you can bring it over to Ting, try it out,

1636
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,300
and then if it works well for you, switch.

1637
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,500
That's what I did.

1638
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,940
Now, like I said, it's been a while.

1639
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,460
But I had an EVO 4G sitting around on my desk.

1640
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,620
So I thought, well, what the heck, why not?

1641
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,220
So I took it.

1642
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,140
It used to be like a Sprint device or something.

1643
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,140
It had a CDMA radio.

1644
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,020
And it had WiMAX, which was going

1645
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,860
to be the next big wireless technology, was WiMAX.

1646
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,060
And I took it out of the desk.

1647
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,300
And I thought, well, I'll try it out on Ting.

1648
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,820
And I switched it over to Ting.

1649
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,820
And I was like, well, holy shit, why

1650
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,200
am I not just doing this all the time for all the things?

1651
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,060
This is just fine.

1652
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,100
It works great.

1653
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,620
And it matches my mobile usage perfectly.

1654
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,740
And then from that point on, I've switched everything over.

1655
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,260
Now I've got multiple devices.

1656
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
And I'm super, super happy.

1657
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,060
Linux.ting.com, go there to get $25 off a device.

1658
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,660
Or if you bring a device, get $25 in service credit.

1659
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,060
Linux.ting.com.

1660
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,140
And a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

1661
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,600
the Unplugged program.

1662
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,780
So I've been having some troubles with Gnome,

1663
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,940
which I outlined in user error.

1664
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,060
There, that was the sentence I was trying to get out.

1665
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,620
And it's mostly around performance.

1666
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,140
It's actually been getting me today, during this show,

1667
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,860
while we were recording.

1668
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,060
We had to stop and restart because Gnome crashed on us.

1669
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,380
And for some reason, and I don't really understand why,

1670
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,580
and I'm starting to suspect maybe it's a graphics driver

1671
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,420
issue, is when Gnome crashes, it also

1672
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,820
kills our audio and OBS for like 15 to 30 seconds.

1673
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,460
It's just a real bugger.

1674
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:20,620
And so it's within this context that I'm

1675
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,620
very, very excited about the new Plasma 5.10 release.

1676
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,300
And this guy from the Plasma team over there

1677
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,700
has a video about it.

1678
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,140
And I thought maybe we'd cover it.

1679
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,940
He covers it all right here, the new features

1680
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,980
of the Plasma desktop.

1681
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,540
After a few months of intensive work,

1682
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:38,260
the KDE community is pleased to announce Plasma 5.10, which

1683
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,740
brings many improvements and features to your desktop.

1684
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,180
Due to the popular demand, we've changed a folder view

1685
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,340
as the default desktop, which allows users

1686
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:51,740
to put whatever files or folders they want on their desktop.

1687
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,980
Spring loading in folder view makes drag and drop

1688
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,180
files powerful and quick.

1689
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,840
When you search in KRunner, it can now

1690
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,620
list non-installed applications in the software center.

1691
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,740
The icon size in the vertical task manager

1692
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,540
is now configurable to support more and more popular

1693
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,140
vertical panel usage cases.

1694
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,560
Speaking of the task manager, it's

1695
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,300
gained options for middle mouse click

1696
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,820
so you can group and ungroup applications.

1697
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,620
Places jump list actions are available to the file manager

1698
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,460
launchers.

1699
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,500
So Dolphin and task manager gives you

1700
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,580
quick access to locations like your downloads

1701
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,340
and your pictures.

1702
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,700
The audio volume applet has a handy menu

1703
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,380
on each device, which you can use to set the default

1704
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,660
or switch the output to a different port.

1705
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,140
Interactive notifications now support a context menu

1706
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,540
on previews, giving you access to actions

1707
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,140
such as open the containing folder, copy, and open with.

1708
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,260
It is now possible to resize widgets on the desktop

1709
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,300
by dragging on their edges and moving them with Alt-Left-Click,

1710
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,460
just like a regular window.

1711
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,740
Plasma menu launchers gained a new category

1712
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:58,260
for often used documents and applications.

1713
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,740
Lock screen has gained support for media controls,

1714
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,700
so you can switch between your favorite songs

1715
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,700
without the need to unlock your desktop.

1716
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,180
Discover Software Center has gained provisional back ends

1717
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,540
for flat packs and snap packages.

1718
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,180
It's now possible to use the virtual keyboard on the login

1719
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,260
and lock screen.

1720
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,260
If you enjoy using Plasma, please

1721
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,460
consider donating to KDE so we can work together.

1722
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,500
Man, I am so glad I recorded that video because I really

1723
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,120
had to go to the bathroom during the show

1724
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,340
and I was not sure what I was going to do.

1725
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,780
I was not sure how I was going to take a pee during this show

1726
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,500
because it's live.

1727
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,500
But that was how I did it right there.

1728
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,180
And it was with that that also gave us a chance to share

1729
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,060
with you all the new features.

1730
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,560
Now, I actually thought it was worth playing the video too

1731
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,540
because it really, to me, illustrates

1732
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:50,900
a continued steady stream of improved Plasma desktop

1733
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
releases over and over again.

1734
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:59,500
Yeah, I was shocked this last week or last yesterday.

1735
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,740
Yesterday?

1736
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,500
It's all a blur.

1737
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,340
It's all a blur.

1738
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,660
I hate the internet, dude.

1739
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,260
The internet makes everything go by so fast.

1740
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,700
Anyways, so yesterday when Linux Action News came out,

1741
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,780
Joe told me that he's planning to, well, he's considering,

1742
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,180
I shouldn't say planning.

1743
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,660
Joe Resington is considering switching to the Plasma desktop

1744
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,900
from XFCE.

1745
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,420
Is this your doing or is this organic?

1746
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,300
No, no, he's just been looking at it.

1747
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,340
And it really is because I think they've

1748
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,460
had about five or six solid releases after the other that

1749
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,200
have been better than the one before it.

1750
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,980
And they're adding features that are legitimately useful.

1751
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,180
So imagine you get a Plasma desktop notification

1752
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,580
that a file has changed in a directory from one of your sync

1753
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,180
software.

1754
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,020
Well, now you can right click on that thing

1755
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,980
and open up the folder.

1756
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,420
Just look at it.

1757
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:45,820
Nice.

1758
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,300
It's nice.

1759
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,780
Yeah, that's very convenient.

1760
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,740
Anyways, the Plasma desktop is just

1761
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,380
getting better and better.

1762
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,220
So I've been thinking about switching back again.

1763
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,340
Can't even finish that whole sentence, can you?

1764
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,300
I just feel like such a jerk.

1765
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,640
But the reality is, so I outlined it in user 10,

1766
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:12,420
but there is a performance issue with GNOME 3 on systems

1767
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,340
that you run for, say, more than 20 days.

1768
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,820
That's been about, at least for me, and this is with the Nvidia

1769
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,460
9-series graphics cards.

1770
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,480
I get about 20 days before I start

1771
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,820
getting about 15 frames per second when I open up.

1772
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,420
Ooh.

1773
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,740
The Activities window on GNOME.

1774
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,740
And it's really stuttery, and it's really noticeable.

1775
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,660
And you combine that with other little problems,

1776
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,700
like the fact that GNOME 3 is crashing on our OBS rig.

1777
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,860
Or yesterday, I was copying a bunch of files, and X crashes.

1778
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,520
And it just screws up my whole system.

1779
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,420
And I can't do anything, because I know Nautilus is still

1780
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,020
copying files, because the process is still running.

1781
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,740
But X is unusable.

1782
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,900
I love GNOME, but I'm having so many problems in the last,

1783
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,460
say, two months with it.

1784
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,900
The one common thread is all of them are on Nvidia systems.

1785
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,620
So I actually am willing to consider that it's Nvidia,

1786
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,220
not GNOME.

1787
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,740
But it's got me wondering if maybe I shouldn't just switch

1788
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,240
back to Plasma for a little bit.

1789
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,220
And so this new release, it looks pretty good.

1790
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:17,140
And if nothing else, it's continued solid improvement

1791
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,300
in the right direction.

1792
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,460
And Qt seems to have a good future in front of it, too.

1793
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,620
So anyways, congrats to the Plasma folks.

1794
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,900
Yeah, that's great.

1795
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,780
They seem to have a good release.

1796
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,380
Yeah, what would it take for you to try it, Wes?

1797
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,340
Not a lot, I don't think.

1798
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,460
I mean, I'm down.

1799
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,900
It looks like a good release.

1800
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,500
I could give it an install.

1801
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,780
But you've got GNOME there.

1802
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,220
I do, yeah.

1803
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,340
It's running GNOME.

1804
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,460
If you were just doing an install tomorrow,

1805
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,220
would you hit GNOME, or would you do Plasma?

1806
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,620
You'd probably do GNOME, wouldn't you?

1807
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,580
I would, mostly because I've got a real minimal GNOME setup

1808
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,140
with just a couple of extensions and a theme.

1809
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,860
And it works OK, and it gets out of my way.

1810
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:54,700
Especially, I only use, what, six applications.

1811
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,740
And so just hitting the old super key,

1812
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:00,540
and typing my thing, and then it starts up.

1813
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,180
That said, I really like Kwin.

1814
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,380
Kwin is great.

1815
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,660
And I think if I put in enough time,

1816
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:11,500
just really sunk my teeth into Plasma.

1817
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,700
So I figured it minimally, I think it would work.

1818
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,700
I tried to do that, and I ran into usability issues, I guess.

1819
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,940
Wimby, have you seen any of this stuff

1820
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,380
I'm talking about with GNOME 3 performance?

1821
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,620
I don't know if you had a chance to hit User Air,

1822
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,740
but essentially the activities pop-up area and whatnot

1823
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,260
is noticeably slower and slower.

1824
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,100
And then if you run it on Wayland, it's really bad.

1825
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,260
Really?

1826
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,620
I've not tested GNOME 3 extensively enough recently

1827
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,540
to encounter that.

1828
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,420
I've been running it a little bit

1829
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,340
for these external GPU tests and comparisons,

1830
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,660
but I've not had a system up for 20 days

1831
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,620
or anything like that.

1832
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,220
What is your opinion of the,

1833
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,420
how would you describe the perceptual difference

1834
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,060
of a system, say, the Mate desktop,

1835
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,860
where the interface is being rendered by the CPU

1836
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:03,020
versus where the interface is being rendered by Comp is?

1837
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,220
How would you describe the difference there?

1838
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,180
Well, if you take a Mate and you switch between the two,

1839
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,580
there's no real difference in the speed

1840
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,260
at which things pop up and render, so.

1841
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,500
I disagree in the, to me, I perceive a difference

1842
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,820
in the way the windows move around,

1843
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,180
the way the windows draw on the screen.

1844
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,100
To me, there's- Oh, yeah.

1845
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,620
Yeah, definitely, yes.

1846
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,460
What do you describe?

1847
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,300
That's what I'm talking about.

1848
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,220
What do you describe that?

1849
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,220
What do you describe that difference as?

1850
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,940
Well, I mean, the first thing is,

1851
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,060
is that reduced all the lack of screen tearing,

1852
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,860
so you just get this sense of- Smoothness.

1853
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,740
Yeah, there's a smoothness to it, yeah,

1854
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,980
a fluidity and a consistency.

1855
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:45,020
And actually, I would say that as good as Comp is

1856
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,300
and Comp to now at eradicating screen tear,

1857
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,860
until you've seen something run on Mir and Wayland,

1858
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,020
you don't realize just how good the pixel pushing are

1859
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,300
in those technologies by comparison,

1860
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,380
because they're a level up again.

1861
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,460
I feel like, see, that is exactly how I feel

1862
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,380
like when I switch between the GNOME Shell,

1863
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,860
like there's just the GNOME 3 desktop

1864
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,060
and anything that uses K1,

1865
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:10,660
but obviously the Plasma desktop.

1866
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,340
That's, that is my, like that level of like,

1867
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,140
I've just stepped up in the way that,

1868
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,720
and I keep coming back to like these things,

1869
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,100
like I mentioned it with the text editor earlier,

1870
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,500
it's like, do these things actually matter?

1871
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,180
Or are they just like nerd things

1872
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,900
that I've decided that matter?

1873
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,300
And I think it depends on the person.

1874
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,140
And I think-

1875
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,180
No, I think they do matter, don't they?

1876
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,540
I hope so, because they matter to me an awful lot.

1877
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,560
But you're asking like, is this like the old compiling

1878
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,300
your software for your CPU thing, right?

1879
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,140
Does it really matter?

1880
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,980
Or is it like a 0.05% difference?

1881
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,060
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it,

1882
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,580
because to me, it feels like it matters a lot

1883
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,520
because I notice it, and if I notice it, then it matters.

1884
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,300
Yeah, and I know, I probably said before,

1885
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,700
I'm a big film fan, and when I'm watching YouTube videos,

1886
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,140
for example, or any sort of video playback,

1887
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,100
and I see that it's dodging around

1888
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,220
and that the image is tearing and all the rest of it,

1889
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,780
it drives me bananas.

1890
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,820
Now, not everyone sees it, but it's not just like video.

1891
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,260
It's simple things like, in some cases,

1892
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,460
scrolling up and down a webpage, for example,

1893
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,860
can be really stuttery,

1894
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:17,100
and you can actually lose your spot in the text,

1895
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,140
because you can't maintain a consistent view

1896
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,420
on where the text is scrolling to,

1897
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,020
so you lose sight of that, and that's frustrating.

1898
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,420
So I think it's something that people will appreciate

1899
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,340
and will notice. It feels good that you say that.

1900
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,340
It feels good that you say that.

1901
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,140
It feels good that the chat room is agreeing with me,

1902
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,420
because this is something that I've commented on

1903
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,540
in my past reviews and gotten a lot of like,

1904
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,620
shut the kind of stuff up. Chris, you're crazy.

1905
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,580
Yeah, I'm just like, okay, all right, maybe it is just me,

1906
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,780
because that stuff does really matter to me,

1907
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,420
and so that's where I'm at.

1908
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,660
Those kinds of things are where I'm at with GNOME right now,

1909
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,220
is that sort of, I'm getting that stuttering,

1910
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,500
a do, do, do, do, do, do.

1911
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,100
I can make the motion with my hand,

1912
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,060
but I can't really describe it to you.

1913
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,300
It's rough, it is rough.

1914
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,420
I had to watch the hand thing.

1915
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,020
It's rough, just don't. You saw it.

1916
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,340
Yeah, you should be glad that you didn't see that.

1917
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,500
Thank you, thank you, Wes.

1918
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,700
So I don't know where this brings me,

1919
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,360
but Plasma 5.10 is out, and I'm considering,

1920
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,780
once Arch gets it updated,

1921
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,260
I'm considering rolling it out.

1922
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,380
I have been also experimenting with a new way

1923
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,060
to try out my Plasma, and I want to talk to you guys

1924
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,580
about the application I've been using to do it.

1925
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,420
Whoa.

1926
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,820
And why I think it's really exciting

1927
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,460
that it's coming to Linux.

1928
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,820
I tried out, for the first time ever.

1929
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,260
Let me guess, let me guess.

1930
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,040
It's a Soos running on Windows.

1931
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,420
That doesn't even exist yet.

1932
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,020
That doesn't even exist yet.

1933
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,100
And here we are.

1934
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,500
It is May 30th, 2017.

1935
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,900
Build was forever ago,

1936
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,940
and we still have no information

1937
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,900
about what version of OpenSUSE,

1938
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,700
or how that's gonna work exactly.

1939
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,100
My only conclusion is,

1940
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,140
is that Microsoft hasn't given the projects any information,

1941
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,680
and they have no idea when this thing's actually gonna ship,

1942
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,040
so they can't tell us what version they're gonna ship,

1943
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,300
because they don't know yet.

1944
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,460
Side rant.

1945
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,680
Side rant. Sorry, go on.

1946
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,520
Anyways.

1947
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,300
No, I tried out the new Plasma desktop in Docker.

1948
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,940
I know, I know.

1949
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:16,060
I'm sorry if I just triggered any of you haters out there.

1950
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,980
I apologize.

1951
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,060
And it was so easy.

1952
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,220
It was so, it was so smooth.

1953
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,460
I have to tell you about it.

1954
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,940
It was an app that I just, actually it was funny.

1955
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,140
I thought it was only available for Mac and Windows,

1956
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,300
and I was really bummed.

1957
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,380
In fact, I told the beard, I was like,

1958
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,720
"'Shit, Rekai.

1959
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,180
"'If this came out for Linux,

1960
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,840
"'I'd make a whole episode about this.

1961
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,300
"'This is so awesome.'"

1962
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,820
And then Rekai did a little digging around,

1963
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,300
and he found a Linux port.

1964
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,140
Woo!

1965
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,140
So I'll tell you all about it,

1966
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,400
but first I'll tell you about our friends at Linux Academy.

1967
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,180
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

1968
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:53,740
and sign up for a free seven day trial.

1969
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,700
Not only will you support the show,

1970
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,980
but you get the seven day free trial,

1971
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,240
you get to try out the Linux Academy platform,

1972
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,720
which is built around learning more about Linux.

1973
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,160
Get the essentials around Linux,

1974
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,860
but also get all of the cool technologies

1975
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,980
that are gonna make you real money around Linux.

1976
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:11,260
You know, stuff like OpenStack, Azure, AWS.

1977
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,260
Oh, AWS, how you have burned me in the past.

1978
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,380
When I was first playing around with AWS,

1979
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,620
I logged in, put all the credit card information in there,

1980
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,520
created a system.

1981
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,900
Like a sucker.

1982
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,420
And then got busy for 24 or 25 days,

1983
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,940
and didn't realize that they were billing me

1984
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,780
just for having a system.

1985
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,740
You're like, I'll just transcode that,

1986
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,860
and I'll spin up this queue.

1987
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:31,700
I wish.

1988
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,820
I didn't do anything with it for like 25 days.

1989
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,220
I had no idea they were billing me.

1990
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,740
And that's what I, you know, like,

1991
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,760
I walked away, oh yeah, okay.

1992
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,100
That was my first lesson, is that this is very expensive.

1993
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,980
That was my first lesson.

1994
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,780
And Linux Academy, they just do all that spin up for you

1995
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,220
as part of your subscription.

1996
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,460
So you don't get that particular lesson.

1997
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,320
You actually learn how to use the systems.

1998
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,900
They got video courses, self-paced,

1999
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,300
in-depth video courses, hands-on labs,

2000
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,980
which really are scenario based,

2001
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,500
which give you a real experience.

2002
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,060
Instructor mentoring with real human beings

2003
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,300
that are happy to advise and answer questions.

2004
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,260
Course schedulers that you can set a time frame

2005
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,620
and you can actually set to it

2006
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:09,840
and make sure you meet your learning goals.

2007
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,500
And of course, if you're going for certs,

2008
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,940
they got courses created specifically

2009
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,460
to prepare you for those exams.

2010
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,900
And then when you're busy, not only do they have nuggets,

2011
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,060
which are like deep dives into single topics,

2012
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,380
but they have an availability planner

2013
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,380
that'll help you create a content plan

2014
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,640
around your cray-cray schedule.

2015
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,600
Just get started.

2016
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,820
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2017
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,580
and sign up for a free seven day trial.

2018
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,180
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

2019
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,600
the Unplugged program.

2020
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,820
So this is a bit of a gimped tutorial.

2021
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,140
I was planning to walk you through this

2022
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,660
a little more in-depth for this episode.

2023
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,900
Did a whole bunch of stuff on a couple of machines

2024
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,040
up in my office and then came down to the studio

2025
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:46,880
to show it to you.

2026
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,740
And it turns out that Docker services are offline.

2027
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:53,300
Yeah, Docker, that thing that enterprises use

2028
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,420
that is supposedly the next big wave in Linux technologies.

2029
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,620
Yeah, it's down, the Docker Hub is down,

2030
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,580
404 for all images.

2031
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:04,820
I can't really demonstrate this to you fully,

2032
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,540
but let me just kind of set it up for you.

2033
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,100
So the piece of software I want to talk about today

2034
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,220
that makes Docker approachable and usable,

2035
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,620
it makes using Docker easier than using VirtualBox.

2036
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:18,300
So if you've ever even flirted with VirtualBox

2037
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,940
or VMware Workstation, this is easier than that.

2038
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,540
And there's a lot of great Docker images

2039
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,700
you can take advantage of right now.

2040
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,500
Containers that you can just search for

2041
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,780
and install right away.

2042
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,180
Things that, I mean everything, guys.

2043
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:33,300
Stuff from like Usenet indexers and downloaders

2044
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,540
to NGINX servers, Minecraft servers.

2045
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,740
Like it's just so much stuff is available in Docker.

2046
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,060
Basically all of the world's great open source software

2047
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,500
is available in a Docker container.

2048
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,300
And if you've had your head in the sand around Docker,

2049
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,780
this is your opportunity to really take advantage of it.

2050
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,120
It's called Kitematic.

2051
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,140
And they'll tell you it's available for Mac OS

2052
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,500
and Windows 7.

2053
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,000
I don't know, I suppose it probably is good for them.

2054
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,580
To me it sort of sniffs of an Electron app,

2055
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:02,420
but I'm not quite sure.

2056
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,820
We'll get to how you can get it on Linux here in a second.

2057
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,260
But it's a one click install to get Docker containers

2058
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,020
running on your system.

2059
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
And it gives you a gooey configuration

2060
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,460
to set up things like X11 forwarding.

2061
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,260
It gives you a configuration to set up your network hosting.

2062
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,500
It has a really nice output for the log.

2063
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,780
Of course it has integration with the hub

2064
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,740
so you can just search for stuff

2065
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,220
and automatically download it to your system and get going.

2066
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,240
It makes it easier, it's also, it's great

2067
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,740
because it doesn't surplant the Docker CLI

2068
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,580
so you can use it in conjunction with the Docker command line.

2069
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,660
Now, I guess you don't really need to care

2070
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,380
about any of that stuff.

2071
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,760
Really what you need to know is it's a really simple gooey

2072
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,180
to just look at all of the great Docker containers

2073
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,500
and essentially get them running on your system

2074
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,960
with just a couple of clicks.

2075
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,940
And before today's episode,

2076
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,420
I thought this was only really available for Mac and Windows.

2077
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,940
Turns out, pretty straightforward

2078
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,580
to get it working on Linux.

2079
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:54,820
There's a deb available, put out there.

2080
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,860
It works best on recent Ubuntu's,

2081
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,700
but there's also an AUR repository.

2082
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,080
Nice, wow.

2083
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,980
Yeah.

2084
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,620
I gotta say, I've heard of this.

2085
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,380
I've had people at work and other places who are like.

2086
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,220
Mac users have told me about it.

2087
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,540
Yeah, oh, a ton of Mac users.

2088
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,060
They love this, which, admittedly,

2089
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,460
Docker's a little harder to use on Mac,

2090
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,500
so this goes, it's a little more useful, I think,

2091
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,060
for those platforms than it is on Linux.

2092
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,920
But for anyone who's wanting to play with Docker,

2093
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,240
intimidated by the constantly changing Docker ecosystem,

2094
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,700
it really does, I think, bridge the gap

2095
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,580
to make it like, I can start playing with this.

2096
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,900
Well, it takes Docker from an idea to,

2097
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,860
I want to try, I want to run a Minecraft server.

2098
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,940
And if that's what you want,

2099
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,100
I want to run a Minecraft server.

2100
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,860
You launch KiteMatic, you type in Minecraft,

2101
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,580
and within 45 seconds, you're running a Minecraft server.

2102
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,980
And I think that's pretty sweet.

2103
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,260
For Arch, they have KiteMatic,

2104
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,460
which uses straight up Docker,

2105
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,420
and then they have KiteMatic Git,

2106
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,260
which is not only a Git version of KiteMatic,

2107
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,820
but also uses the Git version of Docker.

2108
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,540
And so there's just a couple of things you have to do

2109
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,860
on your GNU slash Linux box before you can use this,

2110
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,860
and I've outlined them in the show notes.

2111
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:58,980
It's essentially, you complete the post installation scripts

2112
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,580
that I have linked in the show notes.

2113
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,540
It's make sure you have a Docker group,

2114
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,780
make sure you start the Docker service,

2115
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,560
basic things like that.

2116
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,700
And at least on Arch, where I was testing this,

2117
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,740
I had to run KiteMatic with pseudo privileges,

2118
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,300
otherwise it can't create the containers it needs.

2119
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
And once the Docker service has started,

2120
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,580
you run pseudo KiteMatic, you get a graphical interface

2121
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,840
for deploying really all of the great Docker hub images,

2122
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,100
and so I was trying out the Plasma 5.10 desktop

2123
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,700
using Docker, and it was great.

2124
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,540
That's awesome.

2125
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,700
It was super cool, dude,

2126
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,780
because didn't even have to bother with a VM,

2127
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,980
didn't have to bother with downloading an ISO,

2128
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,380
I just was able to take advantage

2129
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,340
of the native performance of my workstation.

2130
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,660
Anyways, KiteMatic is, if you look around online,

2131
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:46,860
it looks like it's just something for Macs and maybe Windows,

2132
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,620
but us Linux users can get it too,

2133
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,980
and I have a link to how to set that up in the desktop.

2134
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:54,100
And if you've never really thought about messing around

2135
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,740
with Docker before, it kind of makes it approachable,

2136
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,620
kind of makes it real, makes it real,

2137
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:04,140
and they have two different containers

2138
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,180
for neon spin of Plasma.

2139
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,740
They have KDE Neon Plasma,

2140
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,640
which is sort of just the base Plasma desktop,

2141
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,180
and they have KDE Neon All.

2142
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,660
Both of these are containers available,

2143
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,500
and All is like the entire software,

2144
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,100
so it's like a four gig image,

2145
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,760
and then just the Plasma desktop is like a two gig image.

2146
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,600
There you have it.

2147
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,440
You can go fly a kite.

2148
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,460
Go fly a kite, Wes.

2149
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,100
Go fly a kite, Matic.

2150
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,340
Go fly a kite, Matic, Wes.

2151
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,540
I don't know, I'm working on my slam.

2152
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,260
It's not very good, it's not very good.

2153
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,340
I'm sorry, I apologize about that.

2154
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,380
I forgive you.

2155
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:38,980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2156
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,900
Anyways, it's pretty neat, and it was one of these

2157
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:47,140
where I felt like, ah, screw the damn Mac users

2158
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,780
and the damn Windows users.

2159
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,940
Docker's supposed to be a Linux technology,

2160
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,540
and here they have this GUI that makes it super easy

2161
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,860
to pick out the Docker containers you want

2162
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,140
and just deploy them on your system.

2163
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,140
How dare they?

2164
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,900
This is our technology.

2165
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,700
This is our thing, and then Rika was like,

2166
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,980
actually, I found this link here,

2167
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,140
and yeah, you can make it work on Linux.

2168
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,980
That's awesome.

2169
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:10,180
I actually had not done that either,

2170
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,420
and so I'd seen it, and I was like,

2171
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,780
well, yeah, I guess I'll just keep figuring out

2172
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,960
the Docker CLI.

2173
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,800
Yeah, and it's fine.

2174
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,380
It works, and this doesn't necessarily supplant it.

2175
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,460
You can still use both.

2176
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,180
I'll have links to all of that in the show notes.

2177
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,260
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

2178
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,700
Look for Linux Unplugged 199,

2179
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,460
and you'll find links to that,

2180
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,500
plus the Razer core that Wimpy talked about,

2181
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,060
the Samba vulnerability we mentioned,

2182
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:38,220
that crazy GNOME extension if you want it,

2183
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,820
and also the rest of that Plasma 5 video

2184
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,740
that I used to take a leak.

2185
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:44,300
All of that over at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

2186
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,380
Just look for episode 199, and just a slight reminder,

2187
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,740
we do have that barbecue coming up.

2188
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,540
We'd love to have you come hang out at the studio

2189
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,080
for the 4th of July.

2190
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,920
That'd be pretty cool.

2191
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,740
Oh my gosh.

2192
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:54,580
That'd be pretty cool.

2193
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:55,420
Do it.

2194
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,240
Also, you can join us in the mumble room.

2195
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,660
Just do a bang mumble over at jblive.tv,

2196
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,580
and we'll see you back here next Tuesday!

2197
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:20,580
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

2198
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:43,860
Oh, thank you everybody!

2199
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:47,300
jbtitles.com, let's go name this thing.

2200
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,820
Let's go name this thing.

2201
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,460
Varatunda, it was good to see you again, man.

2202
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,520
Good to see you, good to see you.

2203
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,360
Good to see you.

2204
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,180
Oh, absolutely.

2205
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,060
Mr. Lou, we didn't hear from you this week,

2206
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,020
but good to see you too.

2207
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,540
Zub cereal, good to see you.

2208
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:01,260
And we have Robot the Arm.

2209
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,800
Roboter, something like that.

2210
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,640
Good to see you too, man.

2211
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,900
It's awesome to see all these people.

2212
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,980
And then we had a couple people filter in

2213
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,240
during the show.

2214
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,260
It was good.

2215
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,500
It was nice getting a chance to listen to the show, Chris.

2216
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,580
Jb Titles, Jb Titles, Docker Apocalypse,

2217
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:21,740
Go Fly Kite Matic, Keddie Makes Plasma Great Again,

2218
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,940
a package for your package.

2219
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,780
Oh, I like that one.

2220
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,220
No, you don't.

2221
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,740
No Samba, No Cry, that's not bad either.

2222
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,600
That's kind of clever.

2223
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,540
Yeah, that is pretty clever.

2224
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,060
I get that, I get that.

2225
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:42,340
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, boom, boom, boom.

2226
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,900
So Mr. Wimpy, are you doing the eGPU thing

2227
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:49,360
separate from the review of the laptop

2228
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,200
that you and I were discussing?

2229
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,860
Because I've been waiting for that one too.

2230
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:52,700
I want to hear that.

2231
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,980
Yeah, yeah, so the eGPU is this Thursday

2232
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:59,300
and the laptop review is the following Thursday.

2233
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,420
Man, I have to wait even longer.

2234
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,140
I'm looking forward to that, I'm looking forward to that.

2235
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:07,100
So Wimpy, are you doing any of these tests

2236
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,260
that you're running, are you going to be comparing them

2237
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,460
at all to Windows performance and let's say

2238
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:17,080
how much of the third of the bus is being used, et cetera?

2239
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,940
So I can't compare with Windows

2240
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:22,420
because I just don't do Windows.

2241
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,860
So not even interested in making that comparison

2242
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,340
because it's personally meaningless.

2243
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:34,580
In terms of like things like GPU utilization on the bus,

2244
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,980
then yes, I've actually, although we don't talk about that

2245
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,940
when we were discussing it today,

2246
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,840
but yes, I did make a note of how saturated

2247
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,540
the GPU was under load.

2248
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:50,540
And I've looked at what other people have done

2249
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,920
with measuring the comparative performance deltas.

2250
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,940
I haven't done it myself

2251
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,100
because I have no means of making this test.

2252
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:02,980
I don't have a desktop PC with Thunderbolt

2253
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,200
that I can mount the graphics card on the bus

2254
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,000
and then plug it into the core on a Thunderbolt port.

2255
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,840
So I can't do that test to see what the,

2256
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,300
you know, relative performance differences.

2257
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,880
So other people have done those performance tests

2258
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,900
and they're interesting

2259
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,260
because some people have been more thorough than others.

2260
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,420
And what you learn is that you will see banded around

2261
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:30,340
numbers of like, you'll get a 20 to 30% reduction

2262
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:34,540
in performance when you use an external GPU.

2263
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,380
Wow, really that much?

2264
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:39,260
But well, but it depends, right?

2265
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,500
So it depends on the game.

2266
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,420
It depends on the CPU requirements of the game.

2267
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:50,220
And interestingly, as you drive up the resolution

2268
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,220
that you're running the GPU at,

2269
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,460
the higher you drive the resolution,

2270
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:59,880
the closer the delta gets to the installed speed.

2271
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,320
So when you're doing 4K gaming,

2272
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,780
that delta is like 5%, not 20%.

2273
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,780
Wow.

2274
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:09,940
So, and this is because you're pushing the GPU harder

2275
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:13,040
and you know, the bus speed is irrelevant at that point.

2276
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:18,040
But all I was interested in was, does it run well?

2277
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:25,600
And I define well, as can I run it on my 2K display

2278
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,040
with everything pushed to ultra or high

2279
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,840
or whatever the maximum settings is

2280
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,560
and it run at a decent frame rate.

2281
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,520
And the answer to that question is yes.

2282
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,440
Yeah, one of the things from one of the people

2283
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,520
that I saw that did an eGPU test on Windows

2284
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,240
was that there's a difference between

2285
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,520
hooking the eGPU up to a, let's say a desktop system

2286
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,480
and running the display off of the desktop system

2287
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:58,480
and then utilizing the display out on the eGPU

2288
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,520
instead of the desktop system.

2289
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,360
Yeah.

2290
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,400
So I'm not sure if they're aware of that.

2291
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,380
I have done that one.

2292
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:08,840
So I have done the drive the external display solely

2293
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,000
and also reflect the display to whatever the laptop screen

2294
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,520
is because you can do either.

2295
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,120
And there is a slight performance penalty

2296
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,960
of directing the display to the laptop screen

2297
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,960
but it's almost immeasurable for most titles

2298
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,120
is in the realm of a couple of percent in my testing

2299
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,080
unless this is 1080p screen.

2300
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,760
And of course, if you're an Intel graphics user,

2301
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,560
if you can even get within, I mean,

2302
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,920
if you can even play the games with decent settings,

2303
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,660
that's a pretty big win.

2304
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,200
Well, we're talking about the difference

2305
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,140
between running some of these games

2306
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:47,480
at like barely 20 frames per second

2307
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,680
to over 100 frames per second.

2308
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,560
Exactly, exactly.

2309
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:54,000
And this is 20 frames per second at low

2310
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,680
versus 100 frames at everything dialed up.

2311
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,560
What was the out of the box config?

2312
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,720
Was it pretty extensive or pretty plug and play?

2313
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,800
It was really easy.

2314
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,300
The core itself, it's just got a magnetic release

2315
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,540
to pull the chassis out of the casing.

2316
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:14,760
One thumbscrew to where the card goes in,

2317
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,160
plug the card in just like you plug it into the bus on a PC,

2318
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,800
thumbscrew in, close it.

2319
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,040
So that whole process takes about 30 seconds.

2320
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,920
And then you just plug in power to the GPU

2321
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,640
and then you plug a Thunderbolt port

2322
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,120
between the GPU and the computer.

2323
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,740
Come on, I mean, it is somewhat remarkable

2324
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:37,640
that in this day and age, something like this,

2325
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,640
an external graphics card by a vendor like NVIDIA,

2326
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,640
you know, the graphics cards in NVIDIA,

2327
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,400
the enclosure is by Razer and you're connecting

2328
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,720
over a technology created by Intel

2329
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,400
and you just plug it into Linux and it's working?

2330
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,320
Like this is not something that would have happened

2331
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,260
five, six, seven, eight years ago.

2332
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,920
This is a huge piece of equipment

2333
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,120
that you are externalizing and just connecting

2334
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:06,120
to your PCI bus and it's just working and it's no big deal.
