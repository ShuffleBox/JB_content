1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
You might be familiar with Wine, but are you familiar with Twine?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,760
It emulates OS2 binaries, the same way that Wine can emulate Windows binary.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,480
It's named such to continue the fine tradition of programmers producing good code and bad

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,640
product names.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,480
And it comes from the one, the only, Ryan C. Gordon, aka Ikyulus, so you know it actually

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,860
might be a bit legitimate.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,040
He just posted this to his patrons on his Patreon page.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,080
And Wes, good news, they've got Unreal Tournament.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Oh boy!

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,160
Of all the things, right?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
That's what he goes with.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,960
But he's pretty fired up about it.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,800
He actually says this is a big deal.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
And Ryan does have quite a bit of experience porting games and 3D applications over to

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,940
the Linux desktop.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,640
And you know, I gotta be honest, this does speak to me a little bit at a deep nerd level.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,920
Not because I'm planning to use OS2 for anything, but in a way like you hate to see this stuff

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
die.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,080
And when it's all digital, like we have the means to preserve this stuff, and games and

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,960
whatnot are art.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
That is definitely true.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,800
Even if you don't care about any of that, it's kind of just a fascinating read.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,000
He dives into a bunch of details about the progress he's made so far, why it's difficult,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,160
and why it might not be that difficult overall.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah, so I expect any week now, Popeye will be taking the Twine challenge and running

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,560
everything on his desktop through an OS2 emulator.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Hang on.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Wait, what?

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
OS2?

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
It's an OS2 emulator.

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
OS2.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Yeah.

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
You want to take the challenge, Popeye?

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
I can't get my head around this.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,840
Wimpy was more of an OS2 guy than I was.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah, I've got Arkanoa on my ThinkPads.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
You were a big OS2 fan, eh Wimpy?

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Well what do you say?

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
There you go, Wimpy.

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
You take the challenge.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
You take it.

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
You take it.

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,440
I'll give it a go.

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,320
I switched from OS2 to Linux.

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
There you go.

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
There you go.

48
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
And now you can switch back.

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:09,360
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 237 for February 20th, 2018.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,880
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show this week that's so packed with

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
goodness.

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,820
Well, we're going to give you an extra side.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
My name is Chris.

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
My name is Wes.

55
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
It's going to be a side of announcement.

56
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,560
We'll tell you more about that in just a little bit, but first this week we'll cover some

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,040
community news.

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,240
The good folks over at KDE just got a surprise donation from the Pineapple Fund.

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,800
We'll tell you about that.

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Our friends over at Canonical want to know a little bit more about how your computer

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,440
set up, so we'll talk directly to the horse's mouth about that.

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
I do love the horse's mouth.

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
I always think of Mr. Ed.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
With the peanut butter.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So tasty.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,520
And then later on, our good friends over at Elementary OS and System76 working on Pop

68
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,280
OS are doing something that I think a lot of you are going to agree with, the turning

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,420
on disk encryption by default.

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,560
But this isn't a simple implementation, and there's a lot of user challenges to work through

71
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,100
and edge cases that have to be thought through.

72
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,100
So we'll talk to them about turning on disk encryption by default when you install Elementary

73
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,800
OS or Pop OS in the near future.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,920
Gnome's got a new tool to check on your system.

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,240
A big bogus Linux vulnerability is getting all of the attention this week.

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,040
OpenStreetMaps has woes, and then we're going to wrap it all up with that side.

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,600
It's going to be a tasty side.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Maybe a berry flavor.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,520
It's an announcement here at the network.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,280
Something big on the build up to scale is coming back to Jupiter Broadcasting.

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,840
You got to stay tuned.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,520
You got to listen to find out that.

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
You know it.

84
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
You know it.

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,140
You know the drill, Wes.

86
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
You know the drill.

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,480
So Wes, before we go any further, it is our duty to bring in that virtual log.

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,120
Time appropriate greetings, Bumble Room.

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
What's up?

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Hello.

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Hello.

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Hello.

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
How are you?

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
All right.

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
So how many of you are using the MumbleSnap today?

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Just say I.

97
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I.

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
I.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
I.

100
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Sure.

101
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Whoa.

102
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Impressive.

103
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Dude, all of a sudden I'm having FOMO.

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm just feeling like I should be catching up.

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Wow.

106
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
All right.

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,780
We'll talk about production testing.

108
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,360
We're going to put it through its paces this week.

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
All right.

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
Well, let's start with a little bit of good news.

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,480
The KDE project is extremely pleased to announce that they have received 200,000 U.S. Greenback

112
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,680
donations from the Pineapple Fund.

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,720
Now, they go on to say that they're going to use these funds to further their cause

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,720
to make free software accessible to everyone on all platforms, which is good because I

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,360
was pretty convinced until they made that statement that they were going to use that

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,680
money to fund proprietary software, so I'm pretty glad they made that clarification.

117
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Close call.

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Yeah.

119
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,920
The money is going to help them realize their vision of creating a world in which everyone

120
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,760
has control over their digital life and enjoys freedom and privacy.

121
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,040
Well, apparently they're going to buy out Apple and Google.

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I think this is great.

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,680
The Pineapple Fund says that KDE is a necessary community project which just has a general

124
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,320
benefit to the public and advances the use of free software on all platforms, so that's

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
why they were all in.

126
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,800
Two hundred thousand dollars.

127
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,480
The Pineapple Fund has been busy recently contributing money.

128
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,320
I don't know a lot about the Pineapple Fund, but I need to do some more digging.

129
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,680
I did a little bit of reading, so I have a rough idea, but is anybody kind of familiar

130
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,200
with Pineapple Fund before I run my mouth about it?

131
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,240
Anybody want to save me and just eloquently describe in a few short, beautiful sentences?

132
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Eloquently.

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,920
What do you think, producer Michael?

134
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
What do you think?

135
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
You got a shot?

136
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Well, I mean, it's just like it's a Bitcoin-based philanthropist basically.

137
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,320
Right, and when it came to the Free Software Foundation, they actually donated Bitcoin

138
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,560
to the Free Software Foundation.

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
OpenBSD is one of the beneficiaries.

140
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,640
But in this case, for KD, I believe they donated cash.

141
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,600
They converted it to cash.

142
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Cash.

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah.

144
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
Yeah, pretty interesting.

145
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Pretty interesting.

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
So you can find it all out.

147
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,560
They have raised fifty-three million dollars and donated to fifty-eight different charities

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,680
so far.

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I like that.

150
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I think that's pretty cool.

151
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
I think that's a great use of cryptocurrency, too, you know what I mean?

152
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,640
And if you donate now and then they can use those funds down the road, well, today as

153
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,440
we record, Bitcoin is back up to $11,000, probably because of manipulation via Popey's

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
huge wealth.

155
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Ugh.

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
That guy.

157
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
I know.

158
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
But, you know, it's going to a good cause.

159
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,720
Now you can feel good about that and not just feel more poor.

160
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, exactly.

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Thank you.

162
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Thanks to Popey, really.

163
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,320
I think that might be Mr. Dustin Kirkland you hear there coming in a bit.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,160
So let's talk to Dustin and Will Cook.

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,320
They're both joining us from Canonical, and you may have heard of an email that Will sent

166
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,720
out to the mailing list recently for the Ubuntu development in which he says that they're

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,660
looking at how to focus future resources around engineering and realized, you know, we could

168
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,020
use some information, some data, if you will, like what version of Ubuntu people are installing,

169
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,960
if they have a network connection, the type of CPU that they have, how much RAM, how did

170
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,240
they lay out their disks, what packages did they install, what GPU do they have, who built

171
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,740
their computer, these kinds of things that they don't actually currently collect.

172
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,160
But whenever you start talking about collecting additional data from users, it causes quite

173
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,580
a bit of reaction.

174
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,840
So I thought, instead of us just rampant speculation style here on the old show.

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
Oh, but that was going to be so much fun.

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Dude, I'm happy to do it.

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Maybe we'll just save that later.

178
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,280
But first, we'll get the information from Dustin and Will because they're in this thread.

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
And this email came from Will Cook.

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
So guys, welcome to the show.

181
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,320
And Will, why don't we start with you and kind of let's hear your version of what you

182
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
guys are proposing.

183
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Sure.

184
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,040
So I mean, as you said, data-driven development.

185
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,540
This is what we're all about.

186
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,920
We need to know where we should be focusing our efforts, what things people like, what

187
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,400
things people use, and they should get the lion's share of our engineering efforts so

188
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
that we can fix the parts that are most important to those people.

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,920
When I first saw this, I had a couple of different reactions.

190
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
My first reaction was, oh, people aren't going to like this.

191
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,600
But my second reaction is, you weren't collecting this already?

192
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,280
You're not already collecting this information?

193
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,800
That seems like information that would have been collected from day one.

194
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, yeah.

195
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,040
So from day one, we've always had an app port running, which is the thing that pops up and

196
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
says something went wrong.

197
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
Would you like to report an error about it?

198
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
That's always been there.

199
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,280
PopCon was there for a little while.

200
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,440
PopCon's been in Debian since forever.

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,880
But the raw data about what sort of hardware that we're running on, yeah, we haven't ever

202
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,200
gathered that.

203
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,320
So the thing that you're also suggesting, well, actually, I have a follow-up question

204
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
to that.

205
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,960
The one metric I think that's probably getting the most strong reaction would be location

206
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
information.

207
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,600
What kind of specific location information would you be collecting?

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
We talked about this internally before we sent the email.

209
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,200
We decided that it would be useful to everybody to know where people are in the world.

210
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,840
You know, if we find out that 90% of our users are based in India, let's say, then we need

211
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,880
to be focusing on the translations for India.

212
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,080
If we find out that everybody is in the US, then we need to be making sure that the English

213
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,520
translations are up to date.

214
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,420
We're not gathering IP address information.

215
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,560
The location will be the location that the user chooses at login.

216
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,000
So there's no sort of nefarious snooping on where we think you are.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,800
This is purely you tell us you're in this country.

218
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,920
We take that on face value and that's what we record.

219
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,740
And so it's not tracked to like a specific user and location.

220
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,400
So you wouldn't necessarily get Chris F. in Arlington, Washington when you look back at

221
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
the metrics?

222
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,640
No, it's like purely country level, literally top level country level information.

223
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,140
Okay.

224
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,120
And then the other thing, so you mentioned it really in there quickly as PopCon.

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,520
PopCon is a tool, if I'm correct, that sort of monitoring the user's packages that they

226
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,120
install to give you guys over a canonical and aggregate overview of the most popular

227
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
packages.

228
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,720
The idea there, I suppose, would be, well, if we have an idea of what the most popular

229
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,560
packages are, then we know where to dedicate patch time, backporting time, resource development

230
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
time, integration time.

231
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
Is that what PopCon is about?

232
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Exactly.

233
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,200
And we have the archives and people hit the archives in order to get packages.

234
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,640
But let's say that we could look at the web logs on those servers, which we don't.

235
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,680
But if we could do, we could see that people were installing a specific package.

236
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,840
A lot of people are installing a specific package.

237
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,880
That doesn't tell us whether they install it once and then uninstall it or they install

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,060
it and they use it every day or they install it and they use it once a year.

239
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,540
That's the sort of information that PopCon gives us, and with that information, we can

240
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,680
look at promoting packages that are in universe, which is the lowest level of support that

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,840
we offer, up to main, which is something that our security team get involved in.

242
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,300
So if everybody's installing a specific package from universe, they're using it every day,

243
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,040
then we can look at promoting that to main and then the security team and whoever it

244
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,400
is that's maintaining that package will be able to spend a lot more time making sure

245
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,360
that security bugs are fixed, making sure that the latest versions are packaged, keeping

246
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,120
that update for everybody.

247
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,640
So yeah, that's extremely useful information for us and it's extremely beneficial to our

248
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
users.

249
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,960
So I think I have a couple of questions specifically for Dustin, but Will, one of my kind of bigger

250
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,960
picture questions I have for you is the flip side of this is you've also stated that you

251
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,820
plan to make the data public.

252
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,520
Wouldn't that also mean that you plan to reveal exactly, roughly, pretty damn close how many

253
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Ubuntu installations there are, how many people are using Dell laptops versus an entryware

254
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
laptop?

255
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Like isn't this going to result in a lot of speculation being answered?

256
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,160
Because then you'll have real numbers.

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,040
People have like, well, Ubuntu has X amount of users and there's never really been a big

258
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,800
public number released about that.

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Will I'll jump in here actually at this point, yeah, I think that's exactly right and everything

260
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,040
that we've put out so far has been our best guess interpolation on roughly how many users

261
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,800
have downloaded the ISO from the Ubuntu.com mirror, not the mirror run by your local university

262
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:26,920
because obviously we can't count package updates or ISO downloads from mirrors, for instance.

263
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,280
So in a way, yes, there will be a lot more information available about the general usage

264
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,120
of Ubuntu, how and where.

265
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,160
I actually hope that there's some interesting conclusions that can be drawn by people outside

266
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,440
of Canonical.

267
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
I often look at the stats that are published by Docker Hub.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,200
If you go to, you hit Docker's API, you can see pulls of the Ubuntu image or the CentOS

269
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,440
image or the Debian image or the Mongo or the MySQL image, and I think part of that

270
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,560
is obviously those are statistics that were anonymously gathered by your usage of the

271
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,520
Docker binary fetching an image from Docker Hub, but the fact that that information is

272
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:20,920
also available for others to consume and graph and plot and interpolate is I think that's

273
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,080
part of the important social exchange.

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
That is an interesting idea.

275
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,920
So I want to ask you a couple of specifics about that really.

276
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
So what you're really talking about is essentially making all this data public and then making

277
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,000
JSON feeds or some sort of queryable feed available so people can programmatically generate

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
graphs.

279
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,080
That brings me to the infrastructure question.

280
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,560
All of this I'm on board with and in fact, like I said, it kind of seems like it should

281
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,540
have been done from day one.

282
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:53,920
The part that I take pause with is the backend implementation of storing this data and verifying

283
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,600
that it is being abstracted away from user identifiable information.

284
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
How is that being put together?

285
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,360
Because it seems like we're late in the 1804 game right now for that to be built, but I'm

286
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,160
only looking at it from the outside.

287
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,600
Sure.

288
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,840
So that backend infrastructure is not yet implemented.

289
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,280
In fact, right now we put this out on the Ubuntu Devel list that will post it to the

290
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,840
Ubuntu Devel list, which is where we discuss proposals such as this.

291
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,320
And if we started transmitting that information and just sent it to a dev null, nothing to

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:37,720
catch it just yet, that would be okay in that eventually we will have that infrastructure

293
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,000
in place and set up.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,940
Of course, we're based in Europe and have lots of users in Europe, and everybody knows

295
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,000
the GDPR requirements come into play this year.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,800
And so Canonical as a company, as a business, we're under the regulation of the EU and we're

297
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
taking this very seriously.

298
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,120
So there should be every bit of confidence here that this data will be dealt with as

299
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,200
anonymously as possible, and not just because we feel that we owe that to the free and open

300
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,480
source community, but also because it's EU law, frankly, at this point.

301
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Yeah, okay.

302
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,880
I mean, that, yeah, I completely forgot about the new rules coming into place and that does

303
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
make sense.

304
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,360
So my question then, I guess I go from that to, and I'm not sure if this is maybe a will

305
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,760
question or a Dustin question, but let's assume this all gets worked out, stuff gets built

306
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,840
in, the option in the installer is there where people can uncheck it.

307
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,560
How does it affect distributions that are based on Ubuntu that are maybe using the Ubiquity

308
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
installer?

309
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Sure.

310
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,180
So I will throw a spotlight on that first point.

311
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:01,480
This will be as easy to disable on any machine as clicking one box to uncheck and that disables

312
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,320
all diagnostic information.

313
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,660
So what we'll describe, there's basically three sets of information.

314
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:12,940
One is a set of pretty generic statistics about a machine, how many disks, how many

315
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,600
network cards, what sort of CPU.

316
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,600
What that enables us to do is to ensure that the Ubuntu experience is optimized for the

317
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,160
sort of moving target of what does the system hardware that Ubuntu is running on generally

318
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,080
look like, where are the outliers, where's the sort of center of gravity.

319
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,480
That bit of information is more or less a one shot, here's the hardware profile.

320
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,520
Can we underscore that for a second because that was something that wasn't totally clear

321
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,220
to me but because the way it's sort of worded in the email to the mailing list is it sort

322
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,540
of sounds like when I think of user collection metrics, I think of Windows 10 telemetry and

323
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,440
I think of almost constantly sending as I use my computer, sending back information

324
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,980
but with the exception of package installations, it's essentially a one shot data collection.

325
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,960
Is that accurate?

326
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
That's right.

327
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,760
So where'd this all come from was we were looking at the Ubuntu installer and we were

328
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,440
debating as to whether some of the installation options made sense anymore.

329
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,600
There was a checkbox at the very beginning which says automatically download updates

330
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,160
while installing, which I always check because sure, when I'm done installing, I want to

331
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,360
have all the updates and so I asked the team, hey, do people check that box or not?

332
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm curious, can we just get rid of that box and automatically download updates while installing

333
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
them?

334
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
And as it turns out, we don't know.

335
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,760
We don't know how many people check the box that says install the MP3, yes, I want MP3s

336
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,480
to work on my Ubuntu machine.

337
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,120
We actually don't know how many people opt to encrypt their hard disk.

338
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm really keen to hear from the elementary OS guys about their disk encryption plans

339
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,800
and sort of a place where I geek out about.

340
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,900
We didn't actually know and at that point, we started looking at just the installer and

341
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,560
being able to know what does the average Ubuntu user select as their base set of installation

342
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
options?

343
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,760
Are there some options we could just get rid of because they just don't make sense anymore?

344
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:16,560
And in doing so, we combined that effort with another set of questions we had around what

345
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,540
desktop apps are installed on the most Ubuntu machines as well as what are the buggiest

346
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,200
apps in the Ubuntu archive?

347
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,480
And we realized all of this really comes together in a general send diagnostics or don't option

348
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,320
that we see in every operating system, be it Windows or Android or Mac.

349
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,600
We'd like to do that tastefully and we will do that tastefully.

350
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,960
And I think the fact that we're offering to share that information publicly hopefully

351
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,520
makes it valuable to the average Ubuntu user.

352
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,320
The average Ubuntu user will see a better Ubuntu experience.

353
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Sure.

354
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,760
It just clearly gives you a better path to follow when you can see, oh, look at everybody

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
is installing Thunderbird.

356
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,780
It's just Thunderbird is getting removed from almost every system.

357
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,980
And I go back to something we covered this week in Linux Action News is 1804 is going

358
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,120
to feature a minimal install option which removes like 80 packages including Rhythmbox

359
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,960
and Thunderbird and a few others that I don't generally use.

360
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,040
And of course Canonical would have no way of knowing if anybody is using that unless

361
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,320
they turn something like this on.

362
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,760
And you can see what options people are doing during installation.

363
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,280
But Dustin, I just want to underscore and make it super crazy clear for everybody listening

364
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,480
because I think this is a really important point.

365
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,720
The only ongoing data collection if somebody checks this box is if an app crashes and it

366
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,000
will submit the crash in the background now.

367
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,160
If package states change and then those statistics will get submitted, that's the only ongoing

369
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
collection.

370
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
That's right.

371
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,600
So when a package crashes, AppOrt catches that crash and would send Canonical a crash

372
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
report.

373
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,560
And Will can talk about how we've used that, how that has helped identify some pretty major

374
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,360
breakages in Ubuntu and we've been able to stave that off early.

375
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,200
People who enable the proposed repository will start catching those packages if you

376
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
chose.

377
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,880
And then we cannot roll out that buggy fix to the masses of millions of Ubuntu users.

378
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
So yes, that would be ongoing.

379
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,840
The other one would be a periodic, and I don't know what the period is, I don't know if it's

380
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,720
daily or weekly, but think on the order of daily or weekly, anonymous submission of the

381
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,260
packages installed on the system.

382
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
So that's PopCon.

383
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,040
PopCon is what we're going to use, which has been in Debian for ages.

384
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,560
We've been using PopCon, but we suspect that the number of users who go out of their way

385
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,160
to enable PopCon on Ubuntu is probably less than 5%.

386
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,720
And so it's not very representative.

387
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,160
And you know who does enable it?

388
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,020
Geeks, like you and me.

389
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,200
Probably not the Ubuntu user at large who's never heard of PopCon.

390
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,480
So our statistical bias there is quite high.

391
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,080
So what do you know, Vim and Emacs are super high on the PopCon statistics list, meanwhile

392
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,880
VLC is relatively low.

393
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Who would have thought?

394
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Yeah.

395
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Hmm.

396
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,280
So to your point about using that data to catch stuff, Will, is that sort of, to Will

397
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,600
here, is that sort of, Dustin being polite and saying this is one of the reasons why

398
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,520
we're not shipping Whalen in 1804 is because of this data we've collected with the app

399
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
crashes?

400
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Yeah, absolutely.

401
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,440
If you go to errors.ubuntu.com, then you can see the sort of crash reports that we're getting

402
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
in there.

403
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,480
And you know, at the top of that list are the buggiest applications.

404
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
And that is what we look at every day.

405
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,120
And those are the bugs that we focus our efforts on.

406
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
So yeah, absolutely.

407
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,600
This is invaluable information for our team.

408
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Look at that big huge jump right there.

409
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Oh, Wayland.

410
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
That's great.

411
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Yeah, errors.

412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,560
I don't think I've ever actually looked at the graph there at errors.ubuntu.com.

413
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,840
That is pretty cool.

414
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,160
So what's next?

415
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:13,520
This is exactly errors.ubuntu.com is exactly the sort of information that we make public,

416
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
that we collect and we make public.

417
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,040
And I think this is, you know, we're not hiding what we're doing with this information.

418
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,200
We're trying to make Ubuntu better by studying graphs like this.

419
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,960
So this is obviously pretty important to get into 1804 because that's the next big one

420
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
that people are going to be using for five years.

421
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,640
So what's the next functional step?

422
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,680
You guys are collecting feedback, do you start actually like building out the code on the

423
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
client side?

424
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Do you start looking at mocking up ways for users to possibly disable this after install?

425
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah, the mockups are public in that same thread that Will started on Ubuntu Devel.

426
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,160
Canonical's lead UI UX designer, Matthew Paul Thomas, replied with a publicly visible Google

427
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,720
doc, which is the design doc for the overall Ubuntu installer.

428
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,680
It's 40 or 50 pages long.

429
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,760
But if you control F, search in there for diagnostics, you'll land somewhere in the

430
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
middle of that document.

431
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,160
You can see the rough mockups from our UI UX team as to what the wording will look like,

432
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,880
where it will fit into the flow of installing Ubuntu, and how it's enabled and disabled.

433
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,680
So I guess I just, I have, well, one piece of advice, if I could for a moment, if I could

434
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:30,000
be so brave, is to make it clear that if there's some way to keep it short, but make it clear

435
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,540
that it's not this crazy ongoing metric collection, I think that's what people are worried about.

436
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,960
But the question, I guess, that I think of from an end user perspective is, so say I

437
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,400
go buy a Dell Sputnik XPS 13, I would assume that Dell is probably going to turn this on

438
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,740
by default.

439
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,440
And I don't go through that installation process as an OEM customer.

440
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,580
What is going to be my opt out option in that scenario?

441
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,200
And how likely is that feature to ship?

442
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Will, you want to talk a little bit about how this will be enabled, disabled after the

443
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
fact in the system center?

444
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Sure, sure.

445
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:12,760
So yeah, you go to the GNOME control center, GNOME settings, and in there, there's a privacy

446
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,280
tab or option down the left hand side.

447
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,160
And in there are all the usual privacy stuff which exists today, and there will be some

448
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
extra buttons in there.

449
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,520
We're still working through the designs, as Dustin said, where we're working with design

450
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,600
on how granular we get at that point.

451
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,440
Do we allow people to individually toggle the Apple reporting and the popcorn results?

452
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,400
Or is that going to be confusing to the average Joe, and it should just be on or off?

453
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,560
These are decisions which need to be made.

454
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,880
But those settings will exist, they will exist on day one, and they'll be there to switch

455
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,560
on and off as you choose.

456
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Right.

457
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,360
So the Apple-based approach would be the binary, send statistics or not, keep it simple.

458
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,080
Just one thing, the slightly more Linux approach would be, well, let's actually dissect that.

459
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,000
Would you like to send crash reports, yes or no?

460
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,240
Would you like to send package information, yes or no?

461
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,520
Would you like to send hardware information, yes or no?

462
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,040
So I think we're going to work through that.

463
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,400
But as I said, we're soliciting feedback, and we're keen to hear from your users, your

464
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,480
listeners as well.

465
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
What's the most constructive way for them to get involved if they're fired up about

466
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,640
this, and they want to constructively contribute?

467
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,720
So let's point them to the Launchpad bug tracker.

468
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Okay.

469
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I do have one question.

470
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,560
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

471
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,040
So is there anything being done for de-averaging?

472
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,740
I just think about my personal use case, where I install Linux, and a lot of times it gets

473
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,520
to be Ubuntu, in a lot of old machines, that it's not the primary driver.

474
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
And of course, that will definitely skew the statistics saying, hey, we have a bunch of

475
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
old machines.

476
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,760
Yeah, people firing things up to try it out, things like that.

477
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I think that's super important information, actually.

478
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,440
I think it'll all come out as we start treating this data, millions of records, potentially.

479
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,720
I think it's super interesting if there are still people using Ubuntu and expect Ubuntu

480
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,840
to run on an ancient Dell netbook or something like that.

481
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,280
I think that's important.

482
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,640
The data will show 32-bit lives!

483
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,760
What I really wanted to know is if you can disclose what type of strategy and if that

484
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,640
information will also be released.

485
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,240
Because de-averaging is definitely one of the hardest things to do properly when you

486
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,040
have large data sets.

487
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,520
So I'm interested to hear that side, because for me, as a developer, I can go into that

488
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,520
list of information you're releasing, and I would be able to say, oh, so people are

489
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,520
building for these low-end computers, better not use these new fancy features.

490
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,520
But reality is, my target user base would still be on the fancy computer.

491
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:04,360
So the question is, to sort of pare this down, the question really is, will you publicly

492
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,440
be disclosing the math being used to average all this stuff out?

493
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Sure.

494
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
I don't see why not.

495
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:20,520
I predict no fewer than five master's thesis written in 2019 based on Ubuntu.com statistics.

496
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,480
Five thesis and 25 conspiracies, Dustin.

497
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,560
So producer Michael, I want to give you the last question, then we should probably move

498
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,640
on, because I think producer Michael has a good one.

499
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,340
Yeah, I was just wondering, the data itself is interesting, and the opt-out is something

500
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,540
I actually think is potentially beneficial in another way that might not be considered

501
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,860
in some people.

502
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,520
But I was wondering, if you have it so that someone has to opt-out, and they check it

503
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,400
to opt-out, would that information be sent to Canonical as well so that people would

504
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,240
know how many people opt-out versus continue?

505
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
One ping only.

506
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah, that's the proposal right now, that there's one ping that says opt-out or statistics

507
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
equals false.

508
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,980
Once again, we throw away the IP address and the location information.

509
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:14,040
But the simple ping of this user declined is important in understanding the statistical

510
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:21,760
validity and the statistical power, and those are statistics terms, of the data set, actually.

511
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,160
If you don't know how big the data set is, the data is only so useful.

512
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I agree.

513
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Yeah, I agree.

514
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,360
So let's start the ridiculous outrage right now.

515
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Canonical's even tracking me when I tell them not to track me.

516
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
There you go.

517
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
I said it first, so now you can make fun of anybody else who says it after me.

518
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
It's a spyware.

519
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,560
Guys, this is all fascinating.

520
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm really curious to see where this goes.

521
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,280
Is there any other points you wanted to get out there before we move on to some of our

522
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
other news?

523
00:28:51,280 --> 00:29:00,720
So I'm just curious, how much would this impact trying to get more OEMs to try to deploy Ubuntu

524
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
on their machines as an option?

525
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,320
Hmm, well we know until we see the data, that's really the thing.

526
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,240
Potentially it has a lot of potential because they actually would have data.

527
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,360
I've been around Canonical for over 10 years now, and in the early days it was trying to

528
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,800
convince Dell and Lenovo and others to take a chance on this crazy open source Linux distribution

529
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,500
at a time when Windows and Mac sort of dominated the market.

530
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,920
There was no Chrome OS, there was no Android, and it was super difficult to show the size

531
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,720
of the free and open source community.

532
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,660
I think if nothing else, even non-Ubuntu users hopefully can understand and appreciate that

533
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,520
this sort of information will help all open source projects make their case that, hey,

534
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,640
we do deserve, we, the open source community, do deserve a seat at the table at any OEM,

535
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,400
ODM discussion, and hardware enablement from your latest Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and graphics

536
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,080
adapter just working out of the box with Linux.

537
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,720
All of that has to happen upstream.

538
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,460
Someone has to pay for that development.

539
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,320
Some product manager somewhere has to make the case that there's enough Linux users out

540
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,800
there to make this justified exactly.

541
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah, that could be a huge contribution if you think about it.

542
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,040
That could really be a massive amount of data because one of the things that seems to be

543
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,580
definitely true just from an observational standpoint is nothing puts the stress on a

544
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,160
project like Ubuntu shipping it by default.

545
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,800
Once it starts, I mean, you can have, with all respect to the projects like Fedora and

546
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,160
others that will ship Wayland and ship the GNOME desktop for years and do a really good

547
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,840
job of getting that shipping, but there's nothing like Ubuntu shipping something by

548
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,800
default because it puts a whole nother category of stress on something.

549
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,080
And it's way more eyes, it's way more different flavors of users.

550
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
It's a totally different world.

551
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,480
And so if we could start to, as the community, get data from this huge distribution, massively

552
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
beneficial, even if you're not using Ubuntu.

553
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,920
And the fact that you guys are gonna make it clear and easy to uncheck the box, I just

554
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,280
really, I can't find anything to be super upset about this.

555
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
And I would love to.

556
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I love me a good ramp.

557
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
It'd be a great story.

558
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Yeah.

559
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
It sounds pretty solid.

560
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
So guys, thanks for coming on here.

561
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Will and Dustin.

562
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
I really appreciate hearing it from you directly.

563
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Thank you very much.

564
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,600
And I'll be keeping an eye on how this all goes and see what goes, where things, where

565
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
things develop.

566
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
What do you think, Wes?

567
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Yeah.

568
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,400
I think you're absolutely right and that we have this wonderful open source ecosystem.

569
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,800
And so it seems like there will only benefit any number of different projects.

570
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,800
It is the era of data and it's another way to contribute now.

571
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Yeah.

572
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
It is data.

573
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
And if it can be done in a tasteful way that doesn't like …

574
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Up front and …

575
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I like that the location stuff is country level too.

576
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,240
That makes me feel way better about it.

577
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
I like it.

578
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
All right.

579
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Well, we'll let you guys know though.

580
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,720
It'll be something we look at in our 1804 review.

581
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,200
So we'll know when it ships, whatever state it does ship.

582
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Let's keep going though.

583
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,840
We have so much more to get into.

584
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,800
I wanna take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring the program here.

585
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,120
Ting is pay for what you use mobile, a fair price for how much you talk, text and data

586
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,760
you use with nationwide coverage, no contracts, no sneaky agreements, anything weird like

587
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
that in there.

588
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,120
It's just simple pay for what you use.

589
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,920
I think I pay somewhere around 40 bucks, usually just below that for three lines.

590
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,760
Average Ting bill is $23 per phone.

591
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
I know.

592
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
And you know what, Wes?

593
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
It's their birthday.

594
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Is it?

595
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
It's happy birthday, Ting.

596
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
I know.

597
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
I know.

598
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,780
And to celebrate, they're giving away shirts because you get presents for Ting's birthday.

599
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
First 100 Ting customers.

600
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
I gotta get them.

601
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
That is.

602
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,640
I actually should ask Kyra who did their swag for that, because that is legit.

603
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,360
And I wouldn't mind getting that same person to do some swag for us.

604
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Koda Radio?

605
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Damn near 300 episodes.

606
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I gotta get some good...

607
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Whoa!

608
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
I gotta...

609
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
That's some legit swag.

610
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,200
So the first 100 customers at Ting get that.

611
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,960
I don't think I'm in the first 100, but I've been there for almost four years, so I gotta

612
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
be in the range.

613
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I don't know.

614
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,200
I wish I could be a Ting hipster.

615
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,760
Anyways, they're still giving away some, so maybe I could still get one and you can too.

616
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,120
If you go to the Ting blog, but start, do us a favor, start by going to linux.ting.com.

617
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,600
That'll take $25 off a device or $25 in credit if you bring a device.

618
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,300
They've got a great control panel, fantastic customer service, and tons of devices to choose

619
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,200
from.

620
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,180
And really, the best customer support ever, linux.ting.com.

621
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,760
Go follow them on the Twitters, too.

622
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,360
That's how I found out about their t-shirt giveaway, their Ting FTW on the Twitter, linux.ting.com.

623
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,120
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

624
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,000
Boom-da-boom, boom-da-boom, boom-da-boom.

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,680
I like the drums there, Wes.

626
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
You knew where I was going.

627
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I sure do.

628
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,920
Wes was air drumming while I did that.

629
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,840
Dude, that's almost worth putting a camera on you just for that.

630
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,200
All right, well, so you heard Dustin mention it there, and I teased it in the intro.

631
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,080
The Crazy Cats over at Pop!

632
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,340
OS in elementary got together and decided, you know what we need to do?

633
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:14,640
We need to collaborate on making it possible to ship encryption turned on by default on

634
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,200
future System76 machines running Pop!

635
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
OS and elementary OS installs.

636
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,260
So to tell us about this crazy work is Cassidy and Dan from elementary OS and slash System76

637
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,120
in Cassidy's case to tell us all about this.

638
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,840
So guys, where do you think we should start?

639
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,600
Cassy, should we start with you and tell us about the work, sort of the collab work between

640
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Pop!

641
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,840
OS and elementary on this here thing?

642
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Sure.

643
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Yeah.

644
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Okay.

645
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Okay.

646
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
So how did that kick off?

647
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,480
I mean, I know you are kind of, you're kind of in a good position there being involved

648
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,360
in both elementary OS and working for System76 as an employee, but that didn't necessarily

649
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,920
mean this had to come about.

650
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Right.

651
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,560
Well, obviously I'm a secret agent for elementary within System76.

652
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
It's a long play.

653
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
That's a long play, Cassy.

654
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
It's a long play.

655
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
No.

656
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:08,320
So, um, yeah, like I've been using, I had been using elementary OS at System76 for quite

657
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
some time.

658
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,000
Um, and you know, anytime you can collaborate with another project, it's a good idea to

659
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
think about it.

660
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

661
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah.

662
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,680
Really, especially if it's something like working on an installer together, that seems

663
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,680
to be like a solid sort of collection of resources and efforts.

664
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah.

665
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,320
And so we had, we've done a little bit of collaboration in the past with like app center.

666
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,960
So elementary developed app center and pop OS is using it as a pop shop, which is just

667
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,840
a really simple front end for the, uh, repositories.

668
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Okay.

669
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,480
But we decided, you know, elementary had designed this spec for an installer and we'd actually,

670
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
we'd been working on it for years.

671
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,880
Um, just kind of on as a back burner, like, Hey, someday when we get the resources to

672
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,920
do this, we should, this is what we want the experience to look like.

673
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah.

674
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Okay.

675
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,080
Um, and System76 when they kicked off pop OS, um, they were kind of thinking the same

676
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,560
thing like, Hey, we have a chance to really tailor the install experience.

677
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,520
You have the people's first touch of pop OS and System76, um, with an installer and they

678
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,320
looked at the elementary spec for our installer and they liked it.

679
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,240
And so we got together and hacked on it for a week.

680
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
Okay.

681
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Fair enough.

682
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
So we did that.

683
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,920
Uh, I forget when the first hack fest was, but that was, it was a few months ago.

684
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,100
We did a first like initial hack fest, went over the spec and, uh, went over the designs

685
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,000
that we had already designed.

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,640
Uh, we, we updated them.

687
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,320
The elementary guys worked on the front end and the, uh, System76 people worked on the

688
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,760
backend and it, it got off to a great start.

689
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,660
Um, I think we have an upcoming blog post about that.

690
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,680
That one's not published yet.

691
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,740
Um, but after working on that a bit, we decided to get back together and this was last month

692
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,400
to continue working on it and discuss, um, kind of where we are and what we want to do

693
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
next.

694
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Hmm.

695
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,200
And is that when the topic of encryption came up?

696
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Precisely.

697
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah.

698
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,160
So, um, a lot of System76 customers actually require full disk encryption.

699
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,800
So that's, you know, high security environments, some of the strictest security, uh, requirements,

700
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,320
uh, they have to have their entire disk encrypted and that's something you can't really do out

701
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,400
of the box well today.

702
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,640
Um, it requires you reinstall the OS.

703
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,240
So what we would have is we'd have customers who were getting the OS or getting, getting

704
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,240
System76 hardware, then downloading the OS and then having to flashing into a flash drive,

705
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,720
wiping their computer, reinstalling, and then probably forgetting to install the PPA and

706
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,520
it's, you know, it's like the purpose of, you know, out of the box experience out of

707
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
the box.

708
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Right.

709
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Yeah.

710
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Okay.

711
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
So it was really important to System76 to have encryption out of the box cause that's

712
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,000
a big requirement for a lot of our customers.

713
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Okay.

714
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,800
So we started thinking, you know, if we're working on this installer, we have an opportunity

715
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,120
to ship encryption out of the box.

716
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
And so that's what that blog post was about.

717
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:07,220
Um, and figuring out and really, you know what, when I, when I went through this, um,

718
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,180
what I realized Cassidy is that it is way more complicated than just checking a box

719
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
by default.

720
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:19,040
Like you have stuff in here about recovery partitions and essentially like escape hatches.

721
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,640
Can you talk, so what is that, what's the big, what's the big, what's the big problem

722
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
by turning this on by default?

723
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
Cause obviously if it was just checking a box, that probably would have been done five

724
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
years ago.

725
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Right.

726
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
So yeah, the biggest, I mean, there's kind of two things.

727
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,360
There's the technical implications and the UX implications.

728
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Sure.

729
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Yeah.

730
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,120
Um, the, the technical implications are that you can't ship a computer that's encrypted

731
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:49,040
out of the box, uh, and have that actually be acceptable because the OEM then has the

732
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
encryption key.

733
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Right.

734
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
And they probably generate it from some sort of standard image.

735
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,520
So if they have some sort of flaw in their process, it could become predictable.

736
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,480
I would imagine that's something to worry about too, is like you have to make sure you're

737
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,560
encrypting it in a way where the user owns the password.

738
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah.

739
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,040
And there can't be an opportunity for the OEM to get that password because then it's,

740
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,280
it's not as, you know, it's just useless and you have to reinstall it anyway.

741
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
How do you do that?

742
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,000
How do you do that when you're, when you're shipping it pre-built?

743
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,440
So we, uh, we started talking about this idea of a recovery partition and this is something

744
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
other OSs do.

745
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,000
Um, but it's where basically you have an install media as a small partition on the drive out

746
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
of the box.

747
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Um, and this gives you, you know, if you totally screw up your system and need to reinstall,

748
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,960
it means you can just reboot into the restore partition and reinstall without having to

749
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,420
go get a flash drive or anything.

750
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:46,040
And with that comes the ability to reinstall the OS as soon as you get it.

751
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,440
So you're, you could still technically be reinstalling the OS when you get it, but it

752
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,400
removes the need to go get a flash drive and download the OS again and everything.

753
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,960
So with our installer, the idea is you can, when you receive the computer, you open it

754
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,640
up and as far as, as far as the user is concerned, it says, you know, Hey, do you want to encrypt

755
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
your drive?

756
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,960
And you can say, yeah, sure.

757
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,520
That sounds great.

758
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,920
And what it's actually doing under the hood is reinstalling the entire OS.

759
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Wow.

760
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,800
But you don't realize it and then you reboot and you're off and you set up your user and

761
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
you're good to go.

762
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,680
So it's still pretty close to the old out of the box experience.

763
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,800
They don't have to go through all about the full installer.

764
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,680
They get boot started halfway through, but under the hood it's all still new.

765
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah.

766
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,880
And so this installer has a mode like it, so it has an OEM mode and then it must have

767
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,160
like a, like a, just a regular end user mode.

768
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,780
If I download the ISO and I installed Juno or pop OS, I get the installer that lets me

769
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,660
do it at the time of installation.

770
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,880
But then there's like, there's, there's been allowances made for the OEM to set it up.

771
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,800
And the settings at the OEM sets must translate through re-installation, I would assume.

772
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Yeah.

773
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,340
That's the idea is that we precede as much information as we can.

774
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,120
So if you know, if you choose a language or if you choose, you know, any settings that

775
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,000
you choose get restored back when you do the re-install.

776
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
New packages, different PPAs?

777
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,640
I'm not sure what all that is right now.

778
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,760
And is this going to be available in elementary OS as well as pop OS?

779
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
Uh, hopefully, eventually.

780
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,800
Good man.

781
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,880
You don't want to say for sure, cause it's all like future stuff.

782
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Yeah.

783
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,200
Our standard line is, you know, when it's ready.

784
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Yeah.

785
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,800
When it's, I see that actually, it's literally the ending line to the blog post.

786
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah.

787
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,520
So the goal would be to ship it in the next version of elementary OS and pop OS.

788
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,120
I think in both of those cases, we both, System76 and elementary have a backup plan of shipping

789
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,960
ubiquity as is, if, you know, things don't get done in time.

790
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,380
Because I think we're both aiming to release in April or as close to that as we can.

791
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,680
So you know, there's that a little bit of a time crunch and you've got to figure out

792
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,200
if it's worth shipping an entirely new and less tested installer or shipping the old

793
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
and...

794
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,320
Well, to that point, there must have been, I mean, there must have been some discussion

795
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,720
between the teams there where you're looking at the things you need to accomplish.

796
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,680
And I don't, because I wasn't there, the top three on my list installer wouldn't have been

797
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
there.

798
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
So why was installer number one?

799
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,960
Like, what was the background to say, we really got to address this problem?

800
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,240
And I'm particularly interested from the pop OS perspective, because to me, it seems like

801
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,480
the majority of the pop OS customers are going to experience the OEM install.

802
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,880
They're probably using pop OS pre-installed, but the installer was still a high priority.

803
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,080
So do you have any background on sort of that and kind of what the goal is there?

804
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,760
Sure.

805
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,120
With pop OS, I mean, it is definitely, it's made for system 76, like first and foremost,

806
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,300
but we definitely want it to be usable by anybody out there.

807
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,440
So installing, you know, the first experience you get when you're installing is still your

808
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,880
first experience with system 76, if you didn't buy a computer from system 76.

809
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,800
So when you buy a computer, you're getting it in, you're going to the website, you're

810
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,720
getting the packaging, you're opening it up, you're getting the first experience of the

811
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
hardware.

812
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
So you have a good first experience there.

813
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,780
But when you're installing pop OS, you know, on some other machine, your first experience

814
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,440
is really the installation.

815
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,640
So we wanted to make sure that no matter how you experience system 76, it's a good first

816
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
experience.

817
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Sure.

818
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,920
And if I go through that and I go, damn, that was pretty smooth, I might think, I wonder

819
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,720
what else they do that's smooth like that.

820
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Right, right.

821
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,920
It's, you know, the whole interaction is important.

822
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:31,560
And then even with the OEM installer, or even with the OEM installation, when you get it,

823
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,880
you still do go through that first setup right out of the box.

824
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,200
So you're still actually going through part of the installer process, especially with

825
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,160
the full disk encryption, that was really important that you would actually have to

826
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
go through an installer process.

827
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,560
It can't be a user setup if you're going to fully encrypt the disk.

828
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,960
So encryption by default, I think everybody in our audience is going to be pretty on board

829
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
with that.

830
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,920
A question from Noah that sometimes folks have issues when they're updating like Nvidia

831
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,240
binary drivers and whatnot.

832
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,280
Did you run into those issues and have to sort of test through that?

833
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,800
I mean, we're always doing constant testing on things.

834
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,400
We have a QA team that does that at system 76.

835
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,120
But it's kind of to the point where technically it works really well.

836
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,080
The people who know it doesn't work for them have an option to just not encrypt right out

837
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
of the box.

838
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,200
Sure, right.

839
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,880
But I think, you know, pushing it by default, it's secure by default, like that's protecting

840
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
user data by default is what you should be doing in today's day and age.

841
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,920
So I think it's important to get it out there by default.

842
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,420
And that also helps, you know, add a whole lot more testing in after we obviously test

843
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,920
it at system 76, that also adds a lot of testing out there in the real world if it's shipping

844
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
by default.

845
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,040
Yeah, I mean, when you think about it, laptops are becoming more and more the primary machine

846
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,680
for a lot of people doing work.

847
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,680
And so that's really where the use case is to encrypt your data.

848
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,840
Maybe if you have a desktop that's 75 pounds and sitting on your in your home office.

849
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
I don't know.

850
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,440
But for a laptop, like, you know, you you're always working on on your laptop.

851
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,700
And especially I can imagine you have many clients, you know, that's a absolutely many

852
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
standards required.

853
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
And good on you guys.

854
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,160
I think people are going to really like this.

855
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,360
And it's pretty cool to see the collaboration there, too.

856
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,280
It seems like a natural fit.

857
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:18,160
I'm waiting for the day when I can buy a system 76 machine in the currency of my choice with

858
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,520
elementary OS pre installed.

859
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
That is going to happen.

860
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
It's going to happen.

861
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,160
Of course, the currency of choice will see it's always changing.

862
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
But good stuff, guys.

863
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
I'm here.

864
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,560
I just want to add kudos to the elementary OS guys.

865
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,560
That's fantastic.

866
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,840
I've spent a lot of my career working on disk encryption and encryption in Ubuntu.

867
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,080
And I applaud you for the work and development that you've done here.

868
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
I think it's fantastic.

869
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,080
Yeah, thank you.

870
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
Yeah, I agree.

871
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,160
And it's going to be great to get more end users banging on this for everybody.

872
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
That's the thing.

873
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,560
Plus, as Linux users, we love to talk about how secure our operating system is.

874
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,920
But a lot of times it's far behind unless you know what you're doing.

875
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,440
So this is a great step in that direction.

876
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,240
And you know what else the takeaway story is?

877
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,760
The big story is the 1804 installer and distros that are based on 1804 and their installers

878
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,440
are about to get a lot more interesting in this next release cycle.

879
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,240
There's new things that are coming.

880
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,200
Just really quickly, too, while we're talking about new things that are coming.

881
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,960
Did you see Gnome Usage?

882
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,480
Gnome Usage and Gnome 3.28, speaking of 1804, and another distro shipping Gnome 328.

883
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,660
There's a new app in there.

884
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,240
It's called Gnome Usage.

885
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,100
It's sort of basic at this point.

886
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,560
It really kind of shows you two things.

887
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,400
It shows you your resources and your storage.

888
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
And that's...

889
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
What else is there?

890
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
That's kind of it.

891
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
And it's current.

892
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,760
It's real time like what's happening right now.

893
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,720
It's not like historical.

894
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,400
User usage, memory usage, network usage, and storage usage.

895
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,480
It actually looks decent, though.

896
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,600
It's something that's actually been in work for two years, as Joey points out over at

897
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,200
OMG Ubuntu, and it does not replace Gnome System Monitor.

898
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Don't worry.

899
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,080
Your beloved System Monitor is still there.

900
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,840
In fact, it's getting a couple of new features, including improved support for dark themes

901
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,840
in Gnome 328.

902
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,840
So there you go.

903
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,640
Even though I'm recording this on a plasma desktop, still giving you some Gnome updates,

904
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
right?

905
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,180
Hey, we can do that here.

906
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,880
We may have done the plasma challenge and found it to be...

907
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,680
Well, all of us except for Poppy.

908
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,600
Rumor has it Poppy moved off like some sort of vagabond.

909
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
Shut your filthy mouth.

910
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
No, I didn't.

911
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Oh, really?

912
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Oh.

913
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,200
I'm still using KDE Neon like a champ.

914
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
It's great.

915
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
In fact, I haven't even rebooted since I installed it.

916
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
No kidding.

917
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,080
I actually wouldn't have either, but we had a power outage over the weekend here at the

918
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
studio.

919
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,120
So a couple of my KDE machines did have to reboot.

920
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Okay.

921
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,120
All right.

922
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Well, there you go.

923
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
The rumors before the show were false.

924
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Yeah, there's been some false gossip.

925
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Wow.

926
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
I don't know if we've ever had...

927
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Sorry about that.

928
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,360
I don't know if we've ever had a challenge stick like this before.

929
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,800
You know, I'll say this too.

930
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,800
The other day, I had my machine up for a while and I went to go resize some windows and it

931
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,560
was still fast.

932
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:59,000
That sounds like a small thing, but it's all it takes to make me happy is that the fact

933
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,320
that I can resize windows and it's not super...

934
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
Responsive to the last.

935
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
You know what?

936
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
It has been.

937
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
And I really like it.

938
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Well, there you go.

939
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,560
A little update there and some new toys coming to the Gnome desktop in three, two, eight.

940
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,360
Lots of goodies coming down the...

941
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,040
Just a couple of weeks away, actually.

942
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,920
I was going to say, coming down the river.

943
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeah, this sounds like the future, but it's basically tomorrow.

944
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,280
It's like a few episodes out.

945
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Just a...

946
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
Boy, we have so much to get to.

947
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
I'm excited.

948
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,360
You know what else is just a few episodes out is scale.

949
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,600
Scale's coming up really soon too.

950
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,480
And then shortly after that, it's Linux Fest.

951
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Whoa.

952
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,280
Where will we find the time?

953
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,840
You sure you don't want to jump on Lady Joops and just come down to scale, Wes?

954
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,840
I mean, I'll put out the couch for you.

955
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Now that is very tempting.

956
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
You know what?

957
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,280
Take a little road trip in Lady Joops.

958
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,680
There's nothing like traveling in Joops down to California.

959
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,200
I'll tell you what, you know, you could keep Levi company.

960
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,160
I was going to say, if there's Levi involved.

961
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,160
All right.

962
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,880
Well, before we get into the rest of the community news, including that bogus Linux vulnerability,

963
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,080
OpenStreetMap woes, and my big announcement, let's talk about DigitalOcean, simplicity

964
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,360
at scale.

965
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,160
It's a platform you can spin up infrastructure on in seconds.

966
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,580
Everything is SSD based, and they just recently revamped the pricing.

967
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,560
And this just in from the back office here, Wes.

968
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
Big news.

969
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,200
Chris really blew it.

970
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,160
Wes was here when I got the note, which you can hear is a physical is actually so fresh

971
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
and clean.

972
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,000
It's a physical note.

973
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,280
And and I believe my exact words were, Oh, God, I am such an idiot.

974
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
That's exactly verbatim.

975
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,040
Yeah, I got an email here printed out for me.

976
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,520
If you guys go to if you're a new customer, you got to be a new DO customer.

977
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,640
Sorry, this is a new customer only thing.

978
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:39,520
If you go to do.co slash unplugged for 60 days, you can get $100 credit at DigitalOcean.

979
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
What?

980
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,100
Yeah, I usually say a $10 credit.

981
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,280
They update a little bit for because they've just recently rolled out a whole bunch of

982
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,320
new features.

983
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,000
They've made their pricing even more competitive.

984
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,160
And they have new flexible droplets at $15 a month.

985
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,440
You can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application.

986
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,780
They have their big memory and CPU optimized droplets and of course, my favorite the three

987
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,600
cents an hour just got all the droplets got better.

988
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,680
If you if you've been listening to the show for a while and you built a machine on DigitalOcean,

989
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
go upgrade it.

990
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
You just have to shut it down.

991
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,680
Do the upgrade thing.

992
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,080
And the reason why you have to shut it down is because they'll even re expand your file

993
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,080
system.

994
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,040
I mean, like it's the full, full upgrade.

995
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
It's so great.

996
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,240
$100 credit though.

997
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,720
They've had this offer out here for a couple of weeks and I forgot to tell the audience

998
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,440
because I didn't read that paragraph.

999
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,440
So go get on it.

1000
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Get set up.

1001
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Yeah.

1002
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,440
Experience the joy.

1003
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,440
And now we sit around going, why is nobody taking advantage of a $100 offer?

1004
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
We don't do that very often, ever.

1005
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So I'm just an idiot.

1006
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,840
Anyway, so you go to do.co slash unplug to get the $100 credit and you can try out something

1007
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,160
over there for whatever you want.

1008
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,520
I mean, go build a splurge, enjoy yourself.

1009
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
You want to build a GitLab?

1010
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,160
You want to go build the next cloud instance?

1011
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,400
You want to try out something?

1012
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Just do it.

1013
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,520
DigitalOcean.com and they also have a ton of really good documentation.

1014
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,480
You hear us mention the Arch Wiki all the time.

1015
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,640
I would say only number two to the Arch Wiki, the only number two to Arch Wiki these days

1016
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,200
is DigitalOcean's documentation.

1017
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,880
Only because they're paying people to contribute and so that's good quality stuff and it's

1018
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,960
really well structured and they have like a style guide and all that stuff and it makes

1019
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,080
it really easy to read and follow.

1020
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,580
And that's just one of the perks of being a DigitalOcean customer.

1021
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:20,080
That's why Docker and Slack and Jupiter Broadcasting and many others are DigitalOcean customers.

1022
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:28,520
DigitalOcean.com, go use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED or DO.CO slash unplugged and hopefully you

1023
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,640
still have time because it was a limited time offer and I forgot to tell you guys for a

1024
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,440
couple of weeks because I speed read.

1025
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,880
You know how sometimes I mispronounce stuff?

1026
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah, it affects all things of life, including giving you a $100 offer.

1027
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
I apologize.

1028
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,040
Go to DO.CO slash unplugged and get a $100 DigitalOcean credit.

1029
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,400
I can't even believe I'm saying those words out loud.

1030
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
$100 DigitalOcean credit.

1031
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,200
I wish I was a new customer, except then I wouldn't have been enjoying DigitalOcean's

1032
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
all the awesome things.

1033
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
You've got multiple email addresses.

1034
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
Come on.

1035
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,960
All right, so let's just really quickly talk about this bogus Linux vulnerability.

1036
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,560
It's got Steven J. Vanhoch Nicholas really fired up and it takes a lot to get him fired

1037
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
up these days.

1038
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,400
So GoSecure, a company that's trying to make a name for itself, has claimed and discovered

1039
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,280
Chaos, a stolen backdoor rising again.

1040
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,280
That's their title for it.

1041
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:21,040
It's a pretty good name, actually, and here's sort of the dirty secret of this horrible

1042
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,480
vulnerability called Chaos that GoSecure has discovered.

1043
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,480
It just simply brute forces an SSH login.

1044
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,480
So you just basically get compromised if you have a bad password.

1045
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,300
If you've got a good password, it's not taking advantage of any zero-day exploits.

1046
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,680
It's not using some sort of side-channel timing attack to read the memory and parse together

1047
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,980
your password.

1048
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,720
It's just simply using a password database.

1049
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,200
Or just use keys.

1050
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,880
Yeah, I know, right?

1051
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,280
It's just in from 2006.

1052
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,280
Once your system's already been spread wide open because you used a bad password, then

1053
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,280
things tend to go wrong.

1054
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:06,120
It opens up TCP port 8338, which is accepting raw socket connections.

1055
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,960
And then once it has a bad password and it gets on there, if... Oh, I should mention,

1056
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,520
it can only open up port 8338, by the way, if it has root access, because it's Linux,

1057
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,420
which means you also have a weak root password.

1058
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,200
So if you have a weak user password and a weak root password, then it can get on there

1059
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,420
and cause some problems.

1060
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,760
And it's called Chaos, and it's getting a lot of print this week.

1061
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:35,600
So if you hear people talking about a new Linux vulnerability called Chaos, don't worry.

1062
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,640
Just make sure you have a good password.

1063
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,640
Or use keys like...

1064
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,160
I would suggest password123, just set that as root enable, root login over SSH.

1065
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
You'll be fine.

1066
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
All right.

1067
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,720
I don't want to get too down about this, but I actually kind of... I kind of want the

1068
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,980
mumble rooms take on this, because it seems like it's a problem for anything that wants

1069
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,480
to take on Google or Apple or what Amazon or Microsoft is doing.

1070
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,440
And I'm talking about OpenStreetMaps.

1071
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,200
It's a pretty great product, and I really like the way it displays information.

1072
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,400
I kind of prefer... When I'm looking at certain areas, I was checking out Pasadena recently

1073
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,560
trying to figure out if I could bark LadyJupes anywhere down there, and I just found the

1074
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,280
labeling system better and more accurate.

1075
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Not accurate.

1076
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,800
I don't know.

1077
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,640
It's more useful, but it's missing data that it would be nice to have in certain...

1078
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,640
Yeah.

1079
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,640
There are some cases.

1080
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,000
It's got some data that other things don't have, but then it's missing a bunch of... Yeah.

1081
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah.

1082
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Okay.

1083
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Thank you.

1084
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,600
One of my friends, a computer, wrote up an article about some of the problems that he

1085
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,880
sees with OpenStreetMap, and he's a big fan of OpenStreetMap, so this isn't like a takedown

1086
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
piece.

1087
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,720
It's him being concerned about it.

1088
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,740
And he talks about unclear usage policies, about how they sort of discourage the use

1089
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,520
of the free map, but then if you ask for it, they'll let you, but then if you use more

1090
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,100
than 5% of their bandwidth, they'll shut it down.

1091
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,820
They really want you to use their data to generate your own map, and then there's things

1092
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:03,060
in the back end, like the geocoder that figures out different areas and helps you search is

1093
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,720
really bad and it's way out of date.

1094
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,080
It expects very clear syntax, like an exact address, and you can't say things like bagel

1095
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,520
places downtown Seattle.

1096
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,160
And then the killer one is there's no moderation or review model, which, as you could probably

1097
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,880
imagine for something like OpenStreetMap...

1098
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
It could be difficult.

1099
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
Yeah.

1100
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:29,680
Introduces a lot of problems throughout the entire system, including vandalism, bot abuse,

1101
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,880
all sorts of things.

1102
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,600
And then, of course, getting the data is hard.

1103
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,080
It almost... When you read this, it feels like that the author tries to wrap it up on

1104
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,600
a positive note and says, these are all warning signs, and if we take immediate action, maybe

1105
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,020
we can save the day.

1106
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,080
He calls them roadblocks.

1107
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:52,620
Boy, when I read this, I read this as OpenStreetMaps is screwed.

1108
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,560
It seems impossible this day and age.

1109
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,640
The data that you need, the proprietary information, the fact that once you build something like

1110
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,800
this, people come and vandalize it.

1111
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,560
Can OpenSource do this?

1112
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,000
Is this just something that OpenSource can't do?

1113
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
How do we do imaging?

1114
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
How do we do earth imaging?

1115
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Well, go ahead, Whippy.

1116
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Wasn't it Whippy?

1117
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Oh, whoever it was.

1118
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Go ahead.

1119
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,480
So OpenStreetMap has been around for a long time.

1120
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,160
I remember interviewing someone from the project many years ago on the Ubuntu podcast when

1121
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,240
we had little mapping parties because there were just great swathes of emptiness around

1122
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,120
our towns and cities in the UK.

1123
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,760
They were talking about, maybe by the end of the year, we'll have all of the UK mapped

1124
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,040
and there were entire continents that hadn't been mapped yet.

1125
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,000
But people came together and they worked together and they fixed those problems.

1126
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,640
A lot of these are, you need more bodies.

1127
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,200
They need to recruit more people to help moderate the submissions that are happening.

1128
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,200
I fixed things.

1129
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,440
There was a road that was wrong near me and I just logged in, tried to remember what my

1130
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,720
password was, fixed the road, done, and that's fixed for everyone forever who's using that

1131
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,000
map.

1132
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,360
I think they need a bit more of a recruitment drive to get more people involved in using

1133
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,360
it.

1134
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,960
They need to make the tools easier to use for sure because it is a little bit janky

1135
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,640
to do this and have some incentive for people to moderate these things and make it easier

1136
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,080
for people to get access to the data.

1137
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:22,240
If they can solve all those, those are mostly technical but also getting more people involved.

1138
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
I think they're fine.

1139
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,280
I'm more of a glass half full and I know you're quite a glass half empty kind of guy.

1140
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,920
But I think this is solvable.

1141
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,920
All of this is solvable.

1142
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,880
I certainly hope so.

1143
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,640
I tend to think that more bodies on the problem is only a part of the issue.

1144
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:48,200
I think some of this is like technology because you think about it, it's a data issue and

1145
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,360
the more Google is at a point now where they have millions of Android devices that are

1146
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,920
using Google Maps constantly setting real time feedback to Google Maps.

1147
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,400
How do you ever come close to anything like that?

1148
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,920
You know what I mean?

1149
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,000
They talk about their geocoder in here is sort of out of date and I guess you could

1150
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
somehow, maybe somebody could donate a new geocoder, maybe Nokia could come along or

1151
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
something like that.

1152
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,200
I think that makes it very...

1153
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,120
My takeaway from a lot of this is that they need to be clear about what they're trying

1154
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,480
to do and not do because it can be hard.

1155
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,280
Maybe that's something they can't do but they can still be really valuable as an open database

1156
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,600
for all these things even if it's not going to be GMaps level interface.

1157
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,480
I mean, technically, they can just use Google Maps data anyway because Google doesn't own

1158
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,320
the concept of the data that they collect data around usage, that stuff is they own

1159
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,680
but they can't own the map itself.

1160
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,480
They don't provide access to the data so the open street map guys can't just poke at Google

1161
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,240
and get the data out and they get a cease and desist because some of the data isn't

1162
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
theirs anyway.

1163
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,920
It's licensed from third parties but other people have tried to do, in the same way that

1164
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,560
Android devices crowd source a lot of the location and traffic data and so on, other

1165
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
people have tried this.

1166
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
Mozilla tried this.

1167
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,920
They had a thing that was baked into Firefox OS and actually you could optionally, I think

1168
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,160
it was called Mozilla Stumbler, you could install on your phone and just leave it running

1169
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,800
in the background and it would just constantly send updates about where Wi-Fi access points

1170
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,840
were and try and locate where you were so they can put all these dots on the map and

1171
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,420
show where roads are and all that kind of stuff.

1172
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,040
It's possible but you need a critical mass of people who are going to do it and obviously

1173
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,760
Google with a critical mass of billions of devices are already way out ahead.

1174
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,400
I wonder if it isn't a bit of a…

1175
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,320
And they also do one thing that I don't know of any voluntary organization or anybody

1176
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,920
else doing.

1177
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,360
They actually go to governments and ask for maps because governments have dense maps,

1178
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:57,440
infrastructure, detailed, just the data that governments need for defense.

1179
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,440
They have it.

1180
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,440
All right, fair enough.

1181
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,440
It's usually public.

1182
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,080
But hopefully, I think that overall, if it's not going to help as much in terms of maps

1183
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:13,680
but in other things, the new GDPR ruling actually goes and says that you as a citizen or as

1184
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:19,560
a customer have the right to ask for the data that is about you but that essentially could

1185
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:25,160
make it easier to compete by you having the ability to export all of your data and importing

1186
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
a second service.

1187
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,260
To Dan's point, like the hours that places are busy, if you could even get a thousand

1188
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,480
users to export their hours when they go to stores and import that, that would be useful.

1189
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,360
If you could even just get a small fraction…

1190
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:44,520
You just have to be able to get that enabled but enough because they've got it by default.

1191
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,520
Yeah.

1192
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:52,200
It still feels a bit like the Spotify problem in that Spotify is attempting to monetize

1193
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:58,360
music streaming when Google, Apple, and Amazon can just do music streaming as part of their

1194
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,800
overall offering.

1195
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,000
And if it costs them to do music streaming, it doesn't matter because they're selling

1196
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,480
you the block into the platform.

1197
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,320
And I wonder if that is the same with maps.

1198
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,760
It is so expensive and it requires so much overhead to keep good competitive maps that

1199
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,720
perhaps it's the vendors that have a platform incentive to have mapping like Google, Apple,

1200
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,680
et cetera, that will be the best at it.

1201
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,640
And I mean, I hate to keep…

1202
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,720
I hate to say this but maybe it's just not our…

1203
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
Maybe it's not our bag.

1204
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,440
Go ahead, JJ.

1205
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:40,120
So I would say like for those who don't want to be dependent on Google services, just those

1206
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,160
who root in ROM their devices, they would probably see more incentive into seeing these

1207
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
open map platforms.

1208
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Yes.

1209
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
And also…

1210
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
But is that enough?

1211
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,160
Is that enough, JJ?

1212
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Is that enough?

1213
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,160
Because I'll give you an example.

1214
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,220
I would like to have an open street map that I could go to where I could get really good

1215
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,760
like super specific information about cellular signal.

1216
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,760
So I knew where I could go to get really good data signal.

1217
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,080
I would like to know where cops often hang out at so I could mark that on a map.

1218
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,200
That's something I think that would be extremely useful.

1219
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,960
And just for me personally, I'd also like to know where I could park for 24 hours without

1220
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,960
getting towed.

1221
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,160
And I'd like to mark that up on a map.

1222
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,800
And I don't think Google is ever going to do any of that.

1223
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,840
I mean, you're partially describing ways there.

1224
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,560
Which is owned by Google now.

1225
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Yeah.

1226
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,560
But still, it's…

1227
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,040
But there's still demand for those who want to be free from Google services such as yourself

1228
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,400
trying to go away from Google Photos.

1229
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:41,400
There are plenty of people who've built things on top of open street maps like building…

1230
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,200
Whether it's making access to data about, like you say, where's parking.

1231
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,720
There are people who've built cycle maps.

1232
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,760
There are people who've built canal maps in the UK so you know where the canals are.

1233
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,320
And it wouldn't take a lot for someone to build on top.

1234
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:01,120
But as you've mentioned, it's difficult getting access to that map data without rebuilding

1235
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,240
all the tiles yourself or licensing their API.

1236
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,120
So that is a difficult problem.

1237
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,440
So I have a question.

1238
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,440
Yeah, go ahead.

1239
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,880
Would you guys be willing to pay a bounty per se, right?

1240
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,480
So you would introduce into the platform a bounty that says, I would like this such region

1241
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,520
to be mapped, you know, and this bounty coverage a few kilometers, whatever, right?

1242
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,640
And ultimately, then there's people that could attempt to actually map out that thing by

1243
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,280
trying to get the winning of that bounty.

1244
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,600
And that's a fascinating idea.

1245
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
That is a really…

1246
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,720
As long as you have the moderation to prevent abuse of people just going out and wandering

1247
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,280
outside their house for 10 minutes or strapping a phone to a dog and letting it loose in a

1248
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,280
field.

1249
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,320
What you do is you build an AR game, right?

1250
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,760
Yeah, exactly.

1251
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,120
I kind of have the sense that maybe I should try to reach out to some folks at the Open

1252
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,920
Street Map Project and get their take on this too, because this is Sergey's take, right?

1253
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,080
And so I'd like to get their take and see where they…

1254
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:08,120
So if time allows or if anybody out there has a connection, let me know on Telegram

1255
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,120
or Twitter.

1256
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,840
I'd be more than happy to chat with somebody from the project and get their take on it

1257
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,920
and see where they're going with this.

1258
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,840
Because like Popeye was saying, there is so many great just esoteric uses that people

1259
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,120
have built on top of Open Street Maps, it is worth it just for that to continue.

1260
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:28,540
I mean, I have my crazy reasons, but there's also really good reasons like biking and hiking

1261
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,540
and others.

1262
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,640
So I would love to talk to somebody there because this is one of those projects where

1263
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,380
if there was anything I could do, I'd pay a bounty if there is anything I could do.

1264
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,920
If I could run an app on my Android phone while I drive Lady Jups around the country

1265
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,240
to help improve their maps, I'd be more than happy to do it.

1266
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,760
So if you have anybody out there, if you're listening to this show and you know anybody

1267
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,480
out there that maybe I should talk to, I'd love it if you could help make the connection.

1268
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,840
Because jeez, if I just don't prefer the way they render the maps, I just prefer reading

1269
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Open Street Maps than I do Google Maps.

1270
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,560
Not that there's really anything super wrong with Google Maps, I just prefer the way they

1271
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,560
look.

1272
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,560
They do look really nice.

1273
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,560
Yeah.

1274
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,560
I like them too.

1275
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,040
So you hate to see something like that fade away and it makes you wonder like what other

1276
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
things?

1277
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,200
Like what if one day we all got off our arses and decided we wanted to have an open source

1278
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,200
music streaming service?

1279
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Could we do it?

1280
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,200
Impossible.

1281
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,180
What if we wanted to have like a peer-to-peer video streaming service to take on YouTube?

1282
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,440
Could we do it?

1283
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,040
I'm not convinced we could pull it off.

1284
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,560
But Open Street Map is one of those things where we already have a beachhead.

1285
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,560
You know, we're-

1286
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,540
There's a bunch of data plugged in there.

1287
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,800
We already have momentum.

1288
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,920
So if there's anything we could do as a community to come together-

1289
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,920
Let's not lose that.

1290
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,920
Yeah.

1291
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Let's keep it going.

1292
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,920
Let's keep that rolling.

1293
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,200
And I'd love to talk to somebody over there about that.

1294
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,320
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1295
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,920
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support this here show.

1296
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,100
It's everything you need to learn more about Linux.

1297
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:59,080
When I was first starting in IT because IT is like dog years, I don't know if you thought

1298
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,340
about this, but I was recently thinking it's kind of like dog years.

1299
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:07,720
Like 10 years in IT is like 25 years in the banking field.

1300
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:15,200
And one of the things that's so crazy about, because I'm just past my mid thirties now,

1301
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:22,060
so it's not like I'm super old, but it is nuts to my face.

1302
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:28,040
It is nuts to my face that when I first got into IT, the way we would look stuff up, I'm

1303
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,600
a hundred percent honest with you here, is about once a month a couple of us from the

1304
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,680
department would get together in somebody's car and we'd go out to lunch.

1305
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:43,240
And then after lunch, when we're full and may or may not have had a beer in us, we would

1306
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:49,080
go to the bookstore and we would buy a book, a couple of books each.

1307
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:54,640
And then we would bring these books back and we would stack them on the shelf and we would

1308
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,160
never use them unless we were really desperate.

1309
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,320
Plus you probably got grease on them from the fries from lunch.

1310
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,640
You know me too well, Wes.

1311
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:11,520
I couldn't even imagine a resource like Linux Academy and it would have at best been some

1312
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,520
sort of half-assed feature that gets added on to some other training platform.

1313
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,720
So you know, somewhere for corporate training or learning about active directory management

1314
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,840
or how to fix your sync and then they would have thrown on a few Linux courses.

1315
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Go learn some more, Chris.

1316
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,860
We'll pay you some money to go do that.

1317
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,560
And that would have been it.

1318
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:38,480
Later on in my career, what I did have some access to was community college training courses

1319
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,320
that would be taught off of campus or on campus, depending on the course, that were about Linux,

1320
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,680
but they weren't really about the career track that I was on, but they were just checking

1321
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,680
the box.

1322
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,760
My employer wanted me to have continued education.

1323
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,600
We were deploying Linux servers.

1324
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,840
I needed to do something and they wanted results.

1325
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:05,520
So I went and took basic Linux courses like Linux Plus and Introductions to Linux.

1326
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,960
Meanwhile I'm sitting there setting up Linux firewalls and Samba servers.

1327
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,640
It just didn't match.

1328
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,020
That's where Linux Academy completely changes the game, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1329
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,560
You sign up for a free seven-day trial.

1330
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,240
It's everything you need to learn about any category of Linux from the basics all the

1331
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,820
way up to the high level stuff like Azure, AWS, OpenStack, all of that.

1332
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:30,320
They have courses that are also created specifically to help you get certifications if that's the

1333
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,500
route you want to go.

1334
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,120
They have self-paced in-depth video courses and they have virtual labs they spin up on

1335
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:40,200
demand and if you ever get stuck, they have a real human being that can help you.

1336
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,920
It's completely different than anything that I saw many years ago and it's the kind of

1337
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,580
tool that's come along now.

1338
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:50,160
Now that Linux has enjoyed some success in the marketplace, somebody had to come along

1339
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,760
and create this and I'm so thankful it's Linux Academy because it's created by Linux enthusiasts,

1340
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,520
educators, and developers that came together to build the Linux Academy platform and you

1341
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:07,520
can try it out seven days for free at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1342
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,600
So you know, I'm going to get into an announcement here, but I just wanted to do an infernal

1343
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,380
poll with the mumble room.

1344
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:21,440
If we were going to make a decision today, guys, would you say go back to IRC or stick

1345
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,440
with Discord?

1346
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,640
It's not related to my announcement at all, but it's something we were talking about,

1347
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Wes and I, in the pre-show.

1348
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Now that we've been-

1349
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,640
Can I cast the first vote?

1350
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,200
Yeah, go ahead.

1351
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,800
I vote IRC.

1352
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,800
Go back to IRC.

1353
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,240
Yeah, and I think I can back that up pretty well.

1354
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,240
All right, okay.

1355
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,240
Let's hear it.

1356
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,240
Let's hear it, Mr. Noel.

1357
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,280
What is it?

1358
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:44,600
So I think anytime you look at a community, you have to look at the lowest common denominator

1359
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,160
to which the community can centralize around and I think in the Linux community, the open

1360
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,840
source world, Red Hat organizes their community on IRC and sure there are people that are

1361
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,480
organizing on Discord and Telegram.

1362
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,280
We've seen when we go to these events, a lot of the abundant people are organizing on Telegram.

1363
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,040
So certainly there are other platforms in use, but the lowest common denominator, the

1364
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:10,000
one thing that exists in basically every Linux company and every open source community is

1365
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,140
IRC.

1366
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,720
And I think that there are some, from a production standpoint, we're tempted to play with some

1367
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,320
of the new toys because it looks better on screen, there's more animation.

1368
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,480
But I think that that direct community engagement is something that is so valuable, it's worth

1369
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,920
giving up anything potentially else just to have that.

1370
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,360
All right, so I agree with everything you said.

1371
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,360
I'll give you the counter argument.

1372
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,400
Discord is born in a mobile era.

1373
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,080
You can use Discord in your web browser, you can use Discord on a Windows box, Mac box,

1374
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,480
Linux box, you can use Discord on a phone.

1375
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:47,600
Discord is born of a Slack era where you have contextual rich chat with URL previews, image

1376
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,400
previews, emoticons, voice chat integrated.

1377
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:58,760
It's how IRC would be designed today if it had access to all of that feature set.

1378
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,760
I would agree.

1379
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,760
I have all of that.

1380
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,760
I have all of that.

1381
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,760
I have all of that.

1382
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
Go ahead, Poppy.

1383
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,960
Mine is voice chat.

1384
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,280
I have everything you just said in IRC.

1385
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,160
I thought you would be the Discord guy.

1386
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Are you serious right now?

1387
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,160
I was going to send to you to defend Discord.

1388
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,160
If you have the IRC cloud app on your phone, it's in sync with the IRC cloud up on your

1389
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,400
desktop.

1390
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,840
The only thing missing from the list that you just gave is voice chat.

1391
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,840
So what do you think?

1392
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,640
Do you think we should go back to IRC for Jupiter broadcasting?

1393
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,640
I think you should use Slack.

1394
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,160
I would also just piggyback onto that and say that the vast, is there anyone that exists

1395
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,160
in the Discord?

1396
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:46,720
Is there anyone that's in that community that doesn't already set up an IRC system?

1397
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,760
I think a lot of those people, a lot of people I see in the Discord, they're the same people

1398
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,080
that are in IRC.

1399
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,360
So they've already set that up.

1400
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,680
And yes, I would agree with the gentleman who said that it's a little more difficult

1401
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,600
to set up on the phone, and I'm using Quossel, and that also is very simple to set up on

1402
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
the phone.

1403
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
Okay.

1404
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,560
I'd like to hear from Wimpy and Rotten.

1405
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,600
Wimpy, if you're available, just because you've been a longtime observer of JB, you've sat

1406
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,360
back, you have some distance from this.

1407
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,280
I'd kind of like to hear your thoughts if you're there.

1408
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:25,400
So I'm in the Discord and IRC, but I pay more attention to IRC because the IRC chat is easier

1409
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,720
to engage with than Discord chat.

1410
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,040
Whenever I go to Discord, there's pages and pages and pages of irrelevant stuff, and I

1411
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,160
can drop in and out of IRC.

1412
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,300
And as Popey says, I use IRC Cloud as well.

1413
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,640
So what I have on my desktop and my mobile phone is the same.

1414
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,200
If anyone tags me in any of the channels I'm subscribed to, I get notifications on my phone.

1415
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
All right.

1416
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Okay.

1417
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
I can't argue with any of that either.

1418
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Producer Michael, I wanted to give you...

1419
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,200
Oh, Wes, did you want to say something?

1420
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,160
I was just saying, does IRC Cloud have a free plan?

1421
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,720
I think so.

1422
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,720
Yes.

1423
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,720
I am also an IRC user.

1424
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,520
I would be curious with the opposite number.

1425
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,840
I like the comparison idea, but I wonder too how many people have set up IRC just for JB

1426
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,000
but already have Discord from other things.

1427
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,400
That is a great point.

1428
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
Okay.

1429
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,720
Producer Michael, I wanted to give you a chance, and then maybe I'll come back to you.

1430
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,720
They both have problems.

1431
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,520
Discord and IRC both have problems.

1432
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,800
I mitigate the problems with IRC in the same way, but not with IRC Cloud.

1433
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,800
I use Matrix and Riot.im.

1434
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Oh, man.

1435
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,480
You fancy bear.

1436
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,680
You can use Riot.im without actually setting up your own server as well.

1437
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,480
You can just use the Matrix.org stuff.

1438
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,640
So you are kind of in a roundabout way saying IRC, and if you want the fancy features, there's

1439
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,920
ways to get that.

1440
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:45,320
Well, I mean, in the sense of doing the displays and the previews, as far as the communication

1441
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:51,600
aspect, IRC is easier, because a lot of people will say it's harder to set up, but if you're

1442
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,800
just brand new to it, you can just go to a Kiwi IRC or something like that where you

1443
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,360
just link to someone directly to a thing and they're instantly in the chat.

1444
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,160
There's ways to do that where you cannot do that in Discord, and then there's other ways

1445
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,380
in, like, if you don't have a Discord account, you can't go to a Discord server, so there

1446
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:16,980
are aspects that, like, the only thing I would say is the previews and the log is not available

1447
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,980
directly in IRC.

1448
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:23,360
You'd have to use some way to mitigate that, such as, like, Matrix or IRC Cloud.

1449
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,360
Okay.

1450
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,160
I am going somewhere with all of this.

1451
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,920
This isn't just looking at our navel gazes.

1452
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,280
Was that the same navel gaze in here?

1453
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,320
I am actually, I am going somewhere with this, but Wimpy, I know you were jumping in there

1454
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,840
for a second, so I want to go back to you.

1455
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,040
No, Michael's touched on all of those points, really.

1456
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:48,980
I've got nothing extra to add, other than the fact I recently re-added the Jupiter Broadcasting

1457
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:56,720
Channel to my IRC Cloud configuration because I can't submit show title suggestions through

1458
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,720
Discord.

1459
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,720
Right.

1460
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,720
Yeah.

1461
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,120
So I'm going to, you know what I'll do is I'll put a poll out there.

1462
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,640
It's embedded in the show notes if you want to vote because there's lots of people that

1463
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:12,180
can't make it live that have a position on this that maybe sometimes can that could vote.

1464
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:17,780
What brought this up was the discussion that I was having behind the scenes with Wes just

1465
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:25,920
today about, hey, what if for a hot moment we wanted to see if we could dynamically generate

1466
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,620
a live stream video feed on a droplet?

1467
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:34,840
What I mean by that, instead of using OBS here in the studio to capture the chat room,

1468
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:41,080
we had a droplet that was headless that was monitoring a chat room and generating a video

1469
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,880
feed and streaming that to Scale Engine.

1470
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:49,260
So I could just connect in with an audio feed from wherever I'm at and the droplet would

1471
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:53,400
actually generate the chat room and the lower third and all of that.

1472
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,520
And as that conversation progressed, we realized, well, damn, that's a lot harder when you're

1473
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,500
using Discord than it is if you're using IRC.

1474
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,640
And especially when it just comes down to stupid things like we have disparate rooms

1475
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,720
in Discord for the different shows, which is nice because then it's very focused.

1476
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,200
But at the same time, like how do you programmatically plan for that?

1477
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,120
Like how do you switch rooms and capture just that and what if the Discord API changes and

1478
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,940
what kind of information can we get versus an IRC room where everything's just in one

1479
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:28,080
room and it's text, which is a lot easier to work with server side.

1480
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,000
And so then I thought, well, you know, before we go kill ourselves, like what is the interest

1481
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
here?

1482
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,080
Right now, there's only been 19 votes by the live stream.

1483
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:46,960
If you want to vote, strawpoll.me slash 1-5-1-1-5-4-9-6, 68% are voting to go back to IRC.

1484
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:53,560
And I wouldn't shut down Discord, but we would just wait for the live stream focus.

1485
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,240
What's up on the live stream?

1486
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,240
What do we switch back to?

1487
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,400
How does that play into how title stuff is generated?

1488
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,160
Is IRC primary more there?

1489
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Yeah, I think so.

1490
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,120
I think it would mean everything goes back to primary being an IRC.

1491
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,120
I don't care either way.

1492
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,600
I just want to do whatever folks are happy with.

1493
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,760
Although, could we experiment with matrix?

1494
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,720
Matrix is interesting.

1495
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,360
You can use the IRC with matrix so you can do both of those.

1496
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,120
Yeah, that could be something down the road to look more into.

1497
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,120
Wow.

1498
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,120
Well, actually matrix IRC bridge is fantastic.

1499
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,120
I love it.

1500
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,680
I use it for so many different channels.

1501
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,040
So you're saying go play with that.

1502
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Go ahead Noah.

1503
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,400
No, I just, that's interesting that this comes up.

1504
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,680
This is one of the things that I was kind of dragging my feet on it because I know.

1505
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
Oh, I know.

1506
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,040
This is partially your fault actually.

1507
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,600
Well, I heard some rumblings about this and so I was like, ah, just hold off for a little

1508
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,680
bit and just see what happens.

1509
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,080
But yeah, we were talking about it because one of the things that matrix allows you to

1510
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,680
do, and again, this is where I think there's a discussion to be had about software licenses,

1511
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,680
right?

1512
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,880
Because it's open source, it means that I looked at my team here at UltaSpeed and I

1513
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,560
was like, hey, could we do some of these more competitive things from a production standpoint

1514
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
and tie them in?

1515
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,640
They're like, dude, you don't have no idea how easy that would be if we did it with matrix

1516
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,480
and we could have these apps and all sorts of crazy things were coming up.

1517
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,680
And so I'd be tempted if you guys did decide to dig into that, I'd dig into it with you

1518
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,800
and handle some of the heavy lifting because I know how much you love dealing with the

1519
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,360
minutia of the projects, Chris.

1520
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,360
You do.

1521
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,360
Yeah.

1522
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,360
Wes has got some great ideas too.

1523
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,560
We should, we really all need to get together and do a little powwow.

1524
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,560
I completely agree.

1525
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,560
All right.

1526
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,560
Well.

1527
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:29,320
I've been using matrix with IRC for Intergos, IRC for channel for years now.

1528
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,320
Huh.

1529
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,320
All right.

1530
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,320
Don't convince me, Michael.

1531
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,120
I'm going to, I'm going to spend a little more time and consideration with that.

1532
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,120
Okay.

1533
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,920
So I've got a big announcement that I'm pretty excited about that I want to get into, but

1534
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,600
before I do, I don't know.

1535
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,600
I wanted to make a little space here for Mr. Popey and Mr. Wimpy.

1536
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,040
Perhaps they would like to pre-tease some announcement.

1537
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,720
I know Curry just recently happened.

1538
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,480
The Ubuntu podcast has been on season break.

1539
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,240
Rumor has it the band may be getting back together.

1540
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,240
Yeah.

1541
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,240
Yeah.

1542
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,240
So.

1543
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,240
That's it.

1544
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,240
No, go ahead.

1545
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,240
Maybe.

1546
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,400
So yeah, we, for those who don't know, like Wimpy and I do this little podcast.

1547
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,180
It's a little two bit show with.

1548
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,640
It's a wonderful show.

1549
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,640
Everybody should be listening.

1550
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,640
Thanks.

1551
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,640
Ubuntu podcast.

1552
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Thank you.

1553
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,440
And every year since we started 10 years ago, we stop recording at Christmas that we make

1554
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,280
our last episode goes out over Christmas and then we take a break for a couple of months

1555
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,800
so we can all have a rest.

1556
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,120
And then we have a traditional go out for a curry and then at that curry we decide whether

1557
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,640
we're going to do it for another year and our plans for what we will change and what

1558
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,640
will stay the same.

1559
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,920
And we make loads of notes and we implement changes in the following week or so.

1560
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,080
And then we start the new season sometime soon after that.

1561
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,080
Isn't that right Wimpy?

1562
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,080
That's about it, right?

1563
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Yes.

1564
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Roughly like that.

1565
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,080
Yeah.

1566
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,560
Can I ask you a question about that though?

1567
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,560
Okay.

1568
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,320
How many years have you done the show where after the curry you didn't return?

1569
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,840
But you never know.

1570
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:08,200
So far we have a hundred percent success rate of coming back after having a curry.

1571
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,200
But one year.

1572
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
Here's my suggestion.

1573
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,200
One year.

1574
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,200
Why not?

1575
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,200
But I have a suggestion for you Wimpy.

1576
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,360
How about at the last episode of recording you just do it at the curry place and then

1577
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
go ahead and decide right then.

1578
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
That's adorable.

1579
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,680
We've got to have a break.

1580
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,680
It's pretty intense.

1581
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
It's really hard work.

1582
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,680
You can have a break.

1583
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,080
You can still make a decision and then take a break as well.

1584
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,080
Yeah maybe.

1585
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,080
Doing one half hour show.

1586
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,080
Listen.

1587
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,480
Producer Michael you wouldn't understand this but doing one half hour show a week or recording

1588
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,600
two of them every two weeks is a huge amount of work.

1589
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,440
Also you're suggesting we have curry at Christmas.

1590
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,440
Are you mad?

1591
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,440
Yeah.

1592
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,440
Speaking of curry.

1593
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,440
All seasons.

1594
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,080
I was just going to say I'd like to lodge a complaint with my boss at Jupiter Broadcasting.

1595
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,560
Why is it we never have any sort of discussions around curry?

1596
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,480
Oh I don't ever remember being invited to curry to discuss the next iteration of Vast

1597
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
Noah or Lass.

1598
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,480
I know dude.

1599
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
It's not just this.

1600
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,480
There's another.

1601
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,480
This and another.

1602
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,720
I am taking two lessons from the Ubuntu podcast and I will be integrating them into the announcement

1603
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,680
that I have coming up in mere moments.

1604
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,680
Really.

1605
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,680
I'm taking lessons.

1606
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:09,680
I'm taking notes.

1607
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,680
But yeah guys.

1608
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,680
It's good to know that we're so influential.

1609
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,600
I'm looking forward to it.

1610
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,720
But I do also want to give a mention to our buddies over at Late Night Linux.

1611
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:25,440
Episode 31 of Late Night Linux, they had Todd the CEO of Purism on to talk about a lot of

1612
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,160
the questions that I raised on Linux Action News and that Joe's been wondering.

1613
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,560
And the guys over there just did a great job of asking Todd the questions and Todd did

1614
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,480
a great job of answering them.

1615
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:40,840
So if you've been following the Librem 5 or if you've followed my journey with some of

1616
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,560
their stuff, I want to just totally give you a recommendation here.

1617
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,560
Go check out episode 31.

1618
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:50,240
I had a fantastic interview with the CEO of Purism about a lot of the things that have

1619
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,640
been on many of our minds.

1620
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,920
So that's episode 31 of Late Night Linux.

1621
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:00,720
Ubuntu podcast could be coming up, but I'm going to beat all of them with my new release.

1622
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,340
I'm very, very happy to announce the return of an old favorite to the Jupiter Broadcasting

1623
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,800
Network for a limited time.

1624
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,920
I'm doing something kind of different here and I think it's going to be fun.

1625
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:16,240
It's just to the lead up and just a little bit after scale for a limited time, I'm bringing

1626
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:22,240
back Tech Talk Today to the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and you can go over to techtalk.today.

1627
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,900
Now I know what you're thinking.

1628
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,420
Why Tech Talk Today?

1629
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:32,080
Why do Tech Talk Today when you could relaunch Plan B or come up with some other Linux only

1630
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,080
show?

1631
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,260
It's a good question.

1632
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:41,720
You know, we put Tech Talk Today on hiatus in September of 2016 so we could launch UserAir.

1633
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:48,920
And I thought surely somebody will come along, like that Joe Resington asshole or Tom Merritt,

1634
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,120
and they'll launch another tech show.

1635
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,120
You know what?

1636
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,120
They're bastards, aren't they?

1637
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,120
Those bastards.

1638
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,120
You know.

1639
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,120
I sure do.

1640
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,280
They'll launch another tech show that finally gives a perspective that's outside the Silicon

1641
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:11,320
Valley bubble, that maybe even by some weird luck, somebody on the show has used open source

1642
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,040
software once in their life or knows that they're using open source software.

1643
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,240
Surely by 2018, such a hero shall come along.

1644
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,680
And yet no such Batman has arrived on the scene and it's always really bothered me.

1645
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:30,040
I've gotten on the soapbox more than a few occasions about tech journalism on this show.

1646
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,280
There's lots of good tech shows.

1647
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,280
There really are.

1648
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,280
There's too many.

1649
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,160
There's too many tech shows.

1650
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,880
But they all have a really strong Silicon Valley bias.

1651
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,960
They typically can't see beyond the apps on their smartphone, to be honest with you.

1652
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,160
And it drives me crazy.

1653
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:50,200
So looking at the near term future of Jupiter broadcasting, we definitely have a content

1654
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,760
problem.

1655
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,640
I'm going to be traveling to scale.

1656
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,020
We're going to have Linux Fest Northwest.

1657
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:59,880
And if things continue in the direction that they're going, I'll have more interviews

1658
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,440
at company like Microsoft and others that don't really fit into Linux Unplugged.

1659
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,560
They don't fit into LAM.

1660
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,360
They don't fit into Coder.

1661
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,300
So I'm going to launch a limited run of Tech Talk today.

1662
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,560
Something new, just one season.

1663
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,880
In fact, I'm doing seasons.

1664
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,880
That's one of the-

1665
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,880
Whoa.

1666
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,880
Yeah.

1667
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,880
I'm stealing that from Open2Podcast.

1668
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,000
And they invented it and I'm taking it.

1669
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,500
I'm doing seasons and I'm going to do 10 episodes a season.

1670
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,920
So I'm just doing 10 episodes and I really would like you to give it a listen because

1671
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,760
I'm going to use this as an opportunity to have a fun romp.

1672
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,680
Really just, what did you call it?

1673
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,680
Self-referential tech coverage.

1674
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,680
What did you say earlier?

1675
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,360
It was almost like it could have been a tagline.

1676
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,040
Something you liked about Tech Talk today was the fact that it didn't take itself too

1677
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,040
seriously.

1678
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,040
Exactly.

1679
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,040
It's a good fun show.

1680
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,640
I can't remember the words you used, but I should have written them down.

1681
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,200
And that's what our goal is.

1682
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,480
We'll have some curry later and we'll think about that.

1683
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,320
But because I'm doing a season, I'm going to have a bit of a story arc to it.

1684
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,840
It's really going to be about getting my butt down to scale.

1685
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:01,280
And Noah and I specifically are going in with some things that we want to accomplish, some

1686
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,960
objectives ahead of time.

1687
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,960
And some of-

1688
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:04,960
Like eating curry?

1689
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,960
Yeah.

1690
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:06,960
Yes, absolutely.

1691
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,960
That'll be in there as well.

1692
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,200
So I'm relaunching a show for a limited run.

1693
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,360
It's just going to be a lot of fun.

1694
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,040
I'm going to experiment with some stuff and we're going to talk lifestyle stuff, culture

1695
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,500
stuff, tech news with somebody that comes with the perspective of the open source community.

1696
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,720
So if there's something in there from our perspective, I'm covering it.

1697
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,880
That'll be the stuff that gets preferential treatment.

1698
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,520
It's going to be a fun experiment.

1699
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,920
And I may try doing a few things in there that you don't expect.

1700
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,920
So check it out.

1701
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,460
I would love to have you subscribe.

1702
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:39,400
The raw dog RSS feed, plug it into whatever you want, tech talk today or tech talk dot

1703
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,800
today slash RSS, tech talk dot today slash RSS.

1704
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,520
There is going to be some exclusive content I'll generate for our patrons too at the Jupiter

1705
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,400
signal Patreon page.

1706
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,400
Working with seasons sounds interesting.

1707
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,400
What do you think of that?

1708
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Is that crazy?

1709
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,960
No, I think I think it makes a lot of sense.

1710
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,960
10 episodes.

1711
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,960
10 episodes.

1712
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,960
Can I ask you a question?

1713
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,960
Yeah, go ahead.

1714
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,240
Is this something that you're doing live or is this something that it will be recorded

1715
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,680
offline then just published?

1716
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,200
So a bit of both because predominantly I'm going to be all over the place during these

1717
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,400
next 10 episodes.

1718
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,000
Some of it's going to just have to be offline.

1719
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,600
In fact, I think the majority of it will be offline.

1720
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,400
There won't even be a YouTube video of it because it's just going to be Chris on the

1721
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,080
road talking about whatever I'm doing, talking about the news of the day, talking about the

1722
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,080
events we're going to.

1723
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,080
It's going to be kind of raw.

1724
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,080
I really like that.

1725
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,320
Yeah, I think that's going to be like tech vlog today.

1726
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,960
Yeah, it's going to be kind of a little bit actually a little bit like tech vlog today.

1727
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,600
It's mostly drone reviews to be honest.

1728
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,520
But honestly, I think there's also the perfect opportunity to then have like special live

1729
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,120
events because if we're not doing a live one all the time, like when we do a live one and

1730
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:53,200
I'd like to at least do a couple of season, then that's kind of like a special event and

1731
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,360
we'll make a special event out of it.

1732
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,540
So I do plan to do some live stuff.

1733
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:04,800
But I honestly suspect when Noah was here, he and I worked to install a microphone mount

1734
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,960
in my truck.

1735
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:11,600
I expect I'll be doing a lot of the tech talk today's from the passenger seat of my truck

1736
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,440
while I'm going to do something.

1737
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,440
I'm going somewhere.

1738
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,120
I'm on my way to scale.

1739
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,680
I'm going to an interview.

1740
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,680
I'm going to wake up in the morning.

1741
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,680
I'm going to look at the tech news.

1742
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,680
I'm going to think about stuff.

1743
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,880
I'm going to jump in the car.

1744
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,600
I'll either go park somewhere and do a show or I'll have somebody else driving and I'm

1745
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,640
going to sit down and I'm going to record an episode.

1746
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,680
Now that's not to say it's going to sound like shit because you guys know I'm not going

1747
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,160
to put something out that sounds like crap.

1748
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,240
So I'm going to also work on that.

1749
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:38,160
This will be another way for me behind the scenes to really kind of iron out the remote

1750
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:43,080
recording setup and whatnot, really get some of that stuff dialed in.

1751
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:47,960
Then we'll be documenting the journey to scale and kind of what that's been like.

1752
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,000
So that'll be where some of the vlog element comes in.

1753
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,960
Some of the people I talk to, some of the events people would get to bump into, I'll

1754
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,960
be in there.

1755
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,560
So I think it's going to be a particular kind of new show at JB, even though it's an old

1756
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,560
show at the same time.

1757
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,560
Can I ask a question, Chris?

1758
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,560
Yes.

1759
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,560
Will you be changing the show artwork or will you be keeping the thing where you've got

1760
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,920
the jacket and the shorts and your weird feet stance?

1761
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,400
I know the feet do look weird.

1762
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,440
I was just looking at the feet and I'm not quite sure what happened with the feet.

1763
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,440
I don't really know.

1764
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,960
Because, Wes, I mean, look, my feet aren't, my feet's not that, it's not that weird.

1765
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,960
Totally normal.

1766
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,960
Normal foot.

1767
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,920
I mean, there's the extra things, but we don't have to get into that.

1768
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,160
Yeah, it's just webbing.

1769
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:33,400
So what I plan to do is implement a chest up approach to the artwork because it's the

1770
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,640
weird feet, right?

1771
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,280
Although then at the same time, I kind of like, I kind of like it.

1772
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,720
It's kind of like Noah's dick in his AltaSpeed logo.

1773
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,600
It's sort of, you remember the weird feet, you know?

1774
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,160
So I learned from Noah, the savvy businessman that he is.

1775
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,160
You know what?

1776
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,880
People talk about my, we're having a conversation about AltaSpeed and I didn't buy, I didn't

1777
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,280
buy AdSpot on Linux Unplugged.

1778
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,280
That's right.

1779
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,280
Exactly.

1780
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:01,360
But, Poby, if you have, if you have any artwork that you want to mock up for me, I'd, I'd,

1781
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,680
I'm the last person on the job.

1782
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,000
Maybe we can make it just the feet.

1783
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That might be what we need to do.

1784
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
There you go.

1785
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
There you go.

1786
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah, man.

1787
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,400
So scale March 8th through the 11th.

1788
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,480
I know I'm just excited about it.

1789
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,160
I'm curious to see where they go with this thing.

1790
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:21,120
You know, it's been going in a certain direction that I wasn't super into and now they've

1791
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,840
righted the ship and they seem to be sailing in a new direction.

1792
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,960
So I'm curious to go see that.

1793
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,560
But more importantly, it's like, well, where the hell are things going?

1794
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,920
Really?

1795
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,480
You've got, you got that crazy canonical shipping gnome.

1796
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,840
You got elementary OS encrypting their drives.

1797
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,780
You got containers for days.

1798
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:41,920
You've got all these different interests that have kind of really established their places

1799
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
now.

1800
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:48,560
Where's all of this going, especially just in the next, I don't know, 10 months, where's

1801
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,660
this all going for Linux and open source.

1802
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:54,040
And those are some of the things that I want to try to answer over the next few weeks on

1803
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,360
tech talk today and on this show.

1804
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,880
And I believe that Noah and I will be on the same beat.

1805
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,640
So you'll hear more about on ask Noah as well.

1806
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,960
I think it's going to be really kind of a fun experiment.

1807
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,720
And the best part about it is only 10 episodes, right?

1808
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,720
Like, it's just like a go for it and then like, you get in, you get out.

1809
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,720
Yeah.

1810
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,720
Like I just, I've never done anything.

1811
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,360
I'm just going to do 10 of them and then I'm going to go have curry.

1812
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,360
I think that's brilliant.

1813
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,360
What do you think, Noah?

1814
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,360
Is that, is that crazy?

1815
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:24,840
I think there's one crucial part of that missing, but you really like, so when you look at the

1816
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,320
way that you want to do that, I think the important thing is to craft is to get input

1817
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,320
from outside sources.

1818
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,920
And I think the best way to do that is to invite me along for the curry.

1819
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,000
And other than that, I think it's a good plan.

1820
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,960
And maybe sometimes do a weekly show with our mumble room guys.

1821
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,960
Thank you for making it.

1822
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,960
I really appreciate it.

1823
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:41,960
It was a good show with you.

1824
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,560
Stick around because the ask Noah program's coming up.

1825
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,160
If you didn't know the ask Noah show just moments away and you you can hang out here

1826
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,800
and join him otherwise join us live.

1827
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,800
We do this at 2 PM Pacific.

1828
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,400
The live show usually kicks off around 1 31 45 Pacific and all of that is converted to

1829
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:04,080
the proper time in your local area at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar and find the

1830

RSS for the feed.

1832
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,040
Give it a listen.

1833
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,080
Let me know what you think.

1834
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,840
We have some special stuff in the works and uh, I don't know.

1835
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,720
It's fun to bring it back.

1836
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,640
It's fun to bring back people.

1837
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,600
You know, people are still subscribed to that show.

1838
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,240
People are still downloading that show.

1839
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,840
It's still got a subreddit like it just, it needs to come back for even just a bit.

1840
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,740
Tech talk yesterday.

1841
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:35,160
Tech talk yesterday tomorrow at tech talk.today.

1842
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,320
Go check it out and then find the calendar for the live shows, our contact page at Jupiter

1843
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:44,000
broadcasting.com and we also have the subreddit linuxunplugged.letit.com and we got all the

1844
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
things.

1845
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We got all the things.

1846
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
No excuse not to reach out.

1847
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,840
You got the ask Noah show coming up and you can come over here on the Tuesdays and just

1848
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,880
hang out for a nice old Linux meal.

1849
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,120
You get the unplugged program, which is a really nice long live stream.

1850
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,680
Then you get the ask Noah show.

1851
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,200
It's a good Tuesday afternoon.

1852
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,000
Yeah, we had a long winded discussion that didn't really answer your questions.

1853
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,140
Just just ask Noah.

1854
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,140
Just ask Noah.

1855
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,140
Just ask Noah.

1856
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:09,600
And then once you're done listening to all this live stuff, go check out techsnap.systems

1857
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,880
for Wes and I talking about system administration and network building woes and the Ubuntu podcast

1858
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,160
as well.

1859
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,600
And go check out Tux Digital on YouTube because producer Michael is putting out stuff over

1860
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,600
there.

1861
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,640
All right.

1862
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,200
That concludes the plugs of this week's episode.

1863
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,300
You know every now and then you got to get them out.

1864
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,300
You got to get them out.

1865
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,300
Props.

1866
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,040
It's like it's like a form of therapy.

1867
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Just got to get it out.

1868
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,040
Thank you for joining us, guys.

1869
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
Hope you and gals.

1870
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,040
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1871
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,040
Go follow me.

1872
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,040
I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

1873
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,840
We're talking about some of our projects.

1874
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,040
The network's at Jupiter signal.

1875
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
That guy right there.

1876
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,040
He's at West Payne.

1877
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,040
That's right.

1878
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,040
I like that.

1879
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,040
Damn.

1880
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,040
That's almost as good as bacon, dude.

1881
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,040
So good.

1882
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,040
It might be.

1883
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,980
I would like to see Payne versus bacon to see which one wins.

1884
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:50,980
Don't forget.

1885
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,360
While we're voting, we have the poll in the show notes.

1886
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,200
Should we go back to IRC or stay on Discord for the live chat and the focus of the show?

1887
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,200
You decide.

1888
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,200
Let us know.

1889
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,200
Let us know.

1890
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,200
You can vote.

1891
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:24,800
We'll see you in the next one.

1892
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:45,320
You don't need to install that.

1893
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,320
Don't bother.

1894
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
Don't bother.

1895
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,320
Don't bother yourself.

1896
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,320
You got other things to do.

1897
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,320
Haven't you heard of OS?

1898
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,240
It's just the primary platform for your tools.

1899
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,400
All right, JBtitles.com, title suggestions.

1900
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,680
What do you guys think?

1901
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,920
What should we do?

1902
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,520
What should we do, JBtitles.com?

1903
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,520
Make IRC great again.

1904
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,040
Metrics talk today.

1905
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,400
That is a pretty clever combo.

1906
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,840
You came out there with tech nav.

1907
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,840
Tech nav.

1908
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,980
All right, so you all have to go over and subscribe and listen to Tech Talk today at

1909
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,360
least for one or two episodes and then let me know what you think.

1910
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,360
You got to give it like a two episode go because it's going to take me a little bit to find

1911
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,360
a groove.

1912
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,360
So go over there and give it a two episode go for me.

1913
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:27,360
Should it be a new RSS feed or use the old one?

1914
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:34,080
Well, it was going to use the old one and then there was a bit of a server failure on

1915
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,120
my part and as of right now, it's tech talk today.

1916
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:41,680
It's tech talk dot today slash RSS.

1917
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,600
The old feed may start working again and it may not.

1918
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,600
If you're lucky.

1919
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,600
Yeah.

1920
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,160
I'm sorry.

1921
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:55,920
One ping only was my title suggestion in reference to the canonical data collection.

1922
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,200
Which I thought was kind of good because, you know.

1923
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:03,040
I mean, after today, I'm sort of like interested in trying to get one of these either matrix

1924
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,560
or riot to work with IRC.

1925
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:06,560
There you go.

1926
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,560
I'm still trying to figure out how.

1927
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
You maniac.

1928
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:15,920
So one ping only is, of course, I submitted that so I'm a little particular.

1929
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,560
I like that and the metrics talk today is nice.

1930
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:23,480
One ping only is elegant.

1931
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,880
I like that part a lot.

1932
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,760
And it also sort of reinforces the point that it's just one really kind of big data shot.

1933
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:37,040
But yeah, I don't know.

1934
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,040
That's my thought.

1935
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,880
I don't really have a strong sense.

1936
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,760
I would like to see them publish that data.

1937
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,760
I would really like to see that data.

1938
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,760
Yeah.

1939
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,880
I wonder what the granularity will be.

1940
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,880
Yeah.

1941
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,880
Yeah.

1942
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,880
Down to OEMs.

1943
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,880
That's all really what I'd be happy for.

1944
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,880
It's funny.

1945
01:35:53,880 --> 01:36:01,880
Having that Apple thing go automatic, like when that Apple pop-up first landed in Ubuntu,

1946
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,160
people complained and said Ubuntu was more crashy than previous releases.

1947
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,200
And that's because previous releases didn't have a pop-up that told you something was

1948
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,200
crashy.

1949
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,880
And now it does, right?

1950
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,040
And so there are so many blog posts out there that tell you how to turn that thing off and

1951
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,400
make Apple go away.

1952
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,440
And it's so frustrating for me when I'm looking at the errors website and looking at all the

1953
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,880
crashes and thinking, what are the crashes that we're not capturing?

1954
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,440
Because people turn that thing off.

1955
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,800
And so that's why I'm keen for that thing to be fully automatic.

1956
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,360
So if people tick the box, they just get sent.

1957
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,680
And then we can look at the crash log, crash dumps, and we can fix them.

1958
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,680
Yep.

1959
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,680
I agree.

1960
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:39,680
I agree.

1961
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,840
Because I actually almost always just dismiss it because I don't want to go through because

1962
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,520
I've had enough of those ask me then to log in or provide an email address or things like

1963
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,520
that.

1964
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,520
And so I just clear it.

1965
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,280
I clear it immediately as soon as I see it.

1966
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,440
Because I'm just trying to get something relaunched and get back on air.

1967
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,440
But yeah, I agree.

1968
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,120
I would be more than happy to just send in the background and not bother me and let me

1969
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:14,200
get about my day.
