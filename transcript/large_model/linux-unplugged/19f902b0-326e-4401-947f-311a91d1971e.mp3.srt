1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
What colors your hair?

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,620
Still brown still brown

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,520
I think I'm gonna do it at Linux fest if I remember problem is that the the hair dye already got taken from me

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,660
So I already had forgotten until you said something taken from you

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
Every time I'd sit down at the studio. I'd set my arms down and all of a sudden like everything was turning red

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
It was ridiculous. I was like oh, this is no good

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,820
I think if Chris does it he needs to he's to go all the way and do the orchid

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't know if that's gonna happen

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,560
Maybe I also feel like if he's gonna do it. He needs to bleach his hair. Oh, yeah, Chris. Are you gonna bleach your hair?

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,560
No, he says oh junk then yeah

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
It's gonna look no good really why?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,400
Cuz you do orchard what you should do orchard. Why why don't you bleach my hair?

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,700
That's that sounds like a bad time. Well, how are you gonna put a lighter color on a darker color? Is it lighter?

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Both of them are well think so

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,120
Pretty dark hair bro. It's it's not gonna show up at all. Really, you know what they say about guys with dark hair, right?

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,000
I feel like we could have not said this on air and then that could have been my out now you guys are just totally

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,040
No, no. Yeah, the mistake you made is we want you to do this. Oh, yeah

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,360
Well, damn it. See what I think you should do is I think you should make your hair red and your beard organ

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,120
It's not actually a terrible idea oh

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,480
Oh

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,760
My gosh, dude, this is Linux unplugged episode 195 for May 2nd 2017

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,800
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's ripped out all of the proprietary software

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,020
Replaced it with good old Linux. My name is Chris get it out of it. Wait. No, my name is well, yeah

24
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,540
We're gonna keep it here now. Yeah, we got all the proprietary software adder

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
We'll tell you a little bit about that later, but that's not what we're gathered here to talk about today

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,120
Oh, no, we do have a great show though. Oh, that was really totally

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,740
That was great though. I really enjoyed that some new projects

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,260
Some of the pretty excited about because Wes has gotten his hands on them directly and he's like, hey, I've been trying this

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,940
We got to talk about it. I always love those segments on the show

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,480
Then a big big big change has come to all of those encumbered

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:26,020
audio files on your hard drive will tell you about that and then Windows 10 s has been officially announced and it's got

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Chromebooks and desktop Linux in the education market

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,320
Squarely in its crosshairs. Oh, oh boom squarely. Let's just right in there Wes watch out for that and then

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,860
coming up in

35
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,260
Just a few short days the final episode of the Linux action show Linux fest Northwest

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,580
live Linux unplugged perhaps I'm okay. We'll tell you all about all of that and

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,160
Some of the efforts we've been going into here to get all of the Linux get all of the Linux and maybe if we have time

38
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,660
We'd like to have a very honest and frank conversation

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,040
About the state of Linux battery life some tools some tips some tricks from us and the virtual lug

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,120
To manage battery life to get better battery life

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Wes has a has a story you could perhaps share with the class

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,800
from a co-worker who recently tried Ubuntu 1704 and

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,960
we'll just kind of hopefully walk away with some tips to have better battery life on our laptops because it seems like it's on a

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,540
Downward trend these days under Linux when Mac and Windows perhaps are at their best the new Microsoft surface laptop announced today

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,840
They claim 14 hours of battery life. So we'll see maybe can we get Linux close? Can we get close?

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,600
That's the question. I certainly hope so. Yes. Yes. So before we can do any of it

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,080
We've got to bring in our virtual lug a time-appropriate greetings bumble room. Hello. Hello

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,240
So guys

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,880
There is there is a couple of open source projects that I thought we'd start with this week that are just really cool to check

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,800
out and really cool to see come, you know come to fruition and

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,720
The first one is one that the Mac users have had for a while that I I really thought would be great on Linux

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,480
And now it's here. It's called open snitch

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,400
It's a open source port of the little snitch application

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,880
That's pretty famous on Mac and it's an application firewall

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,000
But what it does is it gives you graphical alerts about the applications on your system that are trying to take

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,440
They're trying to make an outbound connection and then the first time it happens you can take immediate action

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,200
You can whitelist that application. You can block it allow deny

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,720
It's a cool. It's a cool way to see what's talking to what and sometimes you're surprised. What's talking to what?

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,160
Yeah, exactly ever seen it. Yeah, you know

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,480
I've used it on I've seen people use it institutions that used it on on Mac OS and it

61
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,320
seemed like it's that like

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,780
Last mile kind of thing that we often associate with the Mac or some of the programs for it where it's like, yeah

63
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,080
All right, I could do all of that with IP tables or you know other means command-line applications

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,320
But but probably you don't I mean if you do great and there's a lot of cool guides out there to do that

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,080
But for like, you know the people who just installed Linux or their casual users or they just want like, um, you know

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,160
They don't do it all the time. They want a cleaner simpler interface. They can remember

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
I think this looks like it could be nice

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Yeah

69
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,500
the other thing that's cool about it that I've used a couple of times when I had client max is I was installing a new

70
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,660
Piece of software and I wanted to figure out what I had to punch open in the corporate firewall or I just want to know

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
What's going on in the system you fire up in this case now open snitch

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,360
You run it for a couple of hours and you just get a list of everything that's trying to talk to everything you discover

73
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,480
That this application that runs in the background actually pings this HTTP server every hour, which you didn't know before

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,340
Yeah, totally. That's good. It is nice a little bit of visibility

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Yeah

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,080
Now there's been some people say oh, you know running this kind of stuff through Python probably isn't a great idea

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,800
And it probably doesn't have the best performance

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,920
So you wouldn't necessarily want to put it on a server that's handling tens of thousands of requests

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,880
But if it's on your you know, like your laptop or your your parents computer or something

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,840
It might be might be worth a try they do caution that it's alpha quality software

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,520
We don't know how good it is right now

82
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,840
I've only played with it just a little bit but something to watch

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,620
Yeah

84
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,920
It's officially being entered into our cool open source projects that we're gonna keep track of

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,240
Category that we like to have on this show and now in the category of cool projects

86
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,520
And I think you've had a chance to play with this maybe a little bit too

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
Deb

88
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:16,040
Simple get it. It's like dead simple, but it's dead Deb simple and I don't really understand because it's like a repository server for app

89
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,800
So it's like your own local repository server. But does it does it not have packages? Is it is that right?

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
like it says on here that there's

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,760
Something about does not require packages or something. I read this on what the hell is this West? What is it?

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,080
What kind is a little confusingly described? So I was in position where I just had some

93
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Programs that I needed to modify then build I was packaging up as Deb files

94
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,300
I really I mean I could just download them and install them but it would be nice to have a little repo

95
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,400
And ideally I'd like this to be minimal effort. It was just for some internal processes, right?

96
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Nothing customer facing and it was a little more work to get set up

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,040
I mean like, you know an app a Debbie an arc repo. It's not that complicated

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,120
It's mostly just an HTTP server around some special files with metadata that you index the packages and that and that sort of thing

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Yeah, so there's like some some app programs out there that'll build that for you access it, but it was a kind of manual

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I found a Docker container that was like, all right

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,620
Well, you run it this way you SCP the thing and I was just gonna say like there must be a Docker

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,920
So they're totally are and that that would have been okay

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,920
But that was like really if you were making like you had your dot changes file and you were doing it like you're building like

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,680
A source package, you know, and I was really just I just wanted that one artifact

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,680
And so this is a little go implementation that provides a HTTP API

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,120
So it just makes it super simple if I have a new package, you know

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,000
It comes out of my build server Jenkins or something. You just post it over

108
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,640
HTTP post that'll add it to the archive and then BAM

109
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
That packages is up there supports multiple versions for packages multiple architectures

110
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,160
And it has it has API key so you can kind of control things as well

111
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,320
So be like well this user can up only this user can update new packages

112
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,560
But other people can get them or more granular than that

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,680
I realized the limitation that I was talking about earlier was that it doesn't have the ability to mirror existing repos, right?

114
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,640
So this isn't like a full apt proxy type setup, which I've used before but really isn't what I needed

115
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
I just wanted my own little simple local mirror for

116
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
And and because it's go it was like go get

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,000
Get hub dot blah blah blah and then it was running so it was super easy. Yeah

118
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,200
So there's a project that I'm watching and maybe if anybody in the virtual log there has a suggestion for something else

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Feel free to jump in but I'm watching this project called hardened Linux

120
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,920
And it's at hardened Linux gnu. I'm sorry old habit hardened Linux github.io and

121
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,760
They say they're a group of free software enthusiasts anarchists and cybersecurity researchers

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,360
Long live anarchy the site reads and long live old school spelt with O's. I think they're being a little tongue-in-cheek there

123
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,920
They it's a small step in security hardening and a giant leap in free and open source software. It's a it's an interesting idea

124
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a core infrastructure. So you're familiar with like obviously all the different projects out there to secure your system

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,280
So what if you brought them all in one spot?

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,160
What if you just brought them all together and tried to make a distro based around that?

127
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
It's kind of think what they're going for here

128
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:09,040
They're all they're also big on on that on a bunch of different open source security projects like PACS and GR security and whatnot

129
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,480
So interesting new initiative. I've always been fascinated with the whole

130
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,080
Like really super ultra secure Linux stuff. I've played in the past lockdown

131
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,680
I've played in the past like there's a I came up as I called Bastille

132
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,120
I can't remember

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,040
There's a piece of software you spell to load on Linux that would go through and try to harden it to meet all these

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,360
Requirements and so they I think they're either basing around like a Debian a Debian base

135
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,240
I don't know just something I came across this week that I'll be digging into more might have a review down the line

136
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Once I get a chance to check it out and and try it out or or learn more about it

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,040
At least I was just just sort of digging around when I came across it this week and thought let's share this with class

138
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,480
It started though in 2014. So it's not like it's brand new. Yeah, the group the group's been together for a while

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,720
I don't know

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,640
I don't know if they're shipping out code or I don't really what they've got at this point

141
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,640
but something to dig into hardened Linux and one of the things too that I

142
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,560
I used to struggle with was I used to have to be able to show regulators that I was taking steps to

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
Right meet certain requirements and and so if there's certain things that like you if you can come across

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,520
This is a question to the audience

145
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,280
If you know one where you can come across like checklist for how to make how do you make a boon to Linux?

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,960
Meet these regulatory requirements. How do you make sent us meet these regulatory requirements or are there distros out there?

147
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Or is something like hardened Linux maybe a project to get us there where it's like you you can start with a Debian base

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
And we've applied all of these

149
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,400
Security packages are all of these standards

150
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't really know quite what's out there these days because I haven't looked for a while

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,680
But I've had a few questions come into the show. So I thought I'll open up to the audience

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,640
So I this is one thing that I've come across to my research, but I'm curious if anybody else

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,920
Has anything I think it's I don't know. I don't know

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
I don't know if this is even really a project that has much legs anymore

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm not quite sure but it's there's got to be something out there to meet this particular requirement because I've gotten notes from people

156
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,160
They say well we can't really use Linux because there's no way to prove that we're following this particular standard or

157
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,080
For for you know, whatever the reason is whatever the industry is it changes. Yeah, exactly

158
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
Would you so let me ask you this say you were going to play a server?

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,580
For a company is there have you ever you ever have you ever worked in a company where they where they say when we deploy

160
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,840
a server you must always configure these things and set these settings and

161
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,940
Turn off these services and install these packages and turn off

162
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,880
The root login on this service like do you do you have you ever worked in a company where there's like a checklist of yes

163
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,020
Oh, yeah, okay, and that's just an internal process that they've developed

164
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,580
Yeah, in a lot of cases that that has been the case and then like these days I see a lot of it done with

165
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Configuration management systems or others like you can run you can have roles or recipes that what defines

166
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,220
What what needs to be changed? Like how do you know?

167
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,420
What to secure how do you know like what services should be configured what way like other than just personal experience and like

168
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,860
You know just learning over the years like how do you know you're actually doing it, right?

169
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,820
you see that's where like we have an issue like hardened Linux or something like

170
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,740
That has like a group of people that are experts in the area that can go through and really come up with a common standard

171
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Of how you secure a system how you make it auditable

172
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,820
That that's something that's a little easier to get more

173
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,740
I think larger buy off like otherwise it seems like to me companies come up with their own

174
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Well, we're gonna configure these things to meet our standards and it's sort of their own internal tribal knowledge that defines what all those things

175
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,460
Should be yeah, I mean, I think there's like, you know

176
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,300
There's some best practice guides and there's some guidance from like the actual requirement

177
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,820
Documentations or like, you know when you get compliance tested or that sort of thing

178
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,340
Yeah, that's usually where some of that will come from

179
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,220
Yeah, right, but if you're not an industry that has compliance testing, but you still want to secure your systems

180
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah, in that case then something like this I think would be

181
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,020
Even if you don't use it

182
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,220
It might be a very handy reference like you might also go look at some of those like cookbooks or other things that see what?

183
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,980
Settings they what changes they're going to make. Yeah, yeah, but you're right that it's not always and then I think there's

184
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,060
Even goes above and beyond where a lot of times like, you know

185
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,860
the the compliance things will be concerned about a fact, you know, like goals and end goals and

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,300
Real world things and then that doesn't always necessarily a one-to-one mapping back into how you should configure consistent or which way you should

187
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Configure. Yeah. Yeah, that's the tricky

188
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Monkey come you had something you wanted to add

189
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,780
Well, yeah

190
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,840
I mean every time you do a an audit inside of a banking company that does any kind of financial transactions or has any

191
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,080
any international transactions with banks

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,400
They always do those audits where they bring an audit a company in to audit your entire network, and they want you to explain

193
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,600
How you're securing these things exactly. That's what I was trying to say

194
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, and and they don't you know

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,160
It all comes down to having good auditing and good practices inside because even if you're I mean we were running puppet

196
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,040
but then somebody goes and installs a bunch of

197
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,320
applications on a Linux box because they want to be able to debug something and they leave them running and so the scan goes out and

198
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,720
You find all these open ports on a server for something. You didn't even know was running on it. And I mean those are the

199
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,520
I think it all comes down to you know, controlling access to servers

200
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,040
and I if that's what they're doing with a hardened install, I just don't see that working because

201
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,760
Most people don't want to use a custom install for for anything

202
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,040
It's got to be something that uses like Santos or Debian or Ubuntu

203
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,120
It can't be like its own custom role distro because you need a lot of industry industry support

204
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,880
You need folks that can walk in off the street that you've hired that have some built-in knowledge

205
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,600
and you need something that in some industries the auditors can recognize like one of the things that happened to us is a

206
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,080
Couple of times we got pushed away from Linux just simply because it was Gentoo and they didn't know what Gentoo was

207
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,480
They knew what red hat was. This is years ago years ago. And yes, I had Gentoo in production

208
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,820
Yes, I understand but I had a Gentoo system in production. I had many of them and they actually dinged us for it as having

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,940
Like this they didn't call it fragmentation at the time, but they dinged us for fragment a fragmented

210
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,140
Network because we had we had Windows boxes

211
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,740
We had SUSE Enterprise boxes, which they understood what that was

212
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,100
We had NetWare and we had Gentoo and it was a lot of systems because we were in the middle of the transition

213
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
from NetWare and Windows and

214
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,420
And and so they they come in they're like well

215
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,500
These Gentoo things are some weird thing that somebody sit down some one of your rogue IT people has just installed across your system

216
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,560
and they should be replaced with Windows 2000 using Active Directory and because

217
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,180
That was actually a finding that the auditors recommended

218
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,340
the

219
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,580
The way that what happens is it by the next time the auditors come around you don't have it

220
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,340
That's a big deal

221
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,540
and then if the second time they come around you don't have it you lose your FDIC insurance and then the bank goes out of

222
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Business and so we ended up deploying Active Directory simply as a response to that. Wow

223
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,580
So it's yeah, it was it's really been codified in my memory that sometimes you really got to get that stuff dialed in totally

224
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Well, you know, there's another way to learn more

225
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,420
Linux Academy you go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug. Do you support the show look at idea?

226
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,180
I know right learn more it could be like this little command line tools

227
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,740
You need to learn more or it's the big stuff, you know, like the big stuff like the container stuff. We're talking about

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,700
AWS Azure all of that stuff you can learn more at Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

229
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,420
Unplugged and you sign up you support the show and you can get a seven-day free trial. I like this graphic

230
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,500
They have look at this Wes

231
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,260
Doesn't that really tell you the state of Linux in the world today?

232
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,020
You got Linux at the core and then off at the different branches

233
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,300
You've got AWS Azure OpenStack big data containers DevOps the whole category of DevOps

234
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,620
And it really is at the center of it all Linux and open-source technology

235
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:15,020
Totally and Linux Academy has the entire platter covered you want to go in and get an education buffet Linux Academy Linux Academy comm

236
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,820
Slash unplugged you sign up you support the show you get to learn more community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members

237
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,420
Instructors that actually know the material that can help you

238
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,140
They have systems in place for team training if you want to get your whole team trained up and you can do it all

239
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,620
For seven days absolutely free just go to Linux Academy comm slash

240
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,240
Unplugged I like the flashcards because they're focused by the community

241
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,420
I like that they spin up servers when you need them

242
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,300
And you can use SSH to log in the courseware and the servers all match. It's so great. It's so great. Um

243
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,300
Our buddy Michael Dominic. Yeah, just started taking some Linux Academy courses

244
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,220
Yeah, it is it's it is so great for continuing education for challenging yourself for staying up to date on stuff

245
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,340
It's just and it's just so easy right like it's it's modern. It's kept up-to-date by Linux experts people experts in all the fields

246
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,700
That they support and so you just know that you're getting a fresh information that you can count on it makes it super easy

247
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,380
You can you can you can tell the passions there exactly yeah, you can join Linux Academy comm slash

248
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,620
Unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program now mr.

249
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,660
Noah joins us to talk about our next story finally Noah after all these ages

250
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,260
We have a brand new version of grub you ready for this. I'm ready. It's grub 2.02. It's gonna support

251
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,860
Experimental 64-bit extended to support it's gonna support LVM UUIDs

252
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,420
It's gonna have proper handling of LVM in general, which I know you're probably excited about absolutely. Here's the thing I'm excited about

253
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,540
ZFS support

254
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:48,360
Okay, yeah, and it XFS version 5 support for the version 5 format of exit like talk about checking a couple of my box

255
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,180
Yeah, that is awesome as well as support for LVM raid one so does it support?

256
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,420
defaulting to the LTS kernel so

257
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,020
Okay, so a little revealing here a little behind-the-scenes reveal here

258
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,540
We are we're doing a lot of work here in the studio as we've mentioned and where's that mouse hand me that mouse here

259
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,520
I'll give them there for people watching the video version

260
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,940
I'll give you a little behind-the-scenes shot of what we've been doing here. Yeah, we got a new sky cam with and

261
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,020
so a bunch of new equipment in here and

262
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,620
All Linux based all of it even even this big honking mixer this right here. That's Linux what yeah, this mixer runs

263
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I know

264
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,540
It's really something and in a decade it's taken us, you know

265
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,220
but with the qualities there like everything is like we're it's a no-compromise setup. In fact, it's better than the old setup and

266
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,900
That's great. Yeah, and here's what here's what is is awfully funny about it is all of it comes crashing down

267
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,820
If you accidentally boot the OBS machine with the stock arch kernel and not the LTS kernel

268
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,320
One thing it was like, oh, okay

269
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,140
Well this capture card requires a module and that has to be on the LTS kernel

270
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,900
Oh, well actually and I think actually to begin with we have even one more because we had ZFS and that needed the LTS kernel

271
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,300
So it's like there's all these things that had to have the LTS kernel and then you yeah

272
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,440
We just we didn't even think about it

273
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,580
We just restarted the box and like all of a sudden nothing's working

274
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,500
No, the capture working on the audio stuff's working just set it up. Yeah when we'd restarted it before so we were like

275
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,560
How does that happen? Yeah, it is super funny, right and we sit here. We're scratching our heads

276
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,740
We're like everything was working and we're about to start with Koda radio. It's right. Today is a busy day

277
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,360
We've got Koda radio Linux unplugged and texting up all back-to-back

278
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,180
Yeah, and so there's not a lot of time for things to break and we're like what's going on?

279
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,560
What's going on and we guys sitting over there in the chair he goes

280
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,360
Oh damn it had to take the stream down choose the LTS kernel you removed that option now, right?

281
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,280
Well, we haven't we haven't had time yet

282
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,000
I've been recording show right? That's a time to grub right? It's like maybe there's some new cool features that

283
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,760
Also, you're gonna have some network support in there as well as it really at the boot level and some improved support for core boot, too

284
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,360
Really? Yeah, it's a serious release. So on grub. Like what do you mean by network support? I don't know

285
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,160
I'm really excited about this. I'm really excited about this. I'm really excited about this

286
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,120
What do you mean by network support? I don't know. I'm reading this. I haven't I haven't read past that

287
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,680
I just read that I just read down the line. I hadn't read that far ahead

288
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
I was so excited about the LVM and ZFS

289
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
You know cool it would be if I could get to a point where I could just be like boot off network

290
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Oh man inside of the grub boot menu. Yeah, that's something to get into right? That is really something to get into

291
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,880
It's however, by the way, if you're ever using arch in production highly recommend the LTS kernel. It's a good way to go

292
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
It's good. It's a good combo of

293
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,040
Rolling user LAN software, which is what we needed. Yeah a nice level stability. That's right. That's right

294
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,080
Hey guys, you mind if we do a little gaming update just real quick here on the show

295
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,000
There it is. That's I was gonna say you got to have that. Yeah, I got to have that

296
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
this is something that

297
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,760
It's a little bit of a little bit of hoops. You got to jump through to get to this

298
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,080
So I'm gonna warn you right now. You got to buy the Windows version

299
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah, and then you got to sign up for the beta but when you do

300
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Under Linux you will get access

301
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,800
To what looks to me like a very very well done mech game you like mech games, you know

302
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,880
Where you're walking around and like in a huge like mech suit, you know, I'm talking about, you know

303
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm talking about guys

304
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,680
this is Dark Horizons mechanized corpse and

305
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Gaming on Linux is got good things to say about it

306
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,160
So it was really good like the way the mech moves it feels really good

307
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,000
Like it really really nailed the feeling of walking around in a giant mech suit now

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's it's not yet out for Linux officially, right? The developer is actively developing this software

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,740
And he's just kind of on the side started making a Linux version now

310
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,040
This is why I mentioned it because I think this is the time to show some love just say hey

311
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah, there's an intro. There's an audience here that's interested in this

312
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,440
So if you want to check it out, you first have to get the Dark Horizons mechanized corpse under Windows

313
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Or just buy it through the steam web app

314
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,960
Sign up for the beta or enable beta mode and then you can go into your library and pull down a little

315
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,520
So what happens if you just buy it unlike the web store, yeah, that's what you do, okay

316
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,200
That's that would have to buy it under Windows. No, that's what I mean. Yeah, it's just that the only version

317
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,760
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's what I do is I would buy it on the web

318
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,980
I would do on the website for sure and then you don't even have to go close to that Windows

319
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,880
Yeah, exactly Noah and I did try while we're in the valve section Noah and I did try to set up a SteamVR

320
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,440
This week. Oh, really and so it's it's hit and miss

321
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,920
So there's really two there's there's a two pronged approach to get SteamVR working under Linux either arch or the second prong is Ubuntu

322
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,200
And in arch it's because all the stuff you well here

323
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
Let me back up a little bit. You need to be at least on kernel 410 and

324
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,120
You need to have as of this recording Nvidia driver version 375

325
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,740
Dot-x and it needs to be the Vulcan beta edition of that driver

326
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,260
This is where it gets tricky because both arch and Ubuntu have Nvidia driver 375 as a package name

327
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,460
But it doesn't have the beta Vulcan stuff and it's in the regular repo

328
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,680
So if you just try to install it, that's what you get. So under Ubuntu

329
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,120
You have to go get the Vulcan driver version PPA

330
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,120
Then you have to go into your PPA priorities and you have to pin it above the main repo one

331
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,520
And fight that fight or under arch you have to you have to play dependency hell where there's all these different conflicting dependencies

332
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
And then once you even get all that set up

333
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,360
It's basically like hardly anything works. So it was a little disappointing. It was so it's still a work in progress

334
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,000
So we haven't really had a chance to really try it out fully because it's sort of

335
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,860
Yeah, but we continue now. It's like halfway set up for when you know, there's more interesting stuff to talk about

336
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah

337
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,040
I mean

338
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm gonna keep working on it because I would like to actually do like a little report on the show and and say this is

339
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,840
How the state of VR under Linux also?

340
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,800
I like just you know, we just want to get I just want to get wimpy's head in a VR headset and have them

341
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,080
See how cool it is. He's such a VR hater, you know, and he's gonna be out here for the Linux fest Northwest rumor has it

342
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,320
So it'd be the perfect opportunity to put his head in a VR headset and get his opinion and because I feel like maybe he

343
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,600
Hasn't really experienced a good VR right because I was a big see here's why I say this

344
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,960
I was like VR smear. Come on. Wake me up and we have holodecks, please

345
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,640
And then I got the oculus and I was like mind blow. Yeah, I had a moment

346
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,080
I had a moment and then ever since then I was all I was all in I thought it was pretty cool

347
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,640
So maybe we'll get a chance to get it working if anybody out there has any experience, please pass it along

348
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,060
Let us know what you dig go to the content we could do we could I tell you what here all the speed technologies to

349
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,980
The rescue if there's anyone out there that thinks I could set it up

350
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,260
Just get in contact with me and I'll get you remote it into that machine

351
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,220
There you go fresh nice fresh 1604 install and you just set it up for us

352
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,540
I'll be your remote hands like I'll plug this stuff in for you. Yeah, totally, you know, whatever

353
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,620
There's got to be somebody out keep on dreaming dude. Keep under maybe though, right? Maybe maybe. All right

354
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,700
That concludes our gaming section. There we go. Wrap it up. Yeah, I gotta wrap up

355
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,780
So anyways, you can find that met game link up in the show notes. This could be good news for all of you

356
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,700
Who are struggling with our org feeds that are under repair right now the mp3?

357
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,540
Technology the licensing program around certain mp3 related patents and software has been terminated

358
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,020
Mmm, isn't it one of them of like the four this would be I think the remaining and the reason why I say this is

359
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:00,420
On the front har website like the actual like patent holders of mp3. I have a post on their website

360
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Basically saying have at it

361
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,900
Really? Okay

362
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,180
They say we thank all of our licensees for their great support for making mp3 the de facto audio codec in the world during the past

363
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,980
Two decades the development they go into the development of mp3

364
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
But yeah, they say

365
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,820
They say that essentially mp3 is still very popular

366
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:25,820
However, most state-of-the-art media services such as streaming or TV and radio broadcasting use modern ISO MPEG codecs such as AAC or MPEG

367
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,540
H and that's what we're making our money. Yeah, and they make higher quality at much lower bit rates

368
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:36,860
And then they link you to the successful history of mp3 like they're done with it. Here's the history if you want to read about it

369
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:46,700
Yeah, they say the the the Technicolor mp3 licensing program for certain mp3 related patents and software for Technicolor and Fraunhauer IIS has been terminated

370
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,460
Hmm. I was thinking it doesn't mean it's now

371
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,780
I think this means it's free as in speech and it's freezing beer, but it's not like free like as in GPL code, right?

372
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,260
Yeah, I don't think it's yeah, it's definitely probably not GPL code

373
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,640
But I was under the impression that we still had some limitations on mp3 due to some existing patents. I could be wrong

374
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,660
Well, it's definitely not like just free code

375
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,380
But I think it means it's legit to I think it means it's safe now to redistribute it like straight up one. Yeah

376
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,340
Okay, that's a big deal today. I learned monkey calm

377
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,100
You want to do a follow-up on a discussion that Noah and Ryan had a few weeks ago. It looks like go ahead

378
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,140
Yeah, so I just installed the pop theme. Oh, yeah

379
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,220
Yeah, this is 76 GTK theme. What do you think a pop? Oh, it's freaking awesome

380
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,980
I mean, I know they're just starting out with it. But if this is what the next few years it's gonna handle for that. I

381
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,300
Mean it's they're doing it. They're doing it right. They're gonna get their users

382
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,460
Exactly what they need to have to make gnome a wonderful experience in Ubuntu now

383
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,360
What are they now? Did you also replicate the bar at the bottom like the OMG Ubuntu screenshot has?

384
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
No, no, I did mine on the side

385
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,700
You can play around with it, but just the theme itself

386
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,380
I mean, it's known so you can do whatever you want with it

387
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,700
But the theme itself is just really clean all the the icons pop everything looks good. And when you bring up Windows it just

388
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,820
They're making they're laying the groundwork so that when their users have it

389
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,300
They can use the system 76 theme and it just everything looks the way it's supposed to there's no hidden

390
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,140
Weirdness and they're gonna back it. That's the greatest thing about it. Yeah. Yeah, it is very bright

391
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,300
And some areas like the like they have the gnome tweak tool up and the like the remove buttons and the orange checkboxes

392
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
I feel like they're hitting me in the face a little bit

393
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,620
But I I also I like I like the shade of color they've chosen there. So it's I don't know

394
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,500
There's a theme. I think it's a great theme. Here's my question you start out on that and then you go to a

395
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,740
generic install

396
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,380
You know the nice thing about system 76 in the past has been you know

397
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,440
If I start if I bought a system 76 machine there might be a couple little tweaks like they turned off like, you know

398
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,980
The the auto logging privacy stuff. They'd shut a couple of those things up

399
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,100
But it the the system wasn't didn't look drastically different if I sat down at an Ubuntu machine

400
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,840
I knew I was sitting at an Ubuntu machine and

401
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,000
I feel like depending on how far they take this especially if it starts getting into the point where they start they put in

402
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,140
A dock or something like that, you know, does that does that then change that?

403
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:15,940
Essentially, I guess what I'm asking is have they just have they just forked the the time when we all just finally got settled on

404
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,820
A given desktop, right? When you say for it, you mean like the user experience in a sense, right? Yeah

405
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,220
Yeah

406
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,260
yeah, but I think we're talking apples and oranges there because conical supported the unity and

407
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,980
I know gnome has its own support structure, but there's not a commercial company behind them saying, you know

408
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,840
Do we this is what we're going to do? Well, I think system 76 does as a vendor

409
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,940
I don't think you just say here's my desktop whatever they do flies and I'll be okay with whatever they choose next year

410
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Yeah, I think yeah

411
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,860
I'm of two minds of this because my first thought is well, where do you draw the line because I've I've

412
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,980
You know

413
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,620
I've had I've had a big revelation recently about gnome extensions that I'd like to share with the class here in a second

414
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,300
But before I so before I before I defend them

415
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,600
I'll raise you my concern and my concern would be is what we end up with is essentially the

416
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,340
Bastardization that's happened to Android where you've got Samsung skin. You've got LG skin

417
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,080
You've got a moto skin and some vendors have a light skin

418
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,860
Some vendors have an entirely different UI with their own applications on top and it's a real shit show and what everybody pines for is

419
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,580
Just a good clean

420
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,620
Regular Android experience and that's why West has a pixel right there, right? That's where that's that's the market spoke

421
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,180
He said we don't want your customizations. We don't want your cut

422
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,180
We know you think you can add value

423
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,220
But the problem is you can't keep up with the pace of rapid development, right now

424
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:42,060
Gnome is not Android. Gnome is not developed or modified nearly at the rate that Android is and I gnome is a

425
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:50,660
product and project of limited means and limited resources and so it's within that context that I look at what system 76 is doing

426
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Not at the so not not

427
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,860
Comparing what they've done to like what Android has done or what other desktops like, you know

428
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,260
Cuz you could also say the same thing about we all know there's some Windows OEMs out there that have just crapped up Windows with

429
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,300
Their own start menu Lenovo and their own their own updaters and they just junked up Windows and nobody wants that either

430
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,700
So there's definitely a risk of that

431
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,640
The thing about gnome though is while it's a great desktop and I just recently switched back to it really enjoying it

432
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,340
Stays out of your way very efficient, but it's not enough

433
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,420
It just the thing is you have to have extensions with gnome

434
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,720
Because the team just doesn't have the time or resource to add everything that everybody wants in an entire world full of geeks and adding

435
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,820
To that what everyone wants is different with every person and you know, you look at the last few releases of gnome solid incremental improvement

436
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,980
But no moving of the gas pedal nothing that's freaking people out no big changes

437
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,160
And so there's there's really no massive progress that system 76 gonna fall behind by shipping their own theme

438
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,900
The risk of divergent user experiences is there. Mm-hmm

439
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,140
And that's I think we just have to wait and see how that plays out

440
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,740
But I think because because of what the reality of gnome is there is room for a vendor to improve on it

441
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,180
But they just can't go too far

442
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,580
And so system 76 like has to walk like this

443
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,460
They are not only gonna kind of create the line they have to walk but then they have to walk it like super tight and then

444
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,820
We're all gonna have the advantage of sitting back and go. Well, they did a good job or they didn't yeah

445
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,100
I don't know. I'm I so I share your reservations, but I almost feel like there's no path forward

446
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,180
Yeah, well the path for an alternative path forward might be we say we go to the gnome team

447
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,860
We say here are the things that we think that would really improve this experience. What do you think about it?

448
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,260
And then, you know collectively everyone that's all that's using gnome

449
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,780
Everyone that makes those decisions looks at it says yeah, we agreed that would be a you know

450
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,060
A way forward and then and then now we've improved it not just for system 76 customers

451
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,780
But for everyone that's using no, I feel like it took him forever just to get wadi updated like it was

452
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,580
Yeah, and I'm like, why do you guys care so much about the rounded corners of your menu?

453
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,660
But you don't care that your default theme looks like garbage like how does that work?

454
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,820
Mm-hmm, and I think their stance, you know what I thought I thought about their stance as well

455
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,340
The themes can be changed and that's why we build it this way

456
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,820
And so they're like building the core of what you need with the expectation part of me. I gotta be honest guys. I

457
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:03,300
Really hope that Ubuntu does not ship stock gnome in some ways because it's not that great. Yeah

458
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,380
It's really not that like there's not needs a spit shine right on a little bit

459
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,500
Yeah, like it needs a couple of things fixed up

460
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,100
But it you know, that wouldn't kill you to set a decent default background

461
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
It wouldn't kill you to turn on one or two extensions

462
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:21,100
You know really you whatever whatever you got done just in about five minutes of goofing around with numb the thing is what you got

463
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,620
To pretty quickly and you said it best

464
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,100
You just said it's pro you go from what looks like a hack on

465
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,340
Linux what everyone thinks of is like a Linux graphical desktop and you turn it into a

466
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Professional broadcast machine just by tweaking a couple of a little like things, right?

467
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,380
Like the dark menus and the dark windows and the in the smaller window borders and stuff like that

468
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,540
It just makes for a much more pleasing desktop

469
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:49,500
Yeah, I think if they just even I agree like if they check if gnome if gnome adopted a default theme of like arc or even

470
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,340
Numix or something like that, then I feel like we'd have a totally different conversation then I'd be like

471
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,220
Now I feel like system 76 is just trying to differentiate and you know make themselves, you know brand their desktop

472
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,940
Right, but right now as it stands, I feel like they don't really have a choice

473
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,780
I mean they almost have to in some interesting to see what it would take to get them to change things like the default theme

474
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
That's not very good. I

475
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,580
Don't know why it took them so long to begin with. Yeah

476
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,100
So we're gonna have a conversation about laptops here in a little bit

477
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,340
In fact, we had a question that came into the show about the setup you did on the Macbook

478
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,980
2013 so I thought we would get to that in a little bit

479
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,700
I also thought maybe we in the context that we could talk about Windows S and

480
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Microsoft's attack on Chromebooks and all of that. So we have a lot to get plus we still have Linux fest stuff

481
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,940
So let's stop and thank digital ocean for a moment digital ocean comm you go over there use the promo code

482
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,820
Do unplugged one word lowercase you apply that to your account after you've created it and then you get a $10 credit

483
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,060
You know, they're so you don't have they introduced high-memory droplets. You can get like over 220 gigs of RAM

484
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,260
They got block storage

485
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,100
You can attach you can attach like just a block device with a bitsy bitsy tight little bit of storage up to 16 terabytes of SSD

486
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,180
Storage now they're introducing it's in you can request early access right now. It's not finished but

487
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
high CPU droplets like

488
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:09,300
Maximum consistently fast lots of core big boy CPUs like there are some big compute jobs going down

489
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,020
DigitalOcean.com now if you're like me you just want to run a next cloud instance

490
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,740
It's great for that too

491
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,300
In fact, you can get started at $5 a month and you get a machine with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one

492
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,780
CPU a terabyte of transfer and all of the storage is SSDs all of it runs on KVM for the virtualizer Linux for the hyper

493
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:32,020
Yeah Linux for the host hypervisor. It's got 40 gigabit e connections into the data center right up to the VMs each VM

494
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,860
I mean we're talking can you imagine that I would love to see them

495
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,940
They actually have some pictures on their Instagram feed and it looks super

496
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:49,260
Whole thing just the whole thing. Yeah, it's it's so nice. I love I love DigitalOcean's interface too because it makes managing all this easy

497
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,220
We all know how to use it. It's straightforward. And then when we're done setting everything up

498
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,860
we just plug it up to the API and just

499
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,740
Push a few buttons tell the bots what to do after that

500
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,620
Just yell at the bots DigitalOcean.com use the promo code DO unplugged check them out

501
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,380
And also when you're there and you've got a machine set up and you want to do a little more with it

502
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,700
Take advantage of their really great documentation. They have I

503
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,360
Have a tutorial on Grey Log for Ubuntu 1604

504
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,020
They just posted seven days ago very very useful and also a tutorial on how to use the Python debugger

505
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,320
hosting multiple websites with nginx and HAProxy using LXD setting up

506
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,380
Yeah, I know setting up Debian setting up CentOS setting up webman

507
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,820
Lots of tutorials lots of open source projects to take advantage of your droplet once you have it going for experts or total beginners

508
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,300
Trust me, you can make it work go to DigitalOcean.com sign up and then apply our promo code DO unplugged

509
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,820
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program

510
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,620
So today Microsoft announced Windows 10 s it's not a joke

511
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,780
It is a simplified Windows Store only version of Windows for schools

512
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,620
The s stands for streamlined and performance guys

513
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,540
So jank

514
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,140
But this seems to be actually sort of exactly what valve was worried about why we got steam machines to begin with was this eventual?

515
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
Windows Store only

516
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,580
Closed down nature even though the you know

517
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,620
And I thought I thought when the Windows Store failed and that nobody bought stuff there that they wouldn't do this

518
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,380
But even despite the failure, this is what's so incredible about these rich corporations that can just burn cash doesn't matter

519
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,140
It doesn't matter like it. Oh, yeah, our stores been a total failure

520
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,580
Okay

521
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,700
The vision

522
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,780
Keeping the vision and they say that do you get better battery life when you can only run store apps that you don't have weird

523
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,980
Stuff updating in the background. They say it's better security

524
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,820
It's best for schools and they're gonna pair this with some of their hardware partners

525
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,340
They're gonna sell computers running Windows 10 s for 190 bucks

526
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,100
They have to they have to do this right because if they don't do this they are going to get overrun by Google and Chromebooks

527
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,560
Yeah, I'm gonna get over there as a raspberry pies and in Debian

528
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,740
They're gonna get overrun by all of the other all of the other hardware and software

529
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,160
Combinations that exist out there that don't require Microsoft Microsoft's licensing model

530
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,620
And and if they open it up and let people use apps

531
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:11,940
Then people would be running Windows these Windows s books with OBS and learning how to broadcast and they would be running open office or Google

532
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:19,180
Docs, so the only way they can prevent that is to force them to buy their applications through their store for their Windows book

533
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,100
That is specifically designed for education. It's really it's kind of a sad thing. Hmm. What do you think Wes?

534
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,620
I mean, it does seem like they kind of they have to do this

535
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:33,000
I imagine you can you know also sell the the schools on office 365 educational editions or whatever

536
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,580
So it is, you know you you get them in your platform and I do see I mean, it's it's kind of like iOS

537
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,380
I do see something like well, right

538
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,780
There may be some auditing capabilities of Windows Store apps other things. It may be a lower maintenance burden for IT staff

539
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,780
That's possible. I don't know for sure. I wouldn't

540
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,580
Having used Google Apps

541
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:56,900
You can drill down the management of Chromebooks like you would not believe down to down to what what what?

542
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,820
Icons are available on the Chromebook itself. So can that person go to this given site?

543
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,420
Can they click on this given link? Can they run this given application?

544
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:10,260
Application, you know down to that. So is there like a potential opportunity for Linux or for yeah

545
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,740
I guess we're like for regular Linux here in that will this make Windows more associated with this limited thing with well

546
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,100
See, here's my worry is it's a it's it's first of all

547
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,540
Probably not gonna be a lot of open source applications in the Windows Store, right?

548
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,780
So probably not gonna be getting GIMP in the in the Windows Store, right?

549
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,140
You're probably not getting Inkscape which would be great tools for schools, right just as an example

550
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,580
So on the low end you've got so much momentum around

551
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,300
Microsoft OEMs active directory Windows management that I could see it doing some serious actual credible damage to even

552
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,780
People that might be putting Ubuntu on library machines

553
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,660
So I'm worried on the low end that it's gonna eat away and then on the high end

554
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,540
They're also doing something else. So it's like a two-pronged approach on the high end

555
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,740
They have the thousand dollar surface laptop now, which is like their new developer machine

556
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,740
They got a big fancy video, but look at the verge and Microsoft has created a real laptop this time

557
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:07,280
So this is the surface book laptop and one of the things Microsoft's done with this sucker is its cloth on the inside

558
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:13,020
So they've and they've laser cut out the keys like they've yeah, they've really got they have a pixel sense

559
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,860
Super high resolution 1080p display on the thing. It's light as hell

560
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,060
It doesn't have any ports which seems to be what everybody actually has a couple ports

561
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:27,860
But you you get my drift. It has like one USB port one mini port dongles. It's got yeah, you gotta have dongles

562
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,380
So what are the chances I can run Linux on that weird cloth bad boy? I don't know honestly probably pretty good

563
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,580
I have an amazing luck running Linux on Microsoft. You try it. You try it. Oh nice. You try it

564
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,860
I feel like I don't want to give Microsoft any money

565
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,500
But I feel like it's gonna be a little bit before it's working but so they got a high-end thing here

566
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,580
They got you know, this is obviously going after your XPS 13. Yeah, you know those kinds of machines your Lenovo's

567
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,540
You're at your galago pros and they're claiming

568
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,860
14.5 hours of battery life if you use Windows S

569
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:03,940
It'll be great for all those VB developers. Yeah, right and they have integrated a vapor chamber into the aluminum chossy to

570
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:11,780
Give it better cooling out the rear standard for $9.99 is a core i5 version with 4 gigabytes of RAM

571
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,280
128 gigabyte SSD and it's gonna start shipping June 15th. Nice

572
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,920
4 gigs of RAM. Yeah, that's just that's unbelievably low. Yeah, but 999

573
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,040
So, you know when you get the $2,500 version will be everything you need

574
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,360
So they got you got this two-pronged approach. You've got you've got them going after Chromebooks and students

575
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,760
Oh also, I should have mentioned this Windows S Windows 10 s free for students and teachers

576
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,320
So that coming, you know all that coming have at it though

577
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,960
And I'll tell you what here's I made this prediction on ask no one you're actually seeing the start of it come up

578
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,400
You are gonna see Microsoft pivot to software as a service

579
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,320
And so they they'll give you the student and teacher version for free

580
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,040
And then once you go to the pro version, they're not gonna sell it to you

581
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
They'll just it'll be $39 a year

582
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,480
That's coming. It's not we've already seen it start with the high Cal license seats stuff is all subscription based now

583
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
so I mean it's

584
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,920
And that's a bad boat for everyone to be in because that's how I feel because here's the thing what you're gonna wind up with dumping

585
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,680
On the market to you're going to wind up with a bunch of people that get sucked in on a free thing before they can

586
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,960
Actually ever do anything interesting with it. They're going to have to pay a ransom fee. Yeah

587
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,680
So and Microsoft that's how Microsoft plans to stay in business

588
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Because they have to sell something and nobody's buying Windows

589
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
so

590
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,080
Mumble room anyone there have any thoughts on how free Windows is going to affect student and teacher adoption of Linux

591
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,760
What do you think monkey? I don't think it's gonna affect it. I

592
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:46,680
Just got I'm working with a school right now and the conversation is how do we get away from Windows and all of their?

593
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,320
requirements just for doing business with them, it's not an

594
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,560
with can you elaborate

595
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,920
well with

596
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,200
With Google, it's a web interface you log in and you basically manage everything remotely. You don't have any

597
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
infrastructure requirements

598
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Secretary at the front desk could set up a student where?

599
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,960
With Microsoft, it's not like that. It's just that they're they're they're barrier for entry is a lot higher, especially for small private schools and

600
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,560
That's something that you see a lot with these guys this is Microsoft comes in and they offer a lot of free stuff

601
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,600
But it's not free because you still got to buy the hardware. You still got to buy the infrastructure

602
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,560
And they're getting away they have a bunch of Macs that were donated to them

603
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,880
but they're having to get away from Mac because they put Apple TVs in every office and they and they

604
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Plugged them in so that the teachers could present their take their iPads

605
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,360
Oh really put presentations up and it completely destroyed their entire network because of all the Apple talk and the broadcasts and it

606
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah, the DNS just killed everything Larry's and but see that's how that's how these guys do it is they

607
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,440
They're not delivering a complete solution. Yeah, they're delivering just one component of it

608
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,700
And that's why I don't think that Microsoft is gonna take off as in the schools unless you have a vendor who's

609
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,600
Developing the whole solution and walking in there with a Microsoft solution, right? Right. Okay, that's fair

610
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,160
So I see come more people. So I wanted to go to arm one

611
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,120
He says not much Linux and UK schools to begin with go ahead arm

612
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:25,840
A lot of the schools in the UK are buying into the Microsoft stuff because of all the office 365

613
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,920
Oh, yeah, so that you can link all schools together and you can easily talk between teachers. What about Chromebooks?

614
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,280
Not much

615
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,520
Well, I've worked at a few schools and never seen one in a school

616
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,760
I mean the last school I worked at they were starting to go all-in on

617
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,780
like just getting dumb iPod the very basic iPods just to use as a it's like just an interface for

618
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,360
Smart boards and things that finding that I was cheaper than doing it any other ways, but you very rarely see like classes of

619
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:05,880
laptops in UK school sometimes but the school I were for if you know if I want to use laptops

620
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,760
We might have three sets of laptops for the entire school and then you've got you've got a book about whenever you want

621
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,800
Yeah, so you that's interesting interesting dynamic from the u.s. Because in the u.s. Chromebooks are like highly prevalent

622
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,720
Yeah, we just have hearts of them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, I mean you go into

623
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,900
You know you go into some of like the PC world see it and this may be maybe for

624
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,960
Old Chromebooks tucked into a back corner. Most people don't even know what they are how they work

625
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,280
and

626
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,240
As far as schools guy, I was having a conversation with our IT guy and saying, you know

627
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,760
He was saying that their head of IT with was looking at maybe Google classroom and stuff

628
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,480
But no one's really got the time to look into what it is and how it works and then Microsoft is saying, you know

629
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,360
I'll take more of our free stuff and we've made this new Microsoft team speak

630
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,480
Bulls, you know just utter crap for that replaces this thing, but we're not going to turn that old service off

631
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,680
So now you've got you've got SharePoint and you've got 365 and you've got this and you've got that and you've got and none of the

632
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
Teachers know what the hell is

633
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,160
All right. Hmm. That is very good insight. Thank you very much

634
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,120
I that's good to hear is just even for another perspective Swift

635
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,520
You kind of are on my train of thinking where I'm like, well crap

636
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,800
Is this another market opportunity that Linux could be about to miss out on if Microsoft can come along all of a sudden and offer?

637
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,080
Windows machines for 180 bucks 190 bucks all of a sudden the entire rules have changed. What do you think?

638
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Do you think this is yet another maybe?

639
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
Opportunity slipping between our fingers

640
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,080
Yes, I really do. I mean Linux has been around for a long time

641
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,240
I mean we get to the point like with with Vista missed opportunity

642
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:47,160
We got eight missed opportunity. We got ten again missed opportunity. When are we gonna have our stuff together?

643
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,640
So that we can really compete with the other stuff that's out here

644
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,280
I'm tired of these people with their shiny little Macs and they're pretty little little computers

645
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,960
Just use Linux for crying out loud and do what you got to do and stop paying all this money for the stupid crap that

646
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,800
We just don't have to do like our turn. It's our turn

647
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,240
Aren't you supposed to be giving up already? Give up on this market. Damn it

648
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,360
I'm with you man. I'm with you

649
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,600
I my only my only thought on it is you know

650
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,920
There is such a there can be in some of the schools not always but there can be a tinkering element and that tinkering

651
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,780
element often leads to Linux and open source and right it's it there's something about open source and maybe even canoe and and the

652
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,780
GPL in particular that

653
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,940
Feels very in line with sort of the core principles of continuing education or fundamental education

654
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,640
Like there's something about it that feels like a really organic fit and there's something about

655
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,220
Licensing and proprietary software that to me has the feeling of walling off knowledge and holding not holding knowledge

656
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,800
Whereas open source is about learning and sharing and improving which is what education should be about too

657
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,100
So it doesn't limit exploration creativity. You can do whatever you want with it

658
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,680
So there is like to me it feels like a really fundamental

659
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,360
Fit that is almost long-term too hard to deny

660
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:13,440
But there's also practical commercial budgetary things that are very real in schools, too. So you just I

661
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,520
Don't know. We'll see where it goes

662
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:15,800
You know

663
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,280
I remember when Windows 10 was about to be released and the tech press was so

664
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,280
Stinking positive and if you guys recall

665
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,900
Windows 10 was given away to everybody for free initially. Well in their defense

666
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,280
Windows 10 was a drastic improvement over Windows 8

667
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,080
They had a reason to because after Windows 8 it was like met geez the DOS would be an improvement, you know

668
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,880
Yeah, yeah, I guess well both of them you can only have the one app open at the time so

669
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,560
All right. Do you think we should make a video to sell it to like pitch it to the people?

670
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,760
That'd be good. That'd be a good Noah. That'd be a good Noah video. Like oh, yeah

671
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,360
Yes, what AltaSpeed should get into is the education market. Oh, yeah, maybe although that's pretty budget constrained

672
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,880
But I imagine hospitality is too. Yeah. Yes

673
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,840
So, I don't know. I mean once you get in there like you can you know

674
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,280
if you get a right school you can I some of the fun some funnest work I did in some ways was at schools just

675
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,000
Because there isn't the that quite quite the like we have this site has to go live on Monday morning

676
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,880
So we can start taking orders kind of pressure. Yeah, that's not there

677
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,760
But it's still if we need to do a good job

678
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,480
But it's not going to be in the end of anyone's careers if this goes south either

679
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,760
That's a nice environment even if it's budget constrained because you still get a little creative

680
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Linux is a good fix for a lot of that stuff

681
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,600
But there's still scale that you get to play with and there's you know

682
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,320
Really busy hours and there's privacy that you have to take into consideration

683
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,000
So it's still it's still a very challenging and interesting environment to work in

684
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,840
So yeah, I'd be at the end of day you're helping kids like that's that's great

685
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,860
Yeah, so as long as you just give me a little off the top for that recommendation

686
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,860
I think you should totally get into it now. Yeah

687
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,560
Send all support to crazy Jupiter broadcasting.com. Does that work like that? Does it work? Oh, okay three-year SLA

688
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Three years have you ever emailed that man?

689
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
You

690
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,520
Know what that is not it is I have actually gotten to emails like they're three years old

691
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,120
I've been like hey, thanks for email, and I'm sorry. I just got to this it came up on a search

692
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,120
And yeah, I've done that before

693
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,520
Boy, when I once I went once I left for Texas the inbox just kind of went yeah

694
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,740
Well, you didn't have many before that so I can understand how they drastically changed your outlook

695
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,520
You know what I got to do is I got to get a really good email program on my phone

696
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,160
Have you seen some of these like there's Google inbox. That's not bad

697
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,480
Yeah

698
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,920
You do I'm a really big fan. I just started using a new one. It's called because you were

699
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,360
Before you were using one that I'd like canine canine. Yeah, yeah now

700
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm on a program called blue male, and we have a blue man by far my favorite thing about it

701
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,320
is I can swipe left and mark it as later or done and

702
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,760
That allows me to to archive that message and then come back like that's a task. Yeah, I like blue male

703
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,200
Yeah, yeah, the task angle is is a nice man. Yeah, what I'm using a lot on inbox

704
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,640
I'm Felix. I feel like I'm already using gmail, so it's not like I'm right. It's just a layer on top

705
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:08,960
Yeah

706
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,080
I like the remind me about this at this day at this time feature because it's like okay

707
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,600
I I have certain days that I deal with this kind of work and so I'm gonna set it for a minder on that day

708
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,440
An inbox you can use with other mail service for us cuz I'm on a fast new new new no

709
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,040
That's why I really like about blue males. Yeah, I use it with fast mail

710
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,560
You don't have to have all the privacy stealing compromises of Gmail right right you know

711
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,200
You know speaking of mobile phones ting. That's what you do

712
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,440
You go there get a deal go to linux.ting.com get $25 off one of these phones

713
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,320
You want to get a new mail app on your phone first got to start with a phone?

714
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,040
That's math guys

715
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,320
That's that is phone math linux.ting.com is where you go if you have a compatible phone

716
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,000
And you just might they got CDMA and GSM

717
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,920
Then you'll get $25 in service credits you bring it over to their

718
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,320
BYOD page you look at all the dirty details, and they'll tell you if it's gonna work on ting or

719
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Or take a shortcut

720
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,560
Call up ting and talk to a real human being and just ask them

721
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,200
They'd be more than happy to work with you the fact that they have CDMA or GSM is big for me, too

722
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,720
If you go on road trips like I do or you travel every now and then huge or heck

723
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,520
You're just gonna move and you don't know what the cell service is gonna be like right go with ting

724
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,760
Yeah, or you know just have fun and experiment like if you get like a Nexus device

725
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,560
I've in the past just let's let's go to an area and I'll activate this one

726
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,560
And then I'll put it in and then I have the other one active and I just switch between them

727
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,720
And you know it's a little bit of hassle, but not bad and on the newer devices

728
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:33,160
It's even easier and just do a speed test. I offered to give a wimpy a timsling. Oh really yeah for what he's out here

729
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,080
Yeah, he has global roaming, so he doesn't need it, but I was like hey

730
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,840
Hey coming to the US do you need a SIM card cuz I can hook you up, bro

731
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,680
I could hook you up

732
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,920
That's awesome, dude

733
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,920
And they have a really great control panel to the let's you manage all aspects of your account set limits alerts turn things off

734
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,320
So like right now not driving to Texas don't need my team if I on it's great

735
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,320
You know and the other thing is even if I left it on it's six dollars a month for the line

736
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,160
That's it those are the kind of things that are other providers that feel like you're like breaking a rule or doing something shady

737
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,280
But I think they're like no that this is your plan your minutes like just use them when you or you know feeling bad for

738
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,560
Having like a $30 a month device in your not use yeah, but if routine it's six bucks

739
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,160
And then it's just when you use it you pay for the usage just minutes message in megabytes and whatever you use

740
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,280
That's what you pay and six dollars for the line is so simple so straightforward bring a device buy one from ting

741
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,360
They don't care just try them out. They also have a calculator

742
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,320
You can see how much you would save and a blog that's full of good tips even if you're not yet a ting customer

743
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,060
Just go to linux dot ting dot com linux dot ting dot com and a big

744
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,740
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

745
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,360
Big event coming up, and this is almost the perfect representation of how this event works

746
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,840
This know what do you agree if you disagree? I'm sure you'll speak up

747
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,360
me

748
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:53,060
Really next fest Northwest has the possibility of becoming the largest community organized event in the United States yes

749
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,120
and I

750
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:01,600
Love these guys, but they really got some problems still right now their websites down. They got a Drupal issue

751
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,600
It looks like they're my SQL server is down

752
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,840
They have issues on the website. They say still on the website say it's gonna be announcing their schedule in the coming weeks now

753
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,480
I'm not saying any of this to criticize. I am pointing out that this is truly a lug run event

754
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,160
It is like an event of the people and there's certain things

755
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,960
They're stronger at right like putting on a hell of a good event, and there's certain things

756
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,480
They're not so strong at like planning a whole bit of it. Yeah

757
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,440
Love about it, dude. We not polished. It's not I mean, but it but it works right as we know it's gonna happen

758
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,920
We're gonna be there, and it's gonna be awesome being in contact. You know from the broadcasting side

759
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,600
We get a lot of behind-the-scenes things that you know we don't necessarily share with a lot of other people and

760
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,360
basically all suffice to say that a lot of things in the Linux landscape are changing a little bit and there is a

761
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,720
Opportunity here for Linux fest to become the Linux fest to go to

762
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,120
So if we could get some of these issues worked out

763
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,420
That'd be really great because and even if they don't work them out to be honest with you. Just show up

764
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,200
That's my answer people ask me. They're like I couldn't register because the just show up

765
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,720
Oh, yeah

766
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,460
Just show up if you if you have trouble just show up and if you if anyone gives you if anyone gives you know

767
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,200
You will not be turned away. You know the sites back up now

768
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
So maybe that's good you know, but I've heard

769
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,840
They're getting a lot of traffic

770
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,160
Maybe that's it maybe they're getting you know and they just have it on some like in a little server

771
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,680
And now it's getting a bunch of traffic office

772
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,320
I wouldn't put it past these guys to be running this on about Raspberry Pi

773
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,960
No, there's a kind of thing they would do totally the slackware server x486 there crashed

774
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,960
We bought a restart there was a time there would so you know it's May 6th and 7th

775
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,160
we're gonna be streaming it live at jblive.tv if you want to check it out and

776
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,880
It also be where we record the last Linux action show. Mm-hmm. Wow. Wow, that's crazy. That's wow end of an era

777
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:50,480
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then almost immediately we launched into whole new projects user air comes back the Linux action news show

778
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,100
It's gonna be big Joe and I are getting really ready. We're going through final things now on the show so exciting

779
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,480
Yeah, it is. It is really it is really fun

780
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,040
It's been a long time since I've done something like this and I think it's gonna be a big big hit

781
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,240
I hope I hope people like it. We'll see maybe they'll hate it

782
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,780
I don't know. Well, you'll get some of both. That's just a guarantee. Yeah. Yeah, and then I'll just switch to vlogging full-time

783
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:19,400
Anyway, so when you have time to edit as yeah as is always as is always the case when the Linux fest is near

784
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:26,460
We like to punish ourselves. We like to punish our bodies. We like to punish our mental spirit stomachs

785
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:31,320
We like to punish. Yes, we definitely punish our stomachs and we punish equipment too, by the way, Wes

786
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,500
Sorry, you may have bad lighting for text now

787
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Yeah

788
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,900
Yeah, we have that why you look so good on Sunday. Yeah, we did

789
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,740
We actually did not have the right lighting on Sunday either. So since last Friday

790
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:49,820
Well, yeah since last Friday Todd has it only been a week. We've been basically so much longer than who he said not

791
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,460
Yeah, not even no, but it's been the Friday before last right? Oh, yeah, that's right. Okay, that feels better. Yeah the Friday before last

792
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,880
It's been a lot of work. We started we ripped out everything in the studio pulled out every single wire

793
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,840
Every everything we were down to the four walls in the ceiling for a while. Yeah, boy, and then we've been

794
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
And that was the last time a Mac was in here

795
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,520
And it's just ever knows. Those were the first two things I took out

796
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,960
Like literally I unplugged it carried it out and I was like, okay now we can go with the rest

797
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,360
Just set it in the backyard. Let it graze. I

798
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,040
Was actually nice to it stay on target

799
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,840
Stay on target. No, then we we rebuilt

800
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,400
with a with around around a couple of core ideas

801
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
we rebuilt with the idea of

802
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:40,720
Supporting the production of the new shows and now the existing shows we have so this studio was built for a different set of requirements

803
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,560
And now we essentially rebuilt the studio for the new set of requirements

804
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,040
So that was the first thing then the second thing we built it around was all Linux. So everything's Linux

805
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,240
Even down to our mixer, which is Linux

806
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,200
We we put everything everything around that and then of course, that's really the third thing because the mixer is so huge

807
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,520
which is not a final mixer, but

808
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,920
It's all kind of built around that so we've we've we've made a lot of changes

809
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,800
We've made I can't I can't show it on camera, but we've made additional room for guests

810
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,160
So we'll be able to have guests in studio mic'd up be able to hear everybody. It's way more like clean and efficient

811
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
Yeah, it's lots more

812
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,200
My favorite part of the whole studio renovation is after ten years Chris finally found where he wanted his microphone. Yeah

813
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,720
Yeah, actually he's not kidding. So for the first time in ten years really eleven years of brought actually twelve years because I

814
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
Before Jupiter broadcasting I had a couple of things

815
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,600
I could never ever every time you buy a microphone stand on a boom stand

816
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,120
It comes with a desk lamp and something that you can drill into your desk

817
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:41,920
Mm-hmm, and I've never been able to commit to it because you know when video production like I some I'm moving stuff around all the time

818
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,160
And you're almost for every shoot like I have a dive a laptop this time this next time

819
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,440
I'm doing a capture the next time it's two people and so you just can't be static and you can't just lock things down

820
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,640
And so did we or did we not just nail the position of that finally after ten years?

821
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,240
I found the perfect spot. No, I got it drilled there drilled it in my hand actually

822
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
with his brown bear muscles and

823
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:11,120
And then we finally actually mounted a a microphone to the table. It's fixed in place. You can move around. It's great

824
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
It's on it. It's on a gesticulating arm. I

825
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,120
Enjoy

826
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,240
So it's an almost perfect position we've got a touchscreen over here for something I'm about to talk about

827
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,500
The all of this is it's really built around now making higher quality productions better better than ever

828
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,880
Wes is at least I hope but to my to my left here. We're running something called caster soundboard

829
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,720
It was a project that was created for a juke for Jupiter broadcasting by a coda radio listener caster soundboard is

830
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:48,000
Sort of a recreation of proprietary software that's available for macOS to do a production soundboard, you know, we're like we

831
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,040
Fire off sounds like that. This is written in c++ and q5. It's GPL

832
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,800
It's up on github you go to github.com slash Jupiter broadcasting to see it and

833
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
It's really close to being perfect

834
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:05,680
It just needs a few tweaks and we have open issues for what needs to be fixed and we're hoping

835
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,200
We're hoping maybe folks in the community would be willing to work with

836
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,320
That yeah, so I don't know if it shows up on the webcam here

837
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,640
So for those of you watching the video over here, we have a this is a 1080p

838
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,320
21 inch Dell touchscreen monitor and I can I can try you want me to try it?

839
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,440
We have one clip in there

840
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,720
This is this is from the open source soundboard running on Linux using a touchscreen and it's got a little button right there

841
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,440
But let's see. That's dark dirt dirt. Did you not hook up the USB port? Never mind?

842
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,840
No, it is no it is fast looking up the

843
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,800
USB card I was I jumped ahead. But anyways, isn't that look great Wes like from what you know

844
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,780
You've seen my past soundboard setup. This is this is it right here. This is a this is a dedicated soundboard setup

845
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:51,240
It's got multiple tabs. It's all written and cute. It's essentially touchable. It's not perfect, but it's touchable

846
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,480
Oh, it's muted. There we go. This is from this is it right here

847
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,820
And one of the things that's really nice is every button is triggerable by a keyboard

848
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,260
But what I'd also like is I'd like each tile to be pressable and playable. I'd like it to be

849
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,300
And if the volume slider was a little bit bigger, I'd be able to slide volume and stuff like that

850
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,820
So it's really really close. We don't have the ability currently to save or export soundboard

851
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:22,580
So if the application closes you lose the entire soundboard, so there's details in there that here's your principal

852
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,700
Here's how here's how here's how he prompts work out of me. This is how he gets free labor

853
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,300
He just he's like a soundboard up yet. I'm like, yeah, you know

854
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,100
Close but he's like, well, I could get a dungu and a MacBook. Go get the MacBook in here

855
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Come on no, you don't want a Mac in here do you?

856
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,260
So we find a developer we're like, yeah

857
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,220
But if there's anyone out there that wants to work on this do we have links in the coder radio show notes?

858
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,740
Yeah, I'll put them in here too. Yeah, and it's you can also just find it

859
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:52,680
We have it pinned at the top of github.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Sweet. Yeah, it'd be really because oh, here's the thing Noah

860
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,540
tell me the thing is

861
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,940
there's a few open source projects that we've now been involved with like show bot and a

862
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,340
Couple other things like pod publish and whatnot that I think we can help out and we can you know

863
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,180
And people have like there's like many podcasts now that use some of the stuff

864
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,260
We've written a j-bot sure and they have their own title

865
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,740
Suggestion systems and all that kind of stuff and it's helped podcasters

866
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,140
Mm-hmm, and I think this is another one because it there's nothing that says it has to run on Linux

867
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,260
I mean, that's what we're using it for but other but if it's just an open source soundboard

868
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,620
I think that'd be useful for people in general not just Linux users. Yeah, it could be a very big

869
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:31,540
No, actually, I would not mind if nobody ever bothered to fork it outside of Linux and we just and that became

870
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:38,940
Like you want the world's best podcasting sound where you're gonna run Linux. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe we could get there

871
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:45,240
I'm not the thing just be and stand on but could just be an AUR or flat pack away or maybe a snap package one day

872
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,060
Either way, if you if you'd like to help us boy

873
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:53,260
Would we appreciate it because it would basically improve all of the Jupiter broadcasting shows and it's really the last thing that the Mac's better

874
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:58,180
At in here like I can objectively say in my opinion everything else in here that we've replaced with

875
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:03,220
Amazing is the only thing the Mac can do is play random clips, isn't that stupid?

876
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,140
But I mean in terms of what you actually say it all out

877
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,900
Yeah, I kind of but if you actually had you ever done it as a living and used to use a soundboard before you understand

878
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,860
It is a very piece important piece of equipment because it's not just about playing stupid noises

879
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,220
It's also how the music's done in the show right intros outro. Yeah, like it's it's actually a pretty critical piece of equipment

880
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,020
So you want it to work right and right objectively?

881
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:28,100
It's the only piece of software slash equipment that we've replaced that is a very much a downgrade

882
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,980
Everything else has been an upgrade in terms of performance reliability functionality

883
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,780
All of it and then obviously the fact that it's free and open source

884
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,340
Yeah, this would be the one thing that is not quite there

885
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,420
But it's so I'd say it's like 60% of the way

886
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:45,640
I think it's like 60% of the way and what's amazing is it was put together by you remember the community member guy that he

887
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,060
Was Xerox was it Xerox? No, no, he's the guy that may be working up, but it started with a C

888
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:55,860
Yeah, I wish I hadn't but anyways, he was so super cool worked with me before and we kind of a couple people work on

889
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,860
We also had a web-based one that was worked on this

890
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:03,700
We really like this one because we have the touchscreen here. Yeah, you can you can just see looking at that how useful that would be

891
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,740
So yeah

892
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,460
Caster soundboard and when we get it done, it could be something that takes off wouldn't just be for podcasting either

893
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,460
Mm-hmm. Could just be fun to have a soundboard

894
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,860
What you want to go we should probably get going in a little bit

895
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,060
But I wanted to talk a little about laptops and battery life

896
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,740
Yeah, so why don't we start with a question that came into the subreddit by a pursue doof?

897
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,020
I think is he had a question about the setup on the MacBook

898
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,380
Running Linux arts Linux on the 2013 MacBook and I said, you know, essentially system

899
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:36,140
D boot was what was used to do the boot management. I use the built-in you if I manager the Mac has when you hold

900
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,980
Down the option key to get to that point

901
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,820
and the Linux dash MacBook package from the AUR were some of the bigger like

902
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,780
Important components and so he followed up with a couple of specific questions, and I thought maybe I'd talk to you

903
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,860
He said as you know

904
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:56,340
Do we see of a way to switch between the integrated Intel GPU and the dedicated Nvidia because I think the way we did my config

905
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,260
Was just dedicated Nvidia all the time. I think that's right

906
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,460
Yeah, so that was one thing he wanted something on so I don't know if we have that don't know that that's worth looking into

907
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,040
You though and then he also and this is one I will toss out to the audience if yet

908
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,900
If you what would you guys do for snapshots?

909
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,660
Would you go with LVM? Would you do ZFS?

910
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,820
Would you do butter FS clonezilla if you want to do snapshots of your system?

911
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:22,380
My personal take would be clonezilla, but did you have any I would do clonezilla? Yeah. I mean, I guess it depends on how

912
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:27,620
How frequently what kind of downtime are you willing to support?

913
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:32,100
What what is your use case and how comfortable are you experimenting if you're okay with LVM?

914
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,540
I think LVM snapshots have gotten a lot better in recent years

915
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,240
If you're okay

916
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,140
If you're already experienced with ZFS then just do that because you'll have a great time with it if you know how to use it

917
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:45,660
Administer it if not then definitely don't do that and yeah, maybe clonezilla or something where sure you it's not as frequent

918
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,140
It's not like just instant, but you know it's reliable understandable thing

919
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,000
I like about the thing I like about clonzilla is I can store it totally off the machine

920
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:59,020
To receive I mean yeah, oh yeah, you could do that. Yeah, I would say this though. I

921
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,660
Was also of the mindset that I better have snapshots for this MacBook because I know it's gonna break on me

922
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,580
Just like the pseudo devs just thinking of and it really has been fine. I've done many kernel updates

923
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:14,420
I think I even I even did an like a complete OS upgrade to Final Cut OS Sierra

924
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:19,940
And I think it's nothing was affected like I just hold down the option key and choose Linux, and it's just fine

925
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,780
It's great. Yeah, so I I found it to be pretty reliable

926
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,940
I was surprised how reliable it was on there

927
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,800
So you might just give it a go, but I did notice one thing that's definite

928
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,500
It's obvious that the battery life under Final Cut OS

929
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:39,340
when not editing is superior to just Linux you know just say you're browsing the web and

930
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:45,420
And Final Cut OS is gonna switch between the Intel and video graphics whereas Linux is always on the Nvidia graphics

931
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,420
right, but the battery life difference is like

932
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,780
Seven and a half hours to an hour and a half to two hours like it's a huge matter

933
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,700
It is a big difference

934
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,740
And I I don't know what is going on with Linux battery life right now because across all my laptops

935
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,060
It's not really where it should be it's not that bad. That's the worst but across all of them

936
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,780
Mmm. It seems like it's have you noticed this have you have you struggled with this?

937
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,460
I know you were saying a co-worker struggled with this recently yeah, you know I did

938
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:14,100
I did know someone in my life who you know he's done Linux stuff for a long a long time

939
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,100
He uses it at work

940
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,220
You know very good on the command line had no he's like hadn't dabbled that much in the desktop side of Linux

941
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,500
And so he you know got himself a new laptop. I'm not sure which one

942
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,620
Installed the latest Ubuntu on it and just had a hell of a time

943
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,820
You know getting anything like decent bad, but I don't think he did any configuration

944
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,500
But just running out of the gate you know he installed it kind of got us up and running boom batteries dead

945
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,580
Which is not a great first run experience, and he'd already you know when he came with Windows

946
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,900
And we just ran at that it was you know eight eight hours of battery life. Oh easy

947
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,140
And so you know I was kind of like we were I was talking people who are

948
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:48,060
It's like okay. Well we start giving them some tips about what to do, but it's like okay

949
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,780
Well is there ever are we ever gonna get to a point where you know even?

950
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,500
mainstream distros have some of these changes out of the gate or

951
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,340
Optionally for a couple distros like Ubuntu Mate edition does some decent battery

952
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:05,020
Loving tweaks out of the box that some other distros don't do so I know that's one of them

953
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:11,420
But yeah, so there is some distro differential as you might say a distro the diff the distro differential indeed

954
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:17,700
But it's still I think across the board since I really would say since kernel 4. It's just been shit I

955
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,660
Think it's gone down. I think it's yeah, I think it's been bad since version 4 of the Linux kernel

956
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,900
I don't really think it's ever come back up

957
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,620
And I don't really care so it's not like I talk about it very often because to me

958
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,780
I just need my better to last long enough between where I have plugs

959
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:32,740
Right you know it's funny. I'm in a totally different boat for me

960
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,380
I need my battery to last only from the time. I leave my house

961
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,580
So time I get back because I won't have plugs usually do you know you get great battery life

962
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:44,660
Yeah, you know about 16 hours well, but then again. I have there's three batteries in that ThinkPad. You know effectively so

963
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,560
Not the best test. Yeah, I see what you mean there. Yeah, I so does anybody in the virtual log

964
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,660
there have anything that they do to save battery life like maybe TLP or

965
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,420
Powertop because I know those are things you can do with power top for example

966
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,740
You can at least get a sense of what's draining your battery, which is a very useful tool

967
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:05,340
But that's maybe old-school is there new things people are using to figure out what's sucking down battery life

968
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,580
I'd love to know any new tips because from where I'm at I feel like I have a limited set of tools really track it down

969
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:16,040
Earlier I'll add it to the show notes architect in the IRC room posted a good link that kind of had a rundown

970
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:22,420
These days it seems like TLP is the most popular at least what people are talking about the most and seems to be the most

971
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,540
up-to-date or most modern

972
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,900
and

973
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:30,340
And you know is one of the ones laptop mode tools being the other one where you know you can kind of just install it

974
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:35,880
And generally forget about it. I think TLP has less config that you might want to do or able to do

975
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,040
So if that might just work for you, and then of course yeah

976
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,060
There's power top which can be very useful especially if you're just trying to understand things you're writing your own

977
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,980
You'd have rules, or you're just like oh. Yeah, it's it's this thing all the time

978
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:49,660
I'm just gonna disable that hardware or not use that program and

979
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,460
Sandy bridge and was that the was that the Intel release that you hated no I hated

980
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:00,500
Sky like sandy bridge and sky like if I recall both had issues like with their p-state driver

981
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,300
Where which screws with like the CPU scaling and just burns battery life like crazy, too

982
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,440
So that hasn't helped either and that was an Intel problem

983
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,500
That's not really a mean it's a Linux kernel problem because it's in the kernel right, but it's Intel code

984
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,420
And I feel like we're just kind of getting that solved in like 412

985
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,620
I think yeah

986
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:21,180
Didn't we just have a new release come out like today or yesterday to of the Linux from I think 411 just yeah

987
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,700
Yeah, and that's not in there. I don't think but I'm not sure did you you did a little rundown of it

988
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Did you see that in there when you were doing it didn't?

989
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,220
No, that's a good question. Yeah, I didn't see it in there when I went I went through your notes

990
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,340
Wested a nice little breakdown of what was in there

991
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:38,620
We never even put it in the show, but it happened during our show prep period and I saw it in there

992
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:42,820
It's like okay that might be something worth talking about but that's still not I still doesn't fix it on

993
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:49,220
Yeah, yeah, you mostly called out LZ for improvements to software raid and sip hash

994
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,780
which

995
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,420
Sounds interesting. Yeah, this is a new hash algorithm that people are

996
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:00,420
But not a piece a driver fix not a not a really not we'll have to go review the kernel newbies

997
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe it's maybe it's something buried in the details there

998
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,260
But I know that's been that's also been part of what's causing this

999
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,700
I know I know from reading some like of Matthew Garrett's older posts

1000
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,700
Remember him talk about you know these days more and more things are being combined not to like one chipset or linked together

1001
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,780
Whereas it's separately they used to be you know more separate components

1002
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,140
And so now you have to get the power states right on all the components for the group of them to power down sufficiently

1003
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,900
So that's not helping us very much. No, that's

1004
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,340
complicated yeah

1005
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:33,580
Well, I guess I would say this if you have a great tool for sort of tracking this problem down

1006
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,820
Or you if you've solved it on a more recent

1007
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:41,540
Ubuntu or or or distro because one of the other problems I have is when I when I looked I did see some stuff

1008
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,740
But mostly what I saw was like really old guides. Mm-hmm. I'm like is this from 2009?

1009
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
I don't think that's a good idea

1010
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:54,460
so I would kind of like to see something maybe submit a few articles for the subreddit Linux action show dot reddit comm or

1011
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,860
You can send them in directly to the show go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact and put it in that way

1012
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,620
Maybe I know power tops

1013
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:06,260
I mean so those ones the basics we know but some other cool ways to track it down like one thing I was thinking about

1014
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,180
this is really stupid, but like if it's just something you wanted to stay on top of all the time and just sort of

1015
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:17,220
Whittle it down is what would happen if you just put a temperature sensor extension on gnome and just look to the devices

1016
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:22,180
They're running hot all the time and track it down that way like if your CPUs seems like it's running hot or your GPU is

1017
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,700
Something hitting that more than it should yeah

1018
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:29,280
I could at least give you an indication that something's working hard because the power obviously would translate to heat somewhere

1019
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,100
Yeah, so it might be a way to start mr. Mr. Noah before we go

1020
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,980
