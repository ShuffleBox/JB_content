WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
I was just getting nostalgic about modems this morning and that sound that they make and

00:04.620 --> 00:08.920
I don't know if it was just serendipity or what but you found the perfect

00:09.760 --> 00:16.280
Perfect open source tool this week. It's pretty cool. West. It's called wave share wave share. It's serverless

00:16.280 --> 00:19.040
It's peer-to-peer. It's local file sharing

00:19.640 --> 00:23.320
Through sound I like all of those words. Yeah, it's using WebRTC. Oh

00:23.960 --> 00:27.720
Signaling is performed through sound no server side is required

00:27.720 --> 00:34.080
You just unplug headphones turn on a microphone and get another computer to listen and you can transmit data

00:34.080 --> 00:40.640
So I'm going to send about this is about a 40 megabyte file and I'm going to send it at the fast speed

00:40.640 --> 00:43.880
They have normal fast fastest and ultrasonic

00:43.880 --> 00:46.080
I'll do fast so that way we can actually hear it

00:46.080 --> 00:50.820
And if you were on the receiving side if you'd gone and we'd set up a session

00:50.820 --> 00:57.580
This would actually be transferring a file to you. You ready? This is what it sounds like. It's it's pretty neat. Oh

01:03.660 --> 01:09.980
That's it. Oh, it's transmitted. Isn't that cool? That's fascinating. I love that. It's so you can find it

01:09.980 --> 01:12.460
We'll have a link in the show notes. It's actually kind of hard to search for

01:13.140 --> 01:16.480
Wave dash share is what you would Google but just go to

01:16.480 --> 01:23.000
Linux unplug calm slash 248. We'll have it there at the top of the links. It's so neat. It's like bringing the modem back

01:24.520 --> 01:29.600
This is Linux unplugged episode 248 for May 8th 2018

01:40.360 --> 01:44.080
Whoa, welcome to Linux unplug your weekly Linux talk show

01:44.080 --> 01:51.000
That's watching all of the keynotes from Microsoft Google and Red Hat all at once and putting it all into something

01:51.000 --> 01:55.520
That's actually interesting. At least we hope my name is Chris. My name is Wes. That's right Wes

01:55.520 --> 02:03.240
It is a packed Tuesday Google Microsoft and Red Hat are all up on stage as we record and they're all talking about

02:03.240 --> 02:06.040
Linux not entirely but it's a lot of Linux

02:06.040 --> 02:12.440
We'll cover a couple of moments from Red Hat summit and from Google I owe that I think matter to our listeners

02:12.440 --> 02:19.040
Plus we got a bunch of community news. We've already got speculation on the next version of Ubuntu and I I

02:19.480 --> 02:26.160
Got really deep into Fedora this weekend, and I did some things. I want to hear about them. I made some changes

02:26.160 --> 02:30.040
Oh, no, so I'm gonna tell you all about it. I did. I'm a maniac when it comes to that

02:30.040 --> 02:32.400
I don't know. I I am officially a Linux nomad

02:32.400 --> 02:37.120
I just hop around a lot, but I think I have the perfect setup this weekend is sitting for Mike Ubuntu workstation

02:37.160 --> 02:39.840
SSH into Fedora 28 cloud instances. I

02:39.840 --> 02:42.680
Consolidated three servers down into one

02:42.680 --> 02:47.280
I'll tell you why I did it and what really made it click for me and why I think I'm going all-in on Fedora

02:47.280 --> 02:49.280
28 on my servers for these jobs

02:49.800 --> 02:55.840
Wow, I never thought okay. I'm going LTS on the desktop and for door 20. You're a bad man

02:55.840 --> 03:02.160
I got a good reason though, and I'll tell you all about that coming up in the show plus we always have those folks

03:02.640 --> 03:08.200
In that virtual look time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hey, yo, what's up, Jedi? Oh

03:08.200 --> 03:09.720
Oh

03:09.720 --> 03:14.160
Come on. We got more than that. Come on. There's more than that. I've got it. Come on guys. You gotta be food

03:14.200 --> 03:16.200
Yeah, I'm hiding

03:17.320 --> 03:19.080
Well, I'm glad to have you on there Jen

03:19.080 --> 03:23.880
It's nice to have you sneaking in today because I know you got one of those I think people call them day jobs

03:23.880 --> 03:29.740
So that's it's really much appreciated welcome. Yeah, especially on a day like today. Most people are burned out good thing

03:29.740 --> 03:34.880
I'm working from home. Oh good move good move. I'm glad I'm glad you're able to make that work today

03:34.880 --> 03:37.080
Most people are burned out because of everything going on

03:37.080 --> 03:41.560
But the big news item like if you're gonna pull one thing out of Google IO

03:41.840 --> 03:49.600
It's the story that we've been slowly building towards on Linux action news and on this program and that is Chrome OS getting full-fledged

03:50.920 --> 03:52.720
real Linux apps

03:52.720 --> 03:59.240
Coming all together in one place. You got Android Chrome apps and now Linux desktop apps on Chrome OS

03:59.360 --> 04:04.800
It's it's a big announcement. We've seen it coming and it's released on the pixel book today

04:04.800 --> 04:06.940
It'll be rolling out to other models later

04:08.040 --> 04:15.160
Seems like a pretty big deal and we know that underneath this it's probably some sort of container eyes Linux environment where

04:15.720 --> 04:20.720
Yeah, looks like they've got a sandbox and then a virtual machine the inside and then where it's like in the past

04:20.720 --> 04:23.400
There's been other methods to get sort of Linux side loaded on Chromebooks

04:23.400 --> 04:26.080
This is something when you go into the settings you'll check a box and now you have it

04:26.080 --> 04:32.080
Yeah, it seems like maybe Google leveraging some of the the security things they've learned from the cloud here on their desktop platform

04:32.080 --> 04:35.920
Whoo, this seems like it could make Chrome OS the largest

04:36.960 --> 04:44.200
Desktop Linux operating system like we've it's always been Linux based, but it didn't have Linux apps now. It's got a

04:45.280 --> 04:52.480
Multi-billion dollar corporate sponsor. It's running a Linux stack. It's got access to desktop Linux applications

04:52.480 --> 04:54.920
oh, and if you need it, it's got Chrome and

04:55.440 --> 04:57.520
features like power wash and

04:57.520 --> 05:04.240
reasonable prices and while we'll throw in a few Google cloud services to which everybody's using those these days anyway

05:04.240 --> 05:04.960
So why not?

05:04.960 --> 05:12.120
I mean it takes the Chromebook to a new level in a way suddenly a major bump in utility at least for me

05:12.120 --> 05:14.500
I mean you can install Android studio on it

05:15.280 --> 05:21.320
Developers have been messing around with getting entire development stacks running inside the Chrome OS container for Linux

05:21.520 --> 05:24.920
There is even people that have gotten wine loaded for different Windows

05:24.920 --> 05:32.720
applications, it's I think it's hard to overstate how this could change desktop Linux this really could make

05:33.120 --> 05:36.000
Chrome OS like the number one desktop Linux system

05:36.000 --> 05:39.840
And I I want to just spend I just want to spend a moment with that because that's a good

05:39.840 --> 05:42.800
This is Linux to the masses here. This is the success

05:43.720 --> 05:48.560
That so many of us wanted for so many decades for so long now. I mean really since

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
multiple decades

05:51.720 --> 05:52.760
and

05:52.760 --> 05:55.360
It's arriving Linux. It's available to

05:56.480 --> 05:59.920
Anybody that goes into like a average electronic store

06:00.800 --> 06:06.000
They'll be able to buy a Chromebook that can run Linux applications seems like a pretty big deal to me

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, it does and it's not even right. Yeah, it's not you don't have to flash it yourself. You're not doing anything complicated

06:11.000 --> 06:13.240
It's in a safe sandbox environment

06:13.240 --> 06:18.640
It's got a warranty and they're cheap, but it's it's deeply tied into proprietary services that spy on you

06:18.640 --> 06:25.120
And so this is what our success ends up looking like and is it success? Is it a is it a clean win?

06:25.120 --> 06:26.720
I don't know if it is

06:26.720 --> 06:28.960
I'm not sure. It's a clean win. I don't think it

06:28.960 --> 06:32.760
I don't think it feels like we thought this might feel like no, I don't think it does

06:32.760 --> 06:37.080
I think I always pictured a Red Hat or a canonical being there

06:37.080 --> 06:40.880
But something more traditional something like we're used to or what we choose for ourselves

06:41.080 --> 06:41.640
Yeah

06:41.640 --> 06:47.440
It can be interesting to see you like five years from now if this really changes the landscape much if maybe people are creating more

06:47.440 --> 06:51.880
Desktop Linux applications so they could people can have richer application experiences on Chromebooks. I

06:53.200 --> 06:58.760
certainly if I was if I had a if I had a fleet of salespeople or

06:59.520 --> 07:06.220
People that worked in a warehouse or on a on a manufacturing line that I needed to buy a fleet of machines to go with

07:06.840 --> 07:08.240
This would be pretty tempting

07:08.240 --> 07:15.560
there is some seriously robust centralized management capabilities with Chrome OS that make it very appealing to businesses and schools and

07:15.560 --> 07:20.520
It's really comparable to what you would get if you were to roll out Windows with Active Directory

07:20.520 --> 07:24.240
And yeah all of that and they have it built into Chrome OS

07:24.680 --> 07:26.520
Apple really can't compete with that

07:26.520 --> 07:32.240
You could custom write that one or two one-off applications that you need that for some reason aren't web apps

07:32.680 --> 07:39.040
Why would you buy a standard full Linux workstation or laptop or even a Windows workstation or laptop?

07:39.240 --> 07:42.160
When you could do this now developers could use it too, right?

07:42.160 --> 07:46.080
I mean they probably already could but even more so where does I wonder where does that leave?

07:46.080 --> 07:47.720
Where does that leave Apple as well?

07:47.720 --> 07:51.900
If you you know Windows has the subsystem for Linux Chromebooks can run Linux apps now

07:52.200 --> 07:57.120
Yeah, I guess if you it's just where are you more locked into Microsoft Apple or Google and that's the one for you

07:57.120 --> 08:01.920
I would like to ask Noah like are you would you consider selling this to clients?

08:01.920 --> 08:08.760
Yeah, and I would like to ask the audience Linux unplug calm slash contact. Is this a win for us if this becomes

08:08.760 --> 08:13.600
Overnight, I mean, I don't know obviously cuz I don't have the numbers in front of me

08:14.440 --> 08:20.400
but it seems like there's some potential here that if they turn this on for the pixel book and say

08:21.120 --> 08:23.200
half a dozen other Chromebook models

08:24.400 --> 08:29.400
it would seem like the install base would all of a sudden at least be in the hundreds of thousands of maybe not millions and

08:29.760 --> 08:36.720
That seems like that would outflank just about every distro but Ubuntu at that point for desktop penetration pretty much

08:36.720 --> 08:41.960
So it could be within a couple of weeks the number two desktop Linux distribution in a way

08:42.680 --> 08:46.640
Am I wrong? Am I overstating that and is this a way you say in a way?

08:46.640 --> 08:49.960
That's the key right like it's still it's still very but when I say in a way

08:49.960 --> 08:53.680
I mean in a way that it's in a way that's gonna be a big deal for end users

08:53.680 --> 08:59.480
I think it makes the argument for a Sputnik for say mom or

09:00.160 --> 09:02.600
So do you see you see it hurt hurt?

09:02.600 --> 09:07.640
No, because it's not gonna it's not gonna change like you and I and our audience's preference

09:07.640 --> 09:14.520
yeah, but for I think it's more like it's gonna go after Windows and Macs and they're gonna do it using Linux and I think

09:14.520 --> 09:19.280
It's just gonna be sort of like how Android is far and beyond the largest deployment of Linux in

09:19.880 --> 09:22.920
Average consumers hands. Yeah, this is gonna be the second largest

09:23.520 --> 09:30.580
And so this in a way is going to be the face of Linux to the majority of people using desktop Linux

09:30.580 --> 09:34.900
That's what I say in a way right because it's the Wi-Fi work the hard

09:36.540 --> 09:44.180
The hard numbers are gonna be such that the gravity of desktop Linux will be here and so that has a way of influencing

09:44.820 --> 09:46.700
application design

09:46.700 --> 09:47.780
consumer purchases

09:47.780 --> 09:52.900
I mean it just has a way of causing incidental factors in the marketplace

09:52.900 --> 09:57.340
What apps will it be that this you know that actually get you so this this new weird hybrid?

09:57.340 --> 10:01.860
I don't know. I mean I I would be really tempted to load Libre off as funny as it sounds

10:02.380 --> 10:04.460
But I just the other night I had a spreadsheet

10:04.460 --> 10:09.980
I uploaded it to sheets on Google didn't really like what it did with it. Open it up in Libre. It was great

10:10.480 --> 10:12.480
You know Calc just handled it fine

10:12.780 --> 10:18.540
I don't know man. I think I if I was if I was advising like friends and family

10:18.540 --> 10:22.180
I think I'm gonna start saying get a Chromebook and I think I'm gonna just like then

10:22.180 --> 10:26.020
I'll just load the couple of side applications that they need with this functionality

10:26.020 --> 10:28.020
We just had a friend

10:28.540 --> 10:30.540
this week her she had an old like

10:31.220 --> 10:34.460
2011 2012 MacBook and the video card finally went out on her and

10:35.300 --> 10:39.060
She's and the Mac repair shops like well if you buy your next MacBook through us

10:39.100 --> 10:41.980
We'll transfer your data at a reduced rate, you know, so they get her like

10:42.460 --> 10:48.540
So we'll save you 60 bucks if you buy a $2,000 laptop through us and I'm like, what do you need the laptop for?

10:48.540 --> 10:52.220
you know like those questions you always ask and she's like well, I got to check my gmail and

10:52.220 --> 10:57.980
I I do, you know online social networking stuff and there's this exercise group that we're going on a bike trip

10:57.980 --> 11:02.860
I want you know, it's Etc. She just goes into the all of its browser based and she's got an Android phone already

11:02.860 --> 11:05.980
She's already got all the Google account stuff. She's had it for years

11:05.980 --> 11:07.980
She's been in the Google ecosystem for years

11:07.980 --> 11:13.140
And I couldn't come up with a compelling reason for her not to get a Chromebook and you add this on there

11:13.140 --> 11:17.220
The maintenance burden is less. It's designed for that type of user

11:17.220 --> 11:21.060
So there I think there are actually a lot of advantages there Wow Wow Jed

11:21.060 --> 11:25.180
You see you're seeing in Chromebooks for as low as 60 bucks. That's remarkable

11:25.700 --> 11:31.400
That's a that's a Lenovo. It's the C grade. I don't know what the grades mean, but yeah

11:32.740 --> 11:33.820
60.99

11:33.820 --> 11:40.820
It's amazing four gigs of memory. Yeah, many Mac. There's other aspects of Chrome OS besides price that are appealing to end-users

11:40.820 --> 11:45.580
I don't know how many uses you I've already converted to Linux, but often they have

11:45.580 --> 11:53.220
Problems with updates. They don't doing it. They are scared because they know Microsoft and the problem is you you just do a reboot

11:53.220 --> 11:55.700
You're done. So it's very easy for the user

11:55.780 --> 11:56.260
Yeah

11:56.260 --> 12:01.420
Not even getting to the power wash aspect just the just the self updating aspect and and really the fact that they don't have to

12:01.420 --> 12:03.740
Worry about data backups if they do go in on cloud stuff

12:05.140 --> 12:08.420
The thing is once you start putting local applications on these Chromebooks

12:08.420 --> 12:12.020
You're gonna start running into the hard memory limits and storage limits

12:12.020 --> 12:16.780
So then the next shoe that has to drop here is maybe this is a 2019 2020 thing

12:16.820 --> 12:22.520
But they've got to start putting larger disk and more ramming these are Chromebooks. Yeah, I mean the pixel books pretty nice, right?

12:22.520 --> 12:29.920
Yeah, but maybe a slightly different more options. Yeah. Yeah. So JJ. What do you think not necessarily cheap Chromebooks for Linux apps?

12:29.920 --> 12:31.660
It might be limited to the more

12:31.660 --> 12:34.140
Premium products seems like that could happen. Yeah

12:34.820 --> 12:40.260
Possibly and also I know I know that the plate currently though you can get the place for a Chrome OS

12:40.260 --> 12:45.960
but only on a certain yep certain hardware type of devices only certain Chromebooks that have the

12:46.540 --> 12:48.980
That have been approved to run the play store

12:48.980 --> 12:53.100
So maybe it'll be the same maybe limited to the to the same exact Chromebooks

12:53.100 --> 12:55.100
But if you happen to have one of those Chromebooks

12:55.300 --> 12:58.500
Like I said at the top of this thing you're getting and all the Android apps

12:58.500 --> 13:03.020
It's possible to run on that thing plus all the Linux apps is possible to run on that thing and all the Chrome apps

13:03.260 --> 13:08.820
It's possible to run on that thing. That's actually kind of slick. That's a lot of that's a lot of choice

13:08.820 --> 13:13.340
I don't know how good any of them are gonna look or function on that device

13:13.340 --> 13:14.380
I mean

13:14.380 --> 13:20.580
Could this be employed to replace the Chrome web store that I've been hearing for the last few years that Google wants to get rid of?

13:20.580 --> 13:22.420
Oh, I don't know about that

13:22.420 --> 13:29.540
My suspicion my suspicion is that it's really about hedging as they transition Android off of Linux

13:29.540 --> 13:32.660
But that's for a future episode. Yeah, let's talk about you there

13:32.660 --> 13:36.340
I can't even this is the story that neither West and I wanted to do this week

13:36.340 --> 13:39.060
But we got to talk about it because I know you guys are gonna be hearing about it

13:39.060 --> 13:43.040
So Jonathan over at LWN has a subscriber only post right now

13:43.040 --> 13:47.060
It'll be out in a little bit and it covers some drama around a G lib C

13:47.060 --> 13:53.980
and it's about the removal of an old joke from the man page from the from the C library manual and

13:54.940 --> 14:01.100
I'm amazed but yet not surprised that it can spiral into such a shitstorm. Let me give you the background here

14:01.100 --> 14:04.020
So think about think about this, you know

14:04.020 --> 14:10.300
You're coming across the manual and you see some old kind of off-color joke in there and you read then you go

14:10.300 --> 14:14.860
There's no reason for this to be in here. Let's remove it and you submit a patch to pull that out and

14:15.660 --> 14:22.700
from there it spirals into a confrontation with RMS because the author of the joke was RMS and I'll read you the joke

14:24.860 --> 14:29.500
It's not even funny that's the worst part so it literally says in the comments put in by RMS

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
Don't remove

14:31.900 --> 14:36.260
Says future change warnings and this is about the abort function in lib C

14:36.860 --> 14:43.380
Proposed federal censorship regulations may prohibit us from giving you information about the possibility of calling this abort function

14:43.820 --> 14:49.380
We would be required to say that this is not an acceptable way of terminating a program. That's the joke

14:49.380 --> 14:56.220
It's an abortion joke that if they make abortion illegal, then they can't talk about the abort function in G lib C and

14:56.220 --> 15:00.460
People come across this the people who actually are responsible for developing the software

15:00.460 --> 15:05.420
RMS is not actively involved in the development of G lib C and they come across this like oh, let's pull this

15:05.420 --> 15:08.140
Let's let's remove this and the developers have this

15:08.820 --> 15:11.620
consensus based community driven development model and

15:11.820 --> 15:17.540
They come to a consensus that people who are responsible for developing G lib C and if everybody agrees and there's consensus reach then they take

15:17.540 --> 15:19.540
Action and they reach consensus

15:19.660 --> 15:20.940
however

15:20.940 --> 15:25.820
They didn't reach out to Stallman now Stallman is not directly involved in the development of G lib C

15:25.820 --> 15:30.460
But of course, it is a good new project and that's where Stallman gets involved

15:30.460 --> 15:36.620
He writes back after seeing on the mailing list. My decision is to keep the joke store just short and sweet

15:37.820 --> 15:42.700
People respond respond back. He says nope. I stand by my decision to keep the joke

15:42.700 --> 15:48.380
They apologize to RMS for not involving him in the conversation, but they say look, you know, we're the maintainers. We've reached consensus

15:48.940 --> 15:52.460
We would like to remove this joke. We're not gonna we're not gonna put the joke back in

15:52.460 --> 15:56.220
It's already been removed at this point. We're not putting the joke back in that's

15:56.860 --> 16:01.980
When you might say Stallman got unimpressed with the situation and went for the authority play

16:01.980 --> 16:05.860
He says this is a direct quote as the head of the GNU project

16:05.860 --> 16:09.580
I am in charge of what we publish in the GNU manuals. I

16:10.540 --> 16:17.980
Decided the criteria to decide by to he later adds I exercise my authority over G lib C

16:17.980 --> 16:23.100
Very rarely and when I have done, so I have talked with the official maintainers

16:23.100 --> 16:29.100
So rarely that some of you thought that you were entirely autonomous, but that is not the case

16:29.740 --> 16:31.740
on this particular question

16:31.740 --> 16:36.620
I made my decision long ago and it started where all of you could see it

16:37.260 --> 16:42.380
What I love about RMS a statement here besides the pure authority play that just says I'm in charge of the manuals

16:42.380 --> 16:45.260
And I've made my decision is the is like the sly

16:45.260 --> 16:50.540
I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes the entire time, but you fools never knew it

16:51.100 --> 16:53.820
He literally writes in his response. I

16:54.380 --> 16:59.500
I've gotten involved so rarely that some of you thought you were entirely autonomous, but this is not the case

16:59.980 --> 17:04.140
Like like he's sitting there stroking his beard with one hand while he writes this

17:04.780 --> 17:11.180
So the maintainer who really is leading this O'Donnell they start the discussion back up, but somebody else who?

17:11.180 --> 17:16.940
Alexander Olivia who? Apparently was on RMS aside just decided to on May 7th

17:17.260 --> 17:21.340
Slip it back in the first change to G lib C in 2018 slipped the joke back in

17:21.420 --> 17:25.740
He didn't post anything on the mailing list didn't ask any didn't say anything until he was directly

17:26.380 --> 17:31.820
Questioned on it. And he says well we were waiting for a return to consensus. So I wanted to put it back in there

17:32.540 --> 17:34.540
Which has now spun into?

17:34.540 --> 17:40.940
this massive fight over who actually controls the project calling RMS an authoritarian leader and

17:41.500 --> 17:47.420
I believe I haven't checked for the last couple of hours. I believe the thread is still spinning out of control right now on the mailing list

17:48.380 --> 17:51.900
And it's all about this stupid joke in the manual at some level

17:51.900 --> 17:57.020
It does just feel like an unfortunate waste of time. I'm not saying there's not legitimate things to be discussed, etc

17:57.020 --> 18:00.860
Right, but if this all could have just been sidestepped and right. I mean the joke

18:00.860 --> 18:08.380
Is really a proxy for a more significant question one which is relevant to both the developers and really the users of the project

18:08.540 --> 18:10.220
the question is

18:10.220 --> 18:13.900
How is a project governed and who makes decisions about which patches are applied?

18:14.140 --> 18:19.900
Is it is it the overall founder of the GNU project and the person in control of the manuals?

18:20.220 --> 18:25.260
Or is it the core developers who are the ones that actually have been doing the work for a long time?

18:25.260 --> 18:32.060
And have made dissent consensus-based decisions on everything else really, but if you ask RMS, well, I've been pulling the strings all along

18:32.380 --> 18:34.620
So they really haven't been doing their own thing, right?

18:34.620 --> 18:38.060
It makes you question like is this the best governance model or what are the you know?

18:38.060 --> 18:42.380
What are the limitations of our governance model and it's really when the dictator has bad taste?

18:42.940 --> 18:45.260
Yeah, and RMS is sort of abrasive

18:46.140 --> 18:48.620
Hardline no compromise style

18:49.260 --> 18:53.020
Takes the conversation to an 11th and it's not a good idea to talk about it

18:53.020 --> 18:55.820
But I guess it's really not about the joke. I just

18:56.620 --> 19:00.540
It just comes across as he has a big ego and he puts himself first

19:00.860 --> 19:04.540
And I wish that wasn't the case because I don't actually think that's usually his intention

19:05.340 --> 19:11.660
But the abrasive nature in which he communicates and conveys himself often leaves one with that impression

19:11.980 --> 19:13.980
And I think it harms the message to a degree

19:14.380 --> 19:18.380
But I think it's a good idea to talk about it. I think it's a good idea to talk about it

19:18.380 --> 19:24.220
But the abrasive nature in which he communicates and conveys himself often leaves one with that impression

19:24.460 --> 19:26.460
And I think it harms the message to a degree

19:27.180 --> 19:34.060
It sometimes would be a good sign to show that some lines are not worth fighting

19:34.860 --> 19:37.020
It's not a good joke. It's old

19:37.900 --> 19:39.900
Why not remove it?

19:39.980 --> 19:43.900
Why not why not take the high ground here and go? Yeah, let's why not come up with a new joke?

19:44.220 --> 19:47.340
Put something else in there. I think that's kind of what disappoints me, too

19:47.340 --> 19:52.780
Uh swamp, uh had a couple of great interviews with rms up on his youtube channel

19:53.100 --> 19:57.820
So look around for those. My next guess is rms. You can go youtube search that

19:58.540 --> 20:01.580
Where he talks about what happens after he passes on

20:02.380 --> 20:05.580
Like who's going to take over who's going to lead the who's going to lead the charge

20:06.140 --> 20:09.980
and uh, I would i'll leave it to you I won't spoil it but uh,

20:11.180 --> 20:15.260
I was surprised by his answer. I'll just leave it

20:15.260 --> 20:22.380
I'll leave it as an exercise to go check that out because I think swap deserves the uh, the views so microsoft's most popular

20:22.860 --> 20:23.980
product

20:23.980 --> 20:28.860
Of all time their most popular big, you know, their big thing really is sequel these days

20:28.860 --> 20:30.860
Where it's for software that they sell and stuff

20:31.660 --> 20:35.500
And the most popular version is the one that runs on linux

20:36.220 --> 20:38.220
coming out of build today

20:38.680 --> 20:40.700
microsoft confirmed

20:40.700 --> 20:46.140
That their most successful server product ever is the sequel server that runs on top of linux

20:46.300 --> 20:50.700
This is the general manager of azure data in an interview with the register

20:50.940 --> 20:56.940
He says it is this is a direct quote the most successful server product. We have ever released in terms of downloads

20:57.260 --> 21:00.380
Our typical volumes are in the hundreds of thousands

21:01.020 --> 21:07.580
We're looking at seven million downloads talking about cosmos db, which was introduced a year ago

21:07.580 --> 21:13.740
It's a distributed multi-model database. So it supports um, sequel apis javascript gremlin mongo db

21:14.380 --> 21:21.180
Azure table storage all of those to query data as you'd expect and it can be scaled to multiple azure regions or locally

21:21.740 --> 21:27.980
Which turns out it's handy when dealing with regional data centers and it's become a big hit because people can mix and match the components

21:28.700 --> 21:33.660
But the takeaway headline here is it's their most successful server product ever in terms of downloads

21:33.660 --> 21:39.500
And it's the one based on linux and I think that just plays a little bit into the backstory of why they're getting so

21:39.740 --> 21:41.740
So deep into all of open source and linux

21:42.380 --> 21:44.380
Now wes I was all proud of myself

21:44.940 --> 21:47.820
But uh, see we're sprinkling in app picks through this whole episode

21:47.900 --> 21:50.380
We really are there's app picks sprinkled in all over the place

21:50.380 --> 21:53.260
And we're going to start with our first one while we're talking about something microsoft related

21:53.660 --> 21:56.780
I was like wes check this out check what check out what I found and you're like, oh, no

21:56.780 --> 22:01.420
No, you don't need this. So with a disclaimer wes is going to tell you how you could do this without this tool

22:01.420 --> 22:05.660
But if you've ever been like in a situation where a year ago

22:05.660 --> 22:09.020
I needed to install windows 10 and I hadn't done it since windows 10 had come out

22:09.420 --> 22:13.740
And I didn't I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I assumed you could just download the iso

22:14.700 --> 22:16.780
And dd it to a flash drive or use etcher

22:17.580 --> 22:19.580
And you're off to the races. No big deal

22:20.220 --> 22:22.220
Nope. Nope doesn't work

22:22.700 --> 22:29.020
The only way I could ever successfully write a windows installer iso that would actually boot into the windows installer

22:29.020 --> 22:31.020
Was from another windows box

22:31.500 --> 22:36.380
You can only do it from another windows box which totally defeated the purpose of what I was trying to do

22:36.380 --> 22:41.660
Which was install a windows box to test something and so I found this tool called windows to usb

22:42.220 --> 22:47.580
It's a bash script which writes windows 7 8 8 1 and 10 dvd images

22:47.980 --> 22:51.820
To your usb flash drive or an external hard drive on linux

22:52.300 --> 22:56.860
And it's really great because it's really fully automatic. You don't have to prep the thumb drive

22:56.860 --> 23:00.800
It supports bios uefi fat32 and ntfs

23:01.340 --> 23:07.420
It works with certain custom windows isos that are like corporate specials like smaller isos. It'll use stock windows bootloaders

23:07.580 --> 23:13.980
It does not break efi secure boot chain and it's available as an app image. So you just download it market is executable

23:13.980 --> 23:19.500
so it's a mod plus x and run it in your terminal and you're good to go and it'll start flashing a

23:19.820 --> 23:21.740
windows iso that you already have

23:21.740 --> 23:23.740
to a usb drive which

23:23.740 --> 23:28.860
Is awesome for the next time in a year when I have to test out windows, but after I told wes about this

23:29.100 --> 23:32.940
He was like, oh man. Yeah, I already got this figured out. You actually had to do this the hard way though

23:33.420 --> 23:36.140
Yeah, that's true. Sometimes I like to do things the hard way

23:37.020 --> 23:40.700
But it all starts with a little ntfs magic. I didn't know that yeah if you do it on on uh

23:41.180 --> 23:43.180
Mbr you can just if you set it up, right?

23:43.180 --> 23:49.580
You can just format it ntfs set the bootable bit and the ntfs partition headers have enough magic to

23:49.580 --> 23:54.460
To get boot manager going and then the rest is an unfortunate operating system

23:54.540 --> 23:57.020
So they have that all just built into ntfs. Yeah

23:57.820 --> 24:02.620
That it's pretty slick actually. Yeah makes it very easy, uh to just to go from the iso

24:03.180 --> 24:04.860
To having a fully functional thing

24:04.860 --> 24:08.380
Efi also makes it easy because they're just booting with standard efi

24:08.380 --> 24:14.700
So gpt formatted right set up all those standard efi file systems copy the rest from the iso and again away you go

24:14.700 --> 24:20.220
Okay, so you so you get it formatted and then you just do like a like an rsync from the actually

24:20.540 --> 24:22.540
Hmm. All right, that's not too bad

24:22.700 --> 24:26.620
That's that's not actually as bad as I thought it was because I didn't realize ntfs had the boot magic

24:27.100 --> 24:28.620
So that's there's a format option

24:28.620 --> 24:32.380
I now that you say that I remember like a bootable option when you format something as ntfs

24:32.700 --> 24:36.620
And when you do that, that's when you get that stuff that's cheating. That's cheating

24:36.620 --> 24:42.220
I know it's just too it's just too slick, but we all have it now. Efi has uh saved us for better or worse

24:42.220 --> 24:47.420
Yeah, yeah, but not everyone wants to do that or remember how to do that or look up the documentation to do that

24:47.500 --> 24:49.500
So if there's just a handy app image

24:50.140 --> 24:53.580
When it's already unfortunate that you have to install windows you might as well make it easy

24:53.740 --> 24:57.580
I just pictured like a younger west pain like a year or two ago like

24:58.280 --> 25:03.500
Rifling around the windows file system and the isos trying to figure out how the hell to get this thing to boot

25:03.900 --> 25:06.940
Being frustrated that he couldn't just dd the iso image to the thumb drive

25:06.940 --> 25:13.740
Like you had you had to do some uh, sherlock there some sherlock work many wasted hours attempting to administer windows from linux

25:14.060 --> 25:19.660
That's right. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? Uh, you know what rms would say about that. I think that we should all

25:20.140 --> 25:25.820
Make those businesses fail. Yeah, that's what he would probably say that about it. He takes a hard line on stuff

25:25.980 --> 25:29.580
He takes a hard line on stuff. I take a hard line on my mobile service provider

25:29.580 --> 25:30.460
They got to be great

25:30.460 --> 25:37.500
And that's why I recommend ting go to linux.ting.com where the average ting bill is just 23 dollars per phone per month

25:37.660 --> 25:43.260
It's six dollars a month for the line and then just what you use in minutes messages megabots whatever you use

25:43.340 --> 25:46.780
That's what you pay. There's no contract. There's no really termination fee

25:46.940 --> 25:52.940
They have nationwide coverage cdma and gsm and as you would expect from any jupiter broadcasting sponsor

25:53.100 --> 25:57.020
They got a great control panel an excellent dashboard that gives you full control

25:57.020 --> 26:03.340
Over your account your minutes your messages and your megabytes. You can get instant snapshots of what you used

26:03.740 --> 26:06.380
Exactly what you can expect to pay at any given moment

26:06.620 --> 26:11.100
They have an app on the android or the iphones that allows you to manage all of that and speaking of devices

26:11.340 --> 26:15.420
They got a bunch that you can buy directly from ting or a whole bunch that they support

26:16.380 --> 26:18.380
ting offers cdma and gsm networks

26:18.380 --> 26:25.260
Which means they support a lot of devices and they have incredible customer service when I signed up for ting

26:25.260 --> 26:32.060
I didn't realize I could activate my phone through their website because that seemed impossible back then but now it seems obvious really

26:32.140 --> 26:33.820
I should have known better

26:33.820 --> 26:38.300
Noob, but I called their customer service. Have you ever had to deal with ting's customer service? They're pretty great

26:38.380 --> 26:44.700
They are great. Actually, I have it myself, but like not everyone some people I've recommended ting to have and I'm you know

26:44.700 --> 26:49.500
I was like, okay. Well, how did it go? Never surprised it goes great. It does they're just so they're so friendly

26:49.580 --> 26:52.940
I actually got a postcard once from one of the reps I talked to oh, see there you go

26:52.940 --> 26:55.420
That's the extra mile. I left an impression. What can I say?

26:56.140 --> 26:59.420
And it's just it's pretty great people love ting and when you switch over you get great customer service

26:59.420 --> 27:04.700
So anyways, I called up the first time and uh, I was I was blown away by how how simple how straightforward

27:04.700 --> 27:08.540
They will communicate with you. And uh, then yeah, I did get a postcard afterwards

27:08.780 --> 27:10.380
So that really happened

27:10.380 --> 27:15.100
It's smarter than unlimited because you just pay for what you use if you use less you pay less

27:15.260 --> 27:18.460
And that's why the average ting bill is just 23 per month. I was paying

27:18.460 --> 27:23.840
120 dollars for a couple of lines back in the day for three lines before I switched to ting

27:24.080 --> 27:26.080
And now i'm paying usually around 40 something a month

27:26.720 --> 27:28.720
linux.ting.com

27:28.880 --> 27:34.320
That's linux.ting.com to support the show and get 25 off a device or 25 in service credit

27:34.560 --> 27:41.200
If you bring a device linux.ting.com now that 1804 is out. We've got to start talking about 1810 obviously

27:41.760 --> 27:46.000
Uh, that's what everybody does right and you can blame mark shovelworth for this actually because he just posted

27:46.000 --> 27:48.880
Queue the cosmic cuttlefish

27:49.440 --> 27:51.040
That's adorable

27:51.040 --> 27:53.280
Super adorable. I'm in love already

27:53.840 --> 28:00.480
I like that. Uh, he says it's time to start talking about 1810 because really it's really it's time to start laying the groundwork for

28:01.040 --> 28:04.500
The next lts thing's got to keep happening 2004 2004

28:05.120 --> 28:06.640
Oh, man, it's right around the corner

28:06.640 --> 28:07.200
but in the meantime

28:07.200 --> 28:13.600
We focus on 1810 and so he says he wants to take this early opportunity in the lts cycle to talk about

28:13.600 --> 28:17.280
Things that he's starting to care more about and what a particular feature he'd love to see

28:17.680 --> 28:20.480
People focus on is security. I like the way mark phrases

28:20.560 --> 28:23.200
Like you guys are all going to work on whatever you're passionate about in ubuntu

28:23.280 --> 28:29.760
But if we had one thing i'd really love to see everybody that everybody could incorporate into whatever project they're working on. It's security

28:30.240 --> 28:34.560
Um, he says i'd feel great about that if we could systematically for everyone who uses ubuntu

28:34.800 --> 28:39.760
Improve their confidence in the security of their systems and their data. It's one of the very true

28:39.760 --> 28:44.160
true few unifying themes across every use case

28:44.960 --> 28:47.360
That is that is so true that you know

28:47.520 --> 28:51.040
It is it's something that the cloud people care about it's something the desktop people care about

28:51.040 --> 28:54.640
It's it's something that all of the different uh aspects of ubuntu care about

28:54.640 --> 28:58.800
I mean we need it to be to keep being a serious operating system, right? Especially yeah

28:59.120 --> 29:03.840
Yeah, especially when it's uh, the core of so many services now and then uh mark

29:04.560 --> 29:08.080
not putting the keyboard down for a moment wrote on the uh,

29:08.080 --> 29:15.600
Ubuntu mailing list for development that it's time to start considering the new installer ubiquity next generation or ng

29:16.000 --> 29:18.080
He says now let's start with a trip down memory lane

29:18.720 --> 29:25.120
MDZ and I were shooting the shooting to the moon on a saturday afternoon in my apartment in london when the idea for ubiquity formed

29:25.440 --> 29:30.640
It seemed crazy a live cd that would let people try out ubuntu and then drive straight into the install

29:31.360 --> 29:36.000
Seemed like that was science fiction, but it quickly took shape on a piece of paper that i'd rather wish i'd kept

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Now 14 years later

29:38.000 --> 29:42.800
We have new kinds of magic to draw on and perhaps ubiquity ng could take advantage of them first

29:43.040 --> 29:48.000
We have curtain which knows how to take a description of a machine and do the right thing partitioning

29:48.480 --> 29:50.480
installing and cleaning up

29:50.560 --> 29:57.920
In fact curtain is neat and efficient and it's super fast. So we have the beginnings of what also could be an html5 installer

29:58.560 --> 30:04.800
Third we have electron which is an html5 app framework used by the world of world-class developers like skype

30:04.800 --> 30:07.920
Spotify and a ton of great apps on ubuntu fourth

30:07.920 --> 30:10.480
We have snaps which are just amazing

30:10.960 --> 30:15.760
Amazingly tasty ways to get the latest bits in the hands of your community

30:16.160 --> 30:22.000
So who is game to sketch this further? So we may be seeing a new installer in the works

30:22.480 --> 30:28.400
Wow seems to be uh in the in the cards in the air. What's the phrase there? Everybody's got new installer ideas

30:28.960 --> 30:30.800
I i'd say it's probably time

30:30.800 --> 30:35.120
I i'd say anybody in the mumble room have thoughts on ubuntu replacing their installer good or bad

30:35.440 --> 30:40.000
As long as it can be customized to what the individual flavors need then yeah, i'm all for it

30:40.480 --> 30:42.400
Yeah, definitely something that keeps the flavors in mind

30:42.400 --> 30:42.640
I mean

30:42.640 --> 30:46.240
I guess if there's momentum right if people want to do it if there's enough momentum and energy

30:46.400 --> 30:49.680
Uh to see the process through what do you think about it being based on electron?

30:50.400 --> 30:54.640
Well if it's easy, I I guess I I will as long as it doesn't have a drawbacks

30:54.640 --> 30:56.640
Right as long as it works if they can make it

30:56.640 --> 31:01.360
Reliable enough for all types of devices that would need to be installed on then if the end product's good

31:01.360 --> 31:05.040
I'm, all right with it. I would love it to have a um

31:05.900 --> 31:11.200
Anchor's back end interface that I could use on the command line when i'm installing it on a server somewhere or something like that

31:11.280 --> 31:16.080
Or make sure you know like the bootstrap still works cleanly and all those things. I'm sure that won't change but

31:16.480 --> 31:20.000
All right, wes i'm going to install so it's another app pick i'm installing it right now on the show

31:20.000 --> 31:22.400
I'm going to see if I can't break my computer live on the air

31:22.400 --> 31:27.520
So this one's a snap that I saw going across the twitters and it's called stress

31:28.220 --> 31:32.720
Ng and it's a tool to load stress on a computer. So if you have for some reason

31:33.440 --> 31:38.480
The desire to punish the subsystems of a computer like the cpu cache disk memory

31:39.120 --> 31:45.520
Your socket connections io the scheduler stress ng is a rewrite of an old stress tool

31:45.920 --> 31:50.420
That has many additional features such as specifying different operations your bogo operations

31:50.420 --> 31:56.740
And uh executions of metrics stress verification on memory compute operations that are more stressful things like that

31:57.140 --> 31:59.140
So I just went installed it here on my machine

31:59.540 --> 32:03.620
And i'm gonna go ahead and give it a go stress ng we're gonna kick it off to the uh-oh

32:04.020 --> 32:06.020
Oh, no, this is no good. Some

32:06.340 --> 32:09.060
It says here that some io tests may fail

32:09.620 --> 32:13.700
Uh, I don't know now i'm thinking maybe this isn't a good idea dangerously chris. Come on now

32:13.780 --> 32:14.820
I don't know wes

32:14.820 --> 32:18.900
I don't know. It seems like this might be a bad idea to do to my production system during the show

32:18.900 --> 32:21.780
I'm starting to get cold feet, but it's a pretty cool

32:22.500 --> 32:27.620
App, I love punishing systems when they're in here for review or seeing what a new droplet can do and things like that

32:27.620 --> 32:31.540
So stress ng. Wow, it's got a lot of options. Holy smokes

32:31.940 --> 32:35.780
I I here's a here's a flag for you though. Maybe this is the one to run with

32:36.180 --> 32:39.780
So you run stress ng and then tack tack aggressive

32:40.580 --> 32:46.580
Yeah aggressive. I like the sounds of it. Also. There is an option called dash-dash ignite cpu

32:46.580 --> 32:49.620
Which will try to make your cpu run as hot as possible

32:50.420 --> 32:56.180
That actually could be useful for other things as well. There's also things in here about just smashing the ios for instance

32:56.260 --> 33:00.900
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it reminds me of that. Uh, you can smash your your disk ios

33:01.140 --> 33:04.420
Uh, you can try to make your system timeout dash-dash thrash

33:06.100 --> 33:12.020
Amazing. Oh, yeah force all pages and cause a swap thrash. That's amazing. That's

33:12.020 --> 33:16.420
Have at this. I think this is going to be good. Oh some crypt some cryptograph stuff in here, too

33:16.740 --> 33:19.460
Yeah, I could play with this for a while. All right. I'll play more with it. It's so easy

33:19.780 --> 33:26.020
It is it's pretty cool. Don't break anything please this come on now just snap install the shows to do. I know right?

33:26.100 --> 33:30.740
I know that's what I was just thinking. Maybe I shouldn't and then one more pick. I told you we're putting a bunch of insane

33:30.740 --> 33:34.020
How did you find so many good things? You did it? It was really you that found this one

33:34.020 --> 33:40.500
I found that last one, but you found this one castro. We've mentioned it once before way back in

33:40.500 --> 33:46.660
The past maybe like six months ago. I'm not quite sure but it's castro is a command line podcast client

33:48.180 --> 33:51.380
Those are all the words that we love right here on linux unplugged. Mm-hmm

33:51.380 --> 33:51.860
Mm-hmm

33:51.860 --> 33:57.140
So you can subscribe to all of your favorite jupiter broadcasting shows which is obviously all of them from the command line

33:57.460 --> 34:01.380
And i'm actually using something similar to this. Although I think i'm going to switch to castro

34:02.100 --> 34:02.960
for

34:02.960 --> 34:07.220
Downloading reruns and things like that for like our automated idea. Mm-hmm

34:07.220 --> 34:10.980
Just subscribe to the rss feed get it automatically and it just drops it in a directory

34:11.060 --> 34:13.060
And then I got a player that reads that directory

34:13.300 --> 34:18.260
And if you've got python already loaded on your system pip install and I sure do castaro castaro

34:18.740 --> 34:23.300
That's probably not castro. It's probably castaro c-a-s-t-e-r-o

34:24.020 --> 34:29.460
I don't know man. All I know is the command line podcast clients are the win. You're already on the command line

34:29.940 --> 34:34.740
Command line music players are already great. Like this is just the perfect thing. Mm-hmm

34:34.740 --> 34:40.340
I thought about I've thought about trying to get as many things like back into the command line as possible not because it's retro

34:40.340 --> 34:44.900
But just because it's really convenient to have them running like persistently on a droplet

34:45.460 --> 34:49.700
Yeah, right. I just did a tmux session. Yeah done. Yeah a tmux session, huh?

34:50.020 --> 34:53.300
That's cool. That's fancier than what I was doing. That's good idea actually

34:53.300 --> 34:55.460
I hadn't I don't know why I hadn't even I haven't even made that connection

34:55.780 --> 35:00.100
I like having uh, I like also having the drop down terminal so the stuff I can put in the drop down terminal

35:00.100 --> 35:05.700
I'm always about that. Oh, yeah, right got the ua going on the plasma desktop. Boom. So yeah, go check out castaro

35:06.740 --> 35:11.700
Uh don't come to me for pronunciation folks come to me for the pics but not for the pronunciations of them for that

35:11.700 --> 35:17.220
You gotta go to west pain. He is a pronunciation expert. That's right. That's what I say official official people come in town

35:17.220 --> 35:20.260
I say go if you go if you want to if you want to know where to go in seattle get good food

35:20.500 --> 35:23.700
Talk to wes and if you want to know how to pronounce something you got to talk to wes

35:23.700 --> 35:25.460
It's a lot of work, but i'm happy to do it

35:25.460 --> 35:30.100
Somebody's got to right maybe you'll just butcher it for everyone. I'm gonna have to bring you along with me

35:30.740 --> 35:35.700
Because i'm going down to texas linux fest in a couple of weeks and if you're in the austin area

35:36.180 --> 35:40.580
on the weekend of june at uh, uh, eighth and ninth

35:41.380 --> 35:45.620
Come down and say hi to me at texas linux fest i'm going i'm going to be in austin texas

35:46.100 --> 35:51.540
June 8th and 9th hanging out. It's the first time i've ever been i'm making it official right now on the show

35:51.540 --> 35:56.260
I haven't even really made it. This is like the first official time. I've even said anything about it. What a commitment

35:56.260 --> 36:00.020
Look at you all the way to texas. I know it's gonna be great

36:00.020 --> 36:04.180
Which probably means the shows are gonna be crazy for a few weeks while i'm on the road, but time for adventure

36:04.180 --> 36:08.500
Mm-hmm. It is it's that time of year and i've always wanted to go down to texas linux fest

36:08.660 --> 36:12.340
And I had such a good time in texas last year. I was just looking for a good reason to go down

36:12.340 --> 36:14.500
I'm, also going to go down and see our buddies from linux academy

36:15.060 --> 36:19.620
And work with them on some of their production stuff. I have a suspicion that they're going to be

36:19.620 --> 36:24.420
Some of their production stuff. I have a suspicion that you're just going to get all that all that tasty barbecue

36:24.580 --> 36:28.500
Is am I right in this real the real motivator is to get levi back down to texas

36:28.580 --> 36:30.820
Oh his homeland. Yeah, levi loves the sun

36:30.900 --> 36:34.980
But yeah, once the dog gets to texas then barbecue then hang out with linux academy

36:35.140 --> 36:38.340
And then hang out with the audience at texas linux fest. That's what is up

36:38.580 --> 36:43.220
So if you're gonna be in the austin area june 8th or 9th, come have some barbecue with me

36:43.700 --> 36:47.940
Maybe some brewskis. That sounds amazing. Come hang out with me and the linux fest guys

36:47.940 --> 36:52.660
Is give noah a hard time for going to self instead. Yeah, I assume he's going to self instead because that's the

36:53.220 --> 36:58.020
That's the really unfortunate thing is that it's at the same time self is so self in texas linux fest

36:58.100 --> 36:59.620
That's the shape. I know what's going on

36:59.620 --> 37:03.700
You got too much good linux in the world. Wow google io and redhat somewhat on the same day

37:03.780 --> 37:08.100
And you got self and texas linux fest on the same day. Yeah, I could go i'll go say hi to alex jones

37:08.100 --> 37:12.180
That seems like a great idea token run. That seems like uh, that seems like a really great idea

37:12.180 --> 37:19.780
I've never installed gnu slash linux digital ocean do dot co slash unplugged go there to sign up and get a

37:20.480 --> 37:25.700
100 credit when you create a new account and that'll last for 60 days when you go to do dot co

37:26.180 --> 37:30.900
Slash unplugged its simplicity at scale spin up an entire linux rig in seconds

37:30.980 --> 37:37.140
They've already got fedora 28 and ubuntu 1804 images good to go. They're updating their documentation

37:37.140 --> 37:43.300
So everything reflects the absolute latest releases and with one click you can deploy an entire application stack

37:43.540 --> 37:47.220
Or just the base rig and the real ninja combo with digital ocean

37:47.540 --> 37:51.140
Is to take advantage of some of the built-in features of their excellent dashboard

37:51.380 --> 37:56.660
For example, you can have dns and ssh keys already set up to go when that machine turns on

37:56.980 --> 38:00.180
So within seconds of launching a new digital ocean droplet

38:00.180 --> 38:07.540
I'm ssh-ing in with my key and my domain is already forwarding to digital ocean's name servers and bam digital ocean gets

38:07.540 --> 38:12.180
It was assigned within seconds to my droplet. I'm up and running i'm using the real domain

38:12.420 --> 38:16.340
I'm using something i'm going to have in production and as soon as I need to add more resources

38:16.500 --> 38:21.940
It's easy to do so I added another 250 gigs to a droplet that i've been consolidating to in seconds

38:22.100 --> 38:27.220
It's wonderful and they even cleverly name the device as do block storage

38:27.220 --> 38:30.900
Uh, and so when I when i'm looking at it in in on the command line

38:30.980 --> 38:36.100
And i'm looking at all the names of my devices. It's really easy to see. Oh, that's that's the 250 gigs

38:36.100 --> 38:40.100
I just attached it just shows up right there and they've even labeled it for me and within seconds

38:40.260 --> 38:45.540
I've added it to fstab and now it's mounted and it's it's brilliant because that's how I prefer to work

38:45.940 --> 38:48.100
Digital ocean is my enterprise now

38:48.100 --> 38:54.580
That's my data center with 12 locations all over the world 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisors ssds for every single rig

38:54.580 --> 38:57.860
Linux runs the virtualizer kvm is the virtualizer

38:58.100 --> 39:02.600
It's an ideal setup and go check them out because they're always adding new features new documentation

39:03.140 --> 39:08.180
And new pricing like flexible droplets that are mix and match for the resources depending on your application

39:08.340 --> 39:10.340
They also have cpu optimized droplets

39:10.420 --> 39:15.860
If you've got some large compute workload and rigs with tons and tons and tons and tons of ram

39:16.740 --> 39:21.140
Or you can just build something for five dollars a month. I just got done setting up a next cloud box

39:21.140 --> 39:25.380
I'll tell you a little bit about oh, it's really nice. It's really nice. It runs so great

39:25.700 --> 39:31.460
And it's just nice to know that it's under my control and I I really thought I really thought I would I would sort of

39:31.780 --> 39:36.180
Scale back on some of that stuff as time went on and these things got easier to just go get some hosted service

39:36.660 --> 39:41.220
No more than ever i'm building my own solutions and i'm using digital ocean to host it because

39:41.700 --> 39:46.500
That part of it is so low friction that I can just get right to the work that I actually want to do

39:46.500 --> 39:51.540
So get that $100 credit by going to do.co slash unplugged. It'll last for 60 days

39:51.540 --> 39:55.940
Once you apply it to a new account, that's do.co slash unplugged

39:56.820 --> 40:00.340
Now let's talk about the change coming to fedora atomic workstation

40:00.500 --> 40:03.300
And this is going to lead us into some of the red hat summit news that we have

40:03.860 --> 40:11.380
And it's uh, it's a rebranding. I suppose they're going from fedora atomic workstation to team silver blue

40:11.380 --> 40:17.060
They're calling it a new initiative and they think it's a better realignment for the long-term goal

40:17.540 --> 40:25.140
Of fedora workstation where they feel like workstation is terrible branding to begin with and they want to call it team silver blue

40:25.540 --> 40:30.020
You can check out. Um, um, joe rezington did an interview with matt miller

40:30.180 --> 40:36.500
From the fedora project in his new show late night linux extra where he goes into some detail about team silver blue rebranding

40:36.500 --> 40:43.300
But that's sort of uh, that's sort of just a just a side note because there also is a lot of other things coming out

40:43.300 --> 40:45.300
Of red hat summit that maybe are

40:45.620 --> 40:48.900
Are bigger breaking news. So red hat summit is kicking off

40:48.900 --> 40:53.940
It's 25th year if you can believe it and they're doing so with a big announcement with ibm

40:54.180 --> 40:59.300
A big expansion between ibm and red hat's partnership and they announced it today. They're very excited about that

40:59.780 --> 41:05.380
and ibm is going all in with containers on red hat enterprise linux and

41:05.380 --> 41:12.040
And ibm is using red hat technology for their new ai and blockchain and internet of things solutions

41:12.660 --> 41:14.100
One of those is probably gonna make a lot of money

41:14.100 --> 41:16.580
And so red hat is probably pretty excited to be at the core of it

41:16.820 --> 41:20.900
But the story that I am the most interested to share with you guys out of red hat summit

41:21.860 --> 41:23.780
And this is the one that I think has some

41:23.780 --> 41:29.060
Longer term ramifications and we've been wondering what was going to happen after the core os acquisition

41:29.060 --> 41:34.660
Core os technologies are being moved into red hat container native products

41:35.300 --> 41:37.780
And it looks like they're kind of doing a merger

41:38.180 --> 41:45.780
They they write on core os.com with the acquisition of container linux. It'll be reborn as red hat core os

41:46.260 --> 41:53.380
A new entry into the red hat ecosystem red hat core os will be based on fedora and red hat enterprise linux sources

41:53.700 --> 41:57.860
And is expected to ultimately supersede atomic host

41:57.860 --> 42:02.260
As red hat's immutable container centric operating system. Wow

42:02.820 --> 42:06.020
I'm slightly disappointed. They didn't call it fedora core os

42:07.300 --> 42:09.300
Yeah, okay, that's fun

42:09.540 --> 42:13.380
I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means for um atomic

42:13.380 --> 42:15.700
I don't I don't understand what it means for core os either

42:15.700 --> 42:19.220
It sounds like core os and atomic are going away and we're getting red hat

42:20.100 --> 42:21.540
core os

42:21.540 --> 42:26.660
Is that the base then container linux is rpm os tree staying around what's happening?

42:26.660 --> 42:32.660
Red hat core os will provide the foundation for red hat's open shift container platform red hat open shift online

42:32.980 --> 42:39.480
And red hat open shift dedicated red hat open shift container platform will also of course continue to support red hat enterprise linux

42:39.700 --> 42:45.300
For those that prefer its life cycle and packaging as the foundation for foundations to their kubernetes deployments

42:45.780 --> 42:49.700
That's pretty thick and it seems like a huge huge development coming out of red hat summit

42:50.180 --> 42:53.460
And I I don't know container linux will continue to provide a

42:53.460 --> 43:00.260
container linux will continue to provide a fast free moving and automated container host and is expected to provide the basis for new operating system

43:00.260 --> 43:02.260
projects from red hat

43:02.340 --> 43:05.460
Seems like there is some something big happening between core os and atomic

43:05.540 --> 43:10.580
So I don't feel any less confused than I did when they bought them. Yeah, I'm just gonna say they've got a lot of different

43:10.640 --> 43:15.620
Initiatives coming out uh from red hat and that's kind of why I wanted to go down to the summit if it could have worked

43:15.620 --> 43:17.620
off 25 years of summits

43:17.620 --> 43:24.500
That's really they're in san francisco this year red hat surpassed 150 million customers. That seems like a big number, too

43:25.060 --> 43:29.380
So big big developments coming out of red hat this week. You got red hat also, uh

43:29.940 --> 43:31.460
Sharing like uh the success stories

43:31.460 --> 43:36.740
They have an ai all of these all of these events are talking about ai so much machine learning

43:36.980 --> 43:42.100
So, I mean I will say all of it is is confusion aside like it's great

43:42.100 --> 43:47.940
There's a lot of really good technology here and it's cool. It it is exciting to see a lot of it continuing and good things

43:47.940 --> 43:51.780
Will come hmm. Yeah when we were watching the build stuff yesterday

43:51.860 --> 43:55.940
Uh, they had uh somebody up on stage that was deploying on a red hat enterprise server

43:56.180 --> 43:58.260
So that was you know seeing that on microsoft stage

43:58.820 --> 44:04.500
Yeah, and then uh, jj you just dropped a link in the chat room about uh, microsoft and red hat working together on a project

44:04.500 --> 44:06.500
What's this is about? What is this about?

44:06.580 --> 44:08.980
They co-developed the first red hat open shift

44:08.980 --> 44:14.340
Uh jointly managed service. Oh, they say by extending our partnership with microsoft

44:14.340 --> 44:21.620
We're able to offer the industry's most comprehensive kubernetes platform on leading public cloud providing the ability for customers to more easily harness

44:22.820 --> 44:28.180
Innovation across the hybrid cloud without produce without sacrificing production stability

44:28.980 --> 44:34.900
Open shift on azure will be a jointly engineered and designed to reduce complexity of container management

44:34.900 --> 44:39.800
Red hat open shift on azure will bring flexibility speed and productivity

44:40.660 --> 44:46.020
Huh, so that's the actual product is red hat open shift on azure. I see. Okay. All right

44:46.340 --> 44:52.580
It's getting very incestuous in a way. It's so weird. It's so it's such a it's such a it's such a strange thud

44:52.660 --> 44:59.780
It's like a re-bloom of all these different branded technologies that are intermixed right and red hat and microsoft getting all friendly

44:59.780 --> 45:03.300
Yeah, and I know we got to get over it. I know we got to get over it, but it's still it's still

45:03.300 --> 45:09.460
I guess everyone's just making that paper. Yeah, I suppose so i've i've been following, um, some of the red hat stuff

45:10.020 --> 45:15.700
But not the traditional red hat angle i've been i've been getting really into fedora 28 since last week's release

45:16.180 --> 45:22.020
So I decided to play around with it to just give it a brief review on linux action news

45:22.340 --> 45:30.100
And in that process it sort of snowballed into me setting up a fedora atomic system and a fedora cloud system

45:30.100 --> 45:35.060
And experimenting with what and how fedora atomic works, which is fascinating. Everything

45:35.620 --> 45:41.940
Is is containerized if you want to install some management tools you install a container which might have another container that needs to pull down

45:42.580 --> 45:44.580
Uh, and that's not necessarily a bad thing

45:44.660 --> 45:48.980
It's just it's a different way of it's a different way of working and sometimes those containers have had issues

45:49.220 --> 45:52.660
So it felt a little still fedora atomic still felt a little raw to me

45:52.660 --> 45:57.860
So I started playing around more seriously with fedora 28 cloud because that felt like it was uh,

45:57.860 --> 45:59.860
further along

45:59.860 --> 46:05.700
And one of the things that is very very different from the last time I really messed around with uh,

46:06.260 --> 46:12.260
Fedora or really red hat on the server is there is so much documentation now for how to do stuff. Really?

46:12.420 --> 46:18.260
Yeah, there wasn't really a there literally was not a singular thing that I got stuck on that I couldn't within

46:19.300 --> 46:25.140
Usually my first google attempt find the answer in the first link or two. That is impressive. Yeah, and I think that's

46:25.140 --> 46:28.260
Especially as you're coming back to it, right? Like that is a very welcoming position

46:28.340 --> 46:33.460
It was and it I think it felt like I was benefiting from the fact that

46:34.260 --> 46:39.460
centos reddit enterprise linux and fedora are all sort of sharing similar command

46:40.000 --> 46:44.740
Syntaxes like they're all using dnf. They basically all have the same stuff in the same place in etsy

46:45.780 --> 46:49.940
It's really all kind of the same now now that they're all kind of caught up with each other and all using system d

46:49.940 --> 46:52.740
Consistent base of yeah, just say what you want to say

46:52.740 --> 46:57.620
So I you know every now and then would find a one-off guide to how to do it on centos and it just happened to work

46:57.620 --> 47:02.180
On fedora, but for the most part I was finding guides on fedora and a lot of it was actually official

47:02.500 --> 47:05.380
Project documentation. I really should give credit to the project here

47:05.380 --> 47:09.700
A lot of it was on like official cockpit project websites or fedora project websites

47:10.420 --> 47:16.820
It has really they've really upped their game. It has really improved the situation with documentation around fedora

47:17.140 --> 47:19.300
Has really really improved and if you're somebody who

47:19.300 --> 47:24.980
You can get pretty far but you forget like what what what do I need to go to do this or what's this command in fedora?

47:24.980 --> 47:30.820
What how do what's even like what is the name of this package if you're capable of like searching on that stuff and getting answers?

47:31.300 --> 47:36.420
I I think you'd be impressed with how manageable fedora 28 is and um

47:37.860 --> 47:39.860
That extends into

47:39.940 --> 47:46.260
A couple of other aspects of fedora and i've had a real ab comparison this week with free nas

47:46.260 --> 47:54.180
And cockpit now, they're not initially comparable, but i'll explain so you might be familiar with when i've raved about cockpit on this show before

47:54.980 --> 47:59.380
Cockpit dash project.org got a link in the show notes cockpit is server management

47:59.540 --> 48:04.900
That makes it easy to manage fedora boxes red hat boxes. They say it's for all linux machines

48:05.620 --> 48:10.180
I've only ever used it on fedora systems. Yeah, i'd like to kind of i'm going to try it on some

48:10.180 --> 48:15.860
I will that would be fascinating. I will give you a tour of it after the show, right? It is

48:15.860 --> 48:18.100
It's first of all, it's simple and easy to use

48:18.900 --> 48:22.900
And and it makes it just you know makes it if you're not familiar with like um

48:23.460 --> 48:28.180
Setting up docker or managing se linux. It makes those things very very approachable

48:28.340 --> 48:35.460
One of the things that I super super super appreciate about cockpit is that it has a brilliant

48:35.460 --> 48:40.100
Se linux troubleshooter. So you you know, for example, I went to go launch a next cloud container

48:40.580 --> 48:45.220
And I wanted my next cloud container to store its data on block storage on digital ocean

48:45.220 --> 48:50.180
So that way I could blow away the container deploy a new container and all of my data would be there

48:50.260 --> 48:52.920
The container is ephemeral. The data is persistent

48:53.620 --> 48:59.220
And se linux wasn't having this it was blocking it because that container wasn't supposed to be accessing that file system

48:59.540 --> 49:01.540
And se linux caught that and it blocked it

49:01.540 --> 49:06.660
But that was preventing my next cloud instance from starting and it I wasn't sure. Well, yeah, what the hell's going on?

49:06.660 --> 49:09.220
Why isn't my why isn't my container starting? Oh, you know

49:10.020 --> 49:15.620
Damn docker blah blah blah blah. Well, you know i'm looking around on cockpit, which uh was just me sort of just uh

49:15.620 --> 49:19.700
I'm just gonna take a look around for a bit because I don't know why this container isn't starting and I look over and I see

49:20.260 --> 49:22.260
se linux

49:22.260 --> 49:25.080
So I click on the se linux thing and it's got categorized

49:25.080 --> 49:31.560
Uh of the recent types of se linux alerts that it's discovered much like the gooey tools do on the fedora desktop

49:32.680 --> 49:34.680
and it's got

49:34.680 --> 49:38.600
Solutions on how to solve it with actual commands that I could run

49:39.160 --> 49:43.800
To flag that stuff as okay in se linux and and mark it as okay in se linux

49:43.880 --> 49:47.560
It gives me the actual commands to run to fix the problem

49:48.120 --> 49:51.320
And when that doesn't work for some reason it doesn't work for me

49:51.320 --> 49:57.160
To fix the problem and when that doesn't work for some reason it's got another brilliant feature

49:57.720 --> 50:03.880
That is is great. It's got an off switch for se linux that disables it until the next realist restart

50:04.200 --> 50:07.160
So you can be in the web interface you can hit this button

50:07.560 --> 50:12.200
You can have that process execute on it's it's our sync job. It needs on the file system

50:12.840 --> 50:13.720
and

50:13.720 --> 50:18.360
You don't have to worry that you forget to ever turn se linux back on because worst case scenario you forget to flip that

50:18.360 --> 50:20.600
Switch back on the next time you reboot it's back on

50:20.600 --> 50:23.960
And you could disable it permanently, but I just think that was really really nice

50:24.280 --> 50:29.000
But the other thing that really made using fedora as a server approachable to me

50:29.240 --> 50:31.400
And this is where I make the comparison to free nose

50:33.800 --> 50:37.480
There's no interference with cockpit when you're managing a fedora system

50:38.200 --> 50:40.200
There's no interference between you

50:40.760 --> 50:43.640
And what you do on the command line and what happens in cockpit?

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
If you start a service via cockpit

50:46.840 --> 50:48.840
It can be stopped via the terminal

50:48.840 --> 50:50.840
If an error occurs in the terminal

50:51.160 --> 50:53.400
You can see it in the cockpit journal interface

50:53.880 --> 50:57.420
If you make a tweak on the command line, like you add a user it's represented

50:58.120 --> 51:01.800
In cockpit, they don't step on each other like it does in free nas like in free nas

51:02.200 --> 51:04.200
You can ssh into a free nas box

51:04.840 --> 51:10.120
And it's it's bsd, but it's not bsd. Like you know it. It's it's like a it's like a small

51:10.680 --> 51:12.600
Strip down bsd

51:12.600 --> 51:15.000
You could say optimized but yeah, you could different

51:15.000 --> 51:20.360
Yeah optimize and the reality is you could make config changes in there that will be persistent while the system is running

51:20.600 --> 51:25.240
But they lose and they're overwritten as soon as the system restarts or you change something in the gooey

51:26.040 --> 51:27.880
They override each other constantly

51:27.880 --> 51:31.320
And for me, it's got to be something where I can really lean heavily on the command line

51:31.400 --> 51:35.660
And then if I want a gooey for remote administration or to look at your resource utilization

51:36.280 --> 51:37.800
I can use cockpit

51:37.800 --> 51:39.400
And uh using cockpit too

51:39.400 --> 51:43.320
It makes it really really easy to deploy docker containers or start virtual machines

51:43.320 --> 51:48.760
And it can search docker hub and so you can put in next cloud it can pull down the official next cloud docker image

51:49.080 --> 51:51.320
And get it started for you and before it starts it'll ask you

51:51.320 --> 51:55.400
Well, how do you want to do the network forwarding? What parts of your file system? Do you want it to get to?

51:55.640 --> 51:57.400
What would you like me to do?

51:57.400 --> 51:59.960
If this instance crashes, would you like me to restart it?

52:00.280 --> 52:03.960
Would you like me to always restart it or only restart it if you haven't stopped it previously?

52:04.680 --> 52:07.160
And you can go in there and set tunables like that as well

52:07.160 --> 52:11.480
Like don't use too much cpu don't use too much memory and then you hit the play button

52:11.480 --> 52:14.360
It starts up the container you decide you no longer want that

52:14.360 --> 52:17.880
It's one click you destroy the container you pull down a new one you reattach it to your data

52:18.040 --> 52:19.880
And you got a fresh system again

52:19.880 --> 52:21.960
And that's what I started playing with this weekend

52:22.840 --> 52:30.360
And through this process I ended up moving over a whole bunch of rigs that were running. Uh, one was an arch system

52:31.080 --> 52:32.600
maybe two actually

52:32.600 --> 52:33.320
and uh

52:33.320 --> 52:40.520
Ubuntu 14.04 so I don't think there was a six there may be a 16.04 system in there that hasn't been moved yet. So

52:40.520 --> 52:46.440
It was a smattering of arch smattering of uh older ubuntu systems that I needed to do something with that

52:46.440 --> 52:50.600
They're just been getting neglected. So while you were talking about this I spun up a

52:51.300 --> 52:55.880
1804 droplet and now cockpit's running. It's it's in the repository. You just apt install and yeah

52:55.880 --> 52:56.440
There we go

52:56.440 --> 53:01.400
That was easy that I wonder about and i'd be curious to see the ui is the way it works with cockpit on fedora

53:01.480 --> 53:03.960
Is that like parts of cockpit are modular?

53:04.040 --> 53:08.840
So if you want to manage the disks then you install that aspect of cockpit if you want to manage

53:08.840 --> 53:15.160
Docker then you install that aspect of cockpit. So like there's individual components of cockpit. I see you can load or not load

53:15.560 --> 53:19.960
I wonder is that is that true? Do you see multiple cockpit packages on ubuntu or do you see?

53:20.680 --> 53:23.960
That's let me look do a little search there. I'd be curious to know that because shit

53:24.600 --> 53:29.800
I'm gonna i'm gonna put that on my systems because the nice thing about cockpit is you can manage multiple systems cockpit bridge

53:29.960 --> 53:34.680
Docker machines network manager. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Yep. Oh shoot. That's great. Well then

53:34.680 --> 53:39.880
Then everybody should do this. So one of the things that I decided to do was consolidate down

53:40.440 --> 53:45.500
To a single fedora 28 instance and you might be wondering why fedora why not centos?

53:45.960 --> 53:52.040
Or reda enterprise linux or maybe 1804 with right? Why not that right? So I want I want to address that because

53:53.000 --> 54:00.840
That was I think the linchpin decision that I made and it's based on a multi-year project that i've been testing behind the scenes

54:00.840 --> 54:06.440
To sort of sort out where I wanted to go in the future and uh, I don't have a lot of these

54:06.440 --> 54:12.040
But every now and then i've got like these three-year long projects that i've been brewing behind the scenes so that we can come

54:12.040 --> 54:17.960
On the air and say i've been i've been skunk working this for a long time and this is what I found and so

54:18.520 --> 54:21.160
That's one of these situations. That's what we're going to talk about next

54:21.400 --> 54:23.980
So let's mention linux academy go to linuxacademy.com

54:23.980 --> 54:30.460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug to sign up for a free seven-day trial of a linux training platform you sign up

54:30.700 --> 54:33.580
And you get access to everything it's nice and easy like that

54:33.740 --> 54:40.220
It's a full feature training library with everything you need to learn about things that run linux and run it and linux runs on

54:40.620 --> 54:44.140
Everything you need to learn and get hands-on experience self-paced in-depth video courses

54:44.460 --> 54:50.460
Hands-on scenario based labs that spin up when you need them ushn learning paths, which are series of courses and content

54:50.460 --> 54:55.580
Planned by instructors and speaking of instructors. They have few full-time human beings

54:56.460 --> 54:59.180
Topic matter experts that are available to help

55:00.220 --> 55:01.900
That's huge. Wow, that's huge

55:01.900 --> 55:03.900
That really is that is a unique advantage

55:04.140 --> 55:08.300
And they also have something that I think is brilliant for those of you who are busy a course scheduler system

55:08.620 --> 55:13.100
You can pick a course time you set your time frame your learning goals and they'll help you stick to it

55:13.260 --> 55:16.220
They also have practice exams and quizzes to help get you ready

55:16.220 --> 55:21.840
Certification training which are courses created specifically to prepare you for exams to get the big certs

55:22.240 --> 55:28.720
Of course, they've got mobile apps and study guides like lesson audio personal notebooks and other tools that help you study while on the go

55:29.680 --> 55:31.360
They're always adding new features, too

55:31.360 --> 55:36.720
They added 70 plus new courseware challenges and all other kinds of content to linux academy

55:36.880 --> 55:42.080
Just last month and they're rolling out new stuff all the time and you can try it out seven days for free

55:42.080 --> 55:48.880
When you go to linux academy.com slash unplugged linux academy.com slash unplugged to support the show and sign up for a free

55:49.200 --> 55:56.400
Seven-day trial big. Thank you linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program go try out those hands-on labs take advantage of that platform

55:57.040 --> 56:01.760
So fedora cloud has been kicking around in this in the back

56:02.320 --> 56:06.880
Well really on digital ocean droplets, but I was going to come up with some some great story

56:06.880 --> 56:12.320
But no really just on digital ocean droplets fedora cloud, uh, I think since they announced it in fedora 24

56:12.400 --> 56:15.520
I don't remember when it came out, but it started as a fedora

56:17.740 --> 56:23.520
23 22 system kind of got refactored around fedora 24 and since then

56:24.720 --> 56:32.640
I've been running mb and nextcloud on and off on this system in production on and off for years now since really around fedora 22

56:32.640 --> 56:36.960
Fedora 24 kind of did a big revamp and now with fedora 28

56:37.440 --> 56:44.480
I can report that I have successfully been able to upgrade that box to every single release of fedora

56:44.720 --> 56:50.160
I have drugged that box from the 22 days all the way up now to 28

56:50.880 --> 56:52.880
and in that time

56:53.360 --> 56:54.880
Nothing is broken

56:54.880 --> 56:56.880
Not a single failure to update

56:56.880 --> 57:02.560
Never has my nextcloud instance gone down. Never has my mb instance been broken. Wow, that's

57:03.200 --> 57:08.320
That's some uptime. And I the reason why I wanted to do this is I said to myself I cannot use fedora

57:08.880 --> 57:11.520
in production if I have to

57:12.160 --> 57:13.760
roll the dice

57:13.760 --> 57:16.240
And worry that every nine or ten months or so

57:17.040 --> 57:19.040
I'm gonna break my system

57:19.360 --> 57:22.880
And I thought well what i'll do is i'll put a couple of things that

57:22.880 --> 57:27.680
That would be a pain in my butt if they go down but aren't going to wreck my day, right?

57:27.680 --> 57:31.760
Doesn't stop shows from going on air. It's not right, but you still need yes, exactly

57:31.840 --> 57:36.000
And so that was sort of the sweet spot for this job and I thought it's enough where i'll use it

57:36.080 --> 57:40.320
But not enough where I will swear off the door if it breaks and um

57:41.600 --> 57:47.040
I when I don't know when I when I did the update to 28 on that son of a bitch and it still didn't break

57:47.520 --> 57:51.920
I sat back and went what the hell am I so worried about i've got snapshots. I've got backups

57:51.920 --> 57:56.880
I'm putting all of this stuff in containers anyways, and all of the data is living on block storage

57:57.920 --> 58:02.800
What do I care? And so um, that's when I started playing with fedora atomic and 28 cloud

58:02.880 --> 58:08.320
I did a fresh cloud install of fedora 28 after I played around with atomic and I did just that I

58:09.120 --> 58:13.920
I detached the block storage from the old 22 that had been brought all the way up to 28

58:14.480 --> 58:16.720
Moved it over to the new 28 instance

58:17.680 --> 58:19.680
installed cockpit

58:19.680 --> 58:21.680
Loaded up docker

58:22.800 --> 58:26.480
Set up a fresh next cloud instance connected to the old next cloud data

58:26.880 --> 58:30.400
Same thing with mb and now I think I think i'm actually going to go even further

58:30.640 --> 58:33.680
Uh and that when that worked that's when I went well then

58:34.240 --> 58:39.520
Why don't I just add more ram and cpu to this system and just shut down these three other droplets?

58:40.000 --> 58:45.120
Yeah, and move them all over if I put it all in containers. I have the data on block storage. I've got backups enabled

58:45.120 --> 58:49.360
Uh, I mean it was just like this is really really great

58:49.680 --> 58:53.680
And I thought I would just mess around with one or two things by the end of the night

58:53.920 --> 59:00.240
I had everything moved over and i've also ended up setting up qo notes again where it's sinking back to my next cloud instance

59:00.320 --> 59:03.200
Which is amazing. It's just been great

59:04.160 --> 59:11.760
And that is slick. So i've moved i've moved over. Uh, my quosel backend is now, uh living in a uh, is living in a container

59:11.760 --> 59:18.560
There is some usenet programs that are now living in a container. There is an audio stream process that is living in a container

59:18.560 --> 59:25.920
There's an mp4 backup process that's living in the container you container hipster you i'm going crazy with these things on this fedora 28 system

59:26.240 --> 59:31.360
It really seems like you uh, you're empowered to to maintain and to like set up your systems now

59:31.360 --> 59:34.640
It seems like you kind of you came to a lot of systems that have been running for a long time

59:34.880 --> 59:39.040
Not documented not easy to figure out what was happening. Yep. Yeah now it's clear and easy

59:39.040 --> 59:44.400
It is really nice because using fedora. It feels very um professional grade

59:44.960 --> 59:48.640
Not that and i'm not taking away anything from any other distribution just you know going into it

59:48.640 --> 59:51.600
Sometimes I have bad experiences and it's like oh man, this is amateur hour

59:51.760 --> 59:57.600
I tend not to share those sometimes but you know, I get very critical like this is ridiculous. I can't believe they ship this

59:57.600 --> 59:59.200
This is embarrassing

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.720
I think we had a conversation about that earlier today when it came to yes

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.680
We did the other thing I was comparing it to recently anyways, uh fedora cloud is something a little different though

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.200
It's it's images that are really not meant to be ever installed on bare metal

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.160
They're really designed to run in a virtualizer

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.440
Um, they also make docker and vagrant images available

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.480
But you don't really just go get the image and dd the iso to a thumb drive

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:32.400
It's really something that is deployable by your cloud provider and it's a very bare minimal install fedora cloud

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.400
It doesn't really have much of anything, but everything's just dnf install away

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.880
You have your basic tools, you know, you can get nano in seconds. So everything will be all right

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.640
Right everything that you need is there or if not, it's it's right there you bastard

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.240
And so it's it's really simple to just dnf the couple of things you might need to get off the ground

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.240
and because the web services and the I set up also, um,

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.240
A mariah db server, uh, these are all in containers. So i'm not even using dnf

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.240
so the the core fedora 28 cloud install is

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.640
Is super minimal. It's the base fedora 28 cloud

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.400
With a couple of modifications to the ssh config and a couple of additional packages for cockpit and docker

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.120
And the rest is all running in these containers

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.600
which are destroyable

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.600
and um have their data stored outside the docker image

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320
and that really was the

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.640
uh, just perfect for me because I I I can manage every once a year upgrading this fedora box

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.600
It works fine. And as long as my applications stay fresh i'm happy there, too

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.800
It was surprisingly pro. I think it might even be a sweet spot for you where it's it's not rolling

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.440
It's not arch, right?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.680
You don't have to update it every week to stay safe

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.080
But it's also not a four-year lts where by the time you've come back to it your needs have changed

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.240
You've forgotten what you did or there's been a lot of different changes in like available software

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.280
One year might just be the nice cadence where you stay fresh

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.080
Yeah

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.160
Also, it does a lot of small defaults that I just don't really care to fiddle with anymore

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.040
like the ssh config is uh root login is turned off by default and

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.520
It only accepts key logins

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.480
Se linux policy is not intensely, um too stringent, but it's it's a

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.000
It's a reasonable default that I probably wouldn't have set up myself. The base package selection is just right

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.880
Um, which I wouldn't have had the expertise to respin a fedora. I could have done an archer ubuntu

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.440
Sure, but not a fedora one and um, the thing that put it over the top was the combination of the super clear

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.560
easy to find documentation and the

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.200
Totally solid implementation of cockpit. I really put it over the top for me

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.200
I hope you're not allergic to bees west. You're not allergic to bees. Are you? No, I am not

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.400
Hey, we got a visitor in the studio. Yeah, we do. Hey, buddy. We got a really big wasp in the studio right now

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.120
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do about that. We'll just keep going on. Hopefully no one's ready

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.040
Yeah, right. He is allergic to him. Anyways, I wanted to share that with you and I also wanted to share if you um,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.520
Are considering trying out some nextcloud

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.760
Which if you have q own nodes and you do that nextcloud back end it is some sweet evernote killing magic

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.160
Check out uh flockus f l o c c u s

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:20.640
Which syncs your firefox bookmarks to nextcloud bookmarks and what's really kind of nice about it

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.040
Is you can sync just one folder of your firefox bookmarks if you want

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.200
That's nice, which is actually exactly what I do

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.320
I have like a current weeks bookmarks that are just for things for this week

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.200
And that's what i'd love to sync to nextcloud. So that's what i'm doing

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:39.120
Um, you do have to have firefox 57 and you can't be using I think the built-in firefox sync

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.720
So that is the downside to it, but it was kind of cool and i'll have a link to it in the show notes

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.800
It's uh f l o c c u s

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.680
all in all, um

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.800
I guess what I what I wanted to convey is

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.040
If you've been skeptical about using fedora in production

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.040
I'd say give it a go for a while do like I did do a little test do a skunk works

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.960
See if it works for you

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.920
Obviously, there's so many great choices that i'm not trying to switch anybody

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.000
But I was really impressed and I did think it was kind of funny to be sitting there like

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.280
I'm loving kubuntu on my workstations and i'm loving fedora on my servers. Yeah, I had a fedora server

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.920
I think it started at 17. It went to maybe 21 then it you know ended up switching things up

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920
But yeah, it was it was really stable. Yeah, I remember when uh

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.040
When I was really stuck like in a position

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.560
I felt stuck at least of trying to support reddit enterprise systems really before they even incorporated yum

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.840
Um, but around that time it I really I really grew to sort of dislike me managing redhat systems and I and I thought

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:48.080
Apt and debian were so and then later ubuntu were so much simpler. So saner defaults easier to update easier to maintain

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.080
That I went into it with I think that's why it took me

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.680
Years of really trying this out before I would accept that it was possible to do it because I kind of had a bad taste

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.520
from my sysadmin days

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.080
You know just sitting there having to man. I mean, do you feel that way with the systems you manage in your day job?

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.360
do you feel like the redhat systems are more of a pain in the arse to manage than the

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.960
especially if you don't have like a enterprise subscription where you get the nice fancy centralized management, it's just

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.600
You know, I think it's gotten a lot better. I think I think these days it is quite reasonable

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.480
I like the security story a lot on redhat style systems

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.800
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that way too. I felt like oh, okay

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:32.320
Yeah, especially now right especially if you're if you're running containers or or any of the other solutions

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:39.760
Application availability like I I don't necessarily have to install it with with dnf if I can get you know

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.160
If it's crucial it apt or dnf doesn't really matter if you're doing it all through containers

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.880
And then most of it's still there right like 90 is in the repository. It's just those last 10 miles and that's

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.160
That that 10 that's well covered. I think what you just nailed it is having all this stuff moved into containers is

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.480
Is really kind of making the underlying os a lot less relevant to me

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:06.080
And so then it's like well who's getting that little implementation right that that minimal shim that I need who's getting that right?

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:12.560
And uh, that's that's a competitive space for distributions to to try to figure that out right now. I think it's very competitive

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:18.160
Yeah, right, especially that's like it's the container os or it's some tiny vm os that lives in a droplet or ec2 instance

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.400
You want it to be tuned well and just work?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.420
So this minimal layer is something that I think is going to be like the big area of growth for distributions

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.040
Google I don't really think as part of io, but they just announced their own kind of container runtime

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.200
I think you saw this. Uh, we were chatting a little bit about it, uh in slack the other night

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.440
Um the g visor remember this yeah g visor g visor is sort of along these same lines

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:50.640
It's an open source sandbox container runtime. And again, it's about kind of making the underlying linux os

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.040
irrelevant

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.720
I think that's worth thinking about for a minute

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.320
Like what does that really mean?

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.240
If all of a sudden the distribution you're using doesn't really matter anymore

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.880
And maybe the fact that it doesn't even need to be linux anymore. So this is from google's uh,

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:14.480
Uh, uh, um, what do they call this google blog.com I guess and they're open sourcing g visor a new kind of sandbox that helps

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.760
Provide secure isolation for containers while being more lightweight than a virtual machine

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.720
G visor integrates with docker and kubernetes making it simple to run sandbox containers in production, but it's not a container

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:34.880
Applications that run in traditional linux containers access system resources in the same way that a regular application does by making system calls

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.840
Directly to the host kernel the kernel runs in a privileged mode that allows it to interact with necessary hardware

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.040
And then returns the results to the application with traditional containers

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:49.060
The kernel imposes some limits on the resources that the application can access these limits are implemented

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.160
Through the use of linux c groups and namespaces, but not all resources can be controlled via these mechanisms furthermore

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.920
Even with these limits the kernel still exposes a large surface area that a malicious application could attack directly

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.600
Of course vms are too much overhead too much bulk to emulate the entire hardware stack

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.640
So enter g visor a lightweight container slimmer than a vm

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.880
That maintains similar levels of isolation as a vm

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.640
The core of g visor is a kernel that runs as a normal unprivileged process

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.240
And is capable of supporting most linux system calls

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.600
I like the one way that described it think about it as implementing linux by way of linux

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.320
So it's just a use a regular user space process

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.360
That is an implement acting as a kernel and implementing a subset of the all of the kernel apis

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.760
So they've they've put a kernel in my kernel, you know, I mean not I mean so why I guess for isolation purposes

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.120
I guess they just answered that but their kernel inside this g visor environment is written in go

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.200
Which they say was chosen for its memory and type safety

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:04.240
And just like within a vm the application running within g visor sandbox gets its own kernel and its own set of virtualized devices

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:10.320
Distinct from the host and other sandbox. Yeah, it's like a very minimalized set of what a vm might do

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.840
But without all the hardware aspects and it provides the kernel. So from the application side, you're still just doing software

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.200
You're not worrying about running your own kernel

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.040
It provides the kernel but it implements a very minimal set because that's that's been one of the biggest flaws with containers

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.560
Right is that even though they are contained in many ways a lot of vulnerability showed up because there's a huge amount of sys

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.840
Calls that we have to defend against if you can instead implement safe minimal set. That's the aim here

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.440
Then you have a lot a lot less surface area. Yeah

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.160
and it also sort of

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.120
Prevents you from writing directly to that dirty linux, you know now you can target the g visor environment

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:54.400
And they could make g visor available for fuchsia in the future. They can they can make g visor run on free bsd if they wanted

01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:02.160
Uh g visor can be thought of as an extremely para virtualized operating system with flexible resource footprint and lower fixed cost than a full vm

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.720
Comes at a higher price per system call overhead and some application compatibility though. So those are the downsides

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
see this this this

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:18.640
Idea of running your applications in containers is the future like there is when we talk about like is that in the distros repo?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720
I love the aur

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.200
Drop in the bucket compared to what's on docker hub drop in the bucket. Everything's on docker hub

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.160
And so here's how it works

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.400
Now when I spin up a next cloud container

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.600
I'm also spinning up a mariah db and i'm connecting the next cloud container to the mariah db container

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.520
So that way my database is in one container my next clouds in another container my qualsal cores in another container

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.480
And uh, they can all talk to the database container if I if I choose right? That's one thing that they have an advantage

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.600
I was right they're thinking about and are used to construct systems, right?

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:52.080
It turns out oftentimes you need those and it's not just a command line tool that sits by itself

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.580
Yeah, and so now I don't think about getting the packages. I don't think about dependencies

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:05.280
I think about well, what containers do I need and a lot of times they'll pull down dependent containers, too. So it's um,

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.620
I don't know. It's a totally different way of managing software and it makes linux a bit less relevant

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.440
Which is sort of the creepy thing about it

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.520
You know, I mean like it really does linux is kind of just an implementation detail

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.680
Yeah, because you can put docker on mac os you could put gvisor potentially on mac os

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.880
I don't know how much of linux kernel is dependent on but it seems like that might be possible

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.000
Especially if at the application layer they're isolating that stuff out. So in the future they could yeah

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.400
How much does this become a platform? Yeah, I don't know. It seems like it is a platform in itself

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.400
It is a busy week for the enterprise with microsoft and red hat and google announcing a bunch of this services stuff

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.480
Um and linux is playing a surprisingly large role in all of it

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.000
It seems like a weird time though because there's a lot there's a lot of these efforts that are

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.520
that are open source that are fit a lot with our fundamentals but

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.280
Feel somewhat separate like it's its own special subset of open source

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.800
That's like enterprise open source and two giant teams somewhere use it

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.040
Yeah, it also feels like we have several things going in slightly different directions in this regard

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.880
You know, you got what red hat's doing with core os you got g visor out there

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.800
You got what microsoft's doing with hyper-v and and special hyper-v environments

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.120
and um

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.080
You still got rocket out there doing its thing. Mm-hmm. And of course that you've have you heard the word about zones, Chris?

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200
Zones are the word

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.520
Uh zones and jails haven't you heard about the have you heard the good news about jails free bsd at first west

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.520
Don't never forget

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.800
All right, well, uh

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.800
One more tease there for texas linux vest if you're going to be in the austin area towards the end of june

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.600
Or no towards the beginning of june june 9th and 10th or whatever it is

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.480
Come say hi. Come say hi eat copious amounts of barbecue. Hang out with me. Come say hi to the folks at linux academy

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.520
He'll be the guy covered in barbecue sauce. Just look for that all the time

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.720
Like just in in if i'm not actively eating barbecue

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.560
So you can't tell if it's me look at my shirt if there's barbecue sauce on my shirt 90 chance

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.720
It's me plus the little barbecue covered dog, too

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.120
Oh, that would be adorable. Uh, mr. West. Why don't they go get more review? Where can they find a little more? Uh, wes

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.040
Oh, maybe you should check out tech snap data systems

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.960
I hear it's a weekly podcast that covers systems network and administration topics. It absolutely does

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.440
Hmm check that out tech snap dot systems. I'll give a plug ski for tech talk today

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.600
We've been staying on top of all of the news this week at tech talk dot today

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.960
Ange and I busting through the headlines. We've got one more coming up later this week if you want to check that out

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.960
And then why not join us live on tuesdays hang out here with the virtual love and then you stick around

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.080
Get the ask nor program extra special bonus and call him up ask him what's going on

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.320
See what he's up to see how he's feeling see if he watched unplugged just ask him that

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.440
Yeah, you see what see what he says just talk to him. Just ask him how he's feeling

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.080
Yeah

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.280
And uh, you get a linux you get a whole linux experience when you come here on tuesdays go to jblive.tv for that

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.020
And jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for those lifetimes our website's linux unplugged.com

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.660
Linux unplugged.com slash 248 for links to everything we talked about and linux unplugged.com slash subscribe

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:20.280
For all the ways to get new episodes. Thanks for being here. See you right back here next tuesday

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.820
So

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.060
Man next week's gonna seem so low-key when all these events aren't going on. No kidding

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.420
It'll be a harder show

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:06.500
It was well this week I felt like was kind of hard because there's like so many things that aren't really interesting to talk about

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.940
But are important to the overall ecosystem. I feel like it was a rough episode really to be honest with you

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:19.540
Not not particularly happy with this one. Not particularly happy not not because you know anything we did well, I mean maybe but mostly just because

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.420
Uh, there's so much enterprise-y stuff and I feel like when we start talking dirty

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:28.740
Yeah, I feel like I feel like when we talk too much about containers people's eyes start to gloss over because

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.260
If you're not living and breathing this stuff, it's hard to connect with it

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.300
And yeah, we just want to talk about plasma. Come on. Yeah

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.300
Yeah, why are you stopping us?

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.220
I don't agree with that

01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:45.540
Yeah, because you give the lots of views of the chance to try some things out and never heard of it because it's easy

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.380
I hope that's true

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.220
Uh, you know, I hope that's true

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:55.060
I I don't know. My sense is that most people find it to be sort of the least interesting aspect of the stuff we cover

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:02.180
But it is but it has so much momentum in that one space and it is so relevant to the marketplace like when you go to

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:08.660
To any trade event or you talk to anybody in the industry. It's only thing they're really thinking about. That's all they're talking about

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:31.700
It really has taken over the world
