WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
So Wimpy, you were talking about video games.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.880
My friend, if you're going to get into games, guess what?

00:05.880 --> 00:12.400
New Humble Bundle 12 is out, and they are finally, once again, rocking the Linux support.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.780
And there's some good ones on here.

00:13.780 --> 00:17.680
There is Gone Home, good game, Luftharossers?

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
How do you say that, Eric?

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
What do you think?

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Luftharossers.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
Let's take a little look at this one.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
Let's see what this is about.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.840
Because I think this is mild fantasy violence.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
Alright.

00:25.840 --> 00:34.680
Oh, that was a fun game, actually, yeah, I got really into that for a while.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Luftharossers?

00:35.680 --> 00:39.800
Yeah, if it's what I think it is, it's a side-scrolling, uh...

00:39.800 --> 00:41.600
Oh, this actually looks like a lot of fun.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.160
Yeah, it's a super game.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.160
Okay.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.160
It's short, though.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.160
It's actually a little short.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.720
Ah, that's actually not a bad thing for me.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.520
Is it like the airplane flying around in there?

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
Yeah.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.520
Yeah.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.520
That's not bad.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.520
Okay, so then you've also got Hammerwatch.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
Let's take a look at it and see what...

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
Oh, this is a really good game.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
You've got SteamWorld.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
Dig that.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
I've heard a lot about this.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
I actually have that one.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.520
Oh, yeah.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
Papers, Please is also...

01:02.520 --> 01:03.520
Here, watch this one.

01:03.520 --> 01:17.040
This Papers, Please is a great game.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.040
Papers, Please.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.040
It's like the whole game right there, too.

01:19.040 --> 01:29.440
Well, that's sad.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.440
Mm-hmm.

01:32.440 --> 01:40.240
Isn't that interesting?

01:40.240 --> 01:41.960
Denied.

01:41.960 --> 01:48.760
What's funny about this is I have worked in a U.S. Customs facility in SeaTac Airport,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.680
and I got to work in a U.S. Customs facility.

01:50.680 --> 01:51.680
Oh, I see.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
So you've worked in a U.S. Customs facility?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Yes, I've worked in a U.S. Customs facility.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
Oh, okay.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
I see.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
I see.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
So, yeah, that's a good game.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.680
Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.680
Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
Yeah, I can see that.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
I can definitely see that.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
Yeah, I can see that.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
All right, so we've got...

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
This is pretty good.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
All right, so should we check in to see how the funding is doing?

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
You know I always like to look at this, right?

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
I always got to see how we're doing.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
Oh, all right, we got to watch the video.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Come on.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.680
They've always got the crazy voiceover guy.

02:10.680 --> 02:16.600
Watch here we go windows mac and linux drm free and with steam keys for one low price

Ha ha cool

02:41.960 --> 02:47.440
Hammer watch leaving dungeons unexplored not on my hammer watch

02:51.320 --> 02:56.200
And steam world dig I ain't saying he a steam world digger

02:56.200 --> 03:01.000
Do you think in addition to steam world dig there might also be a steam world reddit?

03:01.000 --> 03:09.760
And also get loose trousers come fly the unfriendly skies

03:15.520 --> 03:17.520

03:17.520 --> 03:26.760
Hey, what's the big idea here? I always remember to bring papers. Looks like a short drama called lady and the stamp

03:35.240 --> 03:40.040
Should I rummage through these private doc? Have you played this? Well, you know what they say when in home

03:40.040 --> 03:47.520
Pay ten dollars or more and get prison art. Oh, look how he did that prison is what you make of it in this game

03:47.520 --> 03:53.560
That features architecture with conviction not adding it to your bundle would be a crime

03:54.240 --> 04:01.100
As a special bonus everyone who purchases this bundle for sixty five dollars or more will also whoa

04:30.760 --> 04:34.660
Have they ever done the swag thing before so, let's see. Okay now let's take a look

04:34.660 --> 04:37.800
I look at this the top donator right now is

04:38.480 --> 04:46.140
Is a bitly URL, you know for 200 bucks. That's not a bad ad spot that that'd be actually that's worth $200

04:46.140 --> 04:47.280
Oh, yeah

04:47.280 --> 04:49.280
If you put a URL in there like that

04:49.560 --> 04:52.400
So, okay. Here we go. We average Windows price

04:52.960 --> 04:54.960

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
average Macintosh price

04:57.360 --> 05:01.880
$8.84 average Linux price

05:01.880 --> 05:08.360
$9.69

05:13.480 --> 05:20.480
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's not yet chained down by the wrist proprietary hardware. My name is Chris

05:21.000 --> 05:24.880
My name is Matt. Hey Matt, guess what 57 episodes in a row, buddy

05:25.400 --> 05:29.200
Big five seven already. I know now we're like ketchup. You know what? That's cool

05:29.200 --> 05:34.520
It's cool to be like ketchup Matt and you know to help us celebrate being tasty like ketchup in studio producer Eric

05:34.520 --> 05:39.960
Hey, Eric. Hey Chris. How you doing? Good. Are you feeling like Heinz 57 today? A little ketchup a little bit great

05:39.960 --> 05:40.560
Yeah, yeah

05:40.560 --> 05:46.120
You and I are on a marathon broadcast in marathon broadcast mode still because we did that Apple thing this morning

05:46.120 --> 05:51.040
Yeah, that'll be in tech talk today. It's probably gonna be out probably posted while we're recording. Yeah

05:51.320 --> 05:56.440
It was like a two-hour show. It was a big show. Yeah, it was a big show like encoding nightmare. Yeah

05:56.440 --> 06:01.280
Yeah, it takes extra processes. You gotta have more i7. We need more all of the i7

06:01.360 --> 06:05.680
Well coming up in today's episode of the unplugged show. We got a lot of ground to cover

06:05.680 --> 06:08.520
We have a little make good from last week. We didn't get a chance to talk about DNF

06:08.640 --> 06:10.640
We're gonna do that in the latter half of the show

06:11.120 --> 06:14.800
We also have I know you're gonna think it's crazy. You're gonna think I'm nuts

06:14.880 --> 06:18.120
we got to talk about system D just a little bit more because I

06:19.240 --> 06:23.880
Think I figured out where all the controversies coming from. Yeah, I think I've isolated it down

06:23.880 --> 06:28.400
I think we can finally put this topic to bed once we just get it out there in the open

06:28.480 --> 06:32.500
Who's stirring up trouble? Why are they're stirring it up? I think I got the answer for you

06:32.500 --> 06:35.640
We're gonna talk about in today's unplugged call them out put it on the record

06:35.640 --> 06:38.580
So that way we as a public can move on from all of this shenanigans

06:38.840 --> 06:44.240
So we're gonna talk about that in the show and then our mobile room joins us to talk about open media vault today

06:44.240 --> 06:46.320
I think we're supposed to at least we'll see how that goes

06:46.320 --> 06:49.320
I did they've been doing a little open media vault review and

06:49.320 --> 06:54.800
They've been preparing to come on and talk about their experiences with open media vault

06:54.800 --> 06:58.800
So mama room time appropriate greetings to you guys. Welcome to the unplugged show today. Oh

07:00.240 --> 07:02.240
Whiskey, yes

07:02.720 --> 07:07.000
Wimpy are you ready to talk about open media vault today? Are you excited? Oh, yeah

07:10.280 --> 07:14.180
Someone hold that man down free now is everybody review over free now

07:14.180 --> 07:20.260
I'm not exactly the right person be asking because he gets overly excited about nothing. That's true

07:20.260 --> 07:22.340
I didn't want to give away my true feelings

07:24.460 --> 07:29.060
Well, let's see, let's start with our first email see if we can get to the true feelings behind talks

07:29.540 --> 07:32.500
Travis wrote in to Linux unplugged says hey guys

07:32.500 --> 07:38.500
I saw a water article on a little piece of a little project called you talks and I found it to be an interesting concept any

07:38.500 --> 07:41.700
Plans for highlighting it during an upcoming show that you guys are probably familiar with talks

07:41.700 --> 07:47.580
It aims to be a Skype replacement that's secure encrypted and it's more like a protocol where a front-end could be written for it

07:47.580 --> 07:51.980
And no, you were just saying a little earlier you were experimenting with talks. What was your takeaway?

07:52.500 --> 07:55.700
Yeah, so me and actually a couple other people in the mumble room

07:57.540 --> 08:03.220
Tried to got talks installed and started using it and I want to say first I think it's a fantastic

08:03.220 --> 08:06.980
I think it's it's the potential for the project is fantastic

08:06.980 --> 08:10.180
And I think it's a fantastic idea and I think it's going fantastic directions

08:10.180 --> 08:15.820
However, it's very much not ready for daily use at least not from my experience

08:16.740 --> 08:21.220
We were able to establish a call. We were able to have a conversation and that worked really well

08:22.140 --> 08:23.300
Unfortunately to get that call

08:23.300 --> 08:30.120
I had to have my client already open and waiting for the the the thing to pop up because the notification didn't work

08:30.120 --> 08:34.560
That was a gnome. I couldn't even get it installed. It wouldn't even install on 1404

08:34.560 --> 08:41.320
What like I said once it got connected we were able to have a conversation and that worked for about five or six minutes and

08:41.320 --> 08:43.320
Then the entire client would crash

08:43.800 --> 08:45.640
In the middle of a call

08:45.640 --> 08:47.520
Yeah, right in the middle of a call

08:47.520 --> 08:49.280
group group

08:49.280 --> 08:54.080
Conversate like like we're more than one person was connected. Yeah. Oh, yeah work at all group chat worked. Okay

08:55.040 --> 09:01.040
But the like single one person to one person chat also would crash after like five or six minutes of use. Yeah

09:01.040 --> 09:04.760
So you're saying it sucked. Well, I'm here's what I'm saying

09:04.760 --> 09:06.000
I'm saying that you know

09:06.000 --> 09:12.200
It's it's one of those things where when I'm sure once they get once everything reaches stable and it gets and it gets released

09:12.200 --> 09:18.200
Yeah, it will be a fantastic project. It just it's clearly not where you know, for example Skype is today, of course

09:18.200 --> 09:22.720
Yeah, it shouldn't be because how much longer right and how much more money you might have to develop sky. Yeah

09:22.720 --> 09:27.520
Yeah, it's early days doing it a little bit wrong here talks is more of a client

09:27.520 --> 09:32.280
No a server and a protocol you're judging the client one of many fair enough. Yeah

09:32.760 --> 09:36.140
Although his experience sort of echoes experience with the other talks clients

09:36.140 --> 09:40.900
I think just I think there's a I think the underlying aspect of it's still moving and I think of course the top you eyes

09:40.960 --> 09:44.200
You're right. It's more like it's more like HTTP in a sense

09:44.200 --> 09:49.280
It's you can have multiple web browsers that can browse the web. You're gonna have multiple talks front ends, but that might yes

09:49.280 --> 09:50.920
I'm not I'm not

09:50.920 --> 09:55.220
This maybe is going to be a data point to this to this potential

09:55.220 --> 10:01.040
But I I think maybe what we're seeing here is this is the wrong approach for this type of product and service

10:01.040 --> 10:03.560
I think you need to have a client that is

10:04.220 --> 10:10.640
Integrated at the same time with the back end like it the two things shouldn't be developed in a vacuum. I don't I don't think

10:12.680 --> 10:17.960
This seems like you have to have if you when you put when you build a feature into something that the back end can support

10:17.960 --> 10:20.520
The client needs that and you have to build it, you know

10:20.520 --> 10:25.880
Then see how the client responds to that and adjust the back end to how do you how can these two separate things be?

10:26.080 --> 10:31.820
Fully feature compatible. How will they ever sync up in terms of what the back end can do versus what front ends can do?

10:31.820 --> 10:36.880
And etc. It seems well, you're absolutely right in order to have the back end work

10:36.880 --> 10:42.400
You have to have a front end that works with the back end and if the two do not work together then what's the point?

10:42.400 --> 10:48.440
What do you think dare Devlin? So they are actually from what I understood and I tried all the clients listed on the page

10:48.440 --> 10:55.000
Toxic is the client that is been worked and doing that kind of iteration that you're talking

10:55.000 --> 11:01.420
That's the one I like the most and that one never failed in doing any of the tasks that it already says it does

11:01.960 --> 11:05.000
So it only doesn't do audio yet

11:05.000 --> 11:07.560
However, it does already the other things ready really well

11:07.560 --> 11:11.960
And I think it's on progress because they are trying to refine it step by step

11:12.680 --> 11:16.080
Other clients are focusing on the experimental

11:16.080 --> 11:19.800
Experimental API that it's available for the toxic library

11:19.800 --> 11:24.560
Well, it's a to the actual protocol and I think it is actually right approach if we want these

11:25.200 --> 11:26.800
produce

11:26.800 --> 11:33.320
Protocol to propagate like there's already people working on that. I have knowledge of that are working on a WebRTC

11:34.480 --> 11:39.920
Proxy that we talks so you can use your browser to communicate with a tax client, which is amazing

11:40.560 --> 11:44.760
WebRTC already works fine. So why does it need to be integrated with talks?

11:44.760 --> 11:47.520
So you don't have to use two apps. So

11:48.240 --> 11:53.000
Your browser and people can use their own desktop application or phone application, which works

11:53.880 --> 11:58.280
we've also I featured a couple of QT based talks cool clients, but

11:58.880 --> 12:04.040
There seem to be the one that actually performs best under most circumstances and tests. Yeah

12:04.520 --> 12:09.880
In my experience, it's just to me so far away from a hangouts or Skype replacement right? Yeah

12:09.880 --> 12:15.760
It's just it is not production ready and there are people who they're people who start Google Hangouts

12:15.760 --> 12:18.160
And then leave them running all day long at their workplace

12:18.160 --> 12:21.240
It's got a long way to go before it's ever gonna hit that level

12:21.240 --> 12:25.840
But maybe for for enthusiasts enthusiasts that are just kind of messing around with friends and stuff like that

12:25.840 --> 12:28.960
It's probably getting close to that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely and toxic

12:28.960 --> 12:32.600
I do have to say I didn't experiment any kind of crash at all

12:33.160 --> 12:37.560
Maybe because I built all the clients on my distribution set up actually

12:37.560 --> 12:43.360
Mmm, that's good theory. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. Let's do a follow-up from Sven

12:43.360 --> 12:47.640
He wrote in on the Linux action show on Sunday about setting up his home server

12:47.640 --> 12:53.000
And my main concern was he had he was using like three different distros in his house and he was using CentOS

12:53.000 --> 12:56.840
But he was kind of a Linux noob and I was a little worried that he might be spreading himself too thin

12:56.840 --> 13:00.340
So Sven writes in with some follow-up. He says hey guys. Thanks for reading my question

13:00.340 --> 13:06.000
I thought I'd get back to you on the questions you raised so regarding the server OS my reasons for choosing CentOS over core

13:06.000 --> 13:08.980
OS or openSUSE is primarily academic

13:08.980 --> 13:12.200
I researched core OS extensively and would have opted for it

13:12.200 --> 13:19.200
But was what got me using CentOS was that I am from time to time called upon to manage Linux servers or a few at work

13:19.280 --> 13:24.320
Which is really stressful when you suck at it since all of our Linux servers and firewalls run CentOS

13:24.320 --> 13:28.520
I decided it was in my best interest to become more versed in that OS once I'm comfortable with CentOS

13:28.520 --> 13:32.720
I'll probably move to core. Yay, Docker. That's a great reason. Yeah, that is great. It's an excellent reason

13:32.720 --> 13:38.920
Yep, so on the topic of using three different distros at home and my concern there was like well if you're gonna use CentOS

13:38.920 --> 13:41.320
Maybe you should just use CentOS though. You just learn one thing

13:41.960 --> 13:45.600
And so he says you're probably right and I feel the same about keeping things simple

13:45.600 --> 13:49.860
But I think for the time being that my wife will need to acclimate to Linux in general

13:49.860 --> 13:54.440
I need a distro that was both easy to use and visually attractive and elementary OS

13:54.960 --> 13:59.120
Represented the least dissonant experience for her as a first-time Linux user

13:59.120 --> 14:02.960
My long-term goal is to empower her to choose her own distro. Yes

14:02.960 --> 14:06.400
And even command-line if she wants and while it would be nice to see her on openSUSE

14:06.400 --> 14:08.980
I want her to learn a distro that she considers home

14:09.840 --> 14:13.960
And then he says that way I can claim ignorance and won't have to answer questions

14:17.140 --> 14:22.560
Regarding backups. So he says my current backup strategy is rudimentary at best since things are still in development

14:22.560 --> 14:25.880
I'm using a series of Python scripts adapted from my old Windows server

14:25.880 --> 14:29.240
They package things into btsync folders from there

14:29.240 --> 14:32.600
It gets uploaded to spider oak and needs something simple that worked right away

14:32.600 --> 14:37.060
So I haven't really given back as much attention. They deserve it this time any thoughts. That's not bad

14:37.060 --> 14:39.160
What do you do for backup Eric? Oh, well

14:39.160 --> 14:45.200
What I do is I use just Deja-dupe and I back up to a SSH server on my home server

14:45.200 --> 14:46.720
Deja-dupe is a great way to go

14:46.720 --> 14:49.800
Oh, yeah, and in this case you could back up to the folder that spider oak is backing up

14:49.800 --> 14:54.560
I like I really like spider oak as my backup system. Yeah, that's a good one it you know, I

14:54.560 --> 15:00.600
I have very little experience with spider oak to be honest. Yeah. Yeah now what you playing with anything back up wise these days

15:01.080 --> 15:05.040
Well, I used to use spider oak, but it just it's so bloaty. It is slow

15:09.200 --> 15:13.000
Yeah, I mean for me it's like it's really bloody so I've been kind of bouncing back and forth

15:13.000 --> 15:16.040
I'm at one time. I used to use jungle disk one time. I used to use spider oak

15:16.040 --> 15:19.960
I think right now I'm pretty much married to kind of going with a bit torrent sync

15:20.160 --> 15:23.040
To a specific box in the house and spread all over the place

15:23.040 --> 15:25.640
Yeah, yeah until I figure out something a little more permanent

15:26.120 --> 15:30.560
I'm kind of in between right now part of my backup strategy is the fact that I got copies of stuff everywhere

15:30.560 --> 15:35.780
Yeah, that is I mean, it's not a great backup strategy, but it is part of it saved my bacon the other day

15:35.780 --> 15:37.680
I actually accidentally

15:37.680 --> 15:44.620
Deleted my music folder what? Yeah, I actually thank God though. I had a bit torrent sync over to my tablet

15:44.620 --> 15:49.560
So did you catch it before it synced the the delete? I sure did. Oh my gosh

15:49.560 --> 15:51.520
Are you hustling like a fool over here?

15:51.520 --> 15:57.080
Here's the funny part is that bit torrent sync what hadn't been running for some reason?

15:57.400 --> 16:02.860
So I went ahead and just grab the SD card out of my tablet in my computer

16:03.040 --> 16:06.200
Just dropped them all back create this create a new sync

16:06.760 --> 16:13.780
Yeah, she's Louise. I totally looked I like daredevil ins approach recess. I just swap out hard drives. Yeah, that's a way to go

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah, that's another way to go

16:16.000 --> 16:20.500
Oh, yeah, it's simple it works for me. I just have

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
Video another for music and

16:26.160 --> 16:30.580
Yeah, you know, I always want something automatic yeah, I want something automatic so that's why

16:30.880 --> 16:33.360
Bit torrents he keeps my constant scene going on

16:33.360 --> 16:33.720
Yeah

16:33.720 --> 16:38.480
But then deja dupe does my once a week backup because you have the bit torrent sync isn't really a backup because it could have

16:38.480 --> 16:43.440
Synced the delete action. That's right. It could have synced the delay got lucky. I got real lucky. Yeah

16:43.440 --> 16:47.360
I got well, there's two things that bit torrent sync has going for you in your favor one

16:47.640 --> 16:50.280
There's unless you actually manually set it differently

16:50.280 --> 16:52.560
There is a delay a fairly significant one

16:52.560 --> 16:57.400
And the second thing is the fact that unless you decide to turn off it turn this off in your folder preferences

16:57.400 --> 17:03.320
It will actually keep a archive. Yeah, you get the revision. Yeah, that's true. Oh, you get the revision

17:03.320 --> 17:06.400
That's no isn't that what that is? Isn't that what it's like? Oh, it's like a revision copy. You can

17:06.400 --> 17:12.520
Never explored it. I was just like it is in bit torrents. It's gonna just completely it does

17:13.200 --> 17:18.680
Now the where I lucked out and is that it wasn't running on my tablet, right?

17:19.000 --> 17:24.780
So it wasn't running on my tablet. Yeah, right then. Yeah, it was running on my computer, but was not running on my tablet

17:24.780 --> 17:28.480
So I was able to just copy. Yeah, I've always so the here's how I use bit torrent sync

17:29.200 --> 17:33.600
Yeah, is I have obviously I have to have machines that have write access

17:33.600 --> 17:40.080
But the majority of my scenes are using the read-only key. Yeah, so that way I so I've never I never delete on the remote

17:40.080 --> 17:46.080
End really almost ever. Well, I have no reason to either because I mean, it's basically I'm just playing back to me

17:46.080 --> 17:48.040
It's like I'm not. Yeah, exactly for me

17:48.040 --> 17:49.160
It's like clips and stuff

17:49.160 --> 17:49.400
Yeah

17:49.400 --> 17:52.920
And that like I don't ever need to delete and then when I do need to delete them

17:52.920 --> 17:57.760
I'm usually sitting at my desk doing like show prep and where I clean things up anyways, and then I have yeah

17:57.760 --> 18:02.040
Go to that machine. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of just I just do that as a little security thing. Yeah

18:02.040 --> 18:05.080
Um anybody in the mumble room want to chime in on a backup solution?

18:05.080 --> 18:09.620
They're particularly proud of before we move to our next topic. I'm still a big fan of our sink and

18:10.920 --> 18:13.320
I try I try to ob-nam recently

18:13.800 --> 18:19.600
An attic and I found they were slow and pretty inefficient. Although, you know the dedupe

18:20.400 --> 18:26.000
Functionality and ob-nam was pretty good, but it took forever. It was really slow. Mm-hmm. Gooky sprite

18:26.000 --> 18:30.680
That's exactly what I'm doing as well. Yeah. Yeah, and you know our sake actually saved my bacon

18:30.680 --> 18:34.120
Oh our things amazing tool and there's a lot of pre-made scripts

18:34.120 --> 18:38.400
You can kind of take and then adjust to work the way you need if you don't want to write it from scratch

18:41.920 --> 18:44.960
And just cron tab and then you never have to worry about it

18:44.960 --> 18:49.760
Yeah, and the other thing is and the thing that's important to me is I understand every single thing that's happening

18:49.760 --> 18:54.880
Was that with BT sink? I'm just I install the software and I just kind of have to hope that it's working magic

18:54.880 --> 18:56.880
We can see that. Yeah. Yeah

18:56.880 --> 19:01.720
The thing I like about our sink too is you can do the dry run so you can kind of just write get an idea of

19:01.720 --> 19:04.640
What's gonna happen? So is this gonna be a huge massive file transfer?

19:04.640 --> 19:08.280
Is this gonna be a quick thing? And of course it also all my files gonna get deleted. Yeah

19:10.440 --> 19:15.960
And the other thing is you can throw it was sometimes these systems like you'll lose that you'll lose the right date or time or

19:16.040 --> 19:20.960
Last modified and and our sinks really good about this guy an interesting solution. Yeah, go ahead with me

19:21.760 --> 19:24.040
well, like like most of you I'm using our

19:24.040 --> 19:31.320
Bit sync to move my data around the place. So all my various workstations and what have you but for backups

19:31.320 --> 19:36.120
I use our snapshot which gives you a point on time recovery. Yes our snaps

19:37.600 --> 19:40.920
The same it's just got I in my opinion just a little prettier

19:41.040 --> 19:46.440
Yeah, our snap that I think we've mentioned on the show before but I think it's been a long time since we gave it a plug

19:46.440 --> 19:49.720
Yeah, so I use our snapshot on open media fault. Oh

19:49.720 --> 19:55.800
We might get into that in a little bit. Yeah, I'll explain how I do that a bit later if you like

19:55.800 --> 20:01.200
Yeah, that's a good tease. I like that. All right, that's an our sink front end. I believe right it is. Yes. It's on top of it

20:01.200 --> 20:07.040
Yeah, okay. Got it. Okay, cool. Okay, so we've got we got a follow-up on a couple of other things

20:07.040 --> 20:08.220
We need to get to another email

20:08.220 --> 20:12.100
I want to and a Chrome extension that will actually make YouTube suck less

20:12.220 --> 20:15.260
You're not gonna believe this Chrome extension and what it can do. It's incredible

20:15.260 --> 20:20.180
And so before we get to that I want to stop and I want to thank our next sponsor on the unplugged show and that

20:20.180 --> 20:24.340
Is the awesome folks over at team go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

20:25.060 --> 20:31.740
Linux dot ting.com right now won't you go there because you'll get $25 off your first device if you've already got a ting device

20:31.860 --> 20:36.740
Well, then they'll give you a $25 credit towards your account and ting is super awesome

20:36.740 --> 20:41.560
In fact Kyra is in studio today to tell us about how ting rates work. Ting keeps rates simple

20:41.560 --> 20:46.520
We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

20:46.960 --> 20:51.360
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

20:51.520 --> 20:52.320
That's good

20:52.320 --> 20:56.520
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

20:56.760 --> 21:01.720
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

21:02.440 --> 21:04.680
Simple that's what we mean when we say

21:06.400 --> 21:08.320
Mobile that makes sense

21:08.320 --> 21:12.480
You go to linux.ting.com to get started they got a lot of different devices here and feature phones

21:12.720 --> 21:18.400
Ranging from well under $100 like 60 bucks here all the way up to the latest like the Nexus 5 the

21:18.960 --> 21:24.480
All of the latest galaxy lines the iPhone lines. They got it all over there at linux.ting.com. Yeah, you do

21:24.960 --> 21:28.360
Hey, you know what speaking of which if you want you can play a little bit with my L

21:28.360 --> 21:30.040
You want to play with my L?

21:30.040 --> 21:34.520
Yeah, check out how long it's been running on battery you tell the folks how long to you you go if you can find it

21:34.520 --> 21:37.000
Okay, and see if you can tell the folks when you go over to linux.ting.com

21:37.000 --> 21:42.920
To you'll see their savings calculator you go in there you plug in your current usage of what you pay on your current cell phone

21:42.920 --> 21:48.800
Bill and see how much you'd save with ting since ting's only charging you for what you actually use that gives you a ton of

21:48.920 --> 21:53.520
Flexibility and if you're savvy and you know when to make a Wi-Fi call and things like that you would be

21:54.040 --> 21:57.520
Astounded at the savings. I now have three phones on my ting account

21:57.520 --> 22:03.120
And I'm still paying a hundred dollars less a month than I was for one line on my previous provider

22:03.120 --> 22:08.080
It's kind of amazing and what's cool about ting is they're great with however you want to use them if you want to use them

22:08.080 --> 22:13.800
Extensively as as a phone you can if you want to use it mostly as a wireless ISP you can and they have no whole

22:13.800 --> 22:18.760
Customer service if you ever get stuck you call me one eight five five ting FDW and a real person answers the phone

22:18.960 --> 22:23.240
Linux dot ting.com all right, so what's the battery life on that Android L phone there battery life

22:23.240 --> 22:27.960
You've got four days left at 44% and does it say how long it's been running on battery

22:27.960 --> 22:31.440
I couldn't we go up on the go up on the chart if you're on the chart there

22:31.440 --> 22:33.440
I'll give you the date. I think it's instant

22:33.680 --> 22:38.760
Says the fifth yeah the fifth yeah, so I haven't plugged it in so fair. That's impressive. Yeah

22:39.600 --> 22:42.920
Long yeah, you know what it is. There's two things so it's Android L

22:42.960 --> 22:48.160
That's the first thing second thing is I don't make a lot of calls right so there's three things and the third thing

22:48.600 --> 22:52.280
This is the biggest I believe is that I don't have it signed into my Google account

22:52.280 --> 22:56.280
Oh, so how many days has that been on battery that Nexus 5 well?

22:56.280 --> 23:00.520
Let's see since the fifth and today is the nine eight there you go

23:00.520 --> 23:03.200
And it's got how many days left it's got

23:03.840 --> 23:05.840
Four days now you said yeah

23:05.840 --> 23:09.800
Unbelievable, and I seriously think is because I don't log into my Google account, and it's on Android L

23:10.000 --> 23:13.560
Otherwise it's just a standard Nexus 5 and what's crazy you put sailfish on this and you're or

23:14.000 --> 23:17.400
Ubuntu touch and you blow through it in like two hours. Oh, yeah, yeah

23:17.400 --> 23:22.160
So there's a lot this was so awesome about ting is you're I'm rocking the Nexus 5 I own this outright

23:22.160 --> 23:27.200
I only pay for my usage and I can put my OS on there and it's sailfish Ubuntu touch Firefox

23:27.200 --> 23:31.960
It just jumps on the ting network and work. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's awesome Linux dot ting comm

23:32.000 --> 23:34.520
Go help change up the mobile industry by switching to ting

23:34.800 --> 23:41.440
make the rest of the industry take note of what ting is trying to do by voting with your wallet Linux dot ting comm and

23:42.600 --> 23:48.360
Maybe grab yourself a Nexus 5 and then try out the L beta. I'm kind of impressed. Yeah, I just seeing that

23:48.360 --> 23:52.320
I'm impressed too. Yeah, I mean you got a Nexus 5. How long is your battery last right now? Let's see

23:52.320 --> 23:57.480
I also synced to Google. So yeah. Yeah, that's a huge thing. Ah, just

23:59.040 --> 24:05.920
See, I'm thinking I'm thinking I'll have to sign it up with my Google account then see I'm on KitKat and I have 79%

24:06.280 --> 24:08.280
Remaining I charged it just this morning

24:09.280 --> 24:13.320
I've got four hours 46 minutes and seven seconds on

24:14.280 --> 24:17.560
Well, wow, and he's got four days. Yeah

24:17.560 --> 24:24.640
Yeah, that is huge right it's astonishing that's a huge set enough to drag you back to Android then

24:25.120 --> 24:27.120
Maybe we'll see. Oh, I

24:27.440 --> 24:33.160
Battery life is like the killer feature as far as I'm concerned good news. Good news. Look at this

24:33.160 --> 24:38.400
Oh, look at this our Apple videos or our keynote videos already been pulled off off of YouTube

24:40.760 --> 24:44.680
There we go, that was the that was the moment right there right when they're showing the ladies boobs

24:44.680 --> 24:49.880
Right when they're showing the ladies boobs, they're they're pulled down our tech talk today episode a bunch of jerks

24:51.840 --> 24:56.960
Seriously seriously, this has been a bad week. I have one two three marks just from this week

24:57.880 --> 25:01.840
How do you put up with it? I sometimes I just don't even pay attention. I just

25:03.000 --> 25:06.080
All right, the appeals process is easy, right? I mean no

25:07.160 --> 25:09.160
It's it's fruitless is what it is

25:09.160 --> 25:16.240
And in fact, you can even put your account in jeopardy if you try to dispute something that turns out to be legitimate

25:16.240 --> 25:18.240
Then your account can actually

25:18.880 --> 25:23.920
So Elroy wrote in with our next email to help us all cope with YouTube a little more

25:24.400 --> 25:26.400
and I

25:26.400 --> 25:28.960
Think I think maybe all of you will want to go grab this

25:28.960 --> 25:31.800
So Elroy writes and he says I've just become aware of the most important

25:32.560 --> 25:35.700
Fantabulous extension for Chrome that's ever graced the face of this earth

25:35.700 --> 25:43.000
It's called herp derp for YouTube which significantly improves YouTube comments by replacing them with random herps and derps

25:43.180 --> 25:49.020
I'm certain in some way that Matt must have been involved with this great piece of work. It seems inspired one user

25:49.380 --> 25:55.120
Explains it thusly in the beginning God created the Internet's and the Internet's were without form and filled with chaos

25:55.340 --> 26:00.340
Trolls and idiots spread upon the face of the deep discord with their fire and rage as their fuel

26:00.340 --> 26:07.420
thusly the tanner son of ganner and son of Goden who fought during the legendary battle not known as the flames of boxy and

26:07.420 --> 26:13.700
His bacon of hope shined upon the wretched world and tanner said let there be derp and there was herp derp and

26:13.860 --> 26:16.260
Tanner saw the derp and the derp was good

26:16.460 --> 26:22.140
No comment even remark was no comment even remotely remarkable was ever missed since that fateful day

26:22.180 --> 26:27.560
You can find in the Google Play Store. He included a shortened URL. He says please spread the word of this great extension

26:27.560 --> 26:34.840
So there you go herp derp for YouTube. I love it not exactly Linux related, but I think Linux users can

26:35.520 --> 26:41.120
Can probably all say we've suffered a little bit from YouTube comments, so I've already installed in a micro. Yeah, there you go

26:41.120 --> 26:45.400
See I like the before and then the derped so they have the poor than the dirt

26:45.400 --> 26:56.320
Here's the first review yeah, you sir are a genius second review. Oh, thank God third review. This is fabulous

27:02.440 --> 27:04.920
Couple of youtubers would love this actually

27:04.920 --> 27:14.920
That's great. Matt are sorry Martin writes. Oh my god. How did I live without this extension honor rights? Goodbye to dumb bitches on YouTube?

27:14.920 --> 27:16.920
Exactly, that's it right there

27:18.920 --> 27:22.920
Did you already install it? This is awesome. Yeah, this is great

27:22.920 --> 27:24.920
Bubba says herp herp herp derp derp derp derp

27:24.920 --> 27:26.920
And wow that's awesome

27:26.920 --> 27:28.920
So there you go

27:28.920 --> 27:31.920
I said I can actually read this stuff. Yeah, I figured to make it much more palatable

27:31.920 --> 27:35.920
So even though they're pulling down my videos at least I'll have a good time when I go there to read it

27:36.920 --> 27:40.920
So that I thought that if you click and if you click on each comment it becomes English again

27:40.920 --> 27:42.920
So if you want to read it you still can

27:42.920 --> 27:45.920
So that's awesome because now I don't care what anyone says this is great

27:49.920 --> 27:54.920
Rekai points out Rekai points out that you could you could pair this sort of like a good wine and cheese

27:54.920 --> 28:00.920
You could pair this with the well-known cloud to butt extension that turns all references of cloud into the word

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
But have you guys seen this?

28:02.920 --> 28:03.920
Oh that's genius

28:03.920 --> 28:08.920
Because you know actually it bit me the other week because we did my cloud exposed

28:08.920 --> 28:13.920
And then somebody sent in a screenshot with the cloud to butt extension where it said my butt exposed

28:13.920 --> 28:15.920
Tech talk today episode 51

28:16.920 --> 28:20.920
So there's a negative side to it as a content creator

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
It could be a little awkward

28:23.920 --> 28:24.920
That's just brilliant

28:24.920 --> 28:29.920
But you match up the herp derp for YouTube and the my butt extension and your browser is a much better place I think

28:29.920 --> 28:31.920
Who needs net neutrality right?

28:34.920 --> 28:35.920
Yeah, yeah

28:35.920 --> 28:39.920
Okay, we got our last email that came in from a EB

28:39.920 --> 28:44.920
He says proud Papa my 10 and 13 year old boys took to a Chromebook guy gave them

28:44.920 --> 28:51.920
I hit up Google and put the thing in a developer mode installed crouton and got Ubuntu installed and they did it all by themselves

28:51.920 --> 28:54.920
As a parent I feel like my work on this world is now done EB

28:54.920 --> 28:55.920
Good dad

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
Right

28:56.920 --> 28:57.920
Good game

28:57.920 --> 28:59.920
Yeah, that was good

28:59.920 --> 29:02.920
I have the C720 sitting right there

29:02.920 --> 29:05.920
I'm gonna that's gonna becomes Dylan's school computer same thing

29:05.920 --> 29:07.920
I'm not even I don't even think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna leave

29:07.920 --> 29:10.920
My thought is I'll leave the Chrome OS installed for dad

29:10.920 --> 29:13.920
So like if I just need to grab his machine and look something up I'll have Chrome OS

29:13.920 --> 29:16.920
And then when he needs to use it I'll have it in elementary OS

29:16.920 --> 29:17.920
Yep

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
I don't know about elementary OS though

29:19.920 --> 29:20.920
Oh yeah

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
Am I making a mistake?

29:23.920 --> 29:25.920
Ubuntu, sugar on a stick

29:25.920 --> 29:26.920
Arch?

29:26.920 --> 29:27.920
I love both

29:27.920 --> 29:29.920
He's looking at what it does not what it runs

29:29.920 --> 29:30.920
So I think

29:30.920 --> 29:31.920
Yeah, I know he is

29:31.920 --> 29:35.920
But I'm thinking I'm thinking but I would rather have my son run Arch

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
Yeah, well

29:37.920 --> 29:38.920
Nice

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
Yeah, that's all

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
That's the dream you can only hope for

29:41.920 --> 29:44.920
And here come all the Arch fanboys again

29:44.920 --> 29:45.920
Right

29:46.920 --> 29:48.920
So anyways congrats to EB

29:48.920 --> 29:53.920
And you know that was one of the things that we did that we did this episode on Sunday about the Chromebook

29:53.920 --> 29:54.920
It's kind of ridiculous

29:54.920 --> 29:55.920
Yeah

29:55.920 --> 29:56.920
It is a phenomenon

29:56.920 --> 30:00.920
And one of the other common comments we got is yeah Chromebook is great

30:00.920 --> 30:03.920
I can't wait till those $200 Windows laptops come out like we've talked about before too

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
Yeah

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
It's great for Linux

30:06.920 --> 30:09.920
It's funny though because at first it took me a while to sort of recognize it

30:09.920 --> 30:12.920
At first I thought the Chromebook was kind of a threat

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
Yeah

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
And the Chrome boxes

30:14.920 --> 30:18.920
But now that you can replace the freaking BIOS entirely

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
When you pull off that Chrome OS BIOS

30:20.920 --> 30:23.920
And you put on a custom flashed version of

30:23.920 --> 30:24.920
Because it's just an open source

30:24.920 --> 30:25.920
That's right

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
It is a full fledged laptop at that point

30:27.920 --> 30:29.920
And you can always flash the Chrome OS BIOS

30:29.920 --> 30:30.920
Yes, I did actually

30:30.920 --> 30:31.920
Yeah

30:31.920 --> 30:32.920
I did it as a

30:32.920 --> 30:33.920
Go ahead

30:33.920 --> 30:37.920
I've been super happy with my C720 for like I don't know six months running Ubuntu

30:37.920 --> 30:42.920
I keep it as a backup in my backpack next to my Ultra Pro which runs Arch

30:42.920 --> 30:44.920
And then when battery life drains

30:44.920 --> 30:46.920
Because the battery life is insane on the Chromebook

30:46.920 --> 30:47.920
Yeah

30:47.920 --> 30:50.920
Wimpy you were going to make a comment about compatibility

30:50.920 --> 30:54.920
Well yeah the thing is that because the Chromebooks are running Linux

30:54.920 --> 30:57.920
In the main they're extremely Linux compatible

30:57.920 --> 30:58.920
Totally

30:58.920 --> 31:01.920
More so than some of the you know mainstream PCs

31:01.920 --> 31:03.920
That are preloaded with Windows might be

31:03.920 --> 31:04.920
Right, right

31:04.920 --> 31:07.920
Well and plus also because you can put CBIOS on there

31:07.920 --> 31:10.920
And then you can have an open source BIOS

31:10.920 --> 31:11.920
I mean it really is

31:11.920 --> 31:12.920
Yeah

31:12.920 --> 31:13.920
Yeah I wonder if

31:13.920 --> 31:14.920
Yeah I mean Stallman should be happy

31:14.920 --> 31:17.920
Yeah I wonder if these things are getting close to being Stallman approved

31:17.920 --> 31:20.920
I'm sure there must be like stuff for the Wi-Fi or something that's still

31:20.920 --> 31:22.920
Probably negative in the freedom dimension

31:22.920 --> 31:28.920
Yeah in his opinion if anything does allow something that is negative in the freedom dimension

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
It's

31:29.920 --> 31:31.920
And the value of this is negative

31:31.920 --> 31:32.920
Exactly

31:32.920 --> 31:34.920
Yeah that's true, that's true

31:34.920 --> 31:38.920
Alright well let's take a break before we get into our first major topic of the day

31:38.920 --> 31:39.920
I want to talk about Linux Academy

31:39.920 --> 31:41.920
Go to linuxacademy.com

31:41.920 --> 31:43.920
Right now go check them out linuxacademy.com

31:43.920 --> 31:46.920
And if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

31:46.920 --> 31:49.920
You can still take advantage of the Summer of Learning 33% discount

31:49.920 --> 31:51.920
I don't know if you can still technically, is it still in the summer?

31:51.920 --> 31:52.920
Can we still call it that?

31:52.920 --> 31:53.920
I hope so

31:53.920 --> 31:54.920
Yeah it's summer like

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920
Okay alright I wanted to make sure it was still summer like

31:56.920 --> 31:59.920
Because I don't want you guys not to get the Summer of Learning discount

31:59.920 --> 32:01.920
It is too darn important

32:01.920 --> 32:04.920
There are few things in life that are as important as your education

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
As your mind as Ben Folds 5 would tell us

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
Think about your mind

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
Sitting there floating in space

32:09.920 --> 32:11.920
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
They've got step by step video courses

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
Downloadable comprehensive study guides

32:14.920 --> 32:17.920
And you'll love this

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
If you're in somewhere in the course material

32:19.920 --> 32:21.920
You're getting your learning on like a fool

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
You're just sucking it up like a sponge

32:23.920 --> 32:25.920
Getting all kinds of smart over at Linux Academy

32:25.920 --> 32:27.920
And you get to a point and guess what

32:27.920 --> 32:29.920
In the course material you need to build a server

32:29.920 --> 32:31.920
Well this is what really sucks about Linux Academy

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
You've got to stop what you're doing

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
You've got to go build a server

32:34.920 --> 32:35.920
Take a couple of days

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
You've got to get the OS

32:36.920 --> 32:37.920
You've got to order the parts

32:37.920 --> 32:38.920
You've got to get a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse

32:38.920 --> 32:39.920
You've got to install your

32:39.920 --> 32:40.920
Not with them

32:40.920 --> 32:42.920
No oh wait that's right

32:42.920 --> 32:44.920
You don't have to do any of that

32:44.920 --> 32:46.920
Because they spin up a server for you from the fly

32:46.920 --> 32:48.920
Right as you need it boom as the courseware requires

32:48.920 --> 32:50.920
That the server is spun up on the back end

32:50.920 --> 32:51.920
That's part of the server

32:51.920 --> 32:52.920
Doesn't matter if it's AWS

32:52.920 --> 32:53.920
Doesn't matter if it's a Linux box

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
Doesn't matter you guys

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
They have all of it there

32:55.920 --> 32:57.920
Because they are a bunch of Linux experts

32:57.920 --> 32:58.920
And educational enthusiasts

32:58.920 --> 33:00.920
Who've built this system for you

33:00.920 --> 33:01.920
Because it's from the community for the community

33:01.920 --> 33:02.920
They're all about it

33:02.920 --> 33:04.920
They recognize the issues that exist

33:04.920 --> 33:06.920
With all of the educational platforms out there

33:06.920 --> 33:07.920
The shortcomings

33:07.920 --> 33:08.920
The problems that they have

33:08.920 --> 33:10.920
Trying to reach out to Linux enthusiasts

33:10.920 --> 33:11.920
And they've solved a lot of that

33:11.920 --> 33:12.920
Almost all of it

33:12.920 --> 33:14.920
Because the only thing that's remaining is the content

33:14.920 --> 33:17.920
And they are working at an unbelievable pace

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
So many courses are over there right now

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
It could take you years to work through all of it

33:21.920 --> 33:23.920
And they're not done

33:23.920 --> 33:25.920
They're adding more stuff every single week

33:25.920 --> 33:27.920
I just had a little chat with one of the guys

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
That runs Linux Academy

33:29.920 --> 33:31.920
And I got just a hint of what's coming

33:31.920 --> 33:32.920
It's gonna put them

33:32.920 --> 33:34.920
It's gonna set them so far ahead

33:34.920 --> 33:36.920
Of anyone else in the industry

33:36.920 --> 33:37.920
For the next several years

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
I mean it has never been a better time

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
To go over to Linux Academy

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
And just double down on yourself

33:42.920 --> 33:45.920
You can take the step-by-step courseware offline with you too

33:45.920 --> 33:47.920
So that way you can educate yourself when you're in the car

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
If you're in the shower like Scooby Sprite

33:48.920 --> 33:51.920
You can listen in the shower while you listen to Linux Academy

33:51.920 --> 33:52.920
You know these kinds

33:52.920 --> 33:53.920
It's flexible

33:53.920 --> 33:55.920
They also give you the tool set you need

33:55.920 --> 33:57.920
So that way you can attack it in a way that

33:57.920 --> 33:59.920
Is actually manageable

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
That doesn't like induce anxiety

34:00.920 --> 34:01.920
Because for me one of the problems is

34:01.920 --> 34:03.920
I start to get these things that weigh over me

34:03.920 --> 34:06.920
And then it bothers me that I'm not getting it done

34:06.920 --> 34:07.920
I start to feel like I'm

34:07.920 --> 34:10.920
You know not accomplishing everything I want

34:10.920 --> 34:11.920
I start to feel kind of bad about that

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
Linux Academy gives me the tool set

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
Where I can attack things as I have the time

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
Where I can really easily conceptualize

34:17.920 --> 34:18.920
How long something's gonna take

34:18.920 --> 34:20.920
What's gonna be involved in that process

34:20.920 --> 34:22.920
And what it's gonna require for me to commit to do it

34:22.920 --> 34:24.920
And that gives me the opportunity to succeed

34:24.920 --> 34:26.920
Which just keeps me going

34:26.920 --> 34:28.920
It keeps me going back for more and more all the time

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
And if I ever kind of have a lull

34:29.920 --> 34:32.920
They have a really great community support system there that helps me out

34:32.920 --> 34:34.920
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

34:34.920 --> 34:35.920
Go check them out

34:35.920 --> 34:37.920
Get the Summer of Learning discount

34:37.920 --> 34:38.920
And you'll see all the new content they have

34:38.920 --> 34:40.920
I have a list right here I could read off to you

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
It's really amazing

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
And I think you're gonna be impressed

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
And I'll tell you if you go there right now

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
There's so much stuff

34:47.920 --> 34:48.920
There's so much stuff you can start with

34:48.920 --> 34:50.920
It's never been a better time

34:50.920 --> 34:52.920
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

34:52.920 --> 34:55.920
Save 33% and start learning right now

34:55.920 --> 34:58.920
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

34:58.920 --> 35:01.920
And they have a Nagios tutorial now up there

35:01.920 --> 35:02.920
Which is pretty cool

35:02.920 --> 35:04.920
It's like a five part thing

35:04.920 --> 35:06.920
Which was a big deal for me

35:06.920 --> 35:08.920
When I signed up with them forever ago

35:08.920 --> 35:10.920
I was like, give me Nagios, give me Nagios

35:10.920 --> 35:11.920
Because I've never done it

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
I've never set up Nagios

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
And they have the whole thing up there now

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
We were talking about backups

35:16.920 --> 35:18.920
They have a whole thing on backing up with rsync

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
So you can go take that course

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
Oh really?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
Yeah, yeah

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
So that's another good example

35:23.920 --> 35:25.920
Or if you want to set up NFS

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
If you've been wanting to do NFS file sharing

35:27.920 --> 35:28.920
You're ready to get off Samba

35:28.920 --> 35:29.920
Because you're just talking Linux to Linux

35:29.920 --> 35:31.920
And you want to take advantage of the speed of NFS

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
They've got a whole course on NFS

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
And the thing is when you walk away from that course

35:34.920 --> 35:36.920
You will have implemented an NFS server

35:36.920 --> 35:38.920
So it's a one to one translatable skill set

35:38.920 --> 35:41.920
And it's great for stuff that you maybe have done

35:41.920 --> 35:42.920
Once or twice for work

35:42.920 --> 35:44.920
Like four years ago or whatever

35:44.920 --> 35:46.920
And now you need to remember how to do it

35:46.920 --> 35:47.920
For your home or whatever

35:47.920 --> 35:48.920
That's what I use it for

35:48.920 --> 35:49.920
Yep, yep

35:49.920 --> 35:50.920
And let's be honest too

35:50.920 --> 35:51.920
A lot of us are self taught

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
And there's just little areas that I have found

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
That even when I go back and take the most basic stuff

35:55.920 --> 35:56.920
Like I did Linux

35:56.920 --> 35:58.920
I think it's called Linux A Plus

35:58.920 --> 36:00.920
I can't even remember anymore

36:00.920 --> 36:01.920
Is that even a thing, Linux A Plus?

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
It was a really basic rudimentary course

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
I took years ago

36:04.920 --> 36:06.920
I think it was Linux Plus I think

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Oh yeah, Linux Plus

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
Yeah, thank you

36:08.920 --> 36:09.920
Linux Plus, yeah

36:09.920 --> 36:10.920
It's been a while

36:10.920 --> 36:11.920
I actually found it

36:11.920 --> 36:12.920
You know what?

36:12.920 --> 36:13.920
It showed me a couple different ways

36:13.920 --> 36:14.920
I could consider doing things

36:14.920 --> 36:15.920
I actually kind of like

36:15.920 --> 36:16.920
It picked my game up a little bit

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
Even though it was a really intro course

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
This was a long time ago

36:18.920 --> 36:19.920
But I find it to be

36:19.920 --> 36:21.920
And that is true across the whole board too

36:21.920 --> 36:23.920
A Plus is one of those certifications

36:23.920 --> 36:25.920
Where you can use a mouse and keyboard

36:25.920 --> 36:26.920
Uh huh, uh huh

36:26.920 --> 36:27.920
That's very true

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
That is very true

36:29.920 --> 36:33.920
I want to talk a little bit about SystemD

36:33.920 --> 36:36.920
And then we'll do our Open Media Vault review

36:36.920 --> 36:38.920
Okay, so let's do the SystemD thing first

36:38.920 --> 36:40.920
Because I think this might be a little quicker

36:40.920 --> 36:44.920
We've been following SystemD since the beginning

36:44.920 --> 36:46.920
And we now are in a phase

36:46.920 --> 36:48.920
Where a lot of adoption has occurred

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
But there's just an immense amount of pushback

36:50.920 --> 36:53.920
And I've been trying to get a sense of

36:53.920 --> 36:55.920
Where is legitimate complaints?

36:55.920 --> 36:56.920
Where do those follow?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
And then what is just like clicker baiting

36:58.920 --> 37:01.920
To get traffic to drive clicks for your ads?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
So I've been sort of doing some digging

37:03.920 --> 37:07.920
And trying to get my head around all of this

37:07.920 --> 37:09.920
And I don't know if you guys have noticed this

37:09.920 --> 37:11.920
But I certainly have noticed that

37:11.920 --> 37:16.920
The vast majority of anti-SystemD articles

37:16.920 --> 37:18.920
Are coming from two places

37:18.920 --> 37:22.920
And they're coming at an unbelievable fever pitch rate

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
And it makes it seem like

37:23.920 --> 37:25.920
It's just people after people after people

37:25.920 --> 37:26.920
Talking about this

37:26.920 --> 37:30.920
When in reality, I see two people talking about this

37:30.920 --> 37:32.920
And then the rest of the internet shitting their pants

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
Every time they talk about it

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
And then of course it drives traffic

37:35.920 --> 37:37.920
And gets everybody talking about it

37:37.920 --> 37:40.920
Let's start with my favorite, Paul Valencia

37:40.920 --> 37:43.920
Over at InfoWorld.com

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
Paul Valencia recently wrote

37:45.920 --> 37:47.920
You have Windows in my Linux

37:47.920 --> 37:49.920
He says the schism over SystemD

37:49.920 --> 37:54.920
Could lead to a separation of desktop and server distros

37:54.920 --> 37:58.920
Or a mass exodus of Linux server admins

37:58.920 --> 38:00.920
Leaving to FreeBSD

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
Okay, that's just one of his many

38:02.920 --> 38:05.920
And what's great is you can go look at Paul Valencia's post

38:05.920 --> 38:08.920
And you can just read through his anti-SystemD crap

38:08.920 --> 38:11.920
Then another, okay so that's InfoWorld.com

38:11.920 --> 38:13.920
Then number two, number two

38:13.920 --> 38:16.920
IT World, Jim Lynch

38:16.920 --> 38:17.920
Oh yeah

38:17.920 --> 38:18.920
This is the other guy

38:18.920 --> 38:20.920
And in fact, these two guys

38:20.920 --> 38:22.920
Cite each other as examples

38:22.920 --> 38:25.920
To support their arguments

38:25.920 --> 38:28.920
So here was, this one got a ton of traction

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
Over the weekend when I was prepping for last

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
Funny how the story didn't make it into the Linux action show

38:32.920 --> 38:34.920
So here's the headline

38:34.920 --> 38:36.920
SystemD rampages through the Linux community

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
Like Godzilla through Tokyo

38:38.920 --> 38:40.920
Oh my god

38:40.920 --> 38:43.920
And I've got a good little collection

38:43.920 --> 38:45.920
In the show notes of their more recent stuff

38:45.920 --> 38:47.920
And I just went back two weeks

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
I just went back two weeks

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
Here's another headline

38:49.920 --> 38:51.920
It's time to split Linux in two

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
Here's another one

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
These are just the same guys

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
Over and over again

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
Writing these kinds of stuff

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
And here's another story

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
All in their thread

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
All their timeline

38:58.920 --> 39:00.920
Here's another one where he suggested

39:00.920 --> 39:02.920
Here's the other thing I love

39:02.920 --> 39:03.920
This is so great

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
When they also

39:04.920 --> 39:07.920
When Paul self-references his own previous articles

39:07.920 --> 39:09.920
To support his new article

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
I love that one

39:10.920 --> 39:12.920
That's a fallacy right there

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
This thing I wrote a while ago

39:13.920 --> 39:14.920
In this case last week

39:14.920 --> 39:15.920
Still totes legit

39:15.920 --> 39:17.920
So let's just reference that

39:17.920 --> 39:20.920
My insane hyperbolic screed from last week

39:20.920 --> 39:21.920
You know, designed to

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
Oh god

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
Right

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
And so here's a couple of things

39:25.920 --> 39:27.920
That we can probably agree on

39:27.920 --> 39:29.920
The arguments against System D

39:29.920 --> 39:31.920
It violates the Unix philosophy

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
Hear that all the time

39:33.920 --> 39:36.920
It's one big thing doing a lot of things

39:36.920 --> 39:37.920
Which is false

39:37.920 --> 39:40.920
Too much stuff crammed into PID1

39:40.920 --> 39:43.920
What's another common System D

39:43.920 --> 39:45.920
Oh, the logging

39:45.920 --> 39:46.920
The binary log

39:46.920 --> 39:47.920
It's bad for servers

39:47.920 --> 39:48.920
This is the new one

39:48.920 --> 39:49.920
Which is insane

39:49.920 --> 39:50.920
This is the new one

39:50.920 --> 39:52.920
It's bad for servers

39:52.920 --> 39:54.920
How is it bad for servers

39:54.920 --> 39:56.920
It was

39:56.920 --> 39:59.920
The concept came for the requirements

39:59.920 --> 40:00.920
Of modern day servers

40:00.920 --> 40:01.920
That's why

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
Exactly

40:02.920 --> 40:03.920
Yeah

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
It was designed for service

40:05.920 --> 40:08.920
The idea that Paul Valencia argues

40:08.920 --> 40:10.920
That what we need to do

40:10.920 --> 40:12.920
Is we need to split Linux into two

40:12.920 --> 40:14.920
And you have System D for the desktop side

40:14.920 --> 40:16.920
And then the server distros don't use System D

40:16.920 --> 40:17.920
Totally madness

40:17.920 --> 40:18.920
Totally madness

40:18.920 --> 40:20.920
Absolute craziness

40:20.920 --> 40:22.920
It is absolute craziness

40:22.920 --> 40:23.920
And I wonder

40:23.920 --> 40:24.920
At some point

40:24.920 --> 40:26.920
Do we just ignore these people

40:26.920 --> 40:27.920
And move on

40:27.920 --> 40:30.920
And does it actually dilute the

40:30.920 --> 40:31.920
You know what

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
Okay

40:32.920 --> 40:33.920
You guys know who Alex Jones is?

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
Yes

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
Right

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
Everybody's like

40:36.920 --> 40:37.920
Your buddy

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
Yeah

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
Alex

40:39.920 --> 40:40.920
You think I should play the mustache clip?

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
Yeah, I think so

40:41.920 --> 40:42.920
Grrr

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
You won't be able to hear the mustache

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
So you just have to wait a second

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
Oh, no worries

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
Grrr

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
What's driving me crazy

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
Is that photo right there

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
Zoom in on that

40:51.920 --> 40:52.920
It's one of those cops

40:52.920 --> 40:53.920
In a black uniform with a mustache

40:53.920 --> 40:54.920
And you just look like

40:54.920 --> 40:55.920
An absolute clown freak

40:55.920 --> 40:56.920
That works for murdering terrorists

40:56.920 --> 40:57.920
That jack our food and water

40:57.920 --> 40:58.920
I think you're a big joke

40:58.920 --> 40:59.920
Grrr

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
Oh, you got a mustache

41:00.920 --> 41:01.920
I'll just worship you

41:01.920 --> 41:02.920
Oh, you got a mustache

41:02.920 --> 41:03.920
It's okay

41:03.920 --> 41:04.920
Nothing against mustaches

41:04.920 --> 41:05.920
So my point about Alex Jones

41:05.920 --> 41:06.920
Is like

41:06.920 --> 41:07.920
Some people think that Alex Jones

41:07.920 --> 41:08.920
Is such an out-there conspiracy theorist

41:08.920 --> 41:09.920
That he makes all conspiracies

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
About him

41:10.920 --> 41:11.920
But he doesn't

41:11.920 --> 41:12.920
He doesn't

41:12.920 --> 41:13.920
He doesn't

41:13.920 --> 41:14.920
He doesn't

41:14.920 --> 41:15.920
He doesn't

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
He doesn't

41:16.920 --> 41:17.920
He doesn't

41:17.920 --> 41:18.920
How does he even know

41:18.920 --> 41:19.920
That he makes all conspiracy theorists

41:19.920 --> 41:20.920
Look bad

41:20.920 --> 41:21.920
So guys like paul valencia

41:21.920 --> 41:22.920
And Jim lynch

41:22.920 --> 41:23.920
They are just so far out

41:23.920 --> 41:24.920
There with systemd

41:24.920 --> 41:25.920
They make all systemd haters

41:25.920 --> 41:26.920
Look bad

41:26.920 --> 41:27.920
I just want to say

41:27.920 --> 41:28.920
They've been caught

41:28.920 --> 41:29.920
Yeah

41:29.920 --> 41:30.920
They've been caught

41:30.920 --> 41:31.920
Exactly

41:31.920 --> 41:32.920
Hey, that's a good point

41:32.920 --> 41:33.920
Right there

41:33.920 --> 41:34.920
I mean if you look at it

41:34.920 --> 41:35.920
They've figured out

41:35.920 --> 41:36.920
A way to drive traffic to IT world

41:36.920 --> 41:37.920
And info world

41:37.920 --> 41:38.920
And that's just to keep

41:38.920 --> 41:39.920
Writing about systemd

41:39.920 --> 41:40.920
Yep

41:40.920 --> 41:41.920
And then the linux drones

41:41.920 --> 41:42.920
Just keep clicking it

41:42.920 --> 41:43.920
That's right

41:43.920 --> 41:44.920
That's right

41:44.920 --> 41:45.920
And that's because it's controversial

41:45.920 --> 41:50.260
much controversy anymore, not since DBNeo adopted it, I mean where's the controversy

41:50.260 --> 41:51.260
anymore?

41:51.260 --> 41:52.260
They're making it.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.260
Exactly, exactly.

41:53.260 --> 41:57.160
And is this argument that it's not, okay let's just, let's take the it's not very Unix-like

41:57.160 --> 41:59.580
argument.

41:59.580 --> 42:03.500
Is this a valid argument, A. And B, does it matter?

42:03.500 --> 42:10.760
So I think A, I don't think it's a valid argument only in the sense that nothing else implements

42:10.760 --> 42:16.560
some of the things that System D does, and so because there's nothing else, it's somewhat

42:16.560 --> 42:17.560
of a valid argument.

42:17.560 --> 42:22.200
Well, it's the most valid argument only in the sense that like it's the one that comes

42:22.200 --> 42:27.400
closest to being factual, accurate, and sense-making, but it's not that great of an argument in

42:27.400 --> 42:28.400
of itself.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.680
I mean, yeah, sure, you could do, you know, you could control your mouth with, you know,

42:31.680 --> 42:35.160
scripting that you've done, you know, by yourself, but no, System D does it for you.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.160
I don't know.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.160
It makes me angry.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
What do you think, Evans?

42:38.160 --> 42:43.520
Well, it's the agglomeration of tasks that are on System D that were separate to a large

42:43.520 --> 42:44.880
degree.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
That's the argument there.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Yeah.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.920
Now, I know Evans said he has a counter to that argument.

42:48.920 --> 42:55.080
Now, as the importance of the argument, I would say that one of the things we were trying

42:55.080 --> 43:01.840
to achieve is POSIX compliance and this POSIX concept was approached because it will allow

43:01.840 --> 43:06.200
us to have portable applications across operating systems.

43:06.200 --> 43:11.720
That does require that other distros and other operating systems do apply POSIX standards,

43:11.720 --> 43:16.880
which they all have variations, and to a large degree, the applications still don't work,

43:16.880 --> 43:19.440
so the benefits are not there.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
Right.

43:20.440 --> 43:25.040
There's, that would be the, okay, so that's the technical, like Unix compatible definition.

43:25.040 --> 43:30.160
Then you have the philosophical, lots of small tools do one thing really well, working together

43:30.160 --> 43:32.080
in concert to make the overall system.

43:32.080 --> 43:36.320
Well, and the fallacy with that is that System D is a collection of tools, it is not one

43:36.320 --> 43:37.320
single tool.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
Exactly.

43:38.320 --> 43:43.500
Well, but it's repackaging all of those single tools into one tool, which is the philosophical

43:43.500 --> 43:47.640
disagreement in terms of like the Unix side.

43:47.640 --> 43:51.600
System D is a re-implementation of some of those tools that have existed for a while,

43:51.600 --> 43:56.920
and I think what people push as the falsehood, which is that it's all crammed into this one

43:56.920 --> 44:01.960
process called System D that happens to be PID 1 as well, which is crap.

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
It's not all one binary.

44:02.960 --> 44:06.400
I still want to hear what Heaven's Revenge has to say.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.880
Well, I do believe it is very Unix-y.

44:09.880 --> 44:14.700
There is, a lot of people really do still misunderstand what System D is.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.760
It is one thing.

44:16.760 --> 44:23.040
It's an abstract scheduler that the user space uses to schedule things.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.240
That's its purpose.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.080
That's its only job.

44:26.080 --> 44:31.360
Everything else has been built around that, which uses that functionality.

44:31.360 --> 44:37.160
That's why it's so applicable to so many things, and that's why the System D project, the Umbrella

44:37.160 --> 44:43.720
project, has grown to encompass so many different things because it's an abstract scheduler.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.080
So many things just need simple scheduling.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.960
We can't use a CPU scheduler.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.200
We need a user space scheduling system.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.200
That's what it is.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.080
It's just an IPC mechanism for communication and a schedule.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.080
That's it.

44:56.080 --> 44:57.080
It is Unix-y.

44:57.080 --> 44:58.080
It's just one simple thing.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.840
It's just so applicable.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.200
So many things can use it.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
Okay, Wimpy.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.760
Why don't you jump in?

45:04.760 --> 45:05.760
Okay.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.520
Well, I want to be clear.

45:07.520 --> 45:10.840
I'm not a System D hater by any means.

45:10.840 --> 45:15.880
I think it's a great advancement for Linux, but I'm going to be devil's advocate here.

45:15.880 --> 45:23.800
One area where System D is squarely not in the Unix philosophy is that you can't pipe

45:23.800 --> 45:29.160
the utilities together, so that was really the crux of all of the Unix utilities that

45:29.160 --> 45:34.200
everything is text in, text out, and they can be joined together with pipes to make

45:34.200 --> 45:38.240
a new utility by joining them.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
And that simple-

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
I don't care.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.240
Well, there is something to it though.

45:43.240 --> 45:48.400
It gives you the ability to build such an amazingly powerful suite of tools together,

45:48.400 --> 45:53.840
but at the same time, it seems like maybe we've moved from that to a different need

45:53.840 --> 45:54.840
now.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.840
We're modernizing in a sense, and it's not necessarily bad.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.920
It's not necessarily good.

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
I think it's-

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
It's called innovation.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.920
I mean, deal with it.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
Right.

46:03.920 --> 46:08.760
Well, it's called moving the platform forward to the demands of the future and not just

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
to the demands of the past.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.760
Totally.

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
Yeah.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.760
Exactly.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.120
And I think the other thing that I recoil at when I hear people talk about System D

46:16.120 --> 46:22.200
is a lot of times people will say, well, System D creates lock-in, and one common example

46:22.200 --> 46:27.600
they will cite is GNOME now requires Login D. Login D is part of System D.

46:27.600 --> 46:33.920
So, in extents, to get later versions of GNOME, you must have System D because you need Login

46:33.920 --> 46:34.920
D.

46:34.920 --> 46:35.920
Not true.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.520
Well, and I'd say, is that just because of the binary logs?

46:38.520 --> 46:41.960
I mean, how does a system lock in?

46:41.960 --> 46:47.000
It's because Login D implements a set of functionalities that no other project is currently implementing.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Oh, I see.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
But-

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
It's called progress.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.480
Well, the thing is, is at each level there, there is an API available.

46:53.480 --> 46:58.480
Somebody could write a replacement, a Login D, that doesn't require System D. That is

46:58.480 --> 47:00.520
technically possible.

47:00.520 --> 47:05.080
And this week we have seen, and this has actually happened five weeks ago, but this week I saw

47:05.080 --> 47:09.280
the physical 100% truth.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.280
It's in the code.

47:10.280 --> 47:14.120
There is code out there right now called System BSD.

47:14.120 --> 47:20.920
And System BSD is a reimplementation of System D APIs for freaking BSD.

47:20.920 --> 47:27.120
So you can use things like Login D and Time D on BSD that are supposed to be System D

47:27.120 --> 47:28.120
calls.

47:28.120 --> 47:32.440
This is a physical literal demonstration of the portability right here.

47:32.440 --> 47:36.960
They are moving this functionality to a completely different operating system.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.960
That's right.

47:37.960 --> 47:42.240
So the idea that we couldn't reimplement Login D functionality in Gen 2 is bullshit.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
Yeah, exactly.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
We're moving it to BSD now.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
Yeah, exactly.

47:45.240 --> 47:53.200
It's also emblematic of how efficacious the whole System D project has become, like Heavens

47:53.200 --> 47:56.400
and Wimpy were saying.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.880
That's one thing Wimpy wanted to talk about, System D shims, I believe.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.880
Oh, go ahead, Wimpy.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.440
Well, this is what Chris has just touched on.

48:04.440 --> 48:11.440
One of the GSOC students for OpenBSD this year has created those Dbus APIs to replace

48:11.440 --> 48:15.120
some of the System D layers so that things like Nome 3 can run.

48:15.120 --> 48:17.920
But this is what Canonical have been doing for a little while now.

48:17.920 --> 48:26.480
They've got their own System D shim that provides Login D. And that's how you work around that

48:26.480 --> 48:31.280
issue at the moment and why they're able to move their Nome 3 components that they rely

48:31.280 --> 48:32.280
on.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.400
Isn't it, in a sense, almost a good thing because then it just gives us a common thing

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
for us to ride against?

48:36.400 --> 48:37.400
Exactly.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
Of course it's a good thing.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
It gets rid of the fragmentation.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.400
It's just IPC.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.400
Yeah.

48:41.400 --> 48:44.640
I mean, good ideas succeed and bad ideas fail.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.720
That's one of the greatest parts about Linux.

48:46.720 --> 48:50.280
When we talk about it at a factual level like this, it seems clear.

48:50.280 --> 48:53.600
I mean, it seems, yes, there's some disadvantages like we've mentioned, especially when it comes

48:53.600 --> 48:55.320
to binary logs as an old sysadmin.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.480
I'll be honest, that's hard for me.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
That's a fallacy.

48:58.480 --> 48:59.480
We can shoot that one down now.

48:59.480 --> 49:04.320
If you install a syslog daemon on a System D-enabled machine, Journal D will push everything

49:04.320 --> 49:05.320
to syslog.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.320
And that's not the only one.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.320
There's a couple of ways.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.680
There's a couple of ways to pull it off.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
Yeah.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.680
That's not...

49:10.680 --> 49:11.680
Yeah.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.920
There's a couple of different methods to get your old logging system back, more or less

49:14.920 --> 49:17.720
running on top of System D. So, blah.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.720
That's garbage right there.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.720
All right.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.740
I mean, we could keep going on.

49:21.740 --> 49:22.880
We could keep talking about it.

49:22.880 --> 49:27.320
But I just thought with this System BSD shim thing, this was particularly interesting.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.320
Oh, yeah.

49:28.320 --> 49:31.080
Narrowing it down to info world and IT world and seeing how they're playing off each other

49:31.080 --> 49:34.560
to generate a lot of controversy, which it's interesting the way it works, too, is because

49:34.560 --> 49:38.960
the things they talk about there then sort of leak their way into the communications

49:38.960 --> 49:42.720
of the regular community, and all of a sudden people take it as their own opinions and their

49:42.720 --> 49:46.920
own stances and start arguing these points that are being sort of just ginned up for

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
traffic.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
Yeah.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.420
Which is what's scary about it, because these guys are considered to be thought leaders

49:51.420 --> 49:56.400
or whatever in terms of IT or whatever pseudo-IT information you want to, you know, blah.

49:56.400 --> 50:01.360
And so this just creates just endless controversy that's actually damaging to forward progress.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.960
I think it's damaging.

50:02.960 --> 50:08.480
You know, also, I just got to say to both Jim and Paul, if they happen to listen to

50:08.480 --> 50:10.480
this show, you guys have been caught.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.480
You're done.

50:11.480 --> 50:12.480
Busted.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.480
Busted.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.480
Busted.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.480
I almost, you know, like, I don't know.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.200
I almost wonder, do they do it intentionally?

50:18.200 --> 50:19.200
Who knows?

50:19.200 --> 50:20.200
We can't prescribe their motivations.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.200
Well, no.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.200
We can't prescribe their motivations.

50:22.200 --> 50:27.080
We can't prescribe their motivations, but at the same time, we can look at it and say,

50:27.080 --> 50:28.360
these are clickbaity articles.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.360
They are that.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.360
Yeah.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.440
So, yeah, especially with the headlines.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.480
That's the only explanation I can think of.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.640
And also, just to them, we have an open mumble room.

50:37.640 --> 50:39.920
So if either one of those gentlemen would like to join us and talk about it.

50:39.920 --> 50:40.920
That's right.

50:40.920 --> 50:41.920
They're absolutely welcome.

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
We would love that.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.360
If they want to call us out on our calling them out, absolutely.

50:45.360 --> 50:49.280
Well, I can speak intelligently on just a piece of it really quickly in that if you've

50:49.280 --> 50:52.400
ever seen the South Park episode where they explain how Family Guy comes up with their

50:52.400 --> 50:56.840
show titles, writing in tech is a lot like that.

50:56.840 --> 51:02.160
Our editors give us a big tank full of stuff, and then we pick words and make sentences

51:02.160 --> 51:04.060
out of them, and then we pick an article topic.

51:04.060 --> 51:06.240
That's essentially how it works.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.800
These guys know this is absolutely linkbait.

51:08.800 --> 51:09.800
There's no debating this.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.000
I would encourage them to come on here and tell another guy that writes for a living

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
that this isn't linkbait.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
That's right.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
That's right.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
It is.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
I'm sorry.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.560
Sometimes I'm paid to do it too, but I try and come up with a little more positive stuff.

51:20.560 --> 51:21.560
I don't know.

51:21.560 --> 51:22.560
Yeah.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.560
Yeah, I think you do a good job of that.

51:23.560 --> 51:24.560
Well, and that's why I think it's so damaging.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.640
I mean, I'm speaking from five years of working as a print journalist.

51:28.640 --> 51:35.560
You know, I mean, this is your only two arguments for self-defense for this are either I am

51:35.560 --> 51:40.280
technically illiterate or I am being, or I am a tool.

51:40.280 --> 51:44.520
Well, it seems like peeing in your own pool too, like you're eventually poisoning the

51:44.520 --> 51:46.480
well that you draw your content from.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.480
That's right.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.480
Exactly.

51:48.480 --> 51:49.480
Generally speaking, yeah.

51:49.480 --> 51:51.960
A lot of times you've got editors that are like, especially if you've got like someone

51:51.960 --> 51:56.640
above you that's like saying, you know, if you don't hit this target, guess what?

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
You're collecting unemployment tax.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.640
Yeah.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
Yeah.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.640
And that's the problem.

52:00.640 --> 52:01.640
And it's a short term thing, you know, to them.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.000
It's like, I got to make money for this month.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.720
Let's pour the turpentine into the aquifer, see what happens.

52:05.720 --> 52:06.720
Exactly.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.560
If I just have a few drinks, take a few pills, I can get through this article.

52:09.560 --> 52:10.560
I'll be all right.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.560
I can swallow it.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
I can swallow it.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.560
I can make it through.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
But that doesn't excuse it.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.560
It just creates a causality.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.560
This is why this is happening.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.560
Yeah.

52:17.560 --> 52:18.560
You know what?

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
We'd all be a lot better if they just go write about the iWatch.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.560
There we go.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.560
I totally agree.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.560
That's a good point.

52:23.560 --> 52:27.560
They should go be information reporters for terrorists, you know?

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
Yeah.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
That's right.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.560
That's right.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.560
Okay.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.560
All right.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.560
All right.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.560
This is getting bad.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.560
You could tell it's been a long broadcast day.

52:35.560 --> 52:36.560
Yeah.

52:36.560 --> 52:37.560
It's been a long day.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
Yes.

52:38.560 --> 52:39.560
We're getting punchy.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
Yeah.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.560
So why don't we talk, let's talk about DNF here in a second.

52:43.560 --> 52:49.360
Fedora 21 coming down the pipe, we just last week talked about restructuring from the ground

52:49.360 --> 52:52.280
up how you deploy software on Linux using butter FS sub volumes.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.320
I mean, this is not that.

52:54.320 --> 52:58.640
The DNF is not that, but it is still a new tool that's coming to manage software and

52:58.640 --> 53:01.280
producer Eric has had a little hands on time with it, so we're going to talk about that

53:01.280 --> 53:02.280
in a second.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.280
All right.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.280
I'll thank DigitalOcean.

53:04.280 --> 53:08.800
Head over to digitalocean.com right now and go get yourself your own server backed by

53:08.800 --> 53:10.480
SSDs connected to tier one bandwidth.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.000
Oh, you don't know what DigitalOcean is?

53:12.000 --> 53:13.720
My friend, let me tell you.

53:13.720 --> 53:16.720
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

53:16.720 --> 53:18.620
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

53:18.620 --> 53:21.080
Users can create a cloud server in less than 55 seconds.

53:21.080 --> 53:25.800
And pricing plans start only $5 a month, which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

53:25.800 --> 53:30.000
SSD, and this is the best part, one terabyte of transfer just right there.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.120
And so, you've got a CPU that backs it, you've got 20 gigabytes of SSD for incredible IO

53:34.120 --> 53:38.240
density, and you've got it connected to tier one bandwidth with a terabyte of transfer.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.800
And DigitalOcean has data center locations all over the place.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.280
They've got them in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, brand new one in London,

53:44.280 --> 53:45.520
which is great.

53:45.520 --> 53:50.480
And on top of all of that, they manage it all with their incredible intuitive control

53:50.480 --> 53:54.580
panel, which power users can replicate on a larger scale with DigitalOcean's awesome

53:54.580 --> 53:57.080
straightforward API.

53:57.080 --> 54:02.360
And they just got a little more awesome with the introduction of CoreOS.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.760
This is an amazing opportunity for you to go over there and try it out.

54:05.760 --> 54:10.120
And if you use our promo code, because we've got a promo code for you, unplug September,

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
$10 credit.

54:11.120 --> 54:17.040
Like, in the past, when a server grade operating system like this came out that was truly something

54:17.040 --> 54:22.080
new, that you can tell by the industry response is already a success, it's already on the

54:22.080 --> 54:27.760
path to success, think about how awesome it is that if you go over to DigitalOcean.com,

54:27.760 --> 54:32.720
if you use the promo code, unplug September, you could create a CoreOS cluster and play

54:32.720 --> 54:36.520
with one of the most advanced server operating systems on the planet connected to tier one

54:36.520 --> 54:42.760
bandwidth on top of SSD drives using their super fast control panel for free, for two

54:42.760 --> 54:45.360
months, using the promo code, unplug September.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.360
It's huge.

54:46.360 --> 54:52.320
I mean, when have we ever been in this position for technology at this scale that has been

54:52.320 --> 54:54.920
this democratized that we have this level of access to?

54:54.920 --> 54:59.780
It is amazing to see this happen, and it's all backed by Linux on top of KVM.

54:59.780 --> 55:01.480
This is something that we saw at OSCON.

55:01.480 --> 55:05.400
People were getting fired up about CoreOS, and now it's available to everyone.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.400
Yeah.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.720
Yeah, and I thought about playing with CoreOS, and it's not the kind of thing you're going

55:09.720 --> 55:11.160
to throw in VirtualBox.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.640
That's not the right place for that.

55:12.640 --> 55:13.640
And this is such an opportunity.

55:13.640 --> 55:16.520
I mean, of course, they've got all kinds of great distros you can choose from.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.800
CoreOS has just been added.

55:17.800 --> 55:18.800
It's new.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.320
They're going to be working with CoreOS, and it's going to be...

55:21.320 --> 55:22.320
It's a game changer.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.320
It is totally a game changer.

55:23.320 --> 55:27.640
DigitalOcean itself is a game changer, matched with a bunch of game changing technology powered

55:27.640 --> 55:31.320
by the open source technology stack that they ride all that on top of.

55:31.320 --> 55:35.340
Now matching that up, and they didn't just go get a CoreOS image.

55:35.340 --> 55:39.420
They worked with the CoreOS project to make this happen because there's some management

55:39.420 --> 55:40.420
stuff they needed in there.

55:40.420 --> 55:43.580
There's some changes they needed to make, and they want to work directly with CoreOS

55:43.580 --> 55:47.040
to make sure that your images are backed by the CoreOS development team.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.040
It's awesome.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.480
And that's the beauty about doing that is that they can create their own custom image

55:50.480 --> 55:53.760
for what they need to give you guys a custom image.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.020
And then you manage the droplets with their great interface.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.020
That's right.

55:57.020 --> 56:00.720
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGGEDSEPTEMBER when you check out.

56:00.720 --> 56:04.600
You'll get that $10 credit, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux

56:04.600 --> 56:05.600
Unplugged.

56:05.600 --> 56:10.760
Okay, Eric, so let's talk about a package manager, DNF, which literally stands for nothing,

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
right?

56:11.760 --> 56:14.360
DNF has no acronym properties.

56:14.360 --> 56:18.880
So YUM was what, yellow update, was it manager or...

56:18.880 --> 56:19.880
Yellow dog...

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Updates.

56:20.880 --> 56:21.880
I can't remember now.

56:21.880 --> 56:22.880
Something manager, but yeah.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.960
Yellow update, yellow dog update manager, modified.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.760
Yellow dog update or modified is what YUM stood for.

56:28.760 --> 56:29.760
That's right.

56:29.760 --> 56:37.920
And DNF was created by the Fordora Project and also Red Hat Sponsoring to take what is

56:37.920 --> 56:39.560
YUM and make it better.

56:39.560 --> 56:40.560
I know.

56:40.560 --> 56:48.040
But at first I didn't quite understand because I didn't really see a big benefit to DNF.

56:48.040 --> 56:53.920
So for example, I would be using DNF to update my packages, to install a new version of something

56:53.920 --> 56:56.840
or to install Chromium or something like that, right?

56:56.840 --> 56:59.400
I would now call on the DNF command instead of YUM command.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.400
Correct.

57:00.400 --> 57:01.400
Now here's what it is.

57:01.400 --> 57:06.440
It's a drop-in replacement for YUM that is going to actually take on the name of YUM

57:06.440 --> 57:07.720
come Fedora 22.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.400
And you actually literally mean drop-in, like you were playing with symlinks and stuff,

57:11.400 --> 57:12.400
right?

57:12.400 --> 57:13.400
Yeah, exactly.

57:13.400 --> 57:20.960
I took and I renamed my YUM binary to YUM-Legacy and then I made a symlink for DNF to YUM.

57:20.960 --> 57:25.160
And now anytime anything in my system calls on the YUM command, it's actually calling

57:25.160 --> 57:26.160
on DNF.

57:26.160 --> 57:27.160
Now why did you do that?

57:27.160 --> 57:30.240
I did that just to experiment to see if it would work and it does.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.240
It's flawless.

57:31.240 --> 57:32.720
In fact, it runs faster than YUM.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.600
DNF is still using RPM packages on the backend.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.520
It's managing dependency resolution just like YUM does.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.320
It's using repo files like YUM does.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.880
It's using the exact same file structure that YUM has.

57:42.880 --> 57:47.960
The difference is that where YUM pulls down each package individually, when one package

57:47.960 --> 57:53.400
gets done, it will actually pull down several packages simultaneously, therefore using your

57:53.400 --> 57:58.840
bandwidth to the best of its ability and also using your system processes to the best of

57:58.840 --> 57:59.840
their ability.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.880
And they've recently introduced Delta RPM support.

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
Correct.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.800
They introduced Delta RPM support by default before that they had it just as an experimental

58:06.800 --> 58:08.380
setting it could make.

58:08.380 --> 58:09.960
Now it's in there by default.

58:09.960 --> 58:12.560
And I guess it looks like they have a DNF package history.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.920
Maybe you could do some rollback stuff.

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
I don't know if that's in there yet.

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
That's right.

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
Is that in there?

58:16.920 --> 58:20.800
It's in there, but that's one of those things that still has to be enabled by config file.

58:20.800 --> 58:25.660
So it doesn't sound like it's a huge change, but it kind of sounds like it's a direction

58:25.660 --> 58:29.000
to just, it's like we're starting here and we're going to move this forward a little

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
bit.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Right.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
It's actually a rewrite.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.840
I'm not asking if it's completely new or if it's modified.

58:33.840 --> 58:36.340
It's actually a complete rewrite from the ground up.

58:36.340 --> 58:41.320
And I think this is going to be across Red Hat Enterprise, Fedora, and CentOS will all

58:41.320 --> 58:42.320
be using DNF.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.320
Correct.

58:43.320 --> 58:46.240
By the time those versions release in the future, I mean we're talking, the first one's

58:46.240 --> 58:51.320
going to be Fedora 22 and then the next one is going to be, well you're going to see CentOS

58:51.320 --> 58:58.440
and Red Hat in whatever version they decide to release that in probably like a 7.2, 7.3.

58:58.440 --> 59:03.040
I was always kind of surprised that we didn't see any other RPM distros adopt YUM.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.920
I wonder if we'll see DNF adopted by that.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
Yeah.

59:05.920 --> 59:19.040
I see other RPM distros like, Sousa's got Zipper, and Mandrake has RPMI or Mandriva.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.280
They have their own thing.

59:20.280 --> 59:23.760
I have yet to experiment with that because I haven't, I don't know, it just seems like

59:23.760 --> 59:24.760
an irrelevant.

59:24.760 --> 59:28.480
RPMI was, I don't know if that's what they still use, but back in the day when I was

59:28.480 --> 59:31.360
a Mandrake user, that was almost RPM good enough for me.

59:31.360 --> 59:35.400
I could almost, Matt, did you ever play with Mandrake's URPMI, I think was what it was

59:35.400 --> 59:36.400
called?

59:36.400 --> 59:37.400
No, I didn't.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.880
I never spent as much time with Mandrake as I should have.

59:38.880 --> 59:43.240
I kind of toyed around with it a little bit, and then of course the RPM stigma hit me initially

59:43.240 --> 59:44.240
and I just ran away almost immediately.

59:44.240 --> 59:45.240
I seem to remember like-

59:45.240 --> 59:46.240
I remember that.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.240
I don't remember it.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.880
I seem to remember URPMI made it easy to add repos.

59:49.880 --> 59:51.240
It had like a lot of app-like features.

59:51.240 --> 59:52.240
Oh yeah?

59:52.240 --> 59:53.240
I always pronounce it your erp me.

59:53.240 --> 59:54.240
I think they still use it.

59:54.240 --> 59:55.240
Okay.

59:55.240 --> 59:56.240
Okay.

59:56.240 --> 59:57.240
Interesting.

59:57.240 --> 59:59.240
Anybody in the mumble room had a chance to play with the DNF or the new Fedora release

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.240
with any thoughts?

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.480
I'm looking at you, Colonel Linux, and I'm thinking, you're a CentOS guy.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480
I am a CentOS guy, unfortunately.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.440
I've been out of town for the last week.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.960
When these kind of things, though, come down the pipe, do you load up Fedora and think

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.680
to yourself, okay, I'm going to learn how this is going to be for my servers in the

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680
future?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.320
Or is that like a thing that you Red Hat guys do, or how does that work?

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.600
That used to be exactly what I did.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.520
In fact, it's so much to the point that I would teach myself new features of Red Hat

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.520
on Fedora.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.760
Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that anymore.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.920
The projects have split so decidedly in two different ways.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.120
There's almost no similarity between the two.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.480
That's interesting.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:48.240
So I look at... In fact, when I was at LinuxCon, I actually learned that I should stop looking

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:56.920
at CentOS to see what Red Hat's like, because apparently those two are going to become very

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.640
different.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640
That's a little confusing.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640
That is very confusing.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640
Yeah, for real.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.640
Yeah, but so apparently even now, and I haven't had a chance to confirm this, but apparently

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.320
even with 7, there are differences between Red Hat Enterprise and CentOS.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.080
They're no longer just recompiled binaries.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.080
That makes me unhappy.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080
That's not good, because-

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.560
I'm holding out judgment until I find out exactly what the long-term plan... Because

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.160
let's say they take CentOS and make it into an enterprise desktop operating system.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.320
I'm okay with that, as long as projects like... What's another one?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320
Scientific Linux still exist.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.600
As long as it's something I can go to where I can build binaries on some sort of a cost-free

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.320
platform that has access to repos.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.200
As long as I can do that, I think-

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.080
I think that's going to be Fedora.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:49.200
I think Fedora.cloud and Fedora.server are going to... Yeah, Fedora.cloud, Fedora.server.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.960
Whatever they name it is fine with me, as long as I have something.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.360
And that's one thing that's coming out, is that the next... Fedora 21 is going to be

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.800
the first one that goes by that Fedora Next moniker.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800
Yeah.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.280
Boy, that's going to be a transition that is going to take a while to play out, and

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.440
meanwhile Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be standing still.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.240
At some point, Red Hat Enterprise Linux will have to catch up to all this Fedora Next stuff.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.020
How do they make that transition?

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.840
Because Fedora Next is a totally different beast.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.120
You can have a real minimal Fedora Next, and they're even talking about a Fedora Next version

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.000
that's essentially rolling in a way.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.640
Well, especially... Well, yeah, they have Rawhide, but if you look at it, they're going

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.520
to have to deal with the server, the workstation, cloud, and whatever that fourth one is.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.520
I'm not talking about Rawhide.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520
Yeah, I'm talking about RAIL.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.620
No, I'm saying in Red... I'm saying one of the things they're talking about in Red Hat

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.440
is making it so that way... I don't think they're going to be there yet, but I think

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.800
they are designing it with the intention of sort of like Core OS, where you isolate out

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.480
the server applications and the base OS is rolling.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.320
Yeah, and Fedora's already doing that.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.760
RAIL's probably just going to take on what they're doing and have a workstation.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.880
That's one thing RAIL does not have, is they don't have a workstation.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.200
Fedora could have redhatenterprise.workstation.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.760
That's right, Red Hat Enterprise Workstation.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.760
It's going to be CentOS.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.200
Well, I mean, if you look at the way SUSE does it, they have workstation and server,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.760
so why doesn't Red Hat have something like that?

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.560
I wouldn't say because SUSE does something, Red Hat should do it.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.160
Yeah, I'm not saying that.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.080
I'm saying... I just think it's surprising that they don't have something like that already.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.280
Well, like Noah mentioned when he was down at LinuxCon, it's like, come on, give me a

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.200
distro that I can put on the desktops that matches the servers.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.200
We'll see what they do.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.200
Yeah.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.400
Well, I'm looking for... Yeah, there's some Fedora haters in the chat room, but I actually

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.760
think Fedora's starting to become a really interesting project again.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.760
Yeah, well, honestly-

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760
I agree.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:42.640
Honestly, beginning of July, I could have been included with one of those Fedora haters.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.240
I decided to go ahead and try it.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
You've been running the 21 beta?

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240
No, I've been trying 20.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240
Oh, 20.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240
I've just been running the solid 20.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240
What are you, a masochist?

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240
Yeah.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240
What's the matter?

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240
No.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240
Come on, man.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.840
No, I did it because I wanted to get familiar with the system, and I wanted to learn how

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.480
they do it, and what they do-

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.520
Well, you see cool stuff coming out of the project.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520
Exactly.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520
Yeah.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.400
You know, I've been saying this for a little while now.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.040
We're seeing... Most of the innovation is coming from the Fedora project.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040
Like ALIGX?

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040
Yep.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.040
Wait, what?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.040
What?

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.040
No.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040
Random assortment of letters.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:20.200
Don't you guys remember ALIGLX versus XGL, and those were the two back-end compositors,

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.400
and then you read Compass Fusion on top of that?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400
Come on.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400
It's not that old of a reference.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Jeez.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Thankfully, perfect.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.360
What I'm saying is that Red Hat and through Fedora is pushing most of the innovation in

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.880
Linux that I'm seeing, other than Canonical with their thing.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880
Yeah.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880
What?

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880
Yeah, I know, right?

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880
Oh.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.440
No, unless Popey's here, we pretend like Canonical doesn't do anything.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.440
Oh, okay.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.760
So, anyways, some British company, I don't know.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760
I kid.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.760
Wow.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760
Yeah.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760
No, I see where you-

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760
Yeah.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760
They're pushing the innovation.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760
They're pushing things forward, and you wanted to be there.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760
You wanted to see it.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760
Yeah.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.360
I wanted to see what it was like, and sadly, I think that as far as they push it, it doesn't

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.160
run as well on my hardware for some reason.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.640
I've got a little bit more experimentation to do, but-

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.600
So maybe back to a different distro for you?

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600
Perhaps Arch or Ubuntu.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
I don't know.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.160
Have you considered trying 21, just to see if it runs better?

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.160
I might.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.320
Yeah, you've got this weird UI leg thing that happens from time to time.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.320
Yeah.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.320
That is really strange.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320
That would drive me crazy.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320
Yeah.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.920
It's like, and I can watch it in like Ahtop or something, or even Top, and it's like,

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.920
I get this random spike from Gnome Shell, the Gnome Shell process, and it shoots up

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.440
to like 13% and back down, and then 13% back down.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440
And that's Gnome 3.12, right?

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.440
That's Gnome 3.12.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
Stable?

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440
Stable.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440
Yeah.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440
I don't know why it's doing that.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440
It just is.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440
Have you played it all with Korora?

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440
I have.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440
Which is a sort of a re-spin of Fedora with some-

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.840
I have not.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.240
All it really does is include RPM Fusion and a few other things.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.800
RPM Fusion and like Codex and like Flash.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800
Yeah.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
All of which come from RPM Fusion.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
Binary drivers.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
Yeah.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800
Yeah.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
So-

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800
Yeah.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
It just makes it a little bit easier to get going.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Yeah.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.800
It does.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.800
It definitely is a time saver.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800
I have yet to actually try it, but it's not a bad idea.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Just try it around.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800
Yeah.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.680
We'll have a review of Fedora 21 whenever they eventually ship it.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.680
They've just delayed it again.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680
Yeah.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
So-

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680
Yeah.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.680
It's been two weeks delayed so far, and we'll see what happens.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680
Yeah.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680
We'll see what happens.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680
I don't know.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680
All right, Matt.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680
Well, I think that was everything we were going to cover in today's episode.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.880
We'll have episode 330 of the Linux Action Show on Sunday.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.880
Wow.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.880
So that'll be a big show.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880
Yeah.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880
Huge.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880
That's a lot of shows.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880
Wow.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880
That's show after show after show.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880
So if you'd like to get a hold of us, we'd love to get your feedback.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.000
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link, and choose Linux Unplugged

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.520
from the dropdown, or maybe even better, be part of the in-crowd, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.480
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place for comments, feedback, what were you saying?

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480
Open media vault.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480
Oh, God.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480
Yeah.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480
We're going to do an open media vault review.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480
Yeah.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480
All right.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480
Geez.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480
We better do that before we go.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480
I can't-

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480
These shows have been going long, these shows.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480
Oh, it felt like a marathon today.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
It has been a marathon.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480
We can do it next week.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.480
No, no, no.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.040
No, we said we'd do it.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.040
We can do it, right?

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.040
I mean, we should do it.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
Yeah.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.000
We should probably get it done today.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.040
So let's start with open media vault.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.720
Now, the open media vault is something that we've had many requests to review on the show,

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.680
and it's something I haven't gotten around to, because I'll be honest, I'm pretty happy

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.280
with my FreeNAS setup.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.440
Pretty happy with my FreeNAS setup.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.800
But I'd like to hear, well, maybe you guys can convert me away.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.240
So Wimpy, do you want to start on the... Because I know you gave it a kick the tires.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.120
I'm not sure who else in the mumble room today got a shot, but Wimpy, I'd love to hear what

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.600
your thoughts were with it, and maybe what your use case was.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600
Right.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.080
Well, I run open media vault at home.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.440
I've got two open media vault servers.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:45.240
I've got one which is the current stable version, which is 0.5, and I've got what will be the

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.360
1.0 release, which is coming up soon, running on the other box.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:58.360
And primarily I'm using that for NFS and Samba sharing, and Plex media serving, and torrenting

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:04.360
ISO images, and just about everything you can imagine.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.800
There's a plug-in for everything.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800
Nice.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:14.680
So the 0.5 version sits on top of a Debian squeeze base OS, and what will be the 1.0

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.480
release sits on a Debian Weezy base.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.200
So you can install from an ISO image.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.240
It's super simple, it's preceded, so you have the ISO in, it tells you it's going to trash

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.680
all your disks, which it does, and then you end up with an install, and you can boot into

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:36.600
the web UI, you manage everything from the web UI, and it does, if you've ever used any

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.600
of the...

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600
It's very FreeNAS-looking.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
Yeah.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:46.120
Well, the guy that started Open Media Vault actually departed from the FreeNAS project.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.640
So he was one of the original FreeNAS developers, and they had some sort of disagreement.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.360
I'm not quite sure what the details were, but the guy that's doing this is a refugee

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360
from FreeNAS.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360
A refugee.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.360
A refugee from FreeNAS.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
Wow.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.360
What was the file system?

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.160
Well, you've got a choice.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.600
So when you actually create your disks, it's got Linux software RAID on there.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.600
I'm talking about the stable version at the moment.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.360
There's a plug-in for LVM, and then you can choose any of the file systems with the exception

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.960
of ButterFS, which is not available in the stable version, because in Squeeze, that's

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.680
really, really experimental.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:31.280
I hear talk, I don't know how far along it is, that they're working on a plug-in for

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:39.020
the 1.0 release to natively support ButterFS without the use of LVM and software RAID,

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:43.200
so that you could go completely to ButterFS, but I don't know if that's definitely happening

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.600
or how far along it is, but I've seen several references to it.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.120
There has been some talk about ZFS as well, but I can't quite tell whether they're serious

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.480
about that or not.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.600
So disk management, adding additional storage, sort of like if you wanted to go drubble on

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.960
this thing and just sort of add disks over time, sounds like I'm kind of falling back

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.800
on traditional disk management utilities in Linux to add capacity and grow volumes and

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800
things like that?

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.480
Only if you want to.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:18.520
So for example, I think you've talked about SnapRaid in one of the shows somewhere ago,

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:25.240
and also GreyHole, so you can also use SnapRaid and GreyHole if you want to instead of traditional

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240
RAID solutions.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240
Okay.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
That's not bad.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240
I like that.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.520
I mean, like I said, there's plug-ins for everything.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.480
There's some boring stuff.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.920
And the plug-ins would be things like, I would assume things like Plex backup, stuff like

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920
that?

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.240
Well, let's look what I've got at the moment.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.320
So at the moment I've got, hang on a sec, let's bring it all up.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.880
And I'm sure Sync Tools too, right?

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
I'm sure that's another...

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Yeah.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.340
So I've got BitSync installed on there.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.760
So when you install the plug-in, it installs BitSync as a service, as a daemon, and then

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:04.640
has a UI that then integrates into the web UI of the OpenMediaVault thing, and you can

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.800
put your shared secrets in there and all that kind of stuff.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.320
Actually I would say the UI looks a little nicer than FreeNAS.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.000
It definitely looks cleaner.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.860
I've got a plug-in for Calibre, I've got one for Potato, another one for Cups, another

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.660
one which is just a generic downloader which I use for grabbing torrents and web links

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:29.200
and stuff like that and YouTube videos.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.060
It's got a web front-end for navigating your file system.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.080
Like I said, if you want it, it's got Grey Hole which is an alternative storage pool,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:46.440
file system manager, headphones, mini-DLNA I use for streaming to amps and stuff that

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.080
only speak DLNA.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.440
And then there's a MySQL plug-in, an NGINX plug-in, oh you'll like this one, there's

01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:10.640
a ToneCloud plug-in, OpenVPN, Roundcube mail server, and then RSnapshot which I touched

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.040
on earlier, and then SabNZB and SickBeard.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.620
And all of these plug-ins, they don't just install a bit of software, but they actually

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.920
have a front-end GUI that integrates into the OpenMediaVault web UI.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.920
This would sound a killer.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920
To take a box and dedicate it to this.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.920
Yeah.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.920
So it all runs through the browser?

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920
Oh, this sounds awesome.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:38.040
And then it looks like the browser management software also will go out and update the plug-ins

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040
too.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
It does, yeah.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040
It has an update manager.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.520
It's like a front-end to app to basically, so there's an update manager.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.800
I mean there's another plug-in here, I've used it a bit, there's one for VirtualBox

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:58.880
so you can create virtual machines on there, transmission plug-ins, VDR for DVB and DVB-S

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880
and DVB-T.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.120
What's it using for a base?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120
It's all Debian.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120
Wow.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.720
So this is one of the reasons I like it, because although I've got the CUPS plug-in installed,

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.000
I've got, I think Google called them a classic printer, which basically means not a cloud

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.080
print enabled printer, but because it's all just Debian underneath, I've been able to,

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.520
someone's written a native Linux implementation of the cloud print API, which sits on top

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.800
of CUPS.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:36.120
So I've been able to install that on my OpenMedia Vault box to turn my classic printer into

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:40.200
a cloud print printer, so now we can print from our Android phones and tablets.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.200
Oh, that's cool.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.760
So because it's straight up Debian, I can do everything on the box that I would want

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
to do.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760
I was just looking for a solution for that.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.200
Yeah, I was thinking about the same thing.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.720
So is that also how you got Plex running on it?

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.200
Plex is just a plug-in for OpenMedia Vault.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200
Oh, this is so cool.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200
Yeah.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.200
Wow.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:05.400
So the standard plug-ins, there's maybe about a dozen, there's then a website, it's omv-extras.org

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:10.760
and this is where the community publish their plug-ins and this is where you get all the

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.760
good stuff from.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.760
omv-extras.org.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760
Oh yeah.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.760
Oh yeah.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.960
I'm looking at this.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960
This is great.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.160
And you can see they've got stable testing and unstable repositories.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160
WordPress.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
Uh-huh.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.960
Oh, this is pretty awesome, actually.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.960
It's brilliant.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:26.960
There's couch potato.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:27.960
That's where they're right there.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.560
See, can you see why I keep banging on about it?

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560
Yeah, I do.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
Yeah.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
Wow.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
Don't stop either.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
Yeah.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
Rochure, WordPress.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560
Mumble server if you want it.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
I love it.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
A mumble server.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560
Wow.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560
Mini DLNA.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.560
I can't believe it's Roundcube.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.560
I mean, Roundcube.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.560
Wow.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560
You run your mails around.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560
Me likey.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560
Yeah.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560
That is really cool.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.560
This is amazing.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.560
Makes me want to put on a droplet too for some of the mail features.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.560
I know, right?

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.560
That'll just open up another droplet right now.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560
It's going to happen.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:15:00.800
So if you want to put it on a droplet, I've got some instructions here about how to install

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:08.160
a Debian system and then overlay and I'll paste it in the IRC now.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.160
Cool.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160
I'll grab that.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.360
You can convert an existing Debian install.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.240
You can convert a base Debian Weezy into an Open Media Vault install.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240
Wow.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.240
Score.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240
And they also have ISO images, I imagine.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.240
Yeah, they do.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.240
They have ISO images for 0.5.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.240
Log it into the demo right now.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.240
Yeah.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:35.080
What I suggest is create a virtual box machine with one disk that you allocate for the OS

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.760
and then add like five virtual disks for your RAID.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.720
And when you install it, install it onto the OS disk and then you can actually go in and

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.040
use all of the disk management tools and actually experiment with LVMs and RAID or SNAP RAID

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040
or whatever.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.200
And once you've figured out how to do it in a VM, then you can go and reproduce it on

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.200
real hardware.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.200
Yeah.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200
Boy.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.200
Wow.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.400
See, I was kind of expecting Open Media Vault to be a bit of a stinker because I was like,

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.680
how are you going to compete with FreeNAS?

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.760
But it sounds like it's a pretty big contender.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.760
Big time.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.720
The only difference for me with FreeNAS would be, of course, ZFS support, but...

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.160
I wonder if you could just install that.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160
I don't know.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.920
I know that in the forum, some people have been talking about it.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.320
So I can't quite tell whether the lead developer is anti-ZFS because of his falling out.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.360
Oh, that's a good one.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.360
Right.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.360
He got burned.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.600
Whether he just doesn't want to take on supporting it under Linux.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.400
But I think at the moment, very much it's sort of the traditional tools and then the

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.960
plugins for SnapRaid and GreyHole, which give you those, you know, disks at random.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
Yeah.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.960
I think that would do it.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960
Yeah.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.960
GreyHole and SnapRaid are pretty good.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.960
Could be a FreeNAS killer.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.960
This looks deadly.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:56.520
JBLive3 in the chat room says that he installed Open Media Vault on a Debian install with

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520
LXDE.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.080
And then he used that to migrate from Windows Home Server when Microsoft pulled the plug

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.480
on that.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.920
Someone saying that there is a ZFS plugin for Open Media Vault 1.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.440
I can't see that on my system, but apparently it's there.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440
Okay.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.440
Cool.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.760
Rikai has a link in the chat room right now.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.760
I will grab that too.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.800
So I will put links to converting a Debian install to Open Media Vault.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.840
I'll put a link to ZFS on Open Media Vault.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.840
So we'll have all of that.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.160
Is there anything else we should talk about on Open Media Vault before we run?

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.160
Performance is stellar.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.680
So I've got really, really humble hardware and I'm using it as a Plex server and it does

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.800
real-time HD transcoding.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.840
Wonder how it would run on my Netbook server thingy.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.640
What sort of processor have you got in it?

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.640
It's an Atom N270.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.880
Okay.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880
That's probably better than...

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880
Hang on.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880
Let me just find out.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.880
I've got something terrible.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:50.880
Are you serious?

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.880
Wow.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880
What have you got?

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880
A couple gigs of RAM on it?

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880
You're probably right.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
I've got AMD Turion 2 Neo.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880
So...

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880
Yeah.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880
Yeah.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880
So mine is more powerful.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.880
So...

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.880
This is all cringing.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.640
Well, the other thing I was going to...

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.880
What about...

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880
It's good and bad.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.360
On FreeNAS, when you install a plug-in, they're sandboxed.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.040
They're isolated in a sense.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.000
But on Open Media Vault, when you install Plex, is it able to see all of your file shares?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.840
Because to me, one of the disadvantages of the way FreeNAS does it is then I have to

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.920
do this funky way to mount my data into that plug-in or into that jail.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.920
Exactly.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.920
Yeah.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920
Totally.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920
Right.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920
But if Open Media Vault could just see the file system, that would actually be better

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920
than Torrent Sync.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.920
Exactly.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920
Yeah.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920
So that's how it works.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:41.040
So in the UI, you have a section for physical disks, which is just all your drives.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.600
From there, depending on how you want to set it up, you use either LVM or RAID or SNAP

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.980
RAID or whatever.

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:49.280
And then you end up with some file systems.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.000
And those are the things that you actually format with your file system of choice.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.640
And from there, using the UI, when you're in Plex, and it embeds the Plex UI in the

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.320
tool, you can point at anything that the OS can see.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.920
But by default, it wants to use one of the media shares, as they're so called.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920
Okay.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.920
Yeah.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.500
So I create a file system.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:16.360
On there, I create a shared folder called Music.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.360
And when I go to Plex, I say add the media music.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360
And off it goes.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
Easy.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.880
But you can point it at anything in the system if you wanted to.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Okay.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880
Interesting.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.880
That's cool.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.600
That would be a tool that I would want that is not in the plugins page that you referenced.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.600
The OMV extras.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.800
I mean, it's pretty awesome.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.800
Yeah.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.960
And someone's just posted in the chat room, and I found it.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:46.880
In the 1.0 version that I'm running, you have to enable the ZFS repository, and now the

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880
plugin shows up.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880
Okay.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
Yeah.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.640
Rick, I just posted more up-to-date instructions as well.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.640
That's awesome.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.040
Putting links to all this stuff in the show notes for folks that are listening on the

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040
downloads.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040
You guys can grab that.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040
Wimpy, thanks for the review.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.640
Anybody else in the Mumber Room have any Open Media Vault experience to chime in with before

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.640
we run?

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640
Is that?

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.640
That's a good cover.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.640
We got great coverage from Wimpy.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640
So, yeah.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.800
I'm going to be checking it out, so thank you very much for filling us in on that.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.880
And keep us posted as you discover new things or try new things with it.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.320
Let us know how it goes.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.360
You mind being our Open Media Vault correspondent?

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.920
That's absolutely fine.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.920
Okay.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.920
Good.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920
Along with Ubuntu Mate.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920
Mate.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920
Yeah.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.440
You know, just add it to the list, Wimpy.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.440
It's good.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.440
Yeah.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.440
Just a few.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440
Yeah.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.440
All right.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440
Well, thank you very much.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.440
Okay.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.440
So, that will bring us to the end of today's episode.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.440
Don't forget we do Linux Unplugged live, like today.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440
Boy, was today live.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.440
Wow.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.440
Go over to jblive.tv.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.280
We usually start at 2 p.m. Pacific, but jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar has that in your local time.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.320
And if you don't join us for next Tuesday, at least show up on Sunday for the big show.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.520
Linux action show Sunday, 10 a.m. Pacific, jblive.tv.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.920
Matt, that's going to wrap us up.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920
Have a great week.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920
All right.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920
Yeah, you too.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.960
I'll see you on Sunday for episode 330.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.440
That's crazy.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.360
Eric, thank you for joining us in the studio.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
It was great.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
Any time.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.680
And thanks for joining me earlier today.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.600
If you guys want to watch our coverage of the iThink event, it'll be posted on Jupyter

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.600
Broadcasting.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.720
It might not be on YouTube because they're pulling our crap down like crazy, but you

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.840
can hear Eric's commentary and insights as well as mine in the mumble room from today's

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.840
event.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.320
You can watch that in Tech Talk today, episode 55.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.320
All right, everyone.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.600
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:54.520
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:25.800
I'm so glad I learned about Open Media Vault.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.800
Yeah.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800
That was crazy cool.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800
That was way cooler than I was expecting.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800
I mean, you have to-

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.480
I've only covered like half the plugins as well.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:38.000
I mean, there's just so much to it and there's a bunch built into the stock system.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.560
I mean, just reading that page is absolutely nuts.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.320
There's nothing I could think of that I would want from network attack storage.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.360
And they're the community-contributed ones.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:52.120
There's a whole heap of useful stuff built in, so I've got the UPS monitoring online

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120
as well.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.120
Yeah, I saw that too.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120
That's cool.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120
Hey, Wimpy, I forgot to ask this.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.320
Is there a way that I could stick it to a virtual machine and just play with for a while

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.720
before I actually install it on real man?

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720
Yeah.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.720
Toad, yeah.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.520
When I first got started with it, I did it all on VirtualBox.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:10.320
I created five drives, one for the OS, four for pretend disks, and I raided them and stuff

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.320
in Open Media Vault.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:31.340
We have...
