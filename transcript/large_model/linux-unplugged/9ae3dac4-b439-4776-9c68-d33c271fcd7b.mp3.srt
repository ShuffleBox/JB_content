1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
A happy Easter, gentlemen.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,160
Did you get yourselves anything for Easter?

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,280
Yeah, I found a few eggs just outside the studio door.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,560
I assume you put those there for me, right?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,200
Well, they were for raccoons,

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,300
but I'm just hoping that Alex set out

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,080
a little treasure hunt for Brent.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,680
How often is Brent down in the States for Easter?

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,160
I hope like maybe an egg hunt happened.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,980
What happened this morning?

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,440
Tell us, guys, how'd you celebrate?

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,620
Missed opportunity.

13
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,360
Yeah, we didn't do anything.

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,560
We didn't even think about it.

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,480
But what did happen two days ago

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,240
was a massive, I mean, massive box of chocolates

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,440
showed up at Alex's place here,

18
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,120
and he's been trying not to get into it ever since.

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh, man.

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah, care package from England, proper chocolate.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,240
Did anybody warn them that you just spent a week

22
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,640
eating the croissants from the meetup?

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
Like, this is not what you need right now.

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,880
I literally did, yeah.

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,560
Yeah, I bet Brent's been cooking good, though,

26
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,200
so you're probably making it up on the other end

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,080
because he's a pretty lean cook in terms of caloric intake.

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah, I lost 20 pounds in the month before the meetup,

29
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,520
and I've gained about half of that back since the meetup.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,160
That's how you know it's a good meetup.

31
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,640
show.

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,360
My name is Chris.

34
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,320
My name is Wes.

35
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,240
My name is Brent.

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
And my name is Alex.

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,480
Hello, gentlemen.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Glad to have you all here today because it is indeed a big show.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,760
Ubuntu 2204 LTS and Fedora 36 are both landing soon,

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,400
perhaps the day you're listening to this or near.

41
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,440
They both feature GNOME 42 and lots of great new ideas

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,520
baked in, so we're going to take a look at both of them

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
and share our thoughts, and then we're

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
going to round out the show with some great boosts, our picks,

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
and all the stuff that we love to do.

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,640
But before we go any further, let's check the board.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's bring in the Mumble Room.

48
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,480
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,960
Good evening.

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,560
Hey, Brent, hey, Wes, hey, Chris.

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Nice to have you.

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
Hello, hello.

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Hello, guys.

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,200
Hello, hello.

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
You know, I want to say right here towards the top of the show

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
that you are always welcome to join our Mumble Room,

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,680
even if you don't want to participate necessarily.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,880
I know that sounds weird, but I mention it

59
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
because Mumble's free software, so it has

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
kind of a nice advantage there.

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
And I want to encourage that adoption

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,920
because I think it's nice to have decentralized free software

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,440
voice communication tools.

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,920
It uses high quality Opus audio.

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
Also free software.

66
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,080
And you're getting a mix directly from our mixer

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,680
here in the studio, and Mumble has super low latency.

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,040
So it's just a great way to get a high quality audio feed

69
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,360
using free software, and you can load it on your phone.

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
We usually get the stream started

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,960
around noon Pacific time, which is, what,

72
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,600
3 PM on the New York side?

73
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,160
Indeed.

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
And around the world, you can do the math there,

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
but we'd love to have you join us live over at jblive.tv

76
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
if you want to watch it.

77
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
Or you can use Mumble.

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,120
Like, we've got a handful of folks in the quiet listening

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
right now just getting the lowest latency audio stream.

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,520
In fact, it is possible they are getting the lower latency

81
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,520
audio feed of my voice right now than Alex and Brent are.

82
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,440
I mean, Mumble's really impressive,

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,160
and it's great because we can just run it

84
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,560
on our own infrastructure.

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
Or Noah's.

86
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,680
It actually might be on Noah's server still.

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Either way, we'd love to have you there or join us live

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,720
on a Sunday.

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,440
So let's get into the show.

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,960
Let's talk about Fedora 36 first,

91
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,400
because I think a lot of what we're going to touch on

92
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,240
is probably in its more upstream form in Fedora.

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,740
So I think it kind of makes sense

94
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,600
from a conversational standpoint.

95
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,680
We've all kind of been taking a look at it for a little while.

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,120
So there's a lot to unpack in both of these releases.

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,660
So we're going to try to break it up

98
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,360
to what's relevant to each one.

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
And Fedora 36, while outwardly I'd

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,120
say the headline feature for desktop users is GNOME 42,

101
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,540
it seems like when you look at some of the other things,

102
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,160
like Wayland support with NVIDIA.

103
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
About time.

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,440
Podman 4.0 under the hood, it kind of

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,880
feels like 36 is going to have some really kind of changes

106
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,740
that will improve the Fedora workstation and server

107
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,440
experience for a long time.

108
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
Fedora is making a shift here with Podman

109
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,600
and with NVIDIA and Wayland support.

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,360
I think this is laying the groundwork for something,

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,480
but we'll get into that in a little bit.

112
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,460
Because I'm curious, Wes, I asked you not to tell me.

113
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,440
You've been running them both, Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 36.

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,640
And I'm curious which one you've chosen

115
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
to run here on the show today.

116
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,880
I know I said pick the one you like the most

117
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,000
and wait till the show starts.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,360
So which one did you choose?

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Well, let's just say that SE Linux would like you to know

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
that GNOME Shell is trying to access its icon cache.

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I am taking that to mean Fedora 36.

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
Yes, that's right.

123
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,640
So you like the 36 desktop?

124
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
I do.

125
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,920
It's very snappy.

126
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
And especially, I've been mostly using it here

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
on this ThinkPad.

128
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,780
So for the laptop use case, I like the stock GNOME

129
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,360
experience, especially with that new dark mode support.

130
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,080
It doesn't take much to get this into a state

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,720
that I'm happy with using it.

132
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
It all works.

133
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,040
And then I've been really impressed with just

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,640
with how good the pipeline setup on Fedora is getting.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,280
Ubuntu has made some advances there, too,

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
which is also good to see.

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
I was able to download Reaper, start it up.

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,480
It figured out that it could talk Jack back to pipeline

139
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,880
without me having to do anything.

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,840
And then the whole system worked great with the new headphones

141
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,200
I bought without having to futz with it as well.

142
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,880
So it's kind of I'm living the pro audio when I want it,

143
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,800
and it just works on the other hand,

144
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
which that's hard to turn down.

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Wow, yeah, you're getting both.

146
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,600
And have you done like audio playback with the headphones

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
and they've stayed connected when you stop the music

148
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,320
and then restart the music and stuff like that?

149
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
No problem there.

150
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
It's nice to see it getting to that point.

151
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,800
That is nice.

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,920
It's nice to know you can go out and get yourself

153
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
a pair of modern Bluetooth headphones

154
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,400
and you got a good shot of them working with your Linux desktop.

155
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,680
I'll save my thoughts, but I'm curious if Alex or Brent,

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,040
if either of you got any much time with the desktop side

157
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
of Fedora 36?

158
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Well, we actually decided to kind of do it jointly

159
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,600
because as it turns out, Alex had a laptop here buried

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
in his little closet over there.

161
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,440
That's fairly modern, a T480, I think it was, Alex.

162
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,920
Yeah, Red Hat provided me a ThinkPad for work.

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,400
And I've been running Fedora 30, I think 3 was the first one

164
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,040
I put on there.

165
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,880
I've upgraded it now from 33 to 34.

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,600
It was on 35 when we started last night.

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
So we thought we'd upgrade to some beta software

168
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,920
and what's the worst that could happen?

169
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,400
And actually, the upgrade to 36 was completely uneventful.

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,000
I think boring in this case is probably a good thing.

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,580
What was interesting was we were actually

172
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,500
connected to my Thunderbolt dock as we did it,

173
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,240
which was a CalDigit one, which is typically

174
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,200
only a Mac compatible dock.

175
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,640
But my Thunderbolt monitor was picked up straight away,

176
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
no problems whatsoever.

177
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
Ethernet just worked.

178
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,600
All the USB devices worked perfectly.

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,240
And throughout the entire upgrade,

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,080
both displays, and I'm talking about the internal laptop

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
display and the Thunderbolt display,

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
were completely flicker free.

183
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Remember that being added a while ago?

184
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
All the way through the upgrade process,

185
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,880
everything was just completely smooth

186
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,920
as far as the visual aspect was concerned.

187
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
There was a nice progress bar.

188
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,640
And I've got nothing really bad to say about the process.

189
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,000
It just worked.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, it upgraded what, 1,700 packages or so?

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,240
1,756, I think, if I remember.

192
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah, a couple of gigs worth of updates.

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,480
And yeah, just worked.

194
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,620
You know, you did, Alex, mention the monitors.

195
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,020
We ran into a strange situation.

196
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm not sure if it's the monitor itself

197
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,420
or if it's this hub you're using.

198
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,760
But one of your monitors, which I'm

199
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,280
sure you'll fill in the details, ended up with a refresh rate

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
that was really odd.

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, yeah.

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,960
Yeah, so I've got a 4K USB-C monitor,

203
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,920
which I directly connected to the ThinkPad

204
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,160
using the single USB-C cable provided

205
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,840
with the monitor, which is a Dell 2723QE, I think.

206
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,680
And for some reason, when we had 100% scaling turned on,

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
we got 60 hertz, no problem.

208
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,600
If we went to 200% scaling, which

209
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,520
is about where I like my 4K monitor,

210
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
it dropped to only 30 hertz.

211
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,280
And that's painful.

212
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,160
Actually, 29.98, I believe it was.

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,760
Yeah, I've seen that.

214
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,240
It's nice that it can do it.

215
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
It is even better now than ever.

216
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,400
And I really feel like there's pretty much zero

217
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,760
Wayland penalty that I've run into so far, especially

218
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,560
with the 36 release.

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,400
And 42 is the best release of GNOME from the project ever,

220
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,120
including even the very later versions of GNOME 2.

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
In my opinion, obviously, this is the most refined,

222
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,080
most expressed version of what the GNOME vision is

223
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
that we have ever seen.

224
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,280
And if you don't like GNOME 42, you're

225
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,760
just never going to like GNOME, which is OK.

226
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,680
And if there's elements of GNOME you've liked in the past

227
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,640
and you haven't checked in in a bit,

228
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
I think it's going to blow your freaking socks off.

229
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,400
They have really nailed the light mode, dark mode stuff.

230
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,760
It is significantly better than just a hacked theme

231
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,360
to do dark mode.

232
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
It really is, yeah.

233
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,720
It feels like you get on some of those other platforms.

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,000
And they've made improvements to the default theme

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
that just look great anyways, that just

236
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,280
make it look like a polished, professional operating system.

237
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,960
And I even like it in the light mode now.

238
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
It's just great.

239
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,280
So this is a strong version of GNOME

240
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,240
that really realizes the whole 4D transition,

241
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,320
because this is where you really see the Libidwaita

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,360
and the GTK4 stuff really land.

243
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
You've got the new GNOME terminal called Console,

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
I think, and the new text editor that's

245
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,760
replacing GEDIT just called Text or Text Editor,

246
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,840
something like that.

247
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,040
But they're both pretty good apps out of the gate.

248
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,320
We used to have this problem on the GNOME side

249
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,360
where they would reboot an app, and you would then

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,920
wait for three releases before it

251
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
had the functionality that the previous application had.

252
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,200
That has not been my experience with the recent reboots

253
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
of these applications.

254
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,420
And they look like really nice modern applications

255
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,320
that are at home on the GNOME desktop.

256
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
The other thing that's really, I think,

257
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,580
palatable for those of us that pay attention to just

258
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,880
the way your screen draws and stuff like that,

259
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,640
with GTK4 in here, with the Vulkan back end for GTK4 stuff,

260
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
with a number of performance-focused tweaks

261
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,960
that they have laid into all of GNOME 42,

262
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,760
some of the improved tooling, some of the leaner-meaner apps

263
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,720
that are in this thing, like the new screenshot app,

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,960
like the new terminal app, like the new text editor app,

265
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,760
like the improvements to files, like the list

266
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,120
goes on and on, you guys.

267
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,200
It really all comes together for the smoothest desktop

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,940
experience on GNOME ever.

269
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,760
And those are even realized on the Raspberry Pi.

270
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,080
I can even tell an improvement on the Raspberry Pi.

271
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, you put this thing on the Pi?

272
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,420
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,840
And it's great.

274
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,320
It's really something special.

275
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,940
And to be fair, Tumbleweed got it first.

276
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,040
I already had Tumbleweed on the Pi, so I was good to go.

277
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
It was great.

278
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,440
We thought Fedora 36 and Ubuntu would get there first,

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
but Tumbleweed did.

280
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
The wizards.

281
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,280
I know.

282
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,680
They're always hacking away at that kind of stuff.

283
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,480
I think this is such a great release of GNOME

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,520
that I think it's going to be really hard for the team

285
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,480
to now kind of eclipse what this all accumulates to.

286
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,240
And one of the things I love about Fedora 36

287
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,760
is you get the real stock upstream experience.

288
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,360
Now, we'll talk about Ubuntu's take on that in a minute,

289
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,520
but that's one of the nice things about Fedora 36

290
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,280
is you get to see sort of the project's vision there.

291
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,320
The new Snapshot app is really nice.

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,200
I like to take little screenshots and send them

293
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,160
to Wes all the time, so it makes that real quick.

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,820
Yeah, it's true.

295
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,600
It feels really just native to the system, you know?

296
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,080
Yeah.

297
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,880
That's nice.

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
The other thing that was different for this release

299
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,160
cycle than like the last two or three Fedora release cycles

300
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,000
was how we should probably clarify too,

301
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,540
it hasn't quite actually been released.

302
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,700
We're getting here a little early because, you know,

303
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,440
schedules.

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,900
That's what we like, because it's

305
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,960
scheduled to land towards the end of April.

306
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,880
As soon as the week this comes out,

307
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,520
maybe as late as the end of April,

308
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,560
2204 is likely going to hit its target, which

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
will be this week.

310
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,980
But this is kind of where I was going.

311
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,640
This beta of Fedora 36 has been the most solid beta experience

312
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
I've ever had in Fedora.

313
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,520
Like, I have just about had every beta experience blow up

314
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
in my face once, which that's the name of the game.

315
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah, it's not a bad thing.

316
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,260
It's just part of the trying this out

317
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,480
while it all gets assembled.

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,480
And I'm just riding that horse, and I don't really

319
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,960
count that against, again, them in the review,

320
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,440
because that's the beta process that's what it's for.

321
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,940
It did not happen in this 36 release cycle.

322
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,680
It did not blow up on me once.

323
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
It just, I did my daily updates.

324
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,280
I like to do it daily.

325
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,200
You know, when I had new stuff, I installed it.

326
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
Every time I rebooted the system or whatever,

327
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
it always came back up.

328
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,520
And I think what's happened here is on Fedora,

329
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,920
especially, I've migrated to installing

330
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,760
most of my user applications via Flathub and Flatpak.

331
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, me too.

332
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
So everything's kind of isolated from the system.

333
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,960
All of my work communication apps, I use,

334
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,380
I think my browsers are installed from the repo.

335
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,480
Of course, I'm using the desktop environment from the repo.

336
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
I mean, some of that stuff, right?

337
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,760
But all my chat apps, all the tools I use for work.

338
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,240
All the weird proprietary stuff.

339
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,520
Yeah, that's all Flatpak now.

340
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,400
And so you take that and you combine it

341
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,800
with just a smooth beta that isn't doing anything

342
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,360
too crazy outside the desktop space.

343
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,320
And it made for a really nice beta experience.

344
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,280
And I really think out of the gate,

345
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,920
it's gonna be a solid release.

346
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,160
I'm just gonna go right to it.

347
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
Like I was thinking with the last release,

348
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,380
it was so rough, I was gonna wait like six months.

349
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,280
But yeah, no, I've been using this as my primary OS

350
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,380
on the ThinkPad since we talked about GNOME 42

351
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,900
a couple episodes ago, and I've had the same experience.

352
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,040
Just rock solid, I think I'll keep using it.

353
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,680
The one thing I might want to adjust

354
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,120
is I'm still not used to these offline updates.

355
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,280
You know, like they can apply it almost Windows style.

356
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,960
Here I was playing with 2204, rebooting a bunch,

357
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,020
accidentally choose Fedora,

358
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,880
and then I'm waiting for updates.

359
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,180
You mentioned how bumpiness is a fairly standard thing

360
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,720
about running beta software.

361
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
My experience has largely echoed yours this time with 36.

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
It's been very smooth sailing.

363
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
No driver issues, no messing about with God,

364
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,360
do you remember Xorg stuff?

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,480
Like I had two external displays just working out the box

366
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
straight away, you know, no real issues.

367
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,960
The one thing I did have was in the mirrors for some reason,

368
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,780
they seem to be a little bit behind.

369
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,960
And my updates with DNF were looking for packages

370
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,280
that didn't exist in quite a lot of the mirrors,

371
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,720
like the 404s that came through, they were quite extensive.

372
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,080
And so that led me to dig into the mirror process

373
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,020
for Fedora a little bit.

374
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,840
And it turns out that you can sync as often

375
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,520
as every 10 minutes if you're a Fedora repo manager,

376
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,080
or, you know, like a mirror.

377
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,720
But there's no, or seemingly anyway,

378
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,680
there's no documented thing that says

379
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,200
you must sync at least once a day or something like that.

380
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
And it's all done through sort of our sync,

381
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,880
which I thought was interesting.

382
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
I suppose not too surprising,

383
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
but I've never really thought about that.

384
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
And of course that's gonna be distro to distro as well.

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
The individual admin who's configuring

386
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
those system detimers perhaps.

387
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah, and with, you know, depending on the mirror you pick,

388
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,760
you just, I guess it's sort of random

389
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,340
what they decided to do.

390
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,980
I think it's worth noting that it looks like 37 plus,

391
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Fedora 37 plus, that's gonna be interesting.

392
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,320
First of all, they're switching to a newer version of RPM

393
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,060
just for better security.

394
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,160
We'll cover this as it comes up.

395
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,000
They're also planning to drop support

396
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,840
for legacy bio systems.

397
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,320
So long.

398
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,360
This is the most probably,

399
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,720
if you could label something controversial about this,

400
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,300
this is probably it.

401
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,840
There's a lot of mixed opinions here

402
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,400
about deprecating old hardware.

403
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,760
And of course there's valid arguments on both sides.

404
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,400
If you're interested, send us a boost

405
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,960
if you want us to cover that and we'll get to it.

406
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,640
And then also speaking of Xorg,

407
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,200
37 is considering the removal of legacy Xorg drivers as well.

408
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,000
So it's a big transition in terms of

409
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
the underlying hardware support

410
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,680
they're essentially gonna, I guess, support.

411
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,400
And it's gonna change.

412
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,960
It's gonna change the nature of the user base for Fedora.

413
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,520
And it's going to mean there's some users

414
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,440
that can no longer move forward.

415
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,520
But it also means that the team will be able

416
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,680
to focus their time, talent, and energy

417
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
on the broader user base, better security practices,

418
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,760
all of the optimizations you get when you reduce complexity.

419
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,280
And it seems like, especially these last couple of releases,

420
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,580
Fedora's really been shining on the leaning edge

421
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,080
kind of idea that they're going for.

422
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,880
And so I think these kind of things are in that spirit

423
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
and I'm all about it.

424
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

425
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,920
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit

426
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
and you go there to support the show.

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,520
Linode's how we host everything.

428
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,220
And Linode could also be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

429
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,940
You know, one of the things that we're really proud of

430
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,380
is that we've used Linode in a way

431
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,360
that feels strategically smart.

432
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,220
We've got a lot of our user-facing stuff,

433
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,040
well, all of our user-facing stuff up in the cloud

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,600
where we can take advantage of Linode's scaling tools,

435
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,240
their incredible customer support,

436
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,400
their 11 data centers around the world,

437
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
their super nice UI with an API

438
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
that makes it easy to integrate with our tools.

439
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,720
Like, it's great for that.

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,740
But we mix it with kind of a multi-cloud strategy

441
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,520
where we have our own little tiny cloud here on the land.

442
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,160
And they work really well together.

443
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
In fact, Gardner estimates that two-thirds

444
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,720
of all cloud industry customers

445
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,820
will adopt a multi-cloud setup

446
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,680
as a means for avoiding vendor lock-in by the end of 2024.

447
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,000
And the reality is the largest hyperscaler cloud vendors

448
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,840
that try to present themselves as a one-stop shop,

449
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,480
inviting you to become wholly dependent on them

450
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,200
and centralize all of your resources.

451
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,920
And they'll offer everything you might ever need.

452
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,160
But you know the problem of relying

453
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,280
on a single cloud provider like that.

454
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,600
It's the same problem as relying

455
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,740
on a single commercial software vendor.

456
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,480
You get deeply entwined.

457
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
You get locked in.

458
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,440
And you get locked in to your infrastructure.

459
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
That can be dangerous.

460
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,800
And so with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper

461
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,480
than other major cloud providers,

462
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,440
Linode is great for the individuals,

463
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,440
but it's also great for businesses looking for a multi-cloud strategy.

464
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,920
Plus, they combine it with great things like object storage,

465
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,080
Kubernetes support, DDoS protection, VLAN,

466
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
a powerful DNS manager,

467
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,520
and, of course, that cloud dashboard

468
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,360
that's easy for beginners, total noobs,

469
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,960
and, of course, industry pros.

470
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,560
So go use our $100 offer to performance test your network,

471
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,120
troubleshoot something, build something, learn something,

472
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,400
maybe create a backup.

473
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,520
There's so many great options,

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,240
and they have tutorials to help you get started

475
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,640
on anything you might need and one-click application deployments.

476
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

477
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,720
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

478
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,520
Well, if Fedora is the leading edge,

479
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,440
I think it's safe to call Ubuntu the mainstream,

480
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,920
and Ubuntu 22.04, which will release later this month.

481
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,080
This is going to be a big release because, you know,

482
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
all your boring friends running the LTS,

483
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,600
they're going to finally upgrade.

484
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,080
This thing's going to be supported till April 2027.

485
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
So whatever we're getting right now,

486
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,720
it's going to be here to stay.

487
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
We are so spoiled with these LTS releases,

488
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,320
and the community just eats these ones up.

489
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
These canonical stresses this all the time.

490
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,120
Anytime we've talked to them,

491
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
the magnitude of difference is substantial.

492
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
And so we thought, let's take a look at this thing

493
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,680
because this is the one people are going to be considering

494
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,240
deploying on their VPSs, on their Raspberry Pis,

495
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,040
on their servers, on their workstations, and it matters.

496
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,160
And we also know that the interim releases

497
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,960
are often just building towards the climax,

498
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
which is the LTS release.

499
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
And so once again, we all kind of took a look at it

500
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,640
around the horn, and I'll start with mine

501
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,760
because mine are pretty straightforward so far.

502
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,800
I started by, you know, it's a funny thing for me.

503
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,920
My LTS systems are no joke, right?

504
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,960
The ones that I'm running Ubuntu LTS on,

505
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
I have something of value on them.

506
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,360
And so it's a serious calculation for me when I'm like,

507
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,680
which one am I going to upgrade

508
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,120
before it's even officially released

509
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,440
to test it for the show?

510
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
But I love you guys, so I did it.

511
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,720
And so I picked one of,

512
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,880
I don't know if I'll acknowledge this before on the show,

513
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,040
but I have what I call support nodes

514
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,000
that are in orbit of LadyJoobs.

515
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,920
And these run on different servers on Linode's cloud,

516
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,240
and they provide support services for LadyJoobs,

517
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,760
like synchronizing data, moving things around for me,

518
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,000
copying certain backups, stuff like that.

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,680
And these both run Ubuntu 20.04, well, they did.

520
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,560
But I decided to give these ones an upgrade

521
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,640
because it would be a major pain in my ass

522
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
if anything happened to them,

523
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,440
but I'm not planning a road trip right now

524
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
or anything like that, so I would have time to recover them.

525
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,680
And I have to say, I think one of the experiences

526
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
that I have over and over again

527
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,920
when I try out an Ubuntu distro

528
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,360
is when you use the server side of Ubuntu,

529
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
when you use that like in a headless environment

530
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,320
where maybe you're SSHing in,

531
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,280
it's elegant in certain ways,

532
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
where they've built tooling

533
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,000
where you can tell the team

534
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,200
really spent time developing something,

535
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,680
and they really built it well,

536
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,120
and they can just kind of iterate on it after that.

537
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,440
And that's how I felt about

538
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,080
their do release upgrade program.

539
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,760
It's a really handy tool that lets you upgrade

540
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
before it releases out,

541
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,240
or it lets you upgrade after it releases out.

542
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,520
And it just does a lot of sanity checking

543
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,880
on your distribution to try to make sure

544
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,240
you get the best outcome possible.

545
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,480
And where the polish is, is you can tell that the team,

546
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,520
they put a lot of effort into collecting

547
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
a bunch of information about your system,

548
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,800
and then relaying it to you

549
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,680
in a very relatable, readable way.

550
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,080
I put a link to an upgrade warning screenshot

551
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,960
that I got in the process of one of these,

552
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,280
and we'll put a link to this in the show notes

553
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
so you guys can check this out.

554
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,360
And it just walks you through here

555
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,560
where it says, you're gonna have to download

556
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,160
a total of 741 megabytes of files.

557
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,120
This download will take about two minutes

558
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,520
with a 40 megabit connection,

559
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,200
so it's benchmarked my connection.

560
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,520
And about 19 minutes with a five megabit connection,

561
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,560
or maybe it's just giving you examples, I guess.

562
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Fetch and installing the upgrade can take several hours.

563
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
It just kind of walks you through everything

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,400
in very plain, understandable language.

565
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
And the other thing it does is it makes sure

566
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,160
you're not gonna shoot yourself in the foot.

567
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,720
Like maybe you're at a disk space

568
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,960
because you didn't realize that your overlay FS2 folder

569
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,840
had grown to 50 gigabytes.

570
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,600
And so your root partition is totally full.

571
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
And it checks that kind of stuff before you upgrade,

572
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,480
or maybe, maybe you were doing this upgrade

573
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,880
even though you know better.

574
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Even though you know better,

575
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,600
you were doing this upgrade over an SSH connection

576
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
that wasn't in any kind of session manager

577
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,280
or using any kind of reliable connection like a MOSH,

578
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,600
but just raw dog SSH.

579
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,440
Maybe you did that even though you know better.

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm not sure you've even ever used Tmux.

581
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,640
It will warn you and say, hey man,

582
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,200
maybe you don't wanna do this in an SSH connection.

583
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,640
And don't ask me how I know, but maybe that's you.

584
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,600
And it just kind of prevents those kinds of mistakes.

585
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
And then it works the system through the upgrade.

586
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,480
It does the reboot.

587
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,040
And the other thing it does that's really clever

588
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,360
is it notices that you are using a third party mirror,

589
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
which Linode does this.

590
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,520
Linode replaces the canonical mirrors

591
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,280
with local Linode caches.

592
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,880
And the package install times are bananas as a result.

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
Like they just stream down faster

594
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,160
than your new app could move,

595
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,800
probably at the maximum speed of apt.

596
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Let's be honest.

597
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,480
Probably.

598
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,520
And so it says, hey, I noticed you're using

599
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,760
a third party sources.list file.

600
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,560
I can't guarantee that they're gonna have the packages.

601
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,160
I can swap the names for you, man,

602
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,720
but I can't guarantee they're gonna have the packages.

603
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
So I said, yeah, go for it.

604
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,920
Let's see if Linode is pre-caching the release.

605
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,520
Let's find out.

606
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,760
So I said, yes, it modifies my sources.list from Linode

607
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,240
to keep the Linode mirrors,

608
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,840
but puts the jammy name in there

609
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,280
instead of the focal fossil

610
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,120
or whatever the old release was, I can't remember.

611
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
And sure enough, Linode had the packages already mirrored.

612
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,080
And so my upgrade on both of these nodes

613
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
was bananas fast,

614
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,920
just because I was using the local mirrors to upgrade.

615
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,000
And Linode had what you needed.

616
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,640
And I only had to solve the storage issue on one box.

617
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,360
I mean, somebody did, not me, but maybe somebody.

618
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,200
And it went great.

619
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,560
And both systems came right back up.

620
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,280
They're running just fine.

621
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
And I really have no complaints.

622
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,560
I think it's gonna, you know, I didn't need to,

623
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,040
but I think it's gonna just be great.

624
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,760
I'll run these for a little bit.

625
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,280
And then my thought is,

626
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,800
when the actual shipping version is out,

627
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,360
I'll probably start upgrading my pies in LadyJuice.

628
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,520
And then I'll report back on the self-hosted podcast

629
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
on how that goes.

630
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, nice.

631
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,760
What about you, Brent?

632
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
Did you get a chance to kick the tires?

633
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,480
I did, and I was extra interested

634
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,080
because I actually got the chance maybe,

635
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,520
I don't know, three weeks ago.

636
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,160
They were doing the alpha testing week,

637
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,120
and I got my hands dirty in there and found a bunch of bugs.

638
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,320
And it was neat to see the progression.

639
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,080
Most of those, the ones that I filed,

640
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,800
which was about eight of them,

641
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,960
all had lots of action and got kind of all fixed.

642
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,000
And I was interested in seeing that.

643
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,560
So I would say from that perspective,

644
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
it actually went great.

645
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Upon installing, I really was curious

646
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,120
about the new Flutter installer.

647
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,240
And I ran into a few probably edge case bugs

648
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,760
as I seem to have a knack for finding.

649
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
But overall, it worked quite well.

650
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,440
And I loved the look of Ubuntu as well,

651
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,880
the desktop edition, and no complaints really.

652
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,000
I thought as an LTS, it seemed stable to me

653
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,960
and really quite nice to look at.

654
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,360
I'm not a GNOME expert, I would say,

655
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,720
but it feels like, Chris,

656
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,600
that I'm getting in just at the right time

657
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
because everybody seems to have a really nice take on it.

658
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,240
I think 42 is a great release

659
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
if you haven't checked it out for a while.

660
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,320
That's my main takeaway from the show.

661
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,200
So if you haven't tried GNOME, it's time to try it again.

662
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
Alex, did you get a chance to try out the Ubuntu side?

663
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,600
No, I'm more in the production deployment camp

664
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,680
with Ubuntu these days.

665
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,680
So my file server is on Ubuntu.

666
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,120
So I think that's running 2004 right now,

667
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
and it will stay there until 2204.1 comes out.

668
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,600
Ah, yeah, that's a good strategy.

669
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm debating something like that

670
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,640
other than just, I wanna talk about it on Self-Hosted,

671
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
how the upgrade experience goes.

672
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,720
Yeah, I know, I know.

673
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,040
The life of a content creator, huh?

674
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,720
I gotta make content, you know?

675
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
That's the job.

676
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,200
But also, it's like, sometimes I feel like

677
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
a little bit of like, well, I could do it,

678
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
and then I'll do it so they don't have to,

679
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,720
and if it blows up, I'll tell them about it,

680
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,520
and if it doesn't blow up, they'll know it's okay.

681
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,080
I really think Canonical has nailed

682
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,360
the Raspberry Pi support now for a while.

683
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
It's so nice.

684
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,920
It is such a first, it feels like such a first class

685
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,720
server OS on the Raspberry Pi,

686
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
which is such a silly thing to actually say,

687
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,760
but hey, it's where we're at right now.

688
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,840
I mean, when it's just now that Raspberry Pi OS

689
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,520
is kind of catching up, you need,

690
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,840
this has been kind of a haven for you

691
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,960
for saying OS for your boxes.

692
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,040
It's been great.

693
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,520
I like it, I mean, personally,

694
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,960
I like it a lot more than Raspberry Pi OS.

695
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,800
So Fedora 36, I believe, was Rockin' Linux 5.17.

696
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,160
Ubuntu 22.04 is Rockin' 5.15.

697
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,600
It's both pretty modern.

698
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,880
This one came with that, 5.15 is when they introduced

699
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,760
the Samba server in the Linux kernel.

700
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,040
Yeah, KSMBD.

701
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
You know how much I love having a Samba server

702
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,080
built into the Linux kernel.

703
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,640
What else could you want?

704
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,840
Now you can finally flip it on those pies, man.

705
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
Come on, replace your Samba setup at Chubb's.

706
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,920
You know, I mean, everybody says that Samsung

707
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,600
doesn't contribute much to open source,

708
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,280
but that speaks differently.

709
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,440
So what was your experience, Wes Payne, with 22.04?

710
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
You know, I'm liking it.

711
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,120
I think we've lamented a little bit about

712
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,480
how much has Canonical been investing

713
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,000
into the Ubuntu desktop experience.

714
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,320
And although I think I do kind of prefer

715
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,680
the more stock GNOME feel going on

716
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,160
on the Fedora side of things, GNOME 42 is great on Ubuntu.

717
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,680
It's a really nice experience.

718
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,400
And I'm almost not used, I know this will change

719
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,480
over the lifetime of the LTS, but for right now,

720
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm almost not used to how close these two releases are.

721
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
You know, in the past, Ubuntu had kind of been

722
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,600
a little lagging on GNOME.

723
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
And then even just across some of the packages,

724
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
like, you know, you get Ruby 3.0, you get Python 3.10,

725
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
which is a pretty big release in the Python community.

726
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,240
A bunch of stuff like that, LexD, you get QEMU 6.2,

727
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,360
which also includes jack support for low latency audio.

728
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,480
There's a really nice PipeWire support on Ubuntu now.

729
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,760
It's not quite as shiny or like automated.

730
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,480
You know, they've still got the old media session thing

731
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,440
instead of wire plumber.

732
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,720
So there's a few trade-offs, but.

733
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,680
But I feel like for an LTS,

734
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,600
that's probably what I would have expected them to do

735
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
with the audio subsystem.

736
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,400
Yes, I think that's nice mix too,

737
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
because you still got Pulse going.

738
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,440
So, you know, that's all gonna work

739
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,360
just as you might expect,

740
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,200
but there's still PipeWire things you can plug into

741
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,680
if you do need to go above and beyond.

742
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,840
This release switches to NF tables as well, right?

743
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
It does, yeah, isn't that nice to think?

744
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,800
And another thing where Ubuntu's really kind of catching up.

745
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,280
And we get LexD 5 finally,

746
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,040
which we talked about on LAN recently.

747
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,240
Indeed, I was a little disappointed to see,

748
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
I mean, so there is a new little bumped release of ZSYS,

749
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,200
which is sort of the, you know,

750
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,520
their ZFS integration in the file system

751
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,400
into more of like the system level of the operating system,

752
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,560
but it was mostly just a compatibility bump

753
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,320
for the, you know, the newer version of ZFS

754
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,160
that they're shipping.

755
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
So not a ton of work there.

756
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,280
A lot of initial upfront work,

757
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,240
and then it seems very minimal iterative,

758
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,520
but maybe I have the wrong impression.

759
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,880
Also there, I gave the Flutter installer a go as well.

760
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
Seemed, you know, it's still early days.

761
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,920
It's quite minimal.

762
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,520
Towards the end, it looks a lot like what you're used to.

763
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,720
The time zone support seemed very early.

764
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,000
It did auto detect what I wanted,

765
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
but I didn't see a great way

766
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,440
besides manually type it in to change it.

767
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,640
And although you can have it do LVM for you,

768
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,760
there's no ZFS support.

769
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, that was interesting.

770
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
I gave it a go early myself.

771
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I see where they're going with it.

772
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
I think it looks fine.

773
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,640
I'll be interested as more people get experience

774
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,480
and exposure to that, what their take is.

775
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
You can Google search.

776
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
There's a build of the ISO that has the Flutter installer,

777
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,560
if you'd like to grab that.

778
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,200
I think it's also notable that one of the features

779
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,040
we talked about has been pulled,

780
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,120
and that is the switch of rebranding

781
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,640
the live patch stuff to Ubuntu Pro.

782
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,600
That actually didn't end up in 2204.

783
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,680
They ended up reverting back

784
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,000
to the live patch branding and whatnot.

785
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Maybe they just felt, I think they actually did,

786
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,000
I think maybe Joey had an article,

787
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
somebody had an article that,

788
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,000
yeah, Joey has an article over at OMG Ubuntu

789
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,560
that talks a little bit about their motivation

790
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,400
and pulling it out.

791
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,120
Just seems like it wasn't quite ready yet.

792
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,080
Doesn't really change any actual functionality.

793
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,880
Live patch stuff is still all in there.

794
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
Right, yeah, you can still get the service if you need it,

795
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,720
but just a little more consistent for now.

796
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
Yeah, so the upgrade process

797
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,640
on the systems I tried went smooth.

798
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,160
I also ran this beta nearly the entire time

799
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,960
that it was in beta on and off in a VM,

800
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,240
just kind of checking in on it, not serious usage,

801
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
but checking in and doing the upgrades

802
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,680
to see if anything breaks.

803
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,520
Also very smooth upgrade.

804
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,680
And I think as time has gone on,

805
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,440
I have my take on canonical or Ubuntu spin

806
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,920
on the GNOME 42 desktop has softened.

807
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,680
When we saw Fedora's take,

808
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,600
which was basically upstream in the new Adwaita,

809
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,280
and then we saw the canonical Ubuntu version,

810
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,560
I thought this branding that they're doing

811
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
is starting to feel old.

812
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,600
It's starting to feel like the way we used to do Linux.

813
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
And when I see what the GNOME platform is doing

814
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,560
and the way they're iterating that design,

815
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,240
and my fundamental argument always was,

816
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,160
and I don't think I articulated it very well

817
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,640
until just recently,

818
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,000
if GNOME didn't want downstream projects

819
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,320
re-theming the desktop,

820
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,400
then the upstream theme

821
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,480
just simply needed to be better quality.

822
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,600
It needed to be a better theme

823
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,680
if they wanted people to use it.

824
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,280
And they've done it.

825
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,240
That's what they've done now.

826
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,400
And so there's a bit of a mind shift that happens

827
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,480
when you compare these two distros side by side.

828
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,680
And if you got some free VM space or something,

829
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
maybe give this a go at home.

830
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Load up Fedora 36, load up 2204.

831
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,800
And I think you can objectively say it's nice.

832
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
They're both really nice,

833
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,800
but I'm starting to feel like the custom brand theming

834
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,760
is a bit akin to like OEMs loading up new laptops

835
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,600
with their like dashboards to help your PC health

836
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,920
and stuff like that.

837
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,320
It's not quite that bad.

838
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,040
That's not like they're putting software on there

839
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,520
that's stealing processor cycles and stuff.

840
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,640
So I don't want people thinking

841
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,160
like it's a bad thing necessarily,

842
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,480
but it doesn't quite sit with me right anymore.

843
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,600
Alex, what are your thoughts?

844
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Why do both of the major desktop distros

845
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,160
both have to pick GNOME as their default?

846
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,400
Why can't we have some differentiation in the space?

847
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,360
Why can't one be plasma, for example,

848
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,640
and one be GNOME and that be the differentiator

849
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
rather than putting lipstick on a pig, you know?

850
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,560
I think you don't want me to answer why.

851
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,320
Oh no, I do, please.

852
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,120
What it comes down to is as someone who works

853
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,920
on both Fedora Workstation and Fedora KDE,

854
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,240
the most frustrating aspect of working

855
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,120
with the KDE plasma stack is how huge it is

856
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,320
and how discordant the life cycles

857
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,680
of each layer of plasma is.

858
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,640
So for example, the frameworks

859
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,600
has a completely independent life cycle.

860
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,200
It's released monthly.

861
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,080
Then the KDE applications were to release quarterly.

862
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
And then the plasma desktop itself

863
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,760
is released every four months,

864
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,520
and it's out of sync of every distribution release cadence.

865
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,360
And that makes it difficult for testing,

866
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,800
for integration and all that stuff.

867
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,840
Plus, because it's so big,

868
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,800
there's a large surface area of things to manage.

869
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,760
And differentiating on the plasma desktop,

870
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,840
in theory, would be great,

871
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,400
except for it is extremely difficult

872
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,120
to keep up with the plasma desktop

873
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,360
and differentiate on it in the first place.

874
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,760
Think about how Ubuntu was originally using Unity,

875
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,200
and it was a lot of engineering work

876
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,880
for them to maintain that in the first place.

877
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,920
And when they decided to let that go

878
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
and they switched to GNOME,

879
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,160
the primary reason for doing that

880
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,520
was because the other enterprise Linux distributions,

881
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,480
the main enterprise Linux distributions,

882
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,160
Red Hat and SUSE, both use GNOME,

883
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
and so they could benefit from the work

884
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,040
that was being done already

885
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,960
with the focus of those platforms.

886
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,800
Yeah.

887
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,120
Tiny, that's a bit of it, isn't it?

888
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,480
It's about retaining the developers

889
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,600
that already have the skills.

890
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,120
That's correct, especially because a lot of these distros

891
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,480
have long-term support tied to them,

892
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,440
whether it's Fedora eventually getting rolled into Red Hat

893
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,200
or Canonical, they would have to maintain

894
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,040
both a QT stack and a GTK stack for the lifecycle

895
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,640
while both of them are still around.

896
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah, and we've asked Karl and the team at System76

897
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
when they launched POP, why GNOME Shell,

898
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,920
and now building POP Shell on top of that,

899
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,840
why not Plasma and you could kind of just get

900
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,640
to what you wanted using the Plasma tooling built in.

901
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
And they were very honest about the answer is,

902
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,800
well, the team knows GTK tooling.

903
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,640
We know GNOME Shell, we know this environment,

904
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,000
and that's where our developer skills are.

905
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,240
So it's potentially just one of those things

906
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,640
where it's a network effect of,

907
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,520
and it just means because it's been around for so long,

908
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,600
it's been the default for so long,

909
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,960
there's inherently just more people

910
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,680
that the market can hire that have skills in there.

911
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,960
I don't know for sure, but that could definitely seem

912
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,680
like a pretty reasonable component of it.

913
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,960
Don't get me wrong, Chris.

914
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,680
It's not that Plasma isn't possible

915
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,800
to like build out and roll out and have a good experience.

916
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,240
Fedora KD is a great example of this where we have it

917
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,320
and Component 2 is another one.

918
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,600
And you can see this in OpenSUSE

919
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,560
where despite some people's protests,

920
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
it's very clear that the KD

921
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,400
is the most loved experience of the offerings.

922
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,840
But when you're trying to build a Linux desktop

923
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,320
that you're going to commercialize and sell,

924
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,040
having multiple desktops

925
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,720
and not having multiple groups of people

926
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,600
to maintain those desktops

927
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,640
means you're splintering your effort

928
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,920
and it's much, much harder to get everything going.

929
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,720
And if you think about all the work

930
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,120
that Red Hat's doing right now to push forward,

931
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,200
the Linux desktop's feature set

932
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
to be competitive with Windows and Mac,

933
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,520
think about HDR, think about the Wayland stuff,

934
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,680
the hardware acceleration things,

935
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,800
input stuff, touch gestures.

936
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Think about how much extra work it would be

937
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,400
to pull that across a multitude of desktop stacks

938
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
and multitude of implementations across the board.

939
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,240
It's a lot easier for them to go wide on all these issues

940
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,520
if they're focusing on one stack as a reference point

941
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,320
and then leveraging that experience and expertise

942
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
to build it out and then everyone else

943
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,400
can essentially catch up afterwards.

944
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,320
Would I like Red Hat, to example,

945
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,520
have people working on both KD and GNOME?

946
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,920
Of course, but realistically,

947
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
with the kind of stuff that they're working on

948
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,960
and how far they're putting into it

949
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,520
and how much investment that they're doing

950
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,400
and how much that they're working

951
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,960
on all many different touch points in the experience,

952
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,720
I can't blame them for focusing on only just GNOME.

953
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,000
I think that's well said.

954
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,680
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

955
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,120
Get started with a free trial of a team or enterprise plan

956
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,320
at bitwarden.com slash Linux

957
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,400
or try it for free as an individual user

958
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,040
and you can support the show.

959
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,360
Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses

960
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,760
and individuals to store share or sync sensitive data.

961
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,880
I use it for all kinds of things like passwords,

962
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,720
recovery keys, notes, it's fully customizable too

963
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
and in the enterprise context,

964
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
you can turn certain features on or off

965
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
just using enterprise policies

966
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,480
to adapt it to your business needs.

967
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,880
That's pretty nice.

968
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
And of course, I love the fact and I think you will too,

969
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,560
that Bitwarden is open source

970
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,440
and it's trusted by millions of individuals, teams

971
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,960
and organizations worldwide for securing their passwords

972
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,600
and other information.

973
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,560
It's what Wes and I have used for a couple of years,

974
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,440
at least I think Wes longer than I.

975
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,240
I use it for my two factor codes as well,

976
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,560
having it in one place.

977
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,640
It works so well for that kind of thing,

978
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,320
especially on mobile.

979
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,720
It makes having secure complicated passwords on mobile

980
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,120
a doable thing.

981
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,200
And Bitwarden has introduced account switching

982
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,440
so it's super easy to switch between your personal

983
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
and business accounts or maybe you have a personal account

984
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,240
and you have like an open source project

985
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
you're participating in.

986
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
And I think one of the things that gives me

987
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,720
and a lot of our community confidence

988
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,080
is that Bitwarden offers a really good self hosted option.

989
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,440
You can get that up and running pretty easily

990
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,400
or even faster using the Bitwarden cloud,

991
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,160
which is what I decided to do.

992
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
And if I ever wanted to move to the self hosted option,

993
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I could and the nice thing is they have a large,

994
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,240
active community on their forums and on Reddit.

995
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,200
So I have to say a couple of years into using Bitwarden,

996
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,040
obviously I get the idea of good password hygiene,

997
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,720
but what I've really started to appreciate about it

998
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,920
is how fast and straightforward it is

999
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,040
to share passwords with somebody on a certain project

1000
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,520
and it's really simple to say,

1001
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
okay, just these passwords, I'm setting these aside

1002
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,840
and I'm sharing these with you.

1003
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,200
I think using a good password manager

1004
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,320
and I bet you would agree with me

1005
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
is one of the best things you could do online

1006
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,080
to keep your account safe.

1007
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,560
You might already know that really,

1008
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,680
but maybe someone in your life,

1009
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,960
a friend, a colleague, a family member,

1010
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
maybe they need to hear that

1011
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,320
and they need to know about Bitwarden.

1012
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,720
So go yourself, support the show

1013
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,320
or send people to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1014
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,600
It's easy to get started.

1015
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,400
You just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1016
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
Try it for yourself, maybe try it in your business

1017
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,320
and you'll support the show.

1018
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,280
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1019
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,000
As always, we got some great feedback this week,

1020
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
but I figured since many of us have been flying recently,

1021
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,240
I thought I would give a little insights

1022
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,880
that we received in our mailbox.

1023
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,800
Chris, you might like this one.

1024
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,040
It was directed at something you said last week.

1025
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,360
A listener wrote in and said,

1026
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,720
since you were flying with Delta,

1027
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,440
you had probably a very old

1028
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,280
in-flight entertainment equipment.

1029
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,680
Yes, the old monitors used to run Linux.

1030
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,360
The new monitor hardware runs Android.

1031
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,400
They have native GUI with X11

1032
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,040
and like GTK, QT based GUIs,

1033
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,400
the movies are just RTSP server connections

1034
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,600
and games are launched locally.

1035
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,800
The control units like your servers

1036
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,480
and network modules are all Linux boxes.

1037
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,160
The flight tracker or map can be two different things,

1038
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,720
either a single stream channel where each monitor

1039
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,560
and overhead monitors tune in and grabs images

1040
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,120
or more advanced new hardware

1041
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,040
where it launches native Android app

1042
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,200
and gets information using more modern protocols.

1043
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,480
So Chris, you were mentioning

1044
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,960
how you saw some Linux scroll by,

1045
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
so I guess you were in the old camp.

1046
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,280
Yeah, and mine were old and crappy.

1047
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,320
I think local apps would have been way better

1048
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,040
because this thing, like you touch a button

1049
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,360
and it wouldn't even register the tap for a second.

1050
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,760
So you'd always do that thing where you're like,

1051
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,800
did it register?

1052
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,640
And then you have to do it again,

1053
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
but that time it's like halfway through changing.

1054
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,560
Every single time.

1055
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,960
And even though you know it,

1056
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,800
you still like it.

1057
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,640
You still do it.

1058
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,480
And the delay varies.

1059
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
So it was not a great experience.

1060
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,520
So I could imagine something locally work,

1061
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,840
using some sort of network protocol

1062
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,160
would be a lot better.

1063
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,520
You know, I was on JetBlue for part of my flight

1064
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,640
and it was an Android tablet right there.

1065
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,760
And I saw it totally freeze up on the guy next to me

1066
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,640
who unfortunately was actually using it to watch a movie.

1067
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,720
It was just like tapping the screen,

1068
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,480
like, well, what do I do?

1069
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,800
So they just basically put a tablet

1070
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,640
in the back of the seat?

1071
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,480
Seemingly.

1072
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,560
Yeah, okay.

1073
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I guess that would be the way

1074
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,320
people would solve this problem, right?

1075
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,560
But then like, are they all on wifi?

1076
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,320
Are they hardwired over like the USB connection?

1077
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,080
Because that's a lot of network traffic.

1078
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,880
And if you get even half the passenger streaming video,

1079
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,680
wifi is not gonna handle that well.

1080
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,920
No wonder why it locks up.

1081
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,960
I've seen some videos previously of the like computer rooms

1082
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,120
that are included on planes.

1083
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,160
Have any of you had insights into that?

1084
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,600
Have you seen videos of those before?

1085
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,480
Yeah, they're like full on aerial data centers.

1086
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,280
It's insane.

1087
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,840
Like how do they fit all of that power in a plane?

1088
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,880
It seems like that's why we have such small seats, isn't it?

1089
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
How much fuel are they burning,

1090
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
hauling that gear around, right?

1091
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
And how many of us just show up with our own devices

1092
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,360
with our content already loaded on it anyways?

1093
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,720
Yeah, we should probably have a protocol.

1094
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,840
You wanna talk about saving fuel costs

1095
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,600
and lowering prices and saving the environment.

1096
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
How about you just take the like 700 pounds

1097
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,280
of server hardware off the thing

1098
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,480
and we just like have a mount for my tablet

1099
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,080
because that would make me happy.

1100
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,280
That's all I need.

1101
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,360
It's not, I'm not asking for a lot, right?

1102
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,360
And now as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

1103
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
Oh, we received a boost yesterday.

1104
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,680
20,000 sats, thank you Silas, he writes in.

1105
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,080
Folks, any suggestions for a backend file sync method

1106
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,680
that handles a lot of small files well?

1107
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,480
Hmm, I mean, I could just go the R sync route,

1108
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,680
but I'm wondering if we could make the case

1109
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,800
for like a ButterFS or ZFS send.

1110
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,900
Sure, yeah, if you're, you know,

1111
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,360
have those capabilities on both sides

1112
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,560
that are willing to use those toolings.

1113
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,920
You know, if there's bi-directional stuff,

1114
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
then that might not work so well.

1115
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,520
But if you're just trying to back things up, yeah.

1116
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,440
Alex is moving files around the world all the time.

1117
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm wondering what you're thinking.

1118
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,320
Yeah, ZFS send is a great shout

1119
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,120
because that works at the block level.

1120
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,360
So, you know, if you're talking about

1121
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,960
lots of small files with R sync,

1122
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,520
it would have to compute every time it loads up

1123
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,900
a checksum of the source and the destination file,

1124
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,960
compare them and make sure that they're not different

1125
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,300
and then sync the Delta if required.

1126
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,840
If you're talking about lots and lots of small files,

1127
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,360
that can get quite expensive quite quickly

1128
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,200
in terms of time and computing power.

1129
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,360
Whereas something like ZFS,

1130
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,160
because it's working at the block level of the disk,

1131
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,040
it doesn't care that there's 10,000 files in those blocks.

1132
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,380
It cares that there's, I don't know,

1133
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,920
let's say five blocks worth of disk that have changed

1134
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,020
and it will sync those five blocks only.

1135
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,820
So you've got five transactions, let's say,

1136
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,380
instead of 10,000.

1137
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,260
So it can be a lot more efficient for that kind of thing.

1138
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,800
So that's probably the route I'd go.

1139
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Alex, in one of our technical escapades here

1140
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,080
where you show me all of the infrastructure

1141
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,920
that you have set up,

1142
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,080
which I don't even think I have a 10% grasp on yet,

1143
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,360
you were showing me that you also use RESTIC

1144
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,620
to do a little bit of file-based syncing.

1145
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,760
And I wondered what is happening on the back end there.

1146
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,600
I'm not sure.

1147
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,040
I have even 10% of a clue

1148
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,000
of what's going on in my infrastructure some days.

1149
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,760
So yeah, RESTIC is an interesting one.

1150
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,700
That works at the file level as well.

1151
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,760
It monitors things like inode time

1152
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,000
and M time for modified time on the file level.

1153
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,280
So that's a file level based one,

1154
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,400
which wouldn't be very efficient

1155
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,460
for this particular use case.

1156
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,360
But the reason I like RESTIC in particular

1157
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,120
is because I send all my stuff

1158
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,720
to an S3 compatible back end.

1159
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,780
So on my Synology box that is in England,

1160
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,160
that's running Minio in a Docker container.

1161
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,740
And I sync all the files from here to England

1162
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,360
using auto RESTIC, which is a wrapper around RESTIC itself.

1163
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,200
And so I actually have two servers in England.

1164
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,600
I've got the Synology at my mom's house and at my dad's,

1165
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,320
I have a normal Linux box running ZFS.

1166
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,440
And so I like it for the separation of concern.

1167
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,820
So if something goes wrong with my ZFS backup,

1168
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm fat fingered in my Ansible configuration

1169
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,840
and I screw something up,

1170
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,760
there are two separate channels of backup

1171
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,240
and my automation isn't gonna fail on both of them,

1172
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,040
I hope at the same time.

1173
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,080
Sounds like in some cases,

1174
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,000
the cost of moving a lot of small files might be worth it.

1175
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,240
Almost never, I would say computationally.

1176
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Computationally, it's very expensive.

1177
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,080
In terms of disk IO, it's very expensive.

1178
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,800
So I would try and steer clear from it.

1179
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,520
Maybe you could compress those into a single archive

1180
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,420
and sync just that one archive,

1181
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,520
lots of different ways to approach that.

1182
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,440
Gene Bean boosts in with 2000 sats.

1183
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,040
I really appreciate y'all putting the effort

1184
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,240
into running Synapse and promoting Matrix in general.

1185
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,680
I think it's got a lot of potential

1186
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,680
but needs the visibility and battle testing

1187
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,480
that us home users just can't provide.

1188
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,120
After you get the colony stable,

1189
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,280
I'd love to see a dig into bridges,

1190
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,480
especially double puppeting ones.

1191
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,460
A double puppeting bridge?

1192
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,300
Do you know what that is?

1193
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,360
I don't know what that is.

1194
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,720
Well, there's different classes of bridge

1195
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,080
based on how much control you can get

1196
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,240
on the different platforms, right?

1197
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,880
Because some platforms say let you like add input

1198
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,680
as if you're another user, but some platforms don't.

1199
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,380
Yeah, I think that is the kind of the game plan

1200
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,060
is get it stable and then once we get it stable,

1201
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,440
we wanna embed it on the live page,

1202
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,560
like in a read only mode maybe,

1203
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,580
so you don't even have to have an account,

1204
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,240
you can just see the chat on the live stream page

1205
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,040
on the jblab.tv page.

1206
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,440
And then once we got that figured out,

1207
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,640
I think it's bridging time.

1208
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,720
And I don't know how much bridging we're gonna do

1209
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,280
because the place where we run our IRC room

1210
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,580
kind of anti-bridge and like the Discord bridges

1211
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,800
are getting shut down and the Telegram bridges

1212
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,200
always kind of look like crap to me when I see them,

1213
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,400
for the most part, not always,

1214
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,020
but we'll experiment, you know what I'm saying?

1215
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,360
We'll take a look at it and we'll see where it goes.

1216
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,720
Gerald's mud, nope, that's not it,

1217
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,200
boosted in with 10,000 sats two days ago.

1218
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,040
He says, the saved podcasting message

1219
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,840
should have its own URL, an easy one to share,

1220
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,960
and maybe a different message depending on the audience.

1221
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,520
I'm not tired of hearing about it.

1222
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,680
And I really appreciated that

1223
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,720
because I did kind of, I got smack down a lot

1224
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,360
and I kind of stopped talking about it.

1225
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,480
I just sort of thought, well, I'll shut up for a bit,

1226
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,520
but I appreciate that.

1227
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,940
I have decided, you know, a bit of what needs to happen

1228
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,680
is there's sometimes content that we wanna share with you,

1229
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,260
me, wanna tell you,

1230
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,980
and I really don't have a lot of outlets for that,

1231
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,400
other than this show or another show.

1232
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,540
And so we end up stuffing stuff into the show

1233
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,120
that maybe we should talk about somewhere else, right?

1234
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,160
And so I'm gonna try creating essentially

1235
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,400
an audio version of a Jupiter newsletter.

1236
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,080
And I'm basically just gonna do

1237
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,240
a really low quality crappy podcast

1238
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,220
that nobody should listen to called office hours.hair.

1239
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,320
You go to office hours.hair to subscribe.

1240
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,440
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna read some boosts

1241
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,280
that don't make it on the air.

1242
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,680
I'm gonna read emails and cover questions and feedback

1243
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,700
that come in about the network.

1244
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,920
I'm gonna cover things that the network is working on.

1245
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm gonna talk a little bit about my thoughts

1246
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,880
on the podcast industry.

1247
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,360
And right now I'm kind of thinking fortnightly,

1248
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,760
but I don't know.

1249
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,720
We'll see if you like it, office hours.hair,

1250
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,560
if you wanna check it out.

1251
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,920
And so some of the stuff that has ended up in the show,

1252
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,600
we'll have a new home there

1253
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
so we can keep the focus here on the show.

1254
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,280
And if this sounds like a crazy idea

1255
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,760
that's not gonna go anywhere,

1256
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,300
that is literally the premise I launched this show with,

1257
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,320
that we're doing right now.

1258
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,320
So it could go nowhere, it could turn into a thing.

1259
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,800
So go subscribe at officehours.hair slash subscribe.

1260
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
And I got an old episode that I just put in the feed

1261
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,240
because you gotta have something in the feed

1262
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,360
and I did an office hours like 200 years ago.

1263
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,380
And so that's in there, maybe a little bit less than that.

1264
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,080
And then I'm gonna do another one.

1265
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,960
And I think I'm gonna do them live.

1266
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,360
And when I do them, I think I'm gonna do them

1267
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,420
on Tuesdays at noon where we used to do LUP.

1268
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,760
So if you wanna come in the mumble room

1269
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,960
and give me feedback or ask me something,

1270
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,600
you know how you like to ask questions,

1271
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,640
you can come in there and ask your questions

1272
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,960
and I'll answer them.

1273
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,840
And I don't know, that's it.

1274
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,120
So that's gonna be a thing I do.

1275
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,960
Thanks for the encouragement, Gerald with your boosts.

1276
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Officehours.hair soon.

1277
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,000
There's already one in the feed

1278
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,560
but you may have heard it before.

1279
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,200
I don't know, I don't know.

1280
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,440
The computer guy writes in with a thousand sats, thank you.

1281
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,220
I just got accepted into college

1282
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,520
and their email runs on Outlook.

1283
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,160
The IT department said on their website

1284
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,200
that Thunderbird, which is my favorite email client,

1285
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,400
was not supported.

1286
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,160
Furthermore, they said that Linux

1287
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,600
is also not officially supported.

1288
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,560
I managed to get Thunderbird working anyway

1289
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,720
and it looks like I'm gonna be at constant war

1290
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,560
with the IT department as one of the few Linux users.

1291
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,600
Any tips?

1292
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,940
Mm, I have been here.

1293
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,680
I have been here and a part of me wants to say don't do it,

1294
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,920
just don't even bother.

1295
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,360
But I'll tell you what you really gotta do.

1296
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,480
Here's what you gotta do.

1297
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,400
Stay the F off their radar.

1298
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,080
Don't ever let, you may have already tipped your hand

1299
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,480
too much, just stay off their radar as much as possible.

1300
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,960
Do everything low key.

1301
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,040
Find the holes in the system, use them to your advantage

1302
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,800
and just be patient because you're gonna be using

1303
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,680
the infrastructure in a way that they don't expect

1304
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,640
and so that could go sideways.

1305
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,720
And maybe consider just not doing it.

1306
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,480
But if that's already been considered and rejected,

1307
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,600
then stay off their radar.

1308
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,720
Yeah, you can do things like have a backup system

1309
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,920
if you need to, if you need to do it the official way

1310
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,280
and then yeah, as Chris said,

1311
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,520
be prepared to be your own support on this.

1312
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,000
It can be fun to figure out and make work

1313
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,640
and very satisfying when you do make it work.

1314
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,560
But you know, when grades are at hand

1315
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,920
and you don't need one more complication at 3 a.m.,

1316
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,480
sometimes it's nice to have a backup.

1317
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,520
And I will say web apps, web apps might be an allocator.

1318
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,340
Yeah, I agree.

1319
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,280
I think web apps are a lot better now.

1320
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,960
I do think a backup's not a bad idea.

1321
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,320
It could even be a VM, possibly.

1322
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,160
Yeah, indeed.

1323
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,640
This is how I started my dang career,

1324
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,940
like back in, I'm not even kidding, in the year 2000.

1325
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,780
And it was legitimately like me trying to figure out

1326
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,300
how to get email off an exchange server

1327
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,620
when the entire company used Outlook

1328
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,300
and I didn't want to run Windows.

1329
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,940
And I did all kinds of crazy things,

1330
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,180
including buying multiple editions of Xandros

1331
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,280
because it came with Crossover Office pre-licensed

1332
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,940
and you could put an Office install CD

1333
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,360
and it would auto run the installer and install Outlook.

1334
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,020
And that's what they made money on, right?

1335
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,820
This has been a problem that has been

1336
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,140
in the side of Linux users for a long time.

1337
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,420
It's way better now though,

1338
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,740
so I think you could probably pull it off, computer guy.

1339
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,180
You just gotta stay true and like Wes said,

1340
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,140
have that backup.

1341
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,900
I also feel for the IT department here

1342
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,140
and I don't think it's really their fault.

1343
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,540
I was in the same situation in college

1344
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,980
where being slightly contrarian,

1345
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,700
I may have tested some things.

1346
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,620
But for the IT department, you're one person

1347
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,900
compared to how many people that are running Windows and Mac.

1348
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,540
So they just don't want to, they don't have the time.

1349
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,220
Maybe they would love to have the time

1350
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,460
to help you and explore this, but they just don't have it.

1351
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,340
So I don't think it's really their fault.

1352
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,060
And so saying, you might be constantly at war

1353
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,860
with the IT department is maybe a little strong.

1354
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,420
I think maybe it's just that they just,

1355
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,420
they're encouraging you to take it into your own hands,

1356
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,260
really.

1357
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,860
It's only a problem if you make it a problem, really.

1358
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,380
True, true.

1359
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,500
Tiny also has a tip,

1360
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,220
something he could try besides Thunderbird.

1361
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,860
My work has very strict policies around the M365 products

1362
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,700
and the Evolution EWS plugin works really well.

1363
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,260
It even works with OAuth.

1364
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,900
So if they use Duo or some other form of MFA,

1365
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,180
it still works with that.

1366
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,020
That's a great tip.

1367
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,700
It's definitely worth giving Evolution a try.

1368
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,220
That was one of my go-to solutions

1369
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,980
and it still gets maintained.

1370
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,220
So that's a rarity.

1371
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,140
If you're out there with the new podcasting app

1372
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,620
and newpodcastapps.com that support Boost,

1373
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,260
send me a Boost and give us an update

1374
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,740
on your NixOS challenge, how that is going,

1375
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,900
and on any tricks or tips you have

1376
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,340
for working in an Outlook-heavy environment.

1377
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,620
We'll just put it that way.

1378
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,020
A newpodcastapps.com, get one that supports Boost

1379
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,940
and send it in.

1380
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,900
I found a cool tool I want to share with you guys.

1381
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,300
I brought this one to class today.

1382
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,740
It's called RSS Hub.

1383
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,220
I guess one way to wrap your head around this tool

1384
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,460
is think of YouTube DL, but for RSS feeds from websites.

1385
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,700
And what I mean is it's an open source, simple,

1386
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,660
easily extensible RSS generator

1387
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,060
that you can pretty much throw any kind of weird content at

1388
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,140
and it will build you an RSS feed for.

1389
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,540
Now with the caveat that it kind of has to know

1390
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,020
how to work with the data.

1391
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,300
So it has a huge wealth of websites,

1392
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,420
you know, probably more sites than something like a tool

1393
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,620
like YouTube DL even supports.

1394
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,500
I mean, hundreds and hundreds of websites,

1395
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,420
but also the tooling to create your own is just JavaScript

1396
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,100
and it's easily extensible.

1397
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,460
And you can also, the project is also willing

1398
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,740
to just build it for you

1399
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,820
if you give them a polite pull request.

1400
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,100
They've been known to do this.

1401
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,660
It's really simple to get running,

1402
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,260
especially if you do it inside Docker

1403
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,460
and the way you work with it, RSS hub,

1404
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,060
once you get it up and running,

1405
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,980
is you just throw it a URL

1406
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,580
of the thing you want an RSS feed for

1407
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,260
and it spits out the feed for you.

1408
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,500
And then you throw it in your feed reader of choice.

1409
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,060
They also work specifically with a mobile app

1410
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,100
that works together with RSS hub.

1411
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,540
It's slick if you're like me.

1412
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,220
And one of the ways I can,

1413
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,060
I'll sort of responsibly consume content.

1414
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,100
Maybe I'm not in like a head space

1415
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,500
where I wanna be on Reddit or social media,

1416
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,700
or I wanna sit down and really analyze the news.

1417
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,860
RSS feeds are just unbeatable.

1418
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,780
And the only limitation is some content out there

1419
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,380
isn't in an RSS feed.

1420
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,500
That's what RSS hub fixes.

1421
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,340
And of course it's open source.

1422
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,300
The only challenge you might run into

1423
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,060
is there is a bit of a language barrier.

1424
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,780
So, you know, some things you kind of have to do

1425
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,420
the translation in your head a little bit,

1426
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,380
but it's super simple to get up and running,

1427
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,500
uses Redis for the database backend

1428
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,140
and takes very little resources.

1429
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,260
Even when you run it.

1430
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,100
So it's great.

1431
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,580
RSS hub, go check it out.

1432
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1433
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,740
What do you think?

1434
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,580
Do you like it?

1435
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah, I can.

1436
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,260
Trying to impress you here.

1437
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,900
I'm already can think of like a million uses

1438
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,740
for this thing, so.

1439
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,580
I know.

1440
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,420
We gotta start playing.

1441
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,940
I'm wondering if we couldn't use it too, right?

1442
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,220
To like make mixed feeds and stuff like that.

1443
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,220
I mean, you gotta wonder.

1444
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,140
There could be some potential with this tooling.

1445
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,060
So I had to sneak it in today.

1446
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,340
It doesn't really fit, I suppose, with the theme.

1447
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,500
Now that I think about it,

1448
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,980
I've been trying to get these on theme.

1449
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,460
That doesn't really fit.

1450
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,060
It's good enough.

1451
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,180
Alex, Brent, thank you guys both for joining us from Raleigh.

1452
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,860
I'm sure it's beautiful and wonderful there.

1453
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,940
And you've got lots of projects

1454
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,100
you'll be working on this week.

1455
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,260
Yeah, it's always a pleasure.

1456
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,980
I gotta say, maybe part of the recording

1457
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,540
might be difficult because of all the birds singing

1458
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,060
and the sunshine over here.

1459
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,180
It's really, really, really, really, really nice.

1460
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,300
Well, you know, when the deer walk through, they shut up.

1461
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,940
It's hard to be angry about anything

1462
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,460
when it's 75 and sunny.

1463
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,620
Oh, you guys.

1464
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,540
But as far as projects go,

1465
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,340
we have an ever-extending list of temptations.

1466
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,580
So I don't think we'll run out of projects while I'm here.

1467
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,980
I love that you call them temptations.

1468
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,820
Yeah.

1469
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,380
I see them as ways to spend money.

1470
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,220
I've been showing off your server rack

1471
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,580
to people when they visit the studio.

1472
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,540
It's one of the requested items.

1473
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,500
I've gotten some feedback, too.

1474
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,940
Some people suggest maybe we should have used metal,

1475
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,460
but they thought maybe you should have

1476
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,060
welded something from scratch,

1477
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,140
but everybody has their own opinion.

1478
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,700
Should we get into welding this week, Brent?

1479
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,540
Should we do that?

1480
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,500
Yeah, Alex and I were just talking this week about

1481
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,060
maybe getting into welding.

1482
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,900
Come back.

1483
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,140
We'll weld a rack, you know,

1484
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,260
because we're gonna have the heat problem in the studio

1485
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,100
before we know it, too.

1486
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,900
So we're gonna have to weld some kind of solution,

1487
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,100
obviously.

1488
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,500
It's gonna have to be welded.

1489
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,300
All right, well, until then,

1490
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,020
why don't you join us live for a show, huh?

1491
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,900
Why don't you?

1492
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,940
We do this show every single Sunday

1493
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,460
at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv.

1494
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,060
If you are into the tech headlines,

1495
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,140
you're maybe in the industry,

1496
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,100
you wanna keep apprised of what's going on

1497
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,780
in Linux and free software,

1498
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,580
make sure you grab every single episode

1499
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,780
of Linux Action News at linuxactionnews.com.

1500
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,380
Lean, mean, news, just what you need to know.

1501
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,500
None of the fluff.

1502
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,660
We're not trying to waste your time.

1503
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,900
We know you're busy,

1504
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,260
but there's probably a few things going on

1505
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,060
you should probably know about.

1506
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,620
So that's Linux Action News in a nutshell.

1507
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,380
That's my pitch for it right there, linuxactionnews.com.

1508
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,660
See you next week.

1509
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,260
Same bad time, same bad station.

1510
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,100
All right.

1511
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,580
Links to what we talked about today,

1512
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,020
including the work on Fedora 37

1513
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,380
and future versions of Ubuntu

1514
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,260
and details about all of that,

1515
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,820
including extra deets about all of the releases,

1516
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,820
all that stuff at linuxunplugged.com slash four, five, four.

1517
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,420
We have it all there for you.

1518
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,420
You'll also find links to our feedback page,

1519
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,260
our subscribe page, all that stuff.

1520
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,260
Whole catalog there.

1521
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,660
It's like a website.

1522
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,500
It's great.

1523
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,060
You can use it anytime you want.

1524
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,980
Anyways, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1525
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,420
of the Unplugged program.

1526
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,900
If you can't join us live,

1527
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,460
we're just grateful you listen.

1528
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,540
We appreciate that.

1529
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,540
And we'll see you whenever you want.

1530
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:53,540
We'll see you next week.

1531
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:06,100
All right.

1532
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,500
Go pick our title at jbtitles.com.

1533
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,860
What you can't see from here is how Brent spent

1534
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,060
the entire outro air drumming.

1535
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,900
Perfect time.

1536
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
It's in his blood now.

1537
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,020
Even the syncopations that Alex,

1538
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,540
you taught me that word last time I was here.

1539
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,860
Syncopations.

1540
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,700
I know.

1541
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,540
Look it up.

1542
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,900
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

1543
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,060
We got a title crisis here.

1544
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,860
This is a title crisis.

1545
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,900
I saw some pretty funny ones go by.

1546
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,740
Did you?

1547
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,980
Cause none of them say anything about distro being reviewed

1548
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,340
or a bun to or fedora.

1549
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,780
I said they were funny.

1550
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,500
I did not say they were on topic.

1551
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,420
We've got some good alliterative ones right here

1552
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,340
with double distro debate and double distro detail.

1553
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,180
I do like those.

1554
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,020
You're right.

1555
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,860
You're right.

1556
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,700
I do like those.

1557
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,860
Hey, I thought it might be kind of interesting

1558
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:51,260
to maybe itemize the tasks.

1559
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,380
What did I call them?

1560
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,740
Temptations that Alex and I might get into.

1561
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,620
Alex has an entire,

1562
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,940
Chris, did you see this when you were here?

1563
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,580
Alex has an entire drawer of electronic to do.

1564
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,780
It's a drawer, not a list.

1565
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,540
It's a drawer full of like.

1566
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,380
Oh sure.

1567
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,220
Yeah, I love that.

1568
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,700
Yeah, I've got a little crate that I store in the RV

1569
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,620
of like, oh, this is something I got to get to.

1570
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,740
All the crap that you bought

1571
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,220
and then it takes too long to get there

1572
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,220
and you think, why did I buy this again?

1573
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,660
Or you bought it and then like something comes up

1574
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,220
and like that's whatever came up,

1575
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,700
took my like my Saturday afternoon

1576
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,980
that I was going to work on that thing

1577
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,540
and then like no other windows ever opened up again.

1578
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,700
There's always something else to do.

1579
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,420
Speaking of windows that open up again,

1580
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,820
the skylight that we had in the bonus room last night,

1581
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,700
that was a pretty good segue, wasn't it?

1582
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,740
That was a great segue.

1583
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,660
We took a, I had in this drawer,

1584
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,020
I had an Acara Zigbee window sensor,

1585
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,740
like a little magnetic one.

1586
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,180
And so Brent and I put that on the skylight last night.

1587
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,020
What did you think of the pairing process

1588
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,900
with Home Assistant?

1589
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,620
I was like getting ready to sit down

1590
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,980
and absorb what the Home Assistant process

1591
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,820
was going to be for this

1592
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,900
and you were done before I even like got set up.

1593
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,340
So it was kind of amazing and really slick.

1594
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,300
From box to wall in what, eight minutes?

1595
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,020
I would say it was literally a five minute job,

1596
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,860
but it just reiterated to me like the progress we've made.

1597
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,940
If you think about Home Assistant

1598
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,220
and where it started way back when

1599
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,420
and where you are now Alex,

1600
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,460
I would imagine things are pretty slick.

1601
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,300
We've come a long way,

1602
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,380
but Chris is still going to be running Python 2

1603
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,220
in 10 years time.

1604
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,660
So, you know, we can do all the progress we want.

1605
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,020
It's too soon, it's too soon, it's raw stuff.

1606
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:33,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
