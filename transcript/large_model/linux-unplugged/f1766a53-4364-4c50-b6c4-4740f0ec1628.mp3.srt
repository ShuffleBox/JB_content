1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Winter may be coming to an end for us, but it's just beginning for the Mars Linux copter

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,660
You know that things made 27 flights

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,560
Unbelievable, but recently the little Linux copter on Mars has been struggling dust has settled on its solar panels

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,640
And it's having a hard time recharging its six lithium-ion batteries. You know I just had this problem Brent

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
I had to get up on the roof and clean off my solar panels

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,240
Are they gonna hire you to clean off the the wings of this little copter too?

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,580
Yeah, I don't know what the big deal is just get out there and dust it off. Yeah, just blow it off

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,840
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show my name is Chris and my name is Brent

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,540
Hello Brent Wes is out on assignment this week

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,680
I think he's actually at the airport as we record right now well coming up

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,920
We still have a heck of a show Nvidia has done it

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,720
They have kicked off the process of open sourcing their compute and GPU driver, so let's chat about that

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,640
Let's chat about what you can expect

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,320
Let's chat about what's happening first and break it down for you

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,960
And then later on in the show one of the co-founders of tail scale is going to join us

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,360
Let's see if we can get a sense of maybe what makes tail scale so different by chatting with him

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,880
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts some pics and a lot more so before we go any further

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug hello. Mumble room

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,880
Hello guys, thank you for joining us today. I

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,940
Might sound a little different. I am remote on location

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,200
I am down in Southern Oregon getting the very last bits of damage from the Denver Road trip fixed on lady tube

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,840
She her suspension took a beating on the way into Denver, and there's just one bit of repair needed still before

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,240
We're ready for our summer road trip because we are working on another JB road trip

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
And we'll have details on that soon, so I'm down here

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,040
And of course it's right after my star link died on me if you heard last week's episode my star link is out

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,060
So I'm doing this an older school way low bandwidth, so if I sound weird that might be why?

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
But and Brent you're back at home now all done traveling

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,320
I am it feels funny that we kind of switch spots you're traveling now, and I'm home so

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,120
It feels good for my end. This is funny for me though because I traveled over 400 miles

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,560
it was like nearly nine hours of driving yesterday, and I get down to Southern, Oregon and

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I park and

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,960
Everything's where I've left it. It's the weirdest thing. It's like I'm in a different climate because it's much nicer down here

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,040
But all my stuff is in the same drawers

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,080
It's almost like when you when you close all the windows blinds and stuff. It's like I'm I really never left

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,960
I feel like I'm still in Washington, but then I step outside of course. I'm in a totally different different spot

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,880
But I love it jubes did great on the drive down

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,660
We hit some traffic, but other than other than that she did so good, and you know the cellular system

38
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,680
I have now just so seamlessly switches between different networks that we remain connected the entire drive these days

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,960
Which is so awesome, so we're you know streaming podcasts and stuff and listening to him on the way down

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,680
We towed the car

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,720
And so it's just the wife and I the kids are at home because just a quick trip and I'll be down here for a couple

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Of episodes that I'm recording one linux unplugged and one coda radio, and then we'll be heading home

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,600
But it's nice. It's nice to be on the road again

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,960
It's nice to be getting ready for the road trip that we're gonna do later this summer

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,280
So we'll be sharing details on that road trip and office hours if you're curious, but let's let's talk about the big news

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Let's just get right into this

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,520
because I

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,800
Don't know if I ever thought this would happen every now

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,000
And then there have been these just ginormous Everest sized mountains

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
for the linux desktop that we had to climb and

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,640
Once we're on the other side looks like life has changed for linux users forever

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,300
This was definitely the case with Wi-Fi a long time ago

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,000
Automatic X configuration, I think maybe could even get this treatment. There's been certain milestones

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,540
milestones that we have hit that have just changed life for all future linux users where us old-timers look back and go

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,920
If you only knew what we had to do back in my day

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
This is one of those weeks

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,000
Nvidia has announced that they are releasing the GPU kernel modules as open source

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,120
It's starting with compute with so a focus on CUDA and that kind of stuff with an eventual

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
Solution for desktop graphics as well, and I think there's already some example code on their github

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,360
this is going to change the game for distributing the Nvidia driver on

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Linux and

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,840
We have a couple of really great links in the show notes for you to read up if you're curious about the details and then

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:52,760
also, I want to mention that Christian Schaller joined us for Linux action news 240 and we dedicated the entire episode to our

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,200
conversation with him to get some of the details and

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,680
Christian is here now as well live in our mumble room Christian. Welcome back to the show. Thank you

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,880
Thanks a lot for having me

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
this

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Must have been the hardest secret to keep there must have been a point where you realized this was really going to happen and that

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
Must have been thrilling

70
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,840
Yeah, no for sure. It's it's one of those things where I you know, even it was even top secret inside Red Hat

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,320
So I mean I had even conversations with all the Red Hatters. They're like you're saying oh we realize you can do something

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah, that would be nice

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,640
Because I couldn't confirm or this what you call it not affirm it until it was public

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,640
So yeah, definitely a hard secret to keep for a long time

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,680
I bet I I mean it wasn't too long ago that Matthew Miller was on Twitter saying, you know

76
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,600
This is something we've really got to address as a community getting the sense

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah, a lot of people didn't know it was coming in in part

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,120
I have to imagine this is something that they have to manage carefully because it is as a company

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,920
It's kind of an indefinite commitment to now supporting something on an engineering level, isn't it? Yeah. No, I mentioned Matthews

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,200
Twitter thing. Yeah, we ended up reading me into the news after that think like yeah, maybe you need to let Matthew know

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
So he knows that maybe this isn't exactly the best time to stir the boat

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,440
That's fair enough probably a good idea I suppose so I'm curious I know I got I got a couple of questions for you

83
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Since we chatted I suppose as you'd expect there has been some skepticism around the announcement

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
But I think probably the most prominent

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Skepticism has been around this sort of line of thinking. Well sure they released the stuff

86
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
That's gonna touch the kernel is open source

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
But they just moved all this stuff to the firmware and now there's a 34 megabyte firmware blob required

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,280
And I've heard this from a couple of different people

89
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm curious to know what your take is on that not like, you know

90
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,720
What the official position is but just your opinion on on this method of driver development

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay, so from a purely sort of ideal stand, but I would love for everything to be open including firmware that that said

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,360
I mean

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,400
I I guess the one reason felt it was little unfair when people started going off that was that

94
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,880
Everyone is doing this model of having a binary firmware and then you know the driver being

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Mostly sort of connecting that up. So I mean it's it's yes, it's a little unfortunate, but it's it's what everyone does

96
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
So this is not I don't feel it's right to single out in media

97
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,120
Then you have to basically go after more or less every vendor out there

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,040
I mean the Linux firmware file is you know growing for every release due to more and more people putting more more functionality into the firmware

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,480
So that's that's just the way it is. And it's sort of something we as a community has accepted it gets for a long time

100
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,960
No, yeah, a lot of vendors are doing it this way

101
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,880
and I think the only thing that's a little unfair about the criticism is

102
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,120
The file size is being used as like like a negative, you know, 34 megabytes of firmware

103
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,660
But if you actually look at the firmware

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,000
There are just a ton of architectures that that 34 megabytes supports

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,080
In fact Longhorn on Twitter did just that he says the 30 megabytes supports multiple GPU

106
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,000
generations as well as a bunch of other ELF sections and

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,200
things specifically for ampere and Turing and all kinds of little bits in there that aren't necessarily like

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,920
Control mechanisms and stuff like that. So you can't really derive

109
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,880
Anything from that 34 megabyte file size. That's that's a bit of a red herring

110
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
additionally

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
It seems to me that that means the problem solved on the Linux side

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,340
So now as a consumer, this is just a different set of pros and cons that you have to weigh

113
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,020
But it's clearly a benefit because it's gonna make it easier for manufacturers like system 76. They're shipping Nvidia hardware

114
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,260
It's gonna make it easier for folks that have existing Nvidia hardware

115
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,180
But it's also going to be a benefit for the Nuvoo driver too, which I think is sort of been missed in all of this

116
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:44,020
And I don't can you share any details there Christian about what what's kind of maybe the next steps for the Nuvoo driver?

117
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Yeah, I mean it opens up

118
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,860
opportunities for us right to so as I mentioned in my blog and this is that so historically what happened was that

119
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,260
When then we just switched to sign firmware. It basically meant that the wall couldn't use that firmware

120
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,600
So so we had we reached out and you know Nvidia was kind enough to work with us to say, okay

121
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Let's let's make a firmware that make let's know what keep working that of course end up being a big effort for it for Nvidia

122
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,640
Because they had maintained an extra firmware and it took time to get features in

123
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,700
I mean one big feature people kept of course missing was the ability to reclock the GPU

124
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,840
Because Nvidia GPUs and I assume others by default the fault is sort of like almost like a power saving level of GPU

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,200
So so if you are less stuck in that, you know, don't get a lot of performance out of your GPU. So

126
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,320
So they were in talks with them what like how do we fix this and then you know when this thing became a thing

127
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,820
We said like, okay, maybe the solution is that we can then you know

128
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,240
Tie things together with your new release and then we have a shared firmware between you know

129
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
Then we just back in MSS stack, right? That is exciting. That seems like massively

130
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,400
Simplification of engineering efforts and just way easier to maintain long-term. Yeah, exactly

131
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,480
Exactly Casey points out in in the IRC to that, you know for 30 for a 34 megabyte firmware

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,160
You get a massively parallel computer with 12 gigs of RAM

133
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,680
Anyways continue Christian. I know you had another point there. Yeah, I was just gonna save it firmer

134
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,600
I think also I sort of

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Came to terms it firmer in general when we launched LVFS

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,380
I felt that after that I couldn't really go out there and you know scream murder every time I saw

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,560
Former firmware out there being available close source. I bet being involved with LVFS does give you a pretty good perspective on that

138
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,480
I feel like this is one of those stories that after we were done recording LAN

139
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,120
I just wanted to take the rest of the week off like I was so excited

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
It's like what else could happen in Linux that would even matter this week. It's such a big deal

141
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
But now really in a in a weird way

142
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,600
Now a lot of the hard work starts, right?

143
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,240
Like I look at the github and I see all these issues that are being opened up by the community and people that are jumping

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,660
In and right now we're really just looking at a solution for compute as well

145
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,080
And so we should probably set our expectations. I mean, maybe it's not even unreasonable to

146
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,520
Expect maybe summer of next year before there's something people are gonna want to install on their machine

147
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
What do you think you think that's reasonable?

148
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,880
Well, I mean I think if you really want something to just run compute like, you know

149
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,080
We need the I want the driver and you want to sign it

150
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Yourself for the time being to run on let's say your blade machines to use you for compute and you're definitely ready to use it

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,320
But you you need to wait until the graphics comes in for one before able to run to the desktop

152
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,920
and of course at the same time we in the distro world are of course making figuring out how we got to deal with signing and

153
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,160
Packaging this thing and you know, it's not an upstream drive yet. That's another thing people need to remember

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,680
I did still an auto tree driver. So that has you know

155
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Like any other tree driver

156
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,480
It's only set of challenges for us in the distro world to deal with but you know

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,280
I think the pieces will fall in place and and it will make make things easier as we had

158
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,560
Going forward. Well, this was you know

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,820
Really the result of years of investment in a relationship and those details and more are in Linux action news 240

160
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:58,560
Where Christian covers all of that, but I think this is a obvious win. I know some people are very skeptical but to me

161
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,140
This means that people can now buy laptops or desktops within video hardware and you know within a year's time

162
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,180
It's gonna work out of a out of the box like your AMD or Intel graphics does

163
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,140
That's just indisputably a win if that means some some of the functions are in a blob. Yeah, it's maybe it's not ideal

164
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
But it seems to be the compromise

165
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,840
We have decided to live with and it does mean we deliver on the best end-user experience that we can right now

166
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
and it is such a

167
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,820
Tectonic shift from where we were a week ago

168
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,740
That I think people just haven't really even processed what this means so extremely excited and Christian

169
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,940
Thank you for giving us the scoop on all of that and so we can help people understand what's going on and set their

170
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,140
Expectations accordingly and again, I will link to your blog post in the show notes

171
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,980
Which I think everyone should give a read over as well because you put a lot of great info in there

172
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,860
Thanks for joining us again. Yeah, my pleasure and just maybe one last item

173
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,980
I mean I would ask everyone to try to be patient with Nvidia here too because you mean this is a big change for them

174
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,060
Too right and they have to come up with how they deal with the community around the driver

175
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,140
And I mean and we'd have done open source before and various things. It's not like they're completely new to it

176
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,060
But this is like, you know the heart of the hardware, which is not the heart of their business

177
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,700
So, you know if things doesn't all go super smooth from day one

178
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,260
You know give them have some patience and I'm trying to work with them

179
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,820
I say, you know iron out their own interaction with the community that will spring out and spring up around the driver

180
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,660
Linode.com slash unplug go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and it's a great way to support the show

181
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:37,540
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years and their mission has remained unchanged since that begun make cloud computing simple

182
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:44,900
Affordable and accessible to everyone. It's led to the best-in-class experience, and it's why we host everything on Linode

183
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,300
We look at the options. I hear from some of you sometimes tell me about some great bargain-based

184
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,660
deal you got and then usually about six months to a year later. I hear about why you switched to Linode

185
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
So take advantage of the hundred dollars

186
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,100
It's just a great way to go try something and Linode has a lot of one-click deployment applications as well

187
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,540
Some of the apps that we've talked about here on the show one-click to get going zoom replacements. Yeah, they got Jitsi up there

188
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,860
You want to try GitLab? Yeah, they got that fact some of the services. I'm gonna deploy soon for

189
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,180
Some back-end stuff that I'll probably talk about in the future. I'm just gonna use one of their one-click deployments

190
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,340
They've also got a great one for WordPress and they're always adding new ones like just constantly

191
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,980
So I check in there from time to time and I'll just deploy a project and try it out

192
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,340
And it's a great way to try out that hundred dollars, too

193
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,780
So from development tools to game servers to the back-end infrastructure for your business

194
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,940
So I'm talking like scaling from a personal project to something for millions of users

195
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,020
Linode is a great way to go try something and Linode is a great way to go try something

196
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,460
Linode has you covered and then they back it by the best support in the business and they've got a bunch of nice features like

197
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,340
s3 compatible object storage cloud firewalls DDoS protection a

198
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,500
Powerful DNS manager and of course your info management to kubernetes terraform ansible

199
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,620
They've got support for all of that with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than those duopoly

200
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,220
Hyperscalers that want to lock into their crazy esoteric platform

201
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,060
Go use the real internet and go build a system either from the ground up or with one-click deployment

202
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,500
Linode makes it easy and their community support runs deep go get $100 support the show and try something out Linode calm

203
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460
unplugged

204
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,740
Tail scale is a mesh VPN powered by wire guard

205
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,420
We've talked about it on the show before and I should disclose they are a sponsor on coda radio and self-hosted

206
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,420
They don't sponsor this show but you can go to tail scale comm slash coder or tail scale comm slash self-hosted if you want to

207
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,340
Sign up and it's a tool that we all use as a team and there's a lot of great tools out there

208
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,540
We've mentioned nebula in the past. We've also talked about s shuttle or shuttle in the past

209
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,500
We've covered all kinds of mesh VPN solutions like tink and others. It's always a problem

210
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,980
We've been trying to solve but tail scale really has seemed to solve it the best for us

211
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,180
And I have an opportunity to sit down with Avery pen around who is one of the co-founders of tail scale

212
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,680
He spent the previous eight years at Google where he launched some of their first p2p payment systems for Google wallet

213
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,460
He was involved with Google fiber and working out the Google fiber mesh Wi-Fi strategy

214
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,820
He's been involved in other high-profile alphabet projects

215
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,380
so it was just a great chance doing these podcasts sometimes just gives me a chance to talk to people I normally would not get to

216
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,500
Talk to and I wanted to get kind of an insight into tail scale because it just almost seemed too good to be true

217
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,620
And I was hoping maybe to get some insights and I walked away from this conversation

218
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,780
With some of those I think so I wanted to share it with you

219
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:51,300
Avery sat down with me just recently and we were chatting just before we got started about some of his previous projects that I was

220
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
familiar with I

221
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,100
have been looking to solve my

222
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,380
Desperate network problems for years and I've been rolling my own crazy solutions

223
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,060
I had tried a few different things with wire guard

224
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
but I actually started with shuttle and

225
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,940
We talked about it a long time ago on the show and I believe you were the original creator of shuttle VPN, correct that I was

226
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,820
2009 I think so you've been thinking about VPN stuff for a while

227
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,860
I take it was wire guard like the missing piece for you wire guard was definitely a missing piece

228
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,420
I've actually been thinking about VPNs all the way back to 1997 when I wrote my first one

229
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,940
for my the first startup that me and my roommate started in our dorm room in university and

230
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,020
That particular one made some you know major structural mistakes that you should not make when designing a VPN

231
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,900
We we we didn't exactly roll our own crypto

232
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,180
But we took the crypto primitives and we put them together in ways you probably shouldn't do

233
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,740
I learned a few lessons from that we did TCP over TCP which you should not do in a VPN

234
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,220
But it was it was educational and in fact this this carried our product forward

235
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,660
We had a company we it was the thing that actually launched us this VPN because it was on a network appliance server

236
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,820
You could install in small businesses. It was quite easy to configure compared to other VPNs at the time

237
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,940
But it had these other flaws, you know fast forward to the shuttle days. I'm like, okay

238
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,900
I learned a lot of lessons

239
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,740
I know what a few things not to do and I'm a little frustrated that you know

240
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,620
Our product got acquired by IBM IBM sort of dismantled it and killed it

241
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,460
No more VPN that I liked alternatives are like PBDP and IPSec which are pretty terrible or open VPN

242
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,020
So shuttle the motivation was like I don't want to do the encryption myself and I don't want to do TCP over TCP

243
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,620
So SSH has good encryption. Let me just like piggyback on top of SSH

244
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,780
You know rather than sending the packets over SSH

245
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm going to disassemble the TCP sessions and then reassemble them on the other side which bypasses this TCP over TCP problem

246
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,820
That actually worked quite well. It was an open source project

247
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,580
I didn't try to commercialize it, but I used it for all kinds of things

248
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,340
It helped you know any any server that supports SSH can be your VPN server, which is quite handy

249
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,700
The performance wasn't the greatest but it was perfectly good for like transferring some files around and doing some remote terminals

250
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,580
With tail scale when when WireGuard showed up

251
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,220
I was really excited because it is like look I don't have to do my own encryption

252
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,020
But I can understand the encryption that these people are doing which means I can take this like a simple

253
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,500
Primitive for encryption and plug it into a bigger picture of the way I want the world to work

254
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,660
Right a really simple VPN that I control everything about the way the experience happens

255
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,700
But I'm not sacrificing security. It is deceptively simple on the front end as a customer experience

256
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,600
It's a very simple application to install. It's very simple to authenticate. It uses my existing single sign-on provider

257
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
It really couldn't be smoother

258
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,180
And so I'm not surprised to hear that you've been thinking about this since 97 because when I first tried tail scale

259
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:52,320
I thought they must be pulling some real magic off on the back end to make this feel so simple

260
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,300
So what are some of the more complicated things that are being solved on the back end to make it?

261
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,340
Just such a seamless thing for me to have a flat network of all my devices

262
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,940
There's quite a bit of magic in there. The first step is just this key management

263
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,580
So in shuttle we got out of key management by just saying like look it's your job to do SSH key management

264
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,860
You already know how to do that

265
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,860
We'll just piggyback on top of that which is great except that in fact

266
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,980
Many people do not know how to do SSH key management. And so there's a bit of a limited market

267
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,220
It's only people who can figure out how to manage their SSH keys effectively

268
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,260
Which at least is most developers if you wanted to deploy that company-wide for example

269
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,060
most of the people in your company are not developers and so they don't know how to set up SSH keys and so shuttle was

270
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,740
Never a you know a useful product for the general community even if even if pushed by an IT team

271
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:45,140
So tail skills key management instead of using SSH keys, we used what is now, you know, 12 years later

272
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
13 years later

273
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:55,140
Keep losing count 13 years later really common which is the single sign-on system that people are using on web apps, right?

274
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,500
The click click here to logging with Google click here to signing with github

275
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,980
This stuff in the intervening years has become like the standard thing to do. Everything is turned into a web app

276
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,860
All the web apps have a button for like login with Google

277
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,820
So we make tail scale look like a web app for the purposes of authentication, right?

278
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,100
You load up the tail scale app

279
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,140
Which is a native app on your phone or your PC or your Linux machine and it gives you a URL which sends you

280
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,620
To a web browser which then acts like a SAS app which can use your single sign-on

281
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,260
So that's that's the first trick we piggyback again on somebody else's authentication just like shuttle did but this time we're piggyback on

282
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
authentication that everybody knows how to use

283
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,140
The second thing we did is what we call NAT traversal

284
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,060
So this is especially magical other VPNs I've built myself and have used

285
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,660
Require one end of the VPN connection to be on a public facing open firewall port

286
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,660
Which is not that shocking the whole internet kind of runs on this principle

287
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,300
The client can be behind a NAT or a firewall, but the server has to be outside waiting for your connection

288
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Otherwise, how is it going to work? The problem is

289
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,500
People setting up a VPN or trying to make a connection between two devices

290
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,980
This is really limiting to what kind of connections you can make it essentially turns the whole internet into the centralized system

291
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,620
Where nowadays the only people that get a public IP address

292
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,340
Are cloud providers and then you have to rent one from a cloud provider and now everything is like

293
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,500
The hub is the cloud provider and the spokes are everybody else, right?

294
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,020
You're paying rent to these cloud providers to do anything you want to do on the internet

295
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,820
So tail scale the magic involves like you could literally have you in a cafe

296
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,660
With your laptop and your co-worker in a cafe with their laptop

297
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,860
They log into tail scale on the same domain. Those two devices will find each other

298
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,900
They will not go through an intermediate server. They'll actually make a direct peer-to-peer connection

299
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,020
Between those two devices and now they're connected you can go to a service that your co-worker is running on their laptop and try

300
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,380
Out that web service or you can ssh into their device or do file sharing or whatever

301
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,500
Well, this is sort of what i've discovered using tail scale is that

302
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,780
It is essentially allowing me to create my own decentralized internet and it's kind of a sneaky way to do it

303
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,700
It's not really like tail scale selling itself as build your own decentralized internet, but that's kind of the end result, isn't it?

304
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,380
Well, I mean the word the word decentralized has become a bit dirty now because every time someone says decentralized they assume

305
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,180
We're talking about blockchains and bitcoins and stuff. Sure. Yeah. Yeah or any kind of weird crypto

306
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,660
Yeah, and that's that's not what tail scale does

307
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,740
The way I like to think of it is like look we actually did decentralization in a way that's actually decentralized

308
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,580
Therefore like achieves engineering goals, right? We're not we're not doing decentralizations for like religious reasons

309
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,020
We're doing decentralization because it's the most efficient way to solve your problem

310
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,340
Well, and it really is about connecting my devices, isn't it?

311
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,020
That's the issue is I don't have a great way to connect all of these disparate devices double nat different cloud providers vps

312
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,620
Some of them are locked behind vms or containers it flattens all of that

313
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,140
So the neat thing about tail scale is that it's sort of what I call a hybrid centralized decentralized system

314
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,620
The control plane the part that decides which devices can talk to which other devices the part that sends your public keys around

315
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,860
In the same way that you would send a public key to an ssh server and put it in your authorized keys file

316
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,380
That part is centralized you go to the tail scale sass product

317
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,820
We run a little tiny thing that we call the control server that is basically just a collector for public keys

318
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,060
But also connects to your identity system, right? That is where everybody else goes to rendezvous

319
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,020
So me with my laptop in this cafe you with your laptop in the other cafe both of our laptops

320
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Contact the control server and say like hey

321
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,180
Where are my friends? Right and you find out the ip address in the public key

322
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,260
Go back to that and then those two laptops do the data plane

323
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,460
Actually sending packets back and forth initiating connections with each other in a purely decentralized way

324
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,820
This ends up being a really elegant algorithm because it's extremely inexpensive to run a centralized control plane where they only use it occasionally

325
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
And there's no latency sensitivity

326
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,980
But it's extremely inexpensive to run a data plane where we don't have to transfer any of the bytes for you

327
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,940
Right keeps the infrastructure cost down. In fact, you have to pay a lot of money to run a centralized control plane

328
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,300
You had a blog post that I really liked. It's titled how our free plans stay free and you write in there

329
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,660
All this is to say our costs are carefully managed like other sas companies. We don't build physical infrastructure

330
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,580
We avoid touching your packets for privacy, but also to reduce our costs

331
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,140
We fix bugs and docs instead of answering the same questions over and over again

332
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,020
Our control plane is lightweight and our dep network is cost controlled

333
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:31,480
This allows us to maintain a healthy operating margin so that a free tier isn't competing for resources with our paying customers

334
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,860
And I think there's a lot of insights just in that paragraph right there that I felt like I got about the company

335
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
And about you, I mean first of all

336
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,300
It's very clearly plainly written. It's very easy to understand

337
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,140
You don't really mince any words there and it makes a lot of sense as a customer

338
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,100
My first concern was well, is this thing going to stick around and is that a problem that you have discovered?

339
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,980
Are customers worried that this thing is too good to actually stick around that happens pretty often

340
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,620
One of the most common bits of feedback we get is like, please please don't cancel the free plan

341
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,000
Please please don't get acquired by you know list of competitors

342
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,460
Please don't add any more features to the product because I like it just the way it is

343
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,020
And I know what happens when companies add features to their products

344
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,460
I feel like the whole industry at this point has kind of been scarred by a bunch of software companies that have been

345
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
I guess kind of selfish they care more about

346
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,260
Their business model than they care about their users

347
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,740
It feels like the VC model in particular is tricky

348
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,020
And so I wonder if we could speak to that for a moment because also a congratulations

349
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,220
I know you recently raised a Series B round of funding and it looks like you have a blog post that addresses that as well

350
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,860
And in here, you know, you kind of address that issue is like some people are concerned after they hear about some series funding

351
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,540
That there's going to be a whole bunch of feature creep that all of a sudden it becomes this giant platform that

352
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,060
Like a chat system has to be built on top of what are your thoughts around that?

353
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,460
The biggest concern that people and even me when I see announcements like this have is

354
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,100
If you had to raise money, does that mean you were going to go to business if you hadn't raised money?

355
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,180
Because if that's the case then you're on what we call the VC treadmill

356
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
where

357
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,620
You have to keep running faster and faster just to not fly off the treadmill and smack into the back wall

358
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:16,260
Most startups find themselves in that situation and when that happens the desperation level rises and rises

359
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,980
And so you'll see a product that starts off really good, but they didn't quite find their footing couldn't figure out quite the right business model

360
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,180
Didn't make quite enough money to pay their expenses and they had this tough decision. Am I going to lay people off?

361
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,300
Or am I going to raise more money and keep trying?

362
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,420
And most of the time the companies go and try to raise more money and keep trying but that you know

363
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,820
They keep trying and it may not ever find their way, right?

364
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,580
That's where you get these more and more desperate weird things where like I'm going to add a chat system

365
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,700
Or a chat bot to my unrelated product. Tailscale is a little different and I tried to get that across in this blog post

366
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,100
So we announced a Series B funding of a hundred million dollars, right? Which is pretty big for a Series B

367
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
We're not raising that money

368
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Just to stay in business. We actually had a bunch of money still left over from our Series A

369
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,800
We were on track to be profitable by the end of 2022

370
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,580
Kind of inefficiently because in fact, it's it's all you know, if you're going to raise this much money

371
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,060
You should actually spend it. Otherwise, you've kind of wasted your equity

372
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,860
Selling it to investors. So we we intend to spend a hundred million dollars, but we want to do this in a way

373
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:23,140
That we never end up at that desperation level. Like we want to be the ones in control. We're tracking our spending rate

374
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,980
Related to our revenues and because we've got extra money

375
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,060
We're trying to sort of clear out this buffer of extra money by spending a little faster than our revenues

376
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:37,060
But the revenues we look carefully at how fast we're growing so we could become profitable at any time we want

377
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:43,140
And that's a really important attribute to maintain in a company where you don't want to end up with this level of desperation

378
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,460
So we believe we can do it. I mean, you know, there's famous last words. We could always make mistakes

379
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,060
But we really really put a high premium on

380
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:57,220
Not screwing this stuff up because all three co-founders we're we're getting a little older now. We're into our 40s

381
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,140
We've seen this before we don't need to make a million dollars tomorrow

382
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,780
We don't need to make a million dollars tomorrow, but we are really tired of spending five or seven years building something

383
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,740
And then it fails and gets canceled out from underneath us or acquired and then somebody, you know tears it apart

384
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,620
Right. I don't want that to be my legacy as a person

385
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,740
When I retire is every project I've ever done has been ripped out from under me and torn apart

386
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,340
I've noticed what seems to be a consistent long-term thinking in a lot of this and a lot of what you communicate

387
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,860
You're currently thinking about like what we're doing today, but you're also thinking about

388
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,700
Where things are going long term and I wonder if is there something particular in your past experience that has

389
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,420
Has really drilled this into we have to be careful when it comes to vc funding and we have to think in a certain way

390
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,260
Is there something that you went through an experience you went through that really codified that?

391
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,460
I mean my first startup of course was was in this category

392
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,020
We absolutely got ourselves into this trouble where we built some really cool technology including that vpn. I mentioned the pre-shuttle one

393
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,420
It also had a bunch of other stuff. We found the traction users were getting excited

394
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,540
We never quite figured out our go-to-market model

395
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,220
So we could sell the product but the expense of having salespeople calling people

396
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
To try to find the ones who were willing to buy it

397
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,620
Was always a little bit higher than the actual revenue we got

398
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,020
From selling the product, right? And this is in the pre-software as a service days

399
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,180
So it was kind of weird back then you would you would sell something once and not a monthly subscription

400
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,740
And that you know the whole mathematical model of that is very different from the monthly sales, right?

401
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,580
So if you have a sales team today each salesperson say can add 50k of arr per month, right?

402
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,540
Then that's great. You you just have this one salesperson and they keep going and the arr keeps going up

403
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,980
And of course, you're going to have churn and so on so sooner or later it maxes out

404
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,460
But you have this really nice model when you have people selling one shot each time

405
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,380
Then your revenue doesn't keep going up over time, right?

406
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,580
The salesperson that you have selling a certain amount per month means you get that much revenue per month

407
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,500
Not that much additional revenue per month. So the models are very different

408
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,540
But back then, you know, we were selling appliances you bought appliances

409
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,060
The device was you know, there was no subscription element to it. And so we got ourselves into this treadmill of

410
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,940
The long-term value of a customer was slightly less than the cost of acquisition of a customer

411
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,620
And eventually we ran out of money related to the dot-com crash and everything else

412
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,460
Or we ran I shouldn't say we ran out

413
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,180
We never actually ran out of money we ran low on money and eventually we had to look for an exit strategy

414
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,180
The exit strategy we find was through acquisition, right? So our investors made their money back

415
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,580
But none of us got super rich from it, right?

416
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,500
And then I worked at google for a while

417
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,620
I don't want to say too much about google because everybody talks about google all the time

418
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,660
But I saw many many projects inside google succeeding and failing for many many different kinds of reasons and I'm extra curious about that stuff

419
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,020
So I talked to a lot of people while I was there to understand what was working in their project and not working in their project

420
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,540
Like there's definitely patterns to the things that work and don't work and a lot of it involves just sort of like

421
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:58,180
I think i'm not i'm not a real sports person, but some people call it like getting ahead of your skis, right when you over invest

422
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,700
money

423
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,820
And start spending faster than you understand the business model

424
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,180
That's when you get yourself on this treadmill and it happens just as much in startups as it does in teams and large companies

425
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,860
Do you feel like larger teams are more susceptible to that problem than smaller teams and smaller companies?

426
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,940
It's not so much about team size about money, right? So the the curse is having too much money

427
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,620
And not having the self-control to know that it's too much money

428
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Back in the old dot-com days people used to say this about amazon losing money on every sale, but making up in volume

429
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,140
Right a lot of startups to this day still try to do that and it still doesn't work

430
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,060
Amazon was not actually doing that amazon was doing something else which is why amazon's so successful

431
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,020
But it kind of looked like that and there were a lot of startups that were doing that at the time

432
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,340
But they still do it now if you have a business model that you can't make money per unit

433
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,780
At small scale, you're definitely not going to make money per unit

434
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
At 10 or 100 times that scale

435
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,220
I want to shift gears but kind of in the whole business model arena tail scale is open source

436
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,140
And most of the times when I talk to ceos

437
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,300
They tell me that they can't open source their software because somebody would just copy it

438
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Stand up a clone and take all of their profits and that doesn't seem to be a concern of yours

439
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,540
I mean, it's a concern it is it's also a backup plan

440
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,340
So like I said, one of my number one concerns is like when I retire I want my stuff to still exist

441
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,020
And one of my favorite things about shuttle, which is actually one of our competitors

442
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,540
Is that no matter how much I lose attention in it, no matter how much money it doesn't make

443
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Shuttle is still around, right?

444
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,660
There's no company that can just disappear and vaporize the software that was attached to it

445
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,900
And I really like that about open source

446
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,340
I think there's a lot of people out there who open source things and that's like at least half the reason they do it

447
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,980
Is so that when the company they're working for goes away or when they leave the company they're working for

448
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,740
They can still have access to all that source code that they wrote is not destroyed, right?

449
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,140
So I have to admit I have an element of that

450
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,020
Like I personally want to make sure this thing can never die and this is one way to do it

451
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,980
That said, it's also beneficial to our customers

452
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,380
First of all, you can get bug fixes and contributions

453
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,500
Secondly, people don't like installing proprietary VPN clients in their Linux machines

454
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,860
Just generally speaking, you've got almost the whole stack you're using in your cloud servers is open source

455
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,060
If you have this one proprietary VPN server, it very much slows down the adoption

456
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,580
And thirdly, we do, there is a component of Tailscale called the control server that we operate that is not open source

457
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,540
Now there is an open source control server called HeadScale

458
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,900
It's not maintained by us, but we contribute to the HeadScale development

459
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,660
We work with the developer and so on

460
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,060
It doesn't have as many features as Tailscale

461
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,140
It doesn't integrate in exactly the same way, but it works with the same Tailscale clients

462
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,700
So people who are really concerned, they want to have a 100% open source system can do that

463
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,820
Yeah, I was going to ask you about HeadScale, so I'm glad you touched on that. Thank you

464
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,140
Looking at Tailscale, I think a lot of people identify it as one of those quintessential

465
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,420
This is how I get my work done now tools and there's others out there

466
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,500
Slack and Dropbox come to mind

467
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,380
Do you watch some of those companies or are there companies that you watch and go, okay, we're not going to do that

468
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,140
What are you looking for not doing?

469
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,460
I'm curious as a customer, what are you not going to do?

470
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,820
That's an interesting question

471
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,100
In the case of Slack, I really like the way they've done their business model

472
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,900
The way they did their authentication was a series of missteps that I think they're finally getting to

473
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,460
Correcting many years into their existence

474
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,500
So we're probably not going to copy the way Slack did authentication

475
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,660
But I really love their business model, the way that individuals in a company can adopt Slack

476
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,980
They don't even need to necessarily know that other individuals in the same company are adopting Slack

477
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,300
In different Slack instances

478
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,220
And then at some point, you can group all those instances together and say, okay, we're all using Slack here at this company

479
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,500
Why don't we get by a company subscription and get a discount?

480
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,580
That is a really nice business model

481
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:50,500
That's something that in the security world and infrastructure, which is where Tailscale finds itself

482
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,780
You almost never see that

483
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,580
There's almost no such thing as a security product that is adopted in this bottom up way

484
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,260
And the reason for that is pretty simple

485
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,340
It's that security products almost never solve the problem you have right now

486
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,140
If you're a software developer, you're trying to get something done

487
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,660
The only thing a security product tends to do is stop you from getting that thing done

488
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,420
That's the job of a security product

489
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,620
So it tends to be enforced top down by the CISO saying, look, I know you guys have a lot of work to do

490
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,660
But could you please not do these five things that are horrific security holes that are going to get us in trouble?

491
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,340
And then they slow you down

492
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:28,100
Tailscale has this nice model where it comes in as an infrastructure tool, a problem solving tool

493
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,420
And then coincidentally on the side, it's also really secure

494
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,660
So the default thing you do with Tailscale is way better than the default thing you would have done otherwise

495
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,500
So the security people who are in charge find out you're using Tailscale

496
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,740
And instead of saying, oh, no, no, please stop doing that

497
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,340
They're like, oh, thank goodness you stopped doing that thing you were doing before

498
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,820
Let's maybe formalize this Tailscale thing a bit

499
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,860
It makes sense

500
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,740
It does definitely feel like a bottom up tool that people are discovering and just falling in love with

501
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,420
I'd like to kind of wrap it up by just kind of getting your thoughts on sort of the state of the tech ecosystem

502
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,220
You know, you look out there, we have some major, major tech companies

503
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,300
And it feels like eventually if you're playing on their platforms, you get their attention

504
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,580
And I'm wondering if that's on your radar at all as far as maybe Apple goes or Microsoft or Google goes

505
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,460
Have you shown up on their radar yet? Have you had conversations with them?

506
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,180
Are you concerned at all about them influencing or trying to influence the direction of features on the mobile app or something to that regard?

507
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,700
I mean, we've had interactions with pretty much all of them

508
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,100
I would say that in general, they're all pretty happy that we exist

509
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,260
We're not hurting anybody's platform by creating this functionality

510
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,700
There's no like embrace and extend model for them

511
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,100
Because I mean, if you imagine Apple, for example, there actually was a Tailscale like product that Apple launched quite a few years ago now

512
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,140
Quite a few years ago now called Back to my Mac, right?

513
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,580
It did almost that exact same thing, except it only worked on Apple products, right?

514
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,980
Which sounds neat, but almost never solves your problem, right?

515
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,740
And similarly, Microsoft, I just found out yesterday there was a product called Windows Mesh, I think

516
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,980
Came out apparently with Windows 7 or near the time of Windows 7 that did similar things to Tailscale

517
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,740
But it only worked on Windows

518
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:15,380
Tailscale has a feature called Taildrop, which is a lot like AirDrop that Apple has that lets you move files between your devices

519
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,500
Except Tailscale's one works on all your kinds of devices and it doesn't care about physical proximity

520
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:26,740
Apple's AirDrop only works on Apple devices and even then only sometimes and nobody's quite sure why it doesn't always work, right?

521
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:34,100
And AWS, for example, they've got an AWS VPN, they've got VPCs, they've got IPSec connections, but it only works inside AWS

522
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,500
So if AWS was going to try to make a Tailscale, it might not make it easy to connect to other kinds of clouds

523
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,180
Because they really have no incentive to make it easy to connect to other kinds of clouds, right?

524
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,820
But if Tailscale is sitting out here independently making all these things work

525
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,700
Then it actually makes it easier for you to use AWS, easier for you to use Windows, easier for you to use Linux

526
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,260
And easier for you to use Apple, it connects all these things together, it makes all these platforms better, right?

527
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:05,700
So we don't see a lot of interference from the platform owners because we're not really hurting their business at all

528
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,860
We're just making it so that their thing works better with everybody else's things

529
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,340
Yeah, really, it makes it so I can get more work done on their devices, it's what it does

530
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,620
Exactly

531
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,700
Well, Avery, I'm just a huge fan, so thank you very much for all of the hard work

532
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,380
And of course for everyone there at the team and thanks so much for coming on and chatting with us

533
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,140
Yeah, thank you

534
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:34,340
I really enjoyed that chat with Avery, it's not many founders I can sit down and talk everything from TCPIP to big tech economics

535
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,140
So that was really great, and again if you want to sign up, that wasn't sponsored, that wasn't paid for

536
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,660
But if you want to support one of our shows, tailscale.com slash self-hosted or tailscale.com slash coder

537
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:52,980
The whole idea of mesh VPNs that can defeat double NAT, carrier grade networking has been a topic on this show for a long time

538
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:00,500
And when we were in Raleigh, I was kind of leaning over to Brent and I was saying, you know, you got to try this tailscale thing out

539
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:08,820
I think you would really like it specifically because you do kind of travel around and you've kind of got places you visit frequently now

540
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,180
Tailscale feels like it could be a good solution for you, and I know you didn't get a chance to try it out while I was there

541
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,940
But I think you have since then, so what is like the, I don't know, let's say the Brent review of tailscale, what are your thoughts?

542
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:33,300
Well I got to say I'm relatively new to it, it's been maybe a week that I've been into it, and maybe a day since I've really dove into it on my own systems here

543
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,580
But whenever you nudge me towards something I know I need to be listening, and so thank you for that

544
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:45,140
I have in the past, you know, with travel in mind, set up a WireGuard exit node

545
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:52,820
So I have a little VPS somewhere that just purely accepts my connections wherever I happen to be, that makes me feel a little bit better

546
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:59,700
Because there are certain places that I go with my laptop that I don't feel like open traffic is necessarily a good thing

547
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:09,140
But that being said, now I have access to a VM that Alex set up for me where I've been doing some Ansible playing with

548
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:23,380
And I guess I also have a Bitcoin node sitting over there that I can access from here now, and so the more I dive into it, the more I realize it's solving a lot of my various issues that I have had in the past

549
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:32,340
And have found solutions that were a bit annoying, but also solutions for problems that I've had that I haven't had a solution for yet

550
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:44,660
So I know, Chris, you use it a whole bunch, but I'm like tingling with excitement now of diving into Tailscale and really getting a sense of how it can just make things easy and seamless for me

551
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:57,700
For me, the progression was, at first, for like a month or two, I set it up and I was like, oh yeah, finally I can connect my RV server systems and the studio systems all on one flat network

552
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:10,740
That was a huge thing for me, because until Tailscale, I never opened up the RV's network to the internet, and there's a ton of dashboards and control panels and statistics and data that the system in the RV is collecting all the time

553
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,780
And sometimes I'm at the studio and I want to check in on that stuff

554
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:22,180
So that was the first problem I solved, because it takes 30 seconds to get it installed on a Linux box, if that, and they have Raspberry Pi packages and stuff

555
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,100
So I was like, all right, this is great, yeah, okay, sweet, I got a VPN, all right

556
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
I didn't really get hyped about it

557
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:36,900
I don't know why it took me like three months, so you're way ahead of me, dude, until I realized I could install it in a VM

558
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:43,060
And I had several VMs and projects, like a lot of the Nix stuff, the Nix challenge stuff I was doing in VMs

559
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:56,900
And it dawned on me that, wait a minute, I could set up a Nix VM, install Tailscale, which is awesome on Nix, and then I could access this VM from literally all my machines, like it's right here

560
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:03,460
And I could continue the Nix challenge from anywhere, which was great because we were traveling to North Carolina and all of that

561
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,820
And that's when I realized, oh, wait a minute, I actually could run it in this container

562
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:16,420
Oh, and look at this, Umbral has a Tailscale app that runs in Docker, and now I can get access to my Bitcoin, and it just

563
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,620
That is cool

564
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:25,460
Yeah, that's when it clicked, when I was like, oh, I could do it in VMs, I can do it in containers, and I can do it on my physical devices, including my mobile devices

565
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:33,540
And so I just sort of built out a bigger and bigger network, and then it kind of clicked, oh, I can also, you know, support my kids' computers this way

566
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,780
So I really like it, I've probably crossed over where I have more systems using Tailscale than Nebula

567
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:47,220
Nebula is great because there's like no centralized service, there's nobody getting involved, but it's a lot more of a bring up

568
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,220
So it just didn't quite hit the sweet spot for my, like my laptop and my phone and my Raspberry Pi

569
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:59,620
But it was, it seemed like a really sweet spot for the VPS and the servers on the studio LAN

570
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:06,420
But now Tailscale I think has kind of eclipsed some of that too, and it has some really nice DNS stuff, you can actually, if you wanted to, do an easy mode

571
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:15,780
You can put a Pi-hole in your Tailscale network, and it will start resolving DNS for all of your machines on Tailscale

572
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,020
So you can start referring to all your machines by machine name

573
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,300
That is very cool

574
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,820
Yeah, I like it, it's also been really handy while I'm on the road again, every freaking time I'm on the road

575
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,900
That's how I, a lot of the boosts and feedback, I do all of that through a VPN

576
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,660
It's really nice to be able to just have that right there

577
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,900
So it's a, it's a hell of a thing

578
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,860
I'm really impressed with the service and that's why I was hoping to get some insights into how the heck they're going to keep it running

579
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:50,900
And the thing that he touched on in there that I liked is they've set it up in a way where the free accounts don't compete with the paid pro users

580
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:59,220
Which is always like this collision that it seems like all of these services that offer a free version are always heading towards this iceberg

581
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:05,140
Where inevitably the sales team feels like the free accounts are competing with their benchmarks

582
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,380
And you know, we end up, you always see like the free stuff getting cut back

583
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,180
And the idea that they've kind of designed it in a way where that doesn't happen

584
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,340
I feel like that shows some really good long-time thinking, long-term thinking

585
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,220
So it was nice to see that

586
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,220
Like I said, I'm relatively new so I've been diving into some of their documentation

587
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:29,060
Just to get a sense of how it all works and what I could possibly do with it

588
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,420
And I found their documentation to actually be really, really great and also fascinating

589
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,580
Which I don't say very often about documentation

590
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,380
It's, it's slightly, I'll say it's ever so slightly confusing

591
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,380
They have a section for documentation which I think is a little bit more on the technical

592
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,700
It's a simple explainer of the technical side of things which I found very, very helpful

593
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,620
So getting DNS set up for your whole network and those kind of useful tips

594
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,500
But they also have sections that I would encourage people to just go browse

595
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,780
One of them is called the Tailscale Guides and the other is Tailscale Solutions

596
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,140
I don't quite know the difference between them

597
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,140
They seem very similar but there's some amazingly fascinating stuff in there

598
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,780
So they have a guide on like accessing a Pi Hole or Raspberry Pi from anywhere

599
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,900
Which I think is a really nice place to start maybe if you are trying to play with this

600
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,260
But they also have, you know, a guide on Tailscale and NixOS

601
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,820
A new Minecraft server in 10 minutes which sounds really fun

602
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,740
Tailscale in LXC containers

603
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,500
I know we talked about that a little bit last week

604
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,860
So that might be a place to go if people are interested

605
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,180
And the last one that really caught my eye was setting up a dog cam

606
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,020
With Tailscale Raspberry Pi in motion

607
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,100
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

608
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,980
Get started with a free trial of Teams or Enterprise

609
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,140
Or for an individual when you go to bitwarden.com slash Linux

610
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:03,300
Simply put, it's the easiest way for individuals or businesses to store, share, and sync sensitive data

611
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,220
Bitwarden is fully customizable

612
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,780
You can turn certain features off that you don't want

613
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,540
And of course it's what I use for my password and secret information storing

614
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,660
And I'll also add my two-factor authentication token

615
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,420
I put it all in one package

616
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,220
And man is that handy when I'm traveling

617
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,820
Oh my gosh, you guys

618
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,100
I won't name names

619
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,620
But some of my friends out there, they don't use Bitwarden

620
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,820
And I have been on a campaign to convert them

621
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:34,980
Because it is painful when I sit down and watch them try to log in on some service

622
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,900
When they don't have a password manager

623
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,260
Like maybe they set up a new box

624
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,140
Or maybe they're using a system in the studio temporarily

625
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,060
Oh my god, it's painful

626
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,220
Bitwarden makes it so much simpler

627
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,900
They make it easy and safe to store sensitive data

628
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,220
For yourself or when you're working with a team

629
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,180
Wes and I use it to manage our passwords and two-factor codes

630
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,580
And other sensitive data all the time

631
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,260
I use it to work with team members

632
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,500
And I really think it'd be great for open source projects too

633
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,300
And one of the things they've just recently added which is brilliant is a username generator

634
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,740
Stop using the same username at every site you go to

635
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,740
I never really thought about it

636
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,860
But that's crazy

637
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,660
Anything you can do to improve your security online is going to be good, right?

638
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,140
But like I'd say number one is passwords

639
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,660
And number two, I never really thought about it

640
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,100
But of course it's usernames

641
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,260
Because if a service is compromised and their database leaks

642
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,300
Then that username is going to be the same username across multiple sites

643
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,540
At least it is for me, I'm embarrassed to say it's true

644
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,940
So having a different username for each website you use

645
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,180
That's going to make it difficult

646
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,100
I'd say impossible for a hacker and attacker to track you across sites

647
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,220
And of course their generator supports your email service

648
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,780
If it has like the plus addition for an email

649
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,220
So like Gmail for example

650
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,660
User plus your actual like fake thing at gmail.com or whatever

651
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,500
It's really nice

652
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,340
And it's so intuitive the way they do it

653
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,940
Because it all just stores in Bitwarden

654
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,260
Then when I try to log into a service on my phone

655
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,500
I have a nice secure password for that too

656
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,140
And I'll admit before they got really good password management on the phones

657
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,420
This just wasn't a great option

658
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,780
And Bitwarden nails it

659
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,940
And then on the iPhone it ties in with face ID

660
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,980
So it's scanning my face

661
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,260
It's importing the password I mean it just happens so smooth so flawlessly

662
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:12,740
I love it

663
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,980
And like I say when I'm traveling tools like this

664
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,660
I don't know I don't know how I got work done without them

665
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,140
Something like Bitwarden it's the only way I'm going to go

666
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,340
And I love that it's open source

667
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,940
And I love that they have a self-hosted option

668
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,700
And I love that they got a giant community

669
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,300
Go try it out for yourself

670
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,740
Or maybe recommend it to a friend and family member like I've been doing recently

671
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,260
Or maybe it's time for your workplace to kind of get their act together in this regard

672
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,180
No shame in that game

673
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,020
It's just you know the way things have been in the past

674
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,300
But now Bitwarden is changing it and they've got great team plans too

675
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,140
Individual or team go try it out right now

676
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,060
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

677
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,180
Go to Bitwarden.com slash Linux to support the show

678
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,980
And to get started with the best password management

679
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,420
And I'll say it my personal way to keep all my secrets

680
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,180
What's in there?

681
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,100
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

682
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,780
We got some great feedback again this week

683
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,900
Thank you everyone

684
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,700

685
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,140
I was just listening to episode 457

686
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,460
I'm a heavy user of Ansible and LXD

687
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,860
And thought I'd share a couple of useful tips

688
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,620
One is the ability to use LXD to manage hosts with Ansible

689
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,980
No SSH required

690
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,180
If you configure a local LXD client to connect to a remote LXD server

691
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,620
You can specify the name of the host and containers in your inventory

692
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,380
And configure the Ansible host variable as follows

693
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,740
He gives an example we'll include

694
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,580
I think that's kind of neat

695
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,340
I know Alex got real excited about that

696
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,620
So that's sort of fun

697
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,580
They continue

698
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,300
I know you folks are also Bitwarden users

699
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,460
Rather than store secrets in multiple places and use Ansible vaults

700
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,940
I found a plugin that lets you use the Bitwarden command line client

701
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,460
To retrieve Ansible secrets

702
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,100
So we'll leave a link to that

703
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,820
That is awesome

704
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,820
I didn't really even think of that

705
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,700
It's so great

706
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,540
Why not use Bitwarden for the secrets?

707
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,660
You know what he touches on here

708
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,540
About being able to deploy a LXD container or a server

709
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,260
With just like a couple of things that you specify

710
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,380
And then Ansible does the rest

711
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,980
I do really appreciate that when we did the NixOS challenge

712
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,620
We did a bit of a comparison between Ansible and Nix

713
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,460
And that's sort of what's brought up all this Ansible feedback

714
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,940
And it wasn't really a fair comparison

715
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,780
Because the Nix system lets you manage the Nix package and the NixOS possibly

716
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,340
But you could run the Nix package manager on just about any distro

717
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,380
And it lets you manage that world, right?

718
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:35,780
Where Ansible is like multi OS, multi distro, multi container platforms, right?

719
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,980
And so that's the big difference

720
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,060
Now, I think there is a totally valid argument for only needing to learn a Nix system

721
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,420
If that's the scope of your work

722
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,100
But I think it's also really valid to say, you know, there's a lot more I want to get done

723
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,100
And so Ansible is the way for me

724
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,540
And I totally appreciate that

725
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,860
And I feel like I've gotten a whole new set of insights on how people use these tools accidentally

726
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,860
Like we just stumbled into this

727
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,940
And I'm learning a lot

728
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,700
So I guess that's a good thing, right?

729
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,580
So yeah, and I think that's the really the beauty of some of the feedback we keep getting

730
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,740
We're in a position where people just giving us

731
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,100
Keep giving us some great tips on things we didn't know we needed

732
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,140
And turns out we do

733
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,740
And now it is time for Le Boost

734
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,140
As always, we get some great boosts as well

735
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,060
SirLurksalot is back

736
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,780
1337SATS seems oddly specific

737
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,540
Feather for the tinfoil hat, if you will

738
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,900
Starlink knows where you are

739
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,300
Even if you bug out in the middle of nowhere

740
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,420
Considering how Elon's car company collects an enormous amount of data about its customers

741
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,460
You have to at least wonder how that data is being used

742
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,340
Or sold

743
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,380
Or in what form

744
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,140
Who actually has access

745
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:48,500
And how securely it really is in the hands of yet another tech company that dabbles in hardware

746
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,900
Are your internet habits and travels valuable to hacker loot?

747
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,540
Hmm, maybe some bacon here, Chris

748
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Oh, man

749
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:04,340
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about the fact that now there's one more company that's tracking my exact location

750
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:09,380
And they do, you know, they have to know where the dish is in order for it to connect to the satellites up in space

751
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,420
And the dish is always aware of its longitude and latitude

752
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,620
And I must have GPS in there too

753
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,460
You know, it's such a trade-off

754
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,140
I don't know why, but I probably am more comfortable with Starlink than I am

755
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,700
Verizon or AT&T or T-Mobile

756
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,820
I feel like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile probably have like an automated system

757
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,940
That law enforcement can just check a box and get your location info for like the last year

758
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,540
Maybe Starlink will do the same

759
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:42,580
But it's the trade-off of getting connected to the worldwide community, right?

760
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,140
How else can you get connected to an internet like that

761
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,900
Without some trace unless you use someone else's system

762
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:54,660
And JOOPS does have, on the roof, I have a 7-in-1 antenna array

763
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,140
And a couple of those antennas are dedicated to 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi

764
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,340
I can pick up Wi-Fi from quite a range

765
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,420
So every now and then there is, I do have the capability of doing like some sneaky network joining

766
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,660
Careful of what you admit to here

767
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,580
I know, I'm sort of realizing right now

768
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,940
But, you know, when you're out in the middle of nowhere and you have to bring your own internet

769
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,380
Yeah, that would be a problem

770
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,420
Boost to graph

771
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,580
Marcel wrote in with a thousand sats

772
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,900
So when does the Star Trek podcast come out?

773
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
I'm kidding, of course, but I would definitely listen to that

774
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,260
You seem very passionate about it

775
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,620
I just finished Enterprise and I have mixed feelings

776
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,580
On the pre-show for the member feed, I think we got into Star Trek again, didn't we?

777
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,100
I think it was all Coder Radio's fault

778
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,780
It happens from time to time, we get up

779
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,300
With age does come some wisdom

780
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,620
And I have realized that there are some hobbies and passions that I have

781
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,380
That I shouldn't make content out of

782
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,340
And I should keep them for myself to enjoy

783
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,100
And I've decided that Star Trek is one of those things

784
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,300
And I have dabbled in the past with Star Trek related content

785
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:06,020
And I have found that Jupiter broadcasting is its strongest when we really stay on mission and focused

786
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,820
And so that gives me an opportunity

787
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,340
That is an excuse to just keep Star Trek for something I personally enjoy

788
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,620
However, I do love a good Star Trek conversation

789
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,900
And I will always jump in if something's going down on stream related to Star Trek

790
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,460
And I would love to, like, if one of my friends out there starts a Star Trek podcast

791
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,540
I'd love to join them for an episode sometime

792
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,140
Because, yeah, I'm a bit of a fiend when it comes to Star Trek

793
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,780
But I don't plan to launch a Star Trek show

794
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,460
I think I'll leave that out for all the other folks out there that want to make podcasts around it

795
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,620
We got several just like thanks for doing a show, Boose

796
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,340
These are great too

797
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:45,860
We got a couple from Crashmaster18 and Winebearer in a total of about 6,000 SATs

798
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,540
They just sent in some thank yous

799
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,380
So I just want to say thank you guys for boosting

800
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,260
We also got some folks that are doing the SAT streaming

801
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,300
So you can set an amount and while you listen, it'll stream a SAT every now and then back to us

802
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,460
And the great news is that with the price of Bitcoin down, SATs are on sale

803
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,100
They're the same SATs, one SAT still equals one SAT

804
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,620
So get them cheap while you can right now

805
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,340
I'll probably be on sale for a little while as the market's going to just be in the tank

806
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,020
So go get some cheap SATs and load up a podcasting 2.0 app

807
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,740
You can get them at newpodcastapps.com

808
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,100
Podcasting 2.0 has a lot going on

809
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:30,180
Including they're working right now very diligently on incorporating live audio streaming into the app

810
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,020
So you just open up your podcast app

811
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,780
And if Linux Unplugged is live, it'll just show as in your feed list, it's live on air

812
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:43,780
And you can tap it and you can listen to our live stream in your podcasting 2.0 compatible app

813
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,820
Not all apps support it yet

814
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,060
Like I don't think Fountain or Castamatic do

815
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,420
But some of the web apps, there's some really good web podcasting apps, by the way

816
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:50,900
Who knew?

817
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,860
Podverse is great because it's a web app that syncs to a mobile client as well

818
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,260
All of these are listed at newpodcastapps.com

819
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,220
But I can't wait for live streaming and transcription and a whole bunch of other stuff

820
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,380
That's all part of the podcasting 2.0 spec along with the value block

821
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,420
You can check out a lot of all that info in Office Hours

822
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:15,140
We covered a bunch of it last week at officehours.hair for that

823
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,020
And go try out a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

824
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,260
And if you don't want a new podcast app, because I know a lot of you love AntennaPod

825
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,700
That's very popular in our community

826
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,580
So is Overcast on the iOS side

827
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,860
And actually Apple Podcast app is always a strong contender

828
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,980
And Pocket Cast, of course

829
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,820
I know you guys love those apps and you don't want to change

830
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,860
Go try Breeze

831
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,860
You can send in some boosts via the Breeze app and you don't have to switch podcast apps

832
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,300
That's pretty, pretty nice

833
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,980
Guess what?

834
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,700
We got a pick

835
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,980
And it's on theme

836
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,820
Like, I likes it

837
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,820
Brandon, how do you think you pronounce this one?

838
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,100
Oh, I think I got this one

839
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,820
You do?

840
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:53,780
Oh yeah, go for it

841
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,780
I think it's called We're On

842
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,020
Ah, yeah, yeah, like we are on

843
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,660
Right, you see that?

844
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,860
Yeah, we're on

845
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,460
I think you nailed it

846
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:08,500
So this is a secure overlay network based on WebRTC

847
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,620
That is interesting

848
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,140
Yeah, this is weird

849
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,580
But it's on theme for this episode

850
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,020
Wes found this actually

851
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,540
So it's a shame he can't be here

852
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,820
So maybe if we ever give this a go with him, we'll bring it up again

853
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,740
Because I think he actually wanted to talk about it

854
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,740
But the idea is with We're On is that it gives you access to nodes behind a firewall, behind an ad

855
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,900
Using WebRC to establish the connection between the nodes

856
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,780
And actually this stuff has been built into WebRTC all the time

857
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,020
And nobody ever built the tooling around it

858
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:46,100
And it always drove me crazy because we basically use WebRTC now for video calls and audio calls

859
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,620
And that's really where we stopped

860
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,100
But it could, you know, you can actually build a freaking CDN on top of WebRTC

861
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:57,300
So they're using the underlying suite of tools that are available for this

862
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,940
And the project claims it's pretty low overhead and it's pretty surprisingly good performance

863
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,740
That's ridiculous

864
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,780
If you use it between nodes on a LAN, they say, you may not even notice a performance overhead

865
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,620
Which is just wild

866
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,140
I don't know, man

867
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,340
I don't know

868
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,380
But it's actually pretty easy to get up and going on a Linux box

869
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,700
You basically can just pull down a binary and get it up and going

870
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,020
So we'll put a link in the show notes to We're On

871
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,060
And I could see someone who wants a temporary mesh network

872
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,780
You know, maybe it's up for the day or maybe it's up for an event

873
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,900
I could totally see that

874
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,700
Oh, yeah

875
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:33,940
Right

876
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,700
You're doing a corporate event or a Linux event and you want to build a temporary mesh network

877
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,780
You don't necessarily want to assign to anyone's particular account or anything like that

878
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,420
You could use We're On to stand that thing up in five minutes

879
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,580
And now you got yourself an overlay network

880
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,100
All running off of WebRTC, which everybody has support for on their box

881
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,820
Not really something we need because we're pretty much set

882
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,660
But gosh, you could see that

883
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,180
You never know

884
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,380
That's it

885
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,780
That's it

886
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,580
We're wrapping it up

887
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,460
I just want to make a mention that we do this show live on Sunday

888
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,100
Even if that means I got to set up some sort of hack together

889
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,300
Set up run over cellular from Southern Oregon

890
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,260
We're doing it live

891
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,620
And that means that we get great folks like Christian from Red Hat that stopped by

892
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,260
And if you're in our if you're in our Mumble Room

893
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,460
And you got a question about this Nvidia open source driver

894
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,060
You can ask one of the guys that has the most knowledge about the situation directly

895
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,420
That's a unique opportunity

896
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,980
And it happens right here on Linux Unplugged

897
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,620
But also hanging out live just lets you listen in real time

898
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,300
Give us feedback in the chat room

899
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,980
And if you get Mumble, you can actually just hang out in the quiet listening room

900
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,180
Then you get an Opus codec quality of the show

901
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:39,940
With probably lower latency than Brent and I have between each other right now

902
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,500
It's great and it's a totally free software stack

903
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,540
And then you got it

904
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,700
You can join us and you can do things like office hours

905
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,940
Which we also do on Mumble and other network shows that use Mumble from time to time

906
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,860
And if you're in the tech industry or you're just curious about what's going on in the world

907
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,300
Of free software and open source

908
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,260
Don't miss an episode of Linux Action News

909
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,620
LinuxActionNews.com

910
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,260
Christian worked with us to make sure that we had the most accurate information possible

911
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,940
So literally the moment the Nvidia news dropped

912
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,420
Linux Action News dropped

913
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,380
So that way you could have the context and the information first

914
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,260
And you could make sure that you were commenting

915
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,580
Or if you were saying something online, it was accurate, right?

916
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,220
I mean, you see a lot of people just popping off with their opinion

917
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,340
But JB listeners got the facts

918
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,660
Just by being subscribed to Linux Action News

919
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,220
So it's something to consider because when something goes down

920
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,340
We're going to try to cover it there as accurately and as fast as possible

921
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,740
So LinuxActionNews.com

922
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,020
Big plug for that, I guess

923
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,980
Hope to see you next week

924
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,580
Join us, we'll be live on a Sunday

925
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:44,820
But of course, you is always, always welcome to subscribe

926
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,900
Enjoy the show any way you want

927
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,980
Live is just one of the options

928
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,860
And of course, we appreciate any value you can return to the show

929
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,580
Maybe it's a membership at Linux Unplugged Core

930
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,180
Maybe it's jupyter.party for the whole network

931
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,540
Maybe it's a boost

932
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,860
Or maybe it's just telling someone about the show

933
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,220
That matters a lot too

934
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,420
Maybe it's a review, I don't know

935
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,180
I don't know you

936
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,180
I can't tell you what

937
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,300
But we appreciate you listening

938
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,940
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

939
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:37,860
And we'll see you right back here next week

940
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:57,700
So obviously to make it clear

941
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,540
Because I was not sure that no Nvidia driver for the future

942
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:08,340
Is only possible with the right current version of the Nvidia GPUs

943
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,340
And the future GPU cards

944
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,980
And it is not possible to use that one with the 1060 for example, right?

945
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,340
No, not with 1060

946
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,780
Wow, is the 1060 that old?

947
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,940
Wow, yeah, it looks like

948
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,220
Yeah, but in fact, so it could be that

949
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,140
If for the 1060 a working row driver is running

950
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,220
Then somehow we could profit from that new initiative, right?

951
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,420
Maybe

952
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,980
Yeah, maybe

953
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,500
I'm not sure

954
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,620
Because I mean, once again, right

955
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,260
The driver consists of multiple parts, right?

956
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,580
This is a current driver and then there's a user space with Mesa

957
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,700
And then there's also the firmware

958
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,100
And we need all three of them to be able to work together

959
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:48,260
And I don't think the firmware can work with the such old cards

960
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,580
The other thing I had just because it comes in my mind now

961
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,980
And the firmware, if I understood it well

962
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,940
Before, all right, the firmware actually has some shared code

963
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,500
That is also used on Windows, right?

964
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:08,980
So the Linux and Windows driver with the firmware share some code, right?

965
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,060
I usually get someone from NVIDIA to go on details there

966
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,860
I mean, another driver in general is shared between Windows and Linux

967
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,220
And if there is exactly the same firmware, I think it is

968
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,700
But I don't know, between Windows and Linux systems

969
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,180
I mean, they try to, I mean, of course

970
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:28,180
For ease of maintenance to keep things as aligned as possible between the two

971
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,140
Here's what I'm wondering

972
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,660
And this is, we'll just see and it's gonna depend on developer resources

973
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:37,300
But imagine we're four or five years into this, right?

974
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,820
So we've all been using an open source NVIDIA driver for a while

975
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,340
We've got the open source AMD driver

976
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,180
We've got the open source Intel driver

977
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:51,220
Do we start to see one common interface to start to change some of these settings

978
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:56,420
Or whatever is maybe gets exposed that in the past required an AMD control panel

979
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,940
And an NVIDIA control panel

980
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,700
Like, do we start to see maybe some basic settings

981
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,420
Just get baked into the plasma desktop or GNOME desktop

982
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,620
And on the back end, they're figuring out if that's for an NVIDIA card or an AMD card

983
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,380
Like, it feels like the integration and control that could eventually come to the desktop

984
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,460
Is going to be at a whole new level

985
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,660
When all of the major video card drivers are open source

986
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,700
Yeah, I think my thoughts around there is that, you know

987
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,420
They are continuously expanding, you know, what Wokid can do

988
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,420
So, I mean, you know, I mentioned this to you afterwards over interview

989
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,580
But I'm really excited by the fact that, you know

990
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:39,300
There is Vulkan extensions coming out to do H.264, H.265 and VC1 encoding and decoding now

991
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,700
Which means that instead of, you know, up to this point having to deal with like, you know

992
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,260
Special encoding library for NVIDIA

993
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,380
Special encoding library for Intel and so on

994
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,020
We can now, as application writers, right

995
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,460
Have one API we target and we will get GPU accelerated encoding and decoding

996
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,380
So this is something I'm really excited about

997
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,980
And I think, you know, I think we'll see a lot more things moving into Vulkan over time

998
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:07,060
Because I think they're definitely going to go on beyond maybe, you know

999
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,780
Well, as we see with the video, just doing 3D graphics

1000
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,740
Christian, as a last question, I'm curious about

1001
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:17,860
What was your personal favorite part about working on this initiative for you personally?

1002
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,180
Well, the main thing, of course, is that I know that for Fedora users

1003
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,100
And RAL users too, of course

1004
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,340
But it's been a pain point for years to have to then deal with going out

1005
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:32,340
Or first realizing, oh, okay, I need a driver for my hardware

1006
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,900
Because I think on Linux people sort of assume everything is just there

1007
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,900
And then maybe not finding it or maybe they found the wrong version

1008
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,620
Or they found a version that was harder to set up

1009
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,980
I mean, I know a lot of people, of course

1010
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,580
Ended up getting the upstream NVIDIA driver, which they then have to build themselves

1011
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,500
And, of course, I did that myself back in the day

1012
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,260
And it was, you know, a great learning experience

1013
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,660
But, you know, it would have been a lot easier for people to, for instance,

1014
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:58,580
Have found the repository of RPN Fusion to just get it pre-set up for them very easily

1015
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,900
So I think just being able to get beyond that and sort of say, yep, graphics is not going to be

1016
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,700
Something where I, you know, have to read a review for a new Fedora release

1017
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,220
And people saying, oh, this broke

1018
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,060
That's the big thing for me

1019
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:14,740
Oh, I can't wait
