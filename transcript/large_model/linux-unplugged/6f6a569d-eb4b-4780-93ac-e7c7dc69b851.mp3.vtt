WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.020
How about we start things off with a little good news?

00:02.020 --> 00:03.940
This is something you don't hear too often.

00:03.940 --> 00:07.820
It turns out there could be way more free books

00:07.820 --> 00:09.140
than we realized.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.500
Millions of books may have been in public domain

00:12.500 --> 00:15.700
for a long time, and just nobody ever checked.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.200
Yeah, right.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.980
So I guess prior to 1964, books had a 28-year copyright term.

00:20.980 --> 00:24.140
But to extend it, you actually had to send in a separate form.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.820
And of course, with no internet, no easy way to do that,

00:27.820 --> 00:28.980
are you really going to?

00:28.980 --> 00:29.980
Who has the time?

00:29.980 --> 00:31.660
Turns out not that many people.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.620
Thankfully, the New York Public Library

00:33.620 --> 00:35.460
has done a whole bunch of work to go find out

00:35.460 --> 00:37.260
which of these books are out there,

00:37.260 --> 00:39.220
and now you can download them online.

00:39.220 --> 00:41.380
Yeah, you can search the whole thing.

00:41.380 --> 00:45.100
There's literally millions from 1923 to 1964

00:45.100 --> 00:46.780
that are now in public domain.

00:46.780 --> 00:51.780
I bet we will discover in a few weeks some great old books

00:51.780 --> 00:53.000
about computers.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.700
I think it's great to be aware of these things, too, right?

00:54.700 --> 00:56.600
Because that's part of how this should work.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.660
After a time, it should be part of the commons,

00:58.660 --> 01:01.180
and we can all learn from, use, sample, whatever.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.100
I love free books.

01:02.100 --> 01:02.900
This is great.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.640
One challenge I have with that is that there's literally

01:04.640 --> 01:05.420
millions of books.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.300
So how do you know which one to start with?

01:07.300 --> 01:09.580
Or how to, you know, it's just like a giant dump.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.180
So is there anybody curating?

01:12.180 --> 01:14.460
I think in a few weeks, you'll start seeing that.

01:14.460 --> 01:17.080
You'll see people that are adventurous,

01:17.080 --> 01:18.340
and they go look it up.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.580
And they find some historical person

01:20.580 --> 01:22.500
from different industries.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.300
I bet there'll be books about photography.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.740
There'll be books about computers.

01:25.740 --> 01:29.300
There'll be about the, you know, very fundamentals from back then

01:29.300 --> 01:30.660
that we take for granted now.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.140
I actually, I'm willing to bet in a few weeks, maybe

01:33.140 --> 01:35.500
a few months, maybe even a year or two,

01:35.500 --> 01:38.020
things will surface that are absolutely fascinating.

01:38.020 --> 01:40.620
Yeah, I find this also very dangerous because I remember

01:40.620 --> 01:42.900
spending a week just going through Project Gutenberg

01:42.900 --> 01:45.620
trying to see which books were worthy of my time.

01:45.620 --> 01:46.180
Oh, yeah.

01:46.180 --> 01:48.620
It's going to be a rabbit hole, a big old rabbit hole.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.460
Bring it on.

01:49.460 --> 02:01.620
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 313.

02:01.620 --> 02:02.340
My name is Chris.

02:02.340 --> 02:03.220
My name is Wes.

02:03.220 --> 02:03.980
Hey there, Wes.

02:03.980 --> 02:04.700
Hello.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.940
Guess what?

02:05.940 --> 02:07.420
I'm very excited about today's show.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.220
Huge show.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.060
You know, it happens sometimes.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.780
This was going to be the episode, though,

02:11.780 --> 02:13.260
that I was really dreading.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.300
Oh, yeah.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.020
Oh, I could tell.

02:15.020 --> 02:17.500
Yeah, we had to put in a little extra effort,

02:17.500 --> 02:19.620
but we got something really special out of this week's

02:19.620 --> 02:22.380
episode, so I'm pretty happy we did it.

02:22.380 --> 02:25.740
And I mean, how often can I say this?

02:25.740 --> 02:28.780
We're going to do things differently from here on out

02:28.780 --> 02:30.260
after this episode.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.220
How about that?

02:31.220 --> 02:31.820
How about that?

02:31.820 --> 02:32.660
I'm excited.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.020
Mr. Cheese Bacon is here, too.

02:34.020 --> 02:34.540
Hey, Cheesy.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.740
Hey, what's going on, guys?

02:35.740 --> 02:37.620
Oh, you know, doing a podcast.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.060
Other than that, not much.

02:39.060 --> 02:39.580
Pretty good.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.260
Nice.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.620
Yeah, you know, podcast is life.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.940
And of course, our virtual lug is here.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.740
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:46.740 --> 02:47.860
Hello.

02:47.860 --> 02:48.660
Hello.

02:48.660 --> 02:49.220
Hello.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.260
I see CM, and Mini Mac, and Hawkins, and Brent,

02:52.260 --> 02:53.700
and Popeye's been lurking in there,

02:53.700 --> 02:57.700
and Emacs from Answers up there in the quiet listening as well.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.060
So that's a nice showing on Tuesday.

02:59.060 --> 02:59.900
Glad to have you all.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.780
On a warm Tuesday afternoon.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.600
And we have many in the jblive.tv chat room, too.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.380
So it's nice to see everybody here.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.620
Why don't we kick a few things off with community news,

03:09.620 --> 03:12.400
and then we'll get into my thoughts on the Raspberry Pi

03:12.400 --> 03:13.620
4 as a desktop.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.960
I did get the desktop kit.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.700
It arrived a week ago.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.220
Been using it for a week, and I have some thoughts.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.420
But community news first, Mr. Payne.

03:21.420 --> 03:25.740
We follow up with the topic we talked about last week

03:25.740 --> 03:28.100
with one of the co-founders of Manjaro, Philip,

03:28.100 --> 03:30.780
about bundling free office by default

03:30.780 --> 03:33.100
in a future version of Manjaro.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.180
They've updated their decision.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.980
They've done a bit of a 180, not a complete 180, maybe.

03:38.980 --> 03:39.900
Pick an angle here.

03:39.900 --> 03:40.400
Come on.

03:40.400 --> 03:40.980
Maybe a 90.

03:40.980 --> 03:41.700
OK.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.060
It's a pivot.

03:43.060 --> 03:47.780
And they will offer the user choice during installation,

03:47.780 --> 03:50.540
LibreOffice, FreeOffice, or NoOffice.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.740
So as an additional install time option.

03:52.740 --> 03:53.900
What do you think of that?

03:53.900 --> 03:54.520
Not so bad.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.480
I mean, really, it seems fine, right?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.220
If you want to have more choice, why not?

03:57.220 --> 03:59.260
You can have a default. This is a way of not.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.220
I suppose there's probably still a default, right,

04:01.220 --> 04:04.320
in whichever radio button is selected first.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.220
I think myself, I'd choose the NoOffice version.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.180
Yeah, same.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.780
I prefer not to have one.

04:08.780 --> 04:11.600
I bounced this idea off of Joe on Linux Action News,

04:11.600 --> 04:14.060
and I want to bounce it off of you guys a little bit.

04:14.060 --> 04:17.180
It feels a little bit like the outrage crew showed up

04:17.180 --> 04:19.540
and got the developers to change their plans,

04:19.540 --> 04:21.460
like they were going to do something kind of bold

04:21.460 --> 04:23.020
and differentiating, and they were

04:23.020 --> 04:25.860
going to take a bit of a dramatic step, something that's

04:25.860 --> 04:28.660
a bigger step than you normally see a distribution take.

04:28.660 --> 04:31.180
And instead, they ended up doing something

04:31.180 --> 04:35.300
that's not quite as aggressive, not quite as differentiating.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.820
Again, side note, I actually think

04:36.820 --> 04:37.980
it's the right way to go.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.180
But I'm playing devil's advocate here, cheese.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.980
Are we not, once again, seeing outrage-led development

04:43.980 --> 04:48.580
in open source and with social media and the forums and blogs

04:48.580 --> 04:51.580
and podcasts, although I think we did a pretty good job,

04:51.580 --> 04:53.940
but of course I would think that.

04:53.940 --> 04:56.100
Are we not seeing an outrage machine

04:56.100 --> 05:00.140
that generates reactions so fast that developers are just

05:00.140 --> 05:01.940
inundated, and then they scramble,

05:01.940 --> 05:03.860
and then we get compromises?

05:03.860 --> 05:06.860
I mean, I think that it does get hammed up, right,

05:06.860 --> 05:10.660
within all the Linux circles and how

05:10.660 --> 05:13.700
it's really easy to just go after someone

05:13.700 --> 05:18.580
and attack them for not using the most obvious free option

05:18.580 --> 05:21.220
available and trying something different.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.680
I really admire Manjaro for stepping out of the box

05:23.680 --> 05:24.980
and trying something different.

05:24.980 --> 05:29.460
I agree with you that it's not a step back.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.780
It's kind of a sidestep.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.520
They didn't roll all the way back.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.940
This isn't one of those things where

05:35.940 --> 05:39.020
I feel like they're still standing their ground.

05:39.020 --> 05:40.260
I'll put it that way.

05:40.260 --> 05:45.900
I don't feel that the devs were completely pressured to do this.

05:45.900 --> 05:49.300
And it's something that we're going to have to accept,

05:49.300 --> 05:52.380
I think, as a Linux community, that these things are

05:52.380 --> 05:55.060
going to happen and that distributions are

05:55.060 --> 05:56.220
going to evolve.

05:56.220 --> 05:59.900
And that means partnering with other people.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.780
And really, at the end of the day, you still have your choice.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.860
If you don't want free office, you don't have to use it.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.180
You can install something else.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.060
Like you said, they have different installers,

06:09.060 --> 06:10.660
which will allow you to select.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.600
You've also got the Archetype, or I

06:13.600 --> 06:15.980
think it's the Architect edition of Manjaro.

06:15.980 --> 06:18.220
So you can really dial in.

06:18.220 --> 06:21.860
I've heard backlash on, oh, well, they only

06:21.860 --> 06:23.820
limit you and pigeonhole you to 1D.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.900
Well, you can use their own spin and build it out

06:26.900 --> 06:28.620
to really whatever you want.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.720
I have a sense that they felt they

06:30.720 --> 06:34.900
had to step back away from this because of the pushback.

06:34.900 --> 06:39.220
And I think it really still shows the maturity level

06:39.220 --> 06:41.060
within our community sometimes.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.860
Here's where, again, I want to say

06:43.860 --> 06:46.860
I still appreciate that LibreOffice is free software.

06:46.860 --> 06:47.620
It's functional.

06:47.620 --> 06:48.660
It was an option.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.380
There's a lot of elements to this conversation.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.020
But that's the part you just ended on

06:52.020 --> 06:54.300
that I want to touch on here.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.060
I think what ends up happening, and this is just

06:57.060 --> 07:00.980
based on the emails and tweets and telegrams that I get,

07:00.980 --> 07:03.220
is the people that are the most connected

07:03.220 --> 07:07.300
are often the most passionate about free software.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.060
And they respond very quickly.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.540
And they respond very vocally.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.060
I got a lot of people that tweeted me telling me

07:14.060 --> 07:17.980
that they're ripping Manjaro off their system because of this.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.060
People asking on Hacker News for replacement suggestions.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.180
And on our Linux, people were going

07:23.180 --> 07:28.180
on about the different ways to migrate to other platforms.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.980
And what happens is that's on day one and day two.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.820
That's like the first 48 hours.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.940
And you really saw a lot go down in the Manjaro forums

07:34.940 --> 07:36.780
in the first 48 hours.

07:36.780 --> 07:42.780
What happens around hour 64 and further

07:42.780 --> 07:47.860
is I start getting emails from people who are busy.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.980
They have other things to do than to follow

07:49.980 --> 07:52.380
the daily, perhaps even hourly developments

07:52.380 --> 07:53.660
of the Manjaro distribution.

07:53.660 --> 07:56.060
Later in the week, listen to some shows, read some news,

07:56.060 --> 07:56.540
whatever.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.060
Exactly.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.580
People downloaded the episode.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.780
They heard the interview.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.540
And then they sent me some feedback.

08:01.540 --> 08:04.220
And as the week went on, and this will continue for weeks.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.140
I mean, people will be emailing me for weeks

08:06.140 --> 08:08.460
because they won't hear this episode.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.500
As the long tail of that feedback gets longer,

08:11.500 --> 08:13.780
more and more the trend line is people

08:13.780 --> 08:15.380
that support the switch to free office

08:15.380 --> 08:18.500
because they're already using it.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.580
And I've gotten things like, yeah, I've

08:20.580 --> 08:22.740
been advocating free office for a while,

08:22.740 --> 08:25.740
and people always jump on me for it.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.820
I'm not trying to defend, again, any decisions made here.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.860
I'm pointing out that the people that are most active

08:31.860 --> 08:34.060
in the initial 48 hours of the conversation

08:34.060 --> 08:37.220
are not representative of the community.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.500
They're representative of a slice

08:39.500 --> 08:41.100
of the most passionate community.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.340
I mean, even just saying you're going to change operating

08:43.340 --> 08:43.980
systems, right?

08:43.980 --> 08:45.780
Again, that's a fast thing to do.

08:45.780 --> 08:47.220
You have to care a lot.

08:47.220 --> 08:50.340
Nobody who has a lot of things going on is like,

08:50.340 --> 08:52.180
I'll just reload my OS today.

08:52.180 --> 08:56.300
I've got a machine upstairs that is a Frankenstein build

08:56.300 --> 08:58.100
that I need to reload.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.180
And I've been planning to do it for a month.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.300
Because it's working just enough,

09:02.300 --> 09:04.020
I can't get around to it.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.300
I got all these wackadoodle workarounds for it, too.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.060
It's ridiculous.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.820
And my point is that it's not representative

09:10.820 --> 09:13.040
of the full community, but it's the brunt of the feedback

09:13.040 --> 09:14.180
the developers initially get.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.460
And then they want to respond quickly

09:15.460 --> 09:17.780
because they don't want the outrage to escalate.

09:17.780 --> 09:20.020
And so they're really stuck in a catch-22.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.260
And there's a lot of sympathy here, too.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.020
When we talked to Phil, you could

09:24.020 --> 09:26.740
tell he was doing it to try to differentiate Montero.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.460
The thing he spends a lot of time working on,

09:28.460 --> 09:30.660
as do all the people involved in the project.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.980
And this is just a lot of mental stress, right?

09:32.980 --> 09:35.980
When you're like, oh, OK, some people really didn't like that.

09:35.980 --> 09:39.060
But you've got to also, from both sides,

09:39.060 --> 09:41.020
community members should talk about what they want

09:41.020 --> 09:42.480
or don't want in their projects.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.340
But you've got to remember that it's not

09:44.340 --> 09:46.300
like they're doing this for some evil agenda.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.620
They're trying to make the thing they work on better.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.500
Brent, I'm going to go to you now.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.740
Because I have to imagine there's

09:52.740 --> 09:55.660
some similarities between what you do

09:55.660 --> 09:58.180
and creative expression in creating

09:58.180 --> 09:59.820
something like a distribution.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.540
It is absolutely a technical undertaking.

10:02.540 --> 10:05.660
But it is also, for these creators, their way

10:05.660 --> 10:07.780
to express their creativity.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.660
And sometimes, the very people you're

10:09.660 --> 10:13.540
making that creative work for have very harsh feedback.

10:13.540 --> 10:17.440
And you have to know when to cave and compromise.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.420
And you have to know when to stand your ground.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.260
And I guess the point I'm trying to make to you,

10:21.260 --> 10:22.920
and I'm curious if it resonates with you,

10:22.920 --> 10:25.740
it feels like we're seeing maybe a lot more compromise

10:25.740 --> 10:28.300
these days because of the accessibility

10:28.300 --> 10:29.300
of the developers.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.340
Yeah, this sounds like a little bit of criticism.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.500
But to me, one of the advantages of having

10:33.500 --> 10:36.540
all these distributions is that the developers can create

10:36.540 --> 10:38.460
the product that they want themselves to use

10:38.460 --> 10:41.660
and the options that they themselves want to see.

10:41.660 --> 10:45.320
And I think you've heard from a lot of people

10:45.320 --> 10:46.580
that options is better.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.300
I mean, that was one of our possible choices for titles

10:49.300 --> 10:50.060
last week.

10:50.060 --> 10:54.340
And without that sort of creative freedom

10:54.340 --> 10:58.060
for the developers and those behind the distributions,

10:58.060 --> 11:00.000
if everyone's feeling pigeonholed

11:00.000 --> 11:02.540
into the same place, we're going to end up with five distributions.

11:02.540 --> 11:03.980
It all tastes the same.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.680
And I don't think that's what we want.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.460
Also, if people can't fully express their creative vision,

11:08.460 --> 11:10.000
I mean, we're getting very meta here.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.060
But if you can't express your creative vision,

11:13.060 --> 11:14.380
you're probably going to burn out.

11:14.380 --> 11:15.460
Yeah, right.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.620
Especially if you're doing something not for money.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.180
Use that joy that comes with creating product

11:20.180 --> 11:21.680
that you're really jazzed about, right?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.500
You're going to end up creating something kind of mediocre

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
that you're maybe not quite as proud of.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.860
Yeah, exactly right.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.620
And who wants to work on something mediocre?

11:28.620 --> 11:30.500
You want to work on something that gets you up

11:30.500 --> 11:31.140
in the morning.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.420
It does seem like this is sort of an extension of what

11:33.420 --> 11:35.500
we've seen in daily life, right?

11:35.500 --> 11:38.380
Like with the popularity of Twitter and fast feedback

11:38.380 --> 11:42.140
cycles and outrage coming before all the facts are in

11:42.140 --> 11:45.540
or can even be sort of sifted through and understood,

11:45.540 --> 11:48.180
maybe took a little while to percolate to our culture

11:48.180 --> 11:48.860
as well.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.980
Yeah, I think part of the issue there

11:50.980 --> 11:56.140
is you have to put as much responsibility on the people

11:56.140 --> 11:58.540
taking in the outrage and acting on it

11:58.540 --> 12:02.180
as the people that are experiencing the outrage.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.980
What I'm trying to say is a new skill now,

12:04.980 --> 12:06.880
when you're managing a large community

12:06.880 --> 12:09.300
or you're building a large software project,

12:09.300 --> 12:12.700
is learning to properly interpret

12:12.700 --> 12:15.940
that volume of feedback in the correct way that

12:15.940 --> 12:18.820
is still good for you and the project and your users.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.100
And so that's why I think there is room for compromise

12:21.100 --> 12:22.020
on some of these issues.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.860
Of course, of course.

12:23.860 --> 12:26.020
And like in this case, this probably

12:26.020 --> 12:28.500
is a net positive for all.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.060
But where do we draw that line?

12:30.060 --> 12:33.100
And I think I could cite three or four just recent examples

12:33.100 --> 12:35.220
of when this has happened, as I did in LAN.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.380
And how do we do this in a way, a more productive way,

12:37.380 --> 12:39.540
so that the Monjaro developers feel comfortable

12:39.540 --> 12:40.620
with the next version of this, right?

12:40.620 --> 12:41.960
Because it doesn't seem like it's going to stop.

12:41.960 --> 12:42.260
No.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.060
Everybody's more connected.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.000
But can't you imagine, then, you have another great idea that

12:47.000 --> 12:48.100
might be a little controversial.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.380
And now you're just like, no, it's not worth it.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.840
I don't want to deal with this again.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.220
Well, and I think that it's part of human nature,

12:53.220 --> 12:56.300
too, that one negative feedback.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.140
And let's say, let's just throw a wild number out there.

12:59.140 --> 13:02.300
Let's say they have 250,000 users,

13:02.300 --> 13:06.380
and you get 500 people giving you negative feedback,

13:06.380 --> 13:08.820
even less, 50 people, they give you negative feedback.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.540
That's really going to impact your decision on the direction

13:11.540 --> 13:12.820
that you go.

13:12.820 --> 13:17.980
And that's not really speaking for the whole user base.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.180
It's that outraged, knee-jerk reaction.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.420
And it's kind of sad.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.300
Yeah, it's challenging.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.740
It is really kind of, I think it's

13:25.740 --> 13:28.100
going to be a larger challenge because of the open nature,

13:28.100 --> 13:30.020
the public nature of this type of development.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.300
Because keep in mind, this wasn't even a finished version

13:32.300 --> 13:33.460
of Monjaro that shipped.

13:33.460 --> 13:34.880
This was something they were going

13:34.880 --> 13:36.140
to do in a release candidate.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.260
Right.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.700
And that wasn't even the final release candidate.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.380
It was just something they were going to try for a cycle.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.940
And if it worked, they'd go with it.

13:43.940 --> 13:46.580
And then it would have been official in the new Monjaro

13:46.580 --> 13:47.220
release.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.700
Or how often do we see little bundles of outrage

13:49.700 --> 13:53.260
from things on mailing lists before any decisions are made?

13:53.260 --> 13:54.980
We're already talking about it.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.460
That was one of the reasons I really

13:56.460 --> 13:58.500
wanted to reach out to Philip.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.540
And things connected, thanks to a friend of the show.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.600
And we were able to get him on here

14:04.600 --> 14:06.700
and get it straight from him.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.060
And I have to give them credit.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.540
I think they came to a compromise that

14:10.540 --> 14:11.980
will make their community happy.

14:11.980 --> 14:14.340
And that's just as important as making good software.

14:14.340 --> 14:15.620
So absolutely.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.980
Congratulations to them.

14:16.980 --> 14:20.820
And hopefully, they build up a little bit more

14:20.820 --> 14:23.780
of a thick skin so the next time something like this comes around.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.940
Because I think that's a good position for Monjaro,

14:25.940 --> 14:29.020
to push that edge a little bit, to push it forward a little.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.620
Especially as Endeavor OS comes around,

14:30.620 --> 14:34.800
you can get a pretty vanilla arch experience out of that.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.660
It's nice to see Monjaro kind of go a little more cutting edge,

14:38.660 --> 14:41.700
try things that really differentiate.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.740
Because to their credit and to Pop OS's credit,

14:44.740 --> 14:47.180
they've been getting more and more coverage on YouTube,

14:47.180 --> 14:49.300
which is bringing in more and more people.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.500
And it's funny that those are the first distros.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.100
Like, Monjaro is like, what?

14:53.100 --> 14:53.940
OK.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.020
Wouldn't have called that in a predictions episode,

14:56.020 --> 14:57.620
but it seems to be working.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.840
So hopefully, the team continues on.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.060
And the user base is happy with that.

15:02.060 --> 15:06.340
As a Fedora user, I'm kind of happy with this new minimization

15:06.340 --> 15:07.420
team that's been announced.

15:07.420 --> 15:08.700
Now, don't get too excited.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.620
It's early days.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.700
But there's a new minimization team forming,

15:13.700 --> 15:15.780
focusing on minimizing the installation

15:15.780 --> 15:18.820
size of a lot of the popular apps, run times,

15:18.820 --> 15:21.820
and other bits of software in Fedora.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.020
Have I got you yet, Wes?

15:23.020 --> 15:23.940
No, that sounds great.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.060
And what I like about this, too, is it's not just

15:26.060 --> 15:27.180
a one-off effort.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.860
The goal is to build an environment where

15:28.860 --> 15:30.660
it's easy for the Fedora maintainers

15:30.660 --> 15:32.380
to keep things small over time.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.880
And so they're going to dig into stuff like Apache and Nginx

15:34.880 --> 15:39.140
and all sorts of various systems all over the operating system,

15:39.140 --> 15:40.300
trying to make them small.

15:40.300 --> 15:40.860
That's great.

15:40.860 --> 15:43.620
That could also benefit Santos and RHEL down the road.

15:43.620 --> 15:45.820
Well, this has just got that kind of work

15:45.820 --> 15:49.060
that that's not necessarily fun, it's not necessarily sexy,

15:49.060 --> 15:51.540
but it's going to benefit the whole ecosystem.

15:51.540 --> 15:52.040
Mm-hmm.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.860
Mm-hmm.

15:53.860 --> 15:56.980
Now, Wes, this last story we threw in here,

15:56.980 --> 15:58.700
I think Drew found this.

15:58.700 --> 16:02.060
And I just had Wes Payne all over it.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.580
I always love to give you a hard time

16:03.580 --> 16:05.140
for doing everything with KExec.

16:05.140 --> 16:05.820
Sure do.

16:05.820 --> 16:08.500
Wes wants to give a distro a try and creates a RAM disk

16:08.500 --> 16:10.260
and uses KExec, and it goes to town.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.220
And it's hilarious.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.580
It's also very fast.

16:12.580 --> 16:16.300
And it looks like some enterprising Google engineers

16:16.300 --> 16:21.100
have gotten the Windows kernel to boot via KExec

16:21.100 --> 16:23.260
in a special circumstance, like with, I think,

16:23.260 --> 16:27.460
it's early days implementation of the EFI boot services.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.180
Yeah, exactly.

16:28.180 --> 16:31.460
So with KExec and Linux, you can just load the new kernel

16:31.460 --> 16:34.020
and sort of jump to it, hand off control to the new kernel.

16:34.020 --> 16:34.540
Blows my mind.

16:34.540 --> 16:35.700
And since they control everything,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.940
you can get that set up so the kernel knows what to do,

16:37.940 --> 16:39.620
and it just starts running, and you've

16:39.620 --> 16:40.580
got a new kernel running.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.300
I just don't understand how it hands off the devices.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.300
Oh, it discovers the devices and stuff.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.500
And the video cards don't crap out and stuff?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.420
You can have some hardware issues, for sure.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.580
But not on your Intel?

16:50.580 --> 16:52.180
No, I haven't had too many issues.

16:52.180 --> 16:55.700
And you can then use stuff like systemD

16:55.700 --> 17:00.020
and try to get the system to the most almost reset state

17:00.020 --> 17:01.260
and then load the new kernel.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.700
There are some amount of things you can do.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.820
But it's already integrated.

17:03.820 --> 17:07.420
You just do systemCTLKExec, and you're off, ready to go.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.500
So here's the thing.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.820
Windows doesn't really boot like that anymore.

17:11.820 --> 17:14.220
Microsoft was really involved in the whole UEFI thing

17:14.220 --> 17:17.140
happening anyway, and they actually use it.

17:17.140 --> 17:20.780
And one of the things that EFI provides is these boot services.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.100
And these are nice little helpers

17:22.100 --> 17:24.460
so you can grab disks and have the firmware

17:24.460 --> 17:27.340
interact before you've got your operating system loaded.

17:27.340 --> 17:29.940
Windows Bootloader definitely takes advantage of those.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.780
And so before, with KExec, you didn't have that,

17:32.780 --> 17:33.900
because you're dumping everything you've got

17:33.900 --> 17:35.260
and you're starting fresh.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.100
This is an implementation, basically,

17:37.100 --> 17:40.300
where as you're KExecing, the kernel

17:40.300 --> 17:42.280
can provide these things to Windows

17:42.280 --> 17:43.320
to get it up and running.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.740
And you can transition to get Windows actually started.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.320
Because the whole thing about exiting the boot services

17:48.320 --> 17:50.700
is once you've got the operating system up and going,

17:50.700 --> 17:52.460
all the boot services code is discarded.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.860
And that way, it could actually still be a clean KExec.

17:54.860 --> 17:58.660
So the kernel provides the little bits of UEFI Windows

17:58.660 --> 18:00.060
needs until it can fully handle it.

18:00.060 --> 18:00.540
Yes, right.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.820
So you start KExecing.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.360
You get the Windows Bootloader going.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.660
You give it a little EFI stuff.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.860
It calls exit boot services.

18:05.860 --> 18:08.460
All that Linux code is gone, and Windows is off the go.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.260
It's clean Windows.

18:09.260 --> 18:09.780
Yep.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.900
Wow.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.820
Another part that was neat about this is,

18:12.820 --> 18:14.420
this was a post up, because Google's

18:14.420 --> 18:15.980
been working on Linux boot, which

18:15.980 --> 18:19.820
is a project to replace as much of the EFI stack with Linux

18:19.820 --> 18:20.420
as we can.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.980
So that's where this is going to be useful.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.260
On Twitter, someone else who just that day,

18:26.260 --> 18:28.580
this was like a week or two ago, had

18:28.580 --> 18:30.060
got Windows doing the same thing,

18:30.060 --> 18:32.400
running with a custom kernel module.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.100
So it seems to be multiple parties are interested in that.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.620
And hopefully, that means there's

18:36.620 --> 18:39.100
enough momentum to actually get this polished and merged

18:39.100 --> 18:41.260
somewhere.

18:41.260 --> 18:46.020
What I like about this is, when I installed my T480 ThinkPad,

18:46.020 --> 18:49.200
I said to myself, I will never dual boot this machine.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.180
This will always only run Linux.

18:51.180 --> 18:52.380
And I've held true to that.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.460
I have come up with ways to, well, I've

18:54.460 --> 18:57.740
done PCI-paster to get accelerated Windows if I need.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.220
Ironically, I never need it.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.580
But I got it working.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.900
I use it mostly to just accelerate other Linux distros.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.540
But this could be another great way

19:07.540 --> 19:09.460
to have a Linux system with a Windows

19:09.460 --> 19:11.780
install sitting around somewhere on the disk

19:11.780 --> 19:13.500
that you could boot up when you need it

19:13.500 --> 19:16.780
and have full hardware, full performance.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.820
Gosh, this is crazy stuff.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.940
It's also just neat, because this was never really intended.

19:20.940 --> 19:22.780
It's not like Microsoft has blessed this.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.940
It's just some really good hacking in the old school

19:24.940 --> 19:25.860
sense.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.780
Well, you know, like they say, most of Azure runs Linux.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.820
So maybe they'll just bite the bullet,

19:32.820 --> 19:34.280
switch everything to Linux, and then

19:34.280 --> 19:36.540
just kegzak into Windows when they need it all to Azure.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.040
Amazing.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.340
Ha ha ha ha.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.740
All right, let's do a little bit of that housekeeping

19:41.740 --> 19:42.660
here on the old show.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.220
We've got a few things to cover.

19:44.220 --> 19:48.500
A local event is just near wrapping up its call

19:48.500 --> 19:52.260
for papers, Seagull 2019.

19:52.260 --> 19:53.300
It is August.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.820
I think your deadline is August 11.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.580
And we're recording on the 6th right now.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.340
Get them in now.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.540
Yeah, so get it in.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.380
Get it in.

20:00.380 --> 20:03.380
And then the Seagull itself runs November 15

20:03.380 --> 20:04.740
through the 16th.

20:04.740 --> 20:05.980
You've done a talk there before.

20:05.980 --> 20:06.900
Yeah, two years ago.

20:06.900 --> 20:07.940
It was a really good time.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.420
They were great to the presenters.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.420
So if you want to get involved, super friendly,

20:11.420 --> 20:13.260
accommodating conference.

20:13.260 --> 20:16.060
I know last year they had childcare available.

20:16.060 --> 20:18.020
So they really care about the people coming

20:18.020 --> 20:19.460
to the conference, whether you're presenting

20:19.460 --> 20:20.460
or just want to attend.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.020
And it's just a great spot in downtown Seattle, too.

20:23.020 --> 20:23.860
Oh, yeah, beautiful.

20:23.860 --> 20:26.140
If you want an excuse to come visit the city,

20:26.140 --> 20:27.460
I can't think of a better one.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.500
You go down there.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.980
You attend a great event.

20:29.980 --> 20:32.180
And then there's a great evening to be had.

20:32.180 --> 20:35.100
I'll also add their CFP page has just some great references.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.820
If you're giving a talk somewhere else,

20:36.820 --> 20:38.740
they've got a ton of good links for how do you

20:38.740 --> 20:40.580
assess what audience you're talking to,

20:40.580 --> 20:43.020
or just some good tips on presentations.

20:43.020 --> 20:43.620
Good to know.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.900
Yeah, that is really handy to get you going, isn't it?

20:45.900 --> 20:46.500
Yeah, it is.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.300
Yeah.

20:47.300 --> 20:51.600
Also, congratulations to the hard, hardworking individuals

20:51.600 --> 20:53.140
behind the scenes here at Linux Academy

20:53.140 --> 20:55.780
to get the new website launched.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.340
If you haven't seen linuxacademy.com in a little bit,

20:58.340 --> 20:59.620
go check out the new website.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.580
It's looking sharp.

21:00.580 --> 21:03.220
I was in some meetings when they were putting this together.

21:03.220 --> 21:07.420
And I'm just going to say, another site's gone dark.

21:07.420 --> 21:09.220
Dark mode for the web.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.500
They did a fantastic job, man.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.620
The product team over there, Alex and Joelle and Ingrid

21:14.620 --> 21:17.140
and all those people over there at Linux Academy,

21:17.140 --> 21:19.160
have been eyeing it and kind of seeing it

21:19.160 --> 21:20.380
as it's being developed.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.620
And the artwork and the new styling

21:22.620 --> 21:25.140
and it's pretty legit, man.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.580
I like it a lot.

21:26.580 --> 21:27.500
They did a great job.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.340
It's the best looking training website ever.

21:29.340 --> 21:30.420
I mean, it's just gorgeous.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.720
They've just done a killer job.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.900
Linuxacademy.com to check that out.

21:33.900 --> 21:37.720
Also, if you haven't checked out the community section

21:37.720 --> 21:40.180
for a while, there's some free stuff over there.

21:40.180 --> 21:47.060
And now 180 plus Linux Academy courses have transcripts.

21:47.060 --> 21:47.700
There's more.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.700
It's actually landing all the time.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.020
Another batch lands tomorrow.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.140
Future courses are launching with transcripts.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.740
And they're interactive transcripts.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.240
So you can get time codes and stuff.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.100
You can jump around to that.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.300
We might just have to steal how they did that,

22:00.300 --> 22:01.420
because I want that for our stuff.

22:01.420 --> 22:01.980
It's super cool.

22:01.980 --> 22:02.980
It's super impressive.

22:02.980 --> 22:03.900
I mean, it's a lot of engineering.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.460
And the end result is just great for actually using it

22:06.460 --> 22:07.060
to learn.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.820
Yeah, accessibility and to learn.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.140
I think it's really cool.

22:10.140 --> 22:12.180
And one last thing while we're talking about it,

22:12.180 --> 22:13.560
they're doing some swag giveaways

22:13.560 --> 22:16.420
for the YouTube channel, Linux Academy Com.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.540
If you are a community member or a paid member

22:18.540 --> 22:19.760
or you subscribe to the YouTube channel,

22:19.760 --> 22:21.340
there's a form we'll have linked in the show notes

22:21.340 --> 22:26.660
at linuxunplugged.com slash 313 for a swag giveaway,

22:26.660 --> 22:28.260
special, limited edition.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.860
Oh, limited edition.

22:29.860 --> 22:32.180
It's a great team of designers at Linux Academy.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.540
She's just part of, and he's a great designer himself.

22:34.540 --> 22:35.700
But the whole team, like the stuff

22:35.700 --> 22:39.340
they come up with, the website, the art for, the courseware,

22:39.340 --> 22:41.580
and the swag, like the best swag.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
Such swag.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.420
I want to know how I get my hands on that swag.

22:44.420 --> 22:45.460
I wonder if they'll make that available to staff.

22:45.460 --> 22:46.420
Can we get an inside deal?

22:46.420 --> 22:47.620
I got some good swag.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.620
So check that out.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.820
Also, the call for paper is coming up soon.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.900
If you're going to be at Seagull, let us know.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.300
Head over to our telegram group,

22:55.300 --> 22:57.460
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.780
Jump in there and let us know if you're going to be at Seagull.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.420
We're trying to get our Seagull game plan together,

23:01.420 --> 23:02.460
and we'd like to hear from you.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.300
Get some JB critical mass.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.260
That could be a thing.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.740
So let's start organizing now to see what we can get together

23:08.740 --> 23:11.940
for November.

23:11.940 --> 23:14.420
All right, so I've been kicking around the Raspberry Pi

23:14.420 --> 23:17.620
4 as a workstation for a week.

23:17.620 --> 23:19.020
That's how it was pitched.

23:19.020 --> 23:23.740
So I dropped like 100 and change on the desktop kit.

23:23.740 --> 23:25.540
Not so much overall, really.

23:25.540 --> 23:29.140
I mean, really, if you think about what computers used to cost

23:29.140 --> 23:32.780
and what you used to get, this is not bad, really, overall.

23:32.780 --> 23:35.980
The specs of this thing are pretty remarkable

23:35.980 --> 23:38.660
when you compare just like some of my first computers as a kid.

23:38.660 --> 23:39.960
I got the 4 gig RAM edition.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.700
That's what comes in the desktop kit.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.580
It doesn't come with any passive cooling,

23:44.580 --> 23:47.140
and it does come in an enclosure.

23:47.140 --> 23:49.820
And I have pictures of the unboxing of the enclosure.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.140
It's a really nice enclosure.

23:51.140 --> 23:51.980
It looks sharp.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.340
The keyboard is nice.

23:53.340 --> 23:56.620
It feels pretty good compared to a lot of smart keyboards.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.080
It's a pretty lightweight keyboard.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.780
It's got a little USB hub built into it, which is very nice.

24:00.780 --> 24:03.940
It also includes in the box the official Raspberry Pi

24:03.940 --> 24:07.020
beginner's guide and everything you

24:07.020 --> 24:09.860
need to get going, including the mouse and the power supply.

24:09.860 --> 24:12.020
I'm kind of curious about that beginner's guide.

24:12.020 --> 24:14.260
Is it walking you through?

24:14.260 --> 24:16.420
Does it have screenshots of the desktop

24:16.420 --> 24:19.900
and kind of explaining the system to you?

24:19.900 --> 24:20.620
I'm not sure.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.620
Wes will go see if he can find it, because I didn't.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.540
I don't open the manual, cheese.

24:26.540 --> 24:28.860
I think that it's super awesome that they actually

24:28.860 --> 24:30.500
shipped a device with a manual.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
You remember actually getting a physical distro

24:33.500 --> 24:37.740
that had a 500-page manual in it back in the day?

24:37.740 --> 24:38.900
Love that.

24:38.900 --> 24:39.820
For sure.

24:39.820 --> 24:41.440
So it's a real book.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.580
It's a genuine book.

24:42.580 --> 24:43.780
It feels good in the hands.

24:43.780 --> 24:44.860
Quality paper.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.740
He's got it here, he grabbed it.

24:46.740 --> 24:47.420
So what is it?

24:47.420 --> 24:49.900
Is it a walkthrough of Raspbian?

24:49.900 --> 24:52.300
Yeah, and there's a bunch of projects in here.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.780
I'm seeing some code, and it's got you opening up Chromium

24:55.780 --> 24:57.780
and navigating the desktop, but nicely labeled.

24:57.780 --> 24:58.940
Current screenshots, wow.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.820
Oh, yeah, it was updated for Raspberry Pi 4.

25:00.820 --> 25:02.900
Really, really glossy print, too.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.780
But it's also got some nice prints of the board

25:04.780 --> 25:06.940
to show you where all the ports are and what they do.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.980
This is a really, really good book.

25:09.980 --> 25:12.180
Yeah, that's a really good book.

25:12.180 --> 25:12.700
Wow.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.700
It's got stuff for you can get other kits for it.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.780
Here's programming to light up LED board

25:16.780 --> 25:18.380
that you can attach to the Pi.

25:18.380 --> 25:19.700
You know what's funny is I've seen this book,

25:19.700 --> 25:21.660
and I never thought to get it.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.020
And now I'm kind of glad I have it.

25:24.020 --> 25:28.060
The Raspberry Pi 4 is, it feels like if you're not

25:28.060 --> 25:30.020
super familiar with the Raspberry Pis,

25:30.020 --> 25:32.940
it looks like a regular Raspberry Pi,

25:32.940 --> 25:35.420
maybe slightly larger.

25:35.420 --> 25:38.060
The ethernet and USB ports are switched around.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.980
And the most notable change for me

25:40.980 --> 25:44.640
is the power input is now a USB-C connector.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.620
And gone is the full size HDMI output

25:48.620 --> 25:51.340
replaced with two micro HDMI connectors.

25:51.340 --> 25:54.900
Now, the desktop kit does come with two cables

25:54.900 --> 25:57.860
for HDMI in the box, which is nice because I needed that.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.800
And it's regular HDMI on one end, micro on the other side.

26:01.800 --> 26:06.460
And it is undoubtedly a faster machine.

26:06.460 --> 26:12.860
It has a 1.5 gigahertz quad arm V8, a 64-bit processor.

26:12.860 --> 26:15.700
Raspbian ships in 32-bit mode.

26:15.700 --> 26:19.460
The GPU is a Broadcom video core at 500 megahertz.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.340
Mine was a four gigabyte model, but you can also

26:21.340 --> 26:23.300
get it in one or two gigabytes.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.860
Side note, if you don't need the four gigabytes,

26:25.860 --> 26:27.900
you may want to consider the two gigabyte model

26:27.900 --> 26:31.080
because it comes with a passive cooler, I've been told.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.620
It has a gigabit ethernet as well as 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

26:34.620 --> 26:38.620
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, microSD for the storage.

26:38.620 --> 26:42.740
Of course, it's got the classic GPIO 40-pin header.

26:42.740 --> 26:45.540
And it's loaded with USB.

26:45.540 --> 26:51.060
It's got two USB 2s and two USB 3s,

26:51.060 --> 26:53.140
as well as full gigabit and Wi-Fi now

26:53.140 --> 26:55.180
because they're actually on their own controllers.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.860
They're not shared on the USB bus.

26:56.860 --> 26:59.140
Pretty much the universal Raspberry Pi complaint.

26:59.140 --> 27:00.860
Yeah, it really changes everything.

27:00.860 --> 27:05.060
I mean, it makes everything, it makes this a real production

27:05.060 --> 27:06.620
usable machine.

27:06.620 --> 27:11.240
And so I really wanted, I was skeptical.

27:11.240 --> 27:15.860
And I'll say right up front, it's not going to be my desktop.

27:15.860 --> 27:21.320
And I have no illusions of replacing an x86 machine

27:21.320 --> 27:24.460
from the last few years with this thing.

27:24.460 --> 27:31.740
It, to me, feels like a machine from around 2011, 2010

27:31.740 --> 27:34.700
with a decent processor, four gigs of RAM,

27:34.700 --> 27:36.300
and a spinning hard drive.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.900
And I was using SD storage.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.980
So as they begin to support booting from USB storage,

27:41.980 --> 27:44.180
I'll try again with a USB 3 SSD.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.220
I bet it would be better.

27:45.220 --> 27:46.420
I'm sure it would be.

27:46.420 --> 27:50.740
But the overall desktop, for me, kind of meh.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.820
I could see it definitely working anywhere

27:52.820 --> 27:55.100
where a computer that takes a little while to open up

27:55.100 --> 27:57.340
your web browser, sometimes it takes a while for the next tab

27:57.340 --> 27:59.700
to open, it feels like a spinning rust machine.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.620
Anywhere where that workload is acceptable,

28:01.620 --> 28:03.300
you may get away with a Raspberry Pi.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.180
For most of the history of mankind's computing,

28:06.180 --> 28:09.820
totally usable if you're a desktop power user,

28:09.820 --> 28:10.740
you're going to hate it.

28:10.740 --> 28:11.620
Yeah.

28:11.620 --> 28:15.300
So I did some thorough benchmarking on this thing.

28:15.300 --> 28:15.820
Oh, boy.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.140
I love the Ferronix test suite.

28:17.140 --> 28:19.620
Talked about it many times on this show before.

28:19.620 --> 28:22.980
And you combine that with the Open Benchmark website,

28:22.980 --> 28:26.340
you can compare your system to any system that's

28:26.340 --> 28:28.980
ever submitted their benchmarks to the Open Benchmark website.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.700
It's so cool.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.060
So I could compare this Raspberry Pi for,

28:33.060 --> 28:35.860
I went to machines as far back as 2011.

28:35.860 --> 28:38.020
And I was able to get a whole range of machines

28:38.020 --> 28:39.500
that I could compare this thing to.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.140
And as long as they performed the same types of tests

28:42.140 --> 28:43.020
that I did.

28:43.020 --> 28:47.460
And we did CPU performance, we did memory performance tests,

28:47.460 --> 28:49.060
we did audio encoding tests.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.620
I attempted to do video encoding,

28:50.620 --> 28:54.140
but that test failed on the Raspberry Pi 4.

28:54.140 --> 28:57.380
So I decided to try to find where this machine sort of fits

28:57.380 --> 28:59.720
when compared to an x86 machine.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.780
If you could buy an x86 machine, how much

29:01.780 --> 29:04.660
would you have to spend to have comparable performance

29:04.660 --> 29:06.020
to a Raspberry Pi 4?

29:06.020 --> 29:07.420
I thought that'd be kind of interesting.

29:07.420 --> 29:10.300
Kind of the reverse here, you're trying to optimize low.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.140
Can we find a cheap x86 that?

29:12.140 --> 29:13.500
Yeah, how much would that cost?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.700
I know it's kind of a backwards way to think about it.

29:15.700 --> 29:20.420
But when you get a Raspberry Pi with this kind of performance,

29:20.420 --> 29:22.900
it gets to this awkward middle ground

29:22.900 --> 29:27.420
where it's a little bit faster than an older x86 machine

29:27.420 --> 29:30.460
at some operations and slower at others.

29:30.460 --> 29:33.260
And it's kind of like, is this a job now for a Raspberry Pi,

29:33.260 --> 29:36.420
or is this a job for a NUC, a used NUC or something?

29:36.420 --> 29:37.980
We're getting in that range.

29:37.980 --> 29:42.280
And so I compared this to an Intel Core 2 Quad.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.700
And I know that seems a little odd,

29:43.700 --> 29:48.380
but that's actually, this is a 2011 system

29:48.380 --> 29:52.780
that has a 2.4 gigahertz, four cores, and four gigabytes

29:52.780 --> 29:54.940
of RAM.

29:54.940 --> 29:57.340
And what these tests will show, and they're all

29:57.340 --> 29:58.380
linked in the show notes.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.540
And by the way, if you're curious how your Raspberry

30:00.540 --> 30:03.420
Pi stacks up or your own desktop or laptop,

30:03.420 --> 30:05.460
one of the great things about the Phronics test suite

30:05.460 --> 30:07.500
is you can use my URL I have in the show notes,

30:07.500 --> 30:08.880
and you can compare your system.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.900
It'll run the exact same tests, and then

30:10.900 --> 30:13.900
it'll generate those bars you've seen on the Phronics websites.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.700
It'll generate those charts to show you

30:15.700 --> 30:17.820
how your machine differs from my machine.

30:17.820 --> 30:19.220
That's all linked in the show notes

30:19.220 --> 30:21.740
if you'd like to compare how your system would perform.

30:21.740 --> 30:26.780
What was interesting is when it came to a lot of CPU tests,

30:26.780 --> 30:35.140
the Raspberry Pi 4 would lag behind a moderate 2011 Intel

30:35.140 --> 30:35.780
system.

30:35.780 --> 30:39.620
I compared it to quad cores and dual core systems.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.980
And in almost all CPU-bound tasks,

30:41.980 --> 30:46.980
the Raspberry Pi 4 was notably slower.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.460
Right, not out of this world, not

30:48.460 --> 30:50.860
a different order of magnitude, but noticeably slower.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.460
Generally, like in a lot of the audio encoding tasks,

30:53.460 --> 30:56.460
it was 10 seconds slower than some of these Intel systems.

30:56.460 --> 30:57.500
But in aggregate, that adds up.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.420
Which kind of adds up, right?

30:58.420 --> 31:00.700
And it kind of makes sense with the other things we've seen.

31:00.700 --> 31:01.380
Totally usable.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.460
You could do those things there, but if you do them

31:03.460 --> 31:05.140
all the time, it's going to be painful.

31:05.140 --> 31:07.580
Where it surprised me and pulled ahead,

31:07.580 --> 31:09.300
and not too surprising when you consider

31:09.300 --> 31:12.380
the age of these systems, is operations

31:12.380 --> 31:16.540
that were more memory-bound, memory performance tests,

31:16.540 --> 31:19.180
the Raspberry Pi 4 often performed much better.

31:19.180 --> 31:22.340
Not at all tasks, but often, on the average,

31:22.340 --> 31:24.740
performed better than the Intel systems.

31:24.740 --> 31:26.700
So if you're doing things in memory

31:26.700 --> 31:30.300
on an embedded system, a Raspberry Pi, in this case,

31:30.300 --> 31:32.660
would actually be potentially a faster system

31:32.660 --> 31:35.740
than an old, used Intel box you have laying around the house.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.700
And it's, without a question, using way less power,

31:39.700 --> 31:41.740
and likely making a lot less noise, too.

31:41.740 --> 31:42.940
And I mean, that makes sense, too,

31:42.940 --> 31:45.580
unless you're doing serious crunching and work on your Pi.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.340
Probably a lot of times, you have other devices attached

31:47.340 --> 31:49.900
to it, and you just need those CPUs to shuffle bits around.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.740
Yeah, which we'll talk about here in just a second.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.860
So the question of, how much would you have to spend

31:54.860 --> 31:58.420
on an x86 machine to beat the Raspberry Pi in performance?

31:58.420 --> 32:01.220
If you're willing to go used, and I think, in this case,

32:01.220 --> 32:04.700
you should, we have a link to an example PC

32:04.700 --> 32:06.820
at PCLiquidators.com.

32:06.820 --> 32:12.060
$54.99 gets you an Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.93 gigahertz,

32:12.060 --> 32:15.460
4 gigs of RAM, and a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.100
And this system, based on the systems

32:17.100 --> 32:20.180
I was able to compare it to on the Ferronix Open Benchmark

32:20.180 --> 32:24.260
website, would perform faster than a Raspberry Pi 4.

32:24.260 --> 32:26.780
So a $54 used x86.

32:26.780 --> 32:27.500
It's louder.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.420
It's going to put out more heat.

32:29.420 --> 32:31.780
It's going to use more power.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.580
There's not as big of a community around it.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.460
There's lots of other downsides.

32:35.460 --> 32:40.060
But just as a reference point now,

32:40.060 --> 32:43.380
we're starting to get around a 2011 kind of performance,

32:43.380 --> 32:47.620
a little bit maybe 2010 performance of an x86 desktop

32:47.620 --> 32:51.020
on a $35, $45 computer.

32:51.020 --> 32:55.340
Yeah, that has modern Wi-Fi, and modern ports, and a huge

32:55.340 --> 32:58.340
community, and lots of little gadgets, and dongles,

32:58.340 --> 32:59.620
and accessories for it, too.

32:59.620 --> 33:03.340
So my walk away from my week with the Raspberry Pi

33:03.340 --> 33:06.380
as a desktop is I probably won't continue to really use it

33:06.380 --> 33:07.620
as a desktop for me.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.740
I could definitely see myself, like if I wanted a workbench

33:10.740 --> 33:14.900
computer that I could look stuff up, have a terminal,

33:14.900 --> 33:17.140
do some quick Google searches, 100%.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.380
Yeah, just as a computer to leave around somewhere extra

33:19.380 --> 33:19.980
just in case.

33:19.980 --> 33:20.460
Great.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.940
I mean, with the desktop kit, you've got everything you need.

33:22.940 --> 33:25.000
You've got absolutely everything you need except for a screen.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.580
And I've got screens floating around.

33:26.580 --> 33:27.900
I bet everyone does.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.140
So I could totally, absolutely see myself

33:30.140 --> 33:31.500
using it in that scenario.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.300
But where I really see myself putting it in production now

33:34.300 --> 33:38.500
is more like a component of a wider home system

33:38.500 --> 33:42.620
now with the networking options, and now the faster storage

33:42.620 --> 33:45.740
options, and the faster CPU.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.540
This thing can do real image processing for me.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.500
It can do some real actual tasks.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.960
And I want to recommend that people

33:51.960 --> 33:53.600
take a look at the Flick case.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.580
I think the Flirrk case.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.420
I bought them before.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.580
They now have one in production for the Raspberry Pi 4.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.820
We'll link to some information.

34:00.820 --> 34:04.060
It shows genuine reductions in the thermals for the Raspberry

34:04.060 --> 34:05.420
Pi 4 using this case.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.820
So something you want to consider

34:06.820 --> 34:09.260
if you're going to put this thing in long-term production.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.660
Also, if you look on Thingiverse,

34:11.660 --> 34:13.500
you'll see a community building up around now

34:13.500 --> 34:19.020
the new Raspberry Pi 4, including a wicked awesome NAS

34:19.020 --> 34:22.300
enclosure that Alex found that accommodates

34:22.300 --> 34:24.700
a top slot for the Raspberry Pi 4.

34:24.700 --> 34:27.740
And then underneath it is room for SATA drives,

34:27.740 --> 34:28.820
like large drives.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.340
And they have different sizes.

34:30.340 --> 34:32.740
They have some where you can print with the NextCloud logo

34:32.740 --> 34:34.260
on the side.

34:34.260 --> 34:40.700
It's a DIY NAS enclosure for the Raspberry Pi 4

34:40.700 --> 34:42.860
that has some cross-ventilation on it.

34:42.860 --> 34:45.460
And people are starting to design cases already

34:45.460 --> 34:48.700
to accommodate its higher heat profile.

34:48.700 --> 34:52.540
My problem with the Raspberry Pi 4 is I have a 3B+.

34:52.540 --> 34:55.180
And I use it to do octo print for my 3D printer.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.100
It's wonderful for that.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.940
But my issue with the Raspberry Pi 4

34:58.940 --> 35:01.940
is that by the time you buy the 4 gigabyte model,

35:01.940 --> 35:05.260
you buy a keyboard, a mouse, and all the rest of it.

35:05.260 --> 35:08.780
With this desktop kit, you're looking at, what, $120 US?

35:08.780 --> 35:10.320
If you get the desktop kit.

35:10.320 --> 35:15.500
I just built an x86 system to run PFSense around an i5

35:15.500 --> 35:16.260
third gen.

35:16.260 --> 35:21.060
So I think it was a 3470T or something, low power.

35:21.060 --> 35:24.460
Pulls about 10, maybe 12 watts from the wall.

35:24.460 --> 35:27.060
Has significantly better performance, of course,

35:27.060 --> 35:28.900
than a Pi 4.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.380
And that cost me $100 US.

35:31.380 --> 35:32.900
This puts, for me, the Raspberry Pi

35:32.900 --> 35:34.060
in a really awkward situation.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.420
Yes, you've got the network effect, the community,

35:36.420 --> 35:38.380
the people on Thingiverse, all the rest of it.

35:38.380 --> 35:43.860
But without some kind of way to remove the SD boot situation,

35:43.860 --> 35:46.180
because that really hurts performance of apt update,

35:46.180 --> 35:47.660
et cetera.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.220
It's just in a really awkward spot

35:49.220 --> 35:52.500
now it costs in that $100 price point.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.660
I think it still has some significant advantages.

35:54.660 --> 35:56.700
I wouldn't underplay the community effect.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.160
There's so many images available,

35:58.160 --> 35:59.180
especially for some of the stuff we're

35:59.180 --> 36:00.700
going to talk about here in a moment.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.820
You just pop it on, it's good to go.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.660
That makes it approachable to a lot of people.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.220
Yeah, I think it is, you're right,

36:07.220 --> 36:09.900
in an awkward spot of if you just need a box that you're

36:09.900 --> 36:11.060
already experienced, you don't mind

36:11.060 --> 36:13.140
playing around on the Linux command line maybe,

36:13.140 --> 36:14.860
then yeah, there's a lot of options there.

36:14.860 --> 36:17.100
But if you do maybe want a project for someone,

36:17.100 --> 36:19.260
or you might not want a FUTZ, and you

36:19.260 --> 36:20.860
do want to treat it very appliance,

36:20.860 --> 36:21.980
the Pi is kind of unique.

36:21.980 --> 36:27.380
But this, Alex, was the central struggle of my review.

36:27.380 --> 36:30.340
Before the show started, I was not looking forward to this

36:30.340 --> 36:34.340
at all, because I bought the Raspberry Pi 4 thinking,

36:34.340 --> 36:36.380
finally this will be the Raspberry Pi for me

36:36.380 --> 36:39.380
that's fast enough, it's got enough RAM,

36:39.380 --> 36:41.620
now I can really use this sucker.

36:41.620 --> 36:45.060
And I ended up kind of thinking exactly what you're thinking.

36:45.060 --> 36:47.660
Boy, in most cases, I could use some NUCs

36:47.660 --> 36:49.380
that I have in the studio that I didn't want

36:49.380 --> 36:51.140
to use in production anymore.

36:51.140 --> 36:53.460
And for the other stuff, I could probably

36:53.460 --> 36:57.740
just use VMs, which would also be a little bit faster.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.500
And I don't really know where the Raspberry Pi fits anymore.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.580
It was exactly the opposite of my expectations.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.680
My expectations were, this would finally

37:04.680 --> 37:05.700
make it the perfect fit.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.220
And instead, I'm even more lost.

37:08.220 --> 37:09.840
And so what Wes and I had to do was

37:09.840 --> 37:12.260
we spent the last two days putting our heads together,

37:12.260 --> 37:15.960
coming up with various different uses that really are

37:15.960 --> 37:18.220
perfect for the Raspberry Pi, like jobs that are

37:18.220 --> 37:19.260
great for the Raspberry Pi.

37:19.260 --> 37:22.140
And we've been slamming it into various different use cases.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.340
And we've landed on one that I think I like a lot,

37:24.340 --> 37:27.740
that I would never use an x86 PC for.

37:27.740 --> 37:29.860
So that, you know, but I'm with you.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.140
The Raspberry Pi 4 muddies that question more

37:32.140 --> 37:33.180
than it answers it.

37:33.180 --> 37:36.940
So back in 2012, I used it as a Raspberry MC box

37:36.940 --> 37:39.620
way before LibreELEC and all the rest of it.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.740
And it had pretty decent performance

37:42.740 --> 37:46.420
and was able to, for the price of $35,

37:46.420 --> 37:49.220
outperform anything in its price point.

37:49.220 --> 37:54.500
But now we have this huge market of small system boards

37:54.500 --> 37:56.180
like the Pi.

37:56.180 --> 37:59.540
Cheese has a whole collection, I think.

37:59.540 --> 38:02.840
And what the Raspberry Pi 1 did was

38:02.840 --> 38:05.980
it showed that there was a market for that sort of sub $50

38:05.980 --> 38:08.180
single board computer.

38:08.180 --> 38:12.060
And whether the Pi 4 has knocked it out the park,

38:12.060 --> 38:14.860
I think, is questionable, simply because they've

38:14.860 --> 38:17.180
given you that option to go to the 4 gig.

38:17.180 --> 38:20.260
So I'm now evaluating it as a $55 device

38:20.260 --> 38:22.140
rather than a $35 device.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.580
And that really changes the game somewhat.

38:24.580 --> 38:27.700
I agree, only in so much that I think only us geeks kind of

38:27.700 --> 38:28.440
care about that.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.980
I think the general public, you know,

38:29.980 --> 38:34.260
a dad and a kid or a mom and a daughter or a teacher

38:34.260 --> 38:36.860
in a class or whatever the scenario is where they,

38:36.860 --> 38:38.840
you know, it's people that are not inherently

38:38.840 --> 38:40.500
familiar with the options.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.340
They need something that they recognize,

38:42.340 --> 38:44.140
something they can order on Amazon.

38:44.140 --> 38:46.060
And the Raspberry Pi really fits that.

38:46.060 --> 38:48.660
But only us geeks care about it anyway, don't we?

38:48.660 --> 38:48.900
I don't know.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.020
I think the Raspberry Pi is one of those things that,

38:51.020 --> 38:52.180
like I say, it's in schools.

38:52.180 --> 38:53.580
It's a good teaching thing.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.940
I mean, it was originally really all about learning Python.

38:55.940 --> 38:58.660
And I think that those are roots have given it success

38:58.660 --> 39:00.100
in some of those communities.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.500
So Cheesy, you understand the struggle, too,

39:01.500 --> 39:02.860
because you and I were talking about this.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.700
And I know you've been working on kind of a neat implementation

39:05.700 --> 39:06.580
for your Raspberry Pi.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.500
So why don't you kick us off with some actual practical

39:09.500 --> 39:11.820
uses for this thing that's getting crazy fast.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.780
And really, even the older Raspberry Pis

39:13.780 --> 39:15.460
were fast enough to do some of this stuff.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.900
Yeah, so I mean, I've been using the Raspberry Pi, man,

39:17.900 --> 39:21.220
since the OG B model.

39:21.220 --> 39:24.120
But there are still some really great uses.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.260
And one that I came across recently

39:26.260 --> 39:31.580
was Shinobi, which is basically just a network video recorder.

39:31.580 --> 39:37.740
The ZoneMinder, where ZoneMinder kind of ended,

39:37.740 --> 39:41.980
Shinobi has kind of picked up and taken off from them.

39:41.980 --> 39:47.900
So it's Node.js, super nice, super simple to install.

39:47.900 --> 39:52.700
Right now, I have it hooked up to a FozCam that's just

39:52.700 --> 39:55.580
running the RTSP stream.

39:55.580 --> 39:58.620
I'm sitting, and this is on the 3,

39:58.620 --> 40:06.620
I'm sitting at 3% CPU usage, about 250 megs of RAM.

40:06.620 --> 40:09.340
And I've been recording kind of clips throughout the day.

40:09.340 --> 40:12.780
And I've used like 300 megabytes of storage.

40:12.780 --> 40:17.840
You can also add additional devices easily into Shinobi.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.380
So if you have additional cameras,

40:20.380 --> 40:21.460
there's so many settings.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.900
I haven't had an opportunity to dive in and deep dive

40:23.900 --> 40:25.900
into every little setting yet.

40:25.900 --> 40:28.700
But there's a ton of different stuff in there.

40:28.700 --> 40:31.220
The only thing that I haven't found,

40:31.220 --> 40:32.760
that I'm sure some other solutions,

40:32.760 --> 40:36.580
because I know there are some other NVR and surveillance

40:36.580 --> 40:41.180
camera solutions for the Pi, I haven't found the plug-in

40:41.180 --> 40:45.660
to allow me to do motion detection yet.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.980
Granted, I've only been messing it for maybe an hour

40:47.980 --> 40:49.340
and a half, two hours.

40:49.340 --> 40:51.560
Let me take over from here then, my friend.

40:51.560 --> 40:56.020
So we've been messing around with something a bit similar.

40:56.020 --> 40:59.180
You can go deep, or you can go light.

40:59.180 --> 41:00.940
And we kind of went kind of light and thin

41:00.940 --> 41:01.980
with our implementation.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.580
So we actually just did something

41:03.580 --> 41:07.220
on top of the Raspbian image that came on the SD card.

41:07.220 --> 41:10.460
So this is pretty low barrier to entry.

41:10.460 --> 41:13.740
And then we integrated it with a wider automation system.

41:13.740 --> 41:17.060
And this little task that we ended up doing,

41:17.060 --> 41:18.620
and I finally got around to trying,

41:18.620 --> 41:22.220
because I had a reason to with the Raspberry Pi 4,

41:22.220 --> 41:29.220
has opened my mind to an amazing world of possibilities

41:29.220 --> 41:31.380
and fun geeky projects that could

41:31.380 --> 41:33.580
keep me busy for a year flat.

41:33.580 --> 41:34.580
Yeah, that's sincere.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.040
He's actually legitimately excited.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.140
I'm so happy about this.

41:39.140 --> 41:42.980
I mean, you could make an entire show out of this stuff.

41:42.980 --> 41:44.640
It's so good.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.200
So Wes, why don't we start at the beginning?

41:47.200 --> 41:52.340
We're using a Raspberry Pi with a Logitech webcam,

41:52.340 --> 41:55.100
just something you bought off of Amazon.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.920
This one's a C930, because we have a few of those

41:56.920 --> 41:59.220
around the studio, plugged into the USB 2

41:59.220 --> 42:01.800
port on the Raspberry Pi 4.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.460
And then we're running some open source software

42:04.460 --> 42:06.020
to do a little bit of image magic.

42:06.020 --> 42:06.980
Oh, yeah.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.820
And you found it originally, funny enough,

42:08.820 --> 42:11.980
as, of course, a bespoke distribution for the Pi

42:11.980 --> 42:14.540
called Motion IOS.

42:14.540 --> 42:18.260
But as is true, with the Pi 4 being relatively new,

42:18.260 --> 42:19.820
it didn't have an updated image yet.

42:19.820 --> 42:22.460
But it has great support just right in there.

42:22.460 --> 42:24.060
It turns out most of the packages we need

42:24.060 --> 42:25.620
were already in Raspbian.

42:25.620 --> 42:27.680
So all I had to do was get it installed,

42:27.680 --> 42:29.860
which turned out to be fascinatingly simple.

42:29.860 --> 42:31.820
So it's just the package that you want.

42:31.820 --> 42:33.060
It's just called Motion, is that what it's called?

42:33.060 --> 42:33.980
So there's multiple components.

42:33.980 --> 42:34.480
Yeah.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.060
So Motion is the back end system that

42:37.060 --> 42:40.220
can talk to all the cameras, configure them, add them,

42:40.220 --> 42:42.220
and then actually watch them for motion.

42:42.220 --> 42:45.500
And then we're using a project on top called Motion I, which

42:45.500 --> 42:47.860
provides us a slick little GUI in the web

42:47.860 --> 42:50.020
that you can then go configure motion in the back end

42:50.020 --> 42:52.180
and just watch all your streams.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.340
Yeah, it gives you a place to aggregate the cameras.

42:54.340 --> 42:56.340
So you can have a heads up if you had a bunch of cameras.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.460
You can have them all on there.

42:57.460 --> 42:59.180
You can tweak all of the camera settings,

42:59.180 --> 43:02.420
like the res and the refresh rates and the frame rates.

43:02.420 --> 43:08.420
But this web interface also lets you set up a little web hook.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.060
Yeah, it's exactly what you might

43:10.060 --> 43:12.000
want as a nerdy customizer, because you

43:12.000 --> 43:13.140
can run a custom command.

43:13.140 --> 43:15.300
You can send an HTTP request with a web hook,

43:15.300 --> 43:16.540
like whatever you need.

43:16.540 --> 43:19.420
So now we've got that tied back into the Home Assistant we just

43:19.420 --> 43:20.860
got set up at the studio.

43:20.860 --> 43:24.180
Now Motion, as the name implies, is

43:24.180 --> 43:27.820
watching a camera feed for motion,

43:27.820 --> 43:29.660
and then it is triggering an event when

43:29.660 --> 43:31.300
it's detected in that frame.

43:31.300 --> 43:34.820
It's then essentially notifying our Home Assistant install

43:34.820 --> 43:36.300
that an event has happened.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.900
And then what are we doing after Home Assistant becomes aware

43:38.900 --> 43:40.180
that Motion's been detected?

43:40.180 --> 43:41.680
Well, then you can do whatever you want.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.820
Home Assistant's got some neat automation support, right?

43:43.820 --> 43:45.940
So you can have it trigger off a state of something

43:45.940 --> 43:49.260
attached on your network, or it has its own web hook provider.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.140
So once the web comes in, you can then

43:51.140 --> 43:52.620
interact with anything else you want.

43:52.620 --> 43:54.460
In our case, we're just having it turn off and on the light

43:54.460 --> 43:55.380
when we enter a room.

43:55.380 --> 43:57.300
But that was just a test case.

43:57.300 --> 44:02.460
Yeah, we just quickly just grabbed a random old Wemo

44:02.460 --> 44:05.380
smart plug that hadn't been used in probably two years

44:05.380 --> 44:07.060
and plugged it in, got it updated.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.420
Home Assistant detected it.

44:08.420 --> 44:11.420
Wes got it working after getting a manual Wemo integration

44:11.420 --> 44:13.260
set up, which didn't take him too long.

44:13.260 --> 44:14.840
And then it was just a device that you

44:14.840 --> 44:16.580
could include in your overall actions

44:16.580 --> 44:17.340
when something happens.

44:17.340 --> 44:17.580
Yeah.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.620
I've only been using this just in the past couple of days.

44:19.620 --> 44:22.300
But it is nice in that you can support just regular old

44:22.300 --> 44:25.980
devices that are supported on Linux, plugged in over USB.

44:25.980 --> 44:29.020
Or you can do stuff like RTMP or RTSP.

44:29.020 --> 44:31.820
And if maybe you're not an expert with those things,

44:31.820 --> 44:35.260
if you're running MotionEye on multiple systems,

44:35.260 --> 44:36.100
you can interconnect.

44:36.100 --> 44:38.460
It basically exposes that video as a stream outside, too.

44:38.460 --> 44:40.700
So you can connect them all together however you need.

44:40.700 --> 44:43.020
And here's where it gets pretty neat.

44:43.020 --> 44:45.500
So it gives you a lot of options.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.460
First of all, it's clear how you could use this

44:47.460 --> 44:48.740
in a security scenario.

44:48.740 --> 44:50.120
Sure.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.660
It's also nice from a safety scenario.

44:51.660 --> 44:53.820
You have lights turn on when you enter a room.

44:53.820 --> 44:57.620
But what I'm ultimately going for is presence awareness.

44:57.620 --> 44:59.820
And I want multiple levels of presence awareness.

44:59.820 --> 45:02.600
I want motion detectors to know when I'm in a certain room.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.500
I want a location service that notifies Home Assistant.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.740
I want Home Assistant to be communicating with my garage

45:07.740 --> 45:10.300
door so when the garage door at the studio is opened.

45:10.300 --> 45:11.720
All these are different data points

45:11.720 --> 45:13.300
that I can use to automate things.

45:13.300 --> 45:16.780
But you can also use a system like this

45:16.780 --> 45:21.700
in a really relatively low-fi, low-key sort of security

45:21.700 --> 45:22.860
implementation.

45:22.860 --> 45:27.820
So the use case for us is I have a property with a barn on it.

45:27.820 --> 45:28.660
It's family property.

45:28.660 --> 45:31.420
And often when I'm traveling, we like to keep an eye on it.

45:31.420 --> 45:33.900
And I could deploy these Raspberry Pis.

45:33.900 --> 45:36.140
In this case, I only need to monitor two spots.

45:36.140 --> 45:39.700
So one spot, I could physically place the Raspberry Pi

45:39.700 --> 45:41.220
and put a camera on a door.

45:41.220 --> 45:43.340
And if motion's detected, it can alert me.

45:43.340 --> 45:45.820
And there's another spot that's about, well,

45:45.820 --> 45:47.540
it's really on the other side of the barn.

45:47.540 --> 45:50.380
So it's a distance where I could put a network camera that

45:50.380 --> 45:54.980
could feed Motion Eye over RTSP.

45:54.980 --> 45:56.860
Because it can take in video for Linux.

45:56.860 --> 45:59.740
It can take in the Pi camera module itself.

45:59.740 --> 46:02.740
Or it can take in an RTSP stream.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.780
And so that's a lot of different cameras.

46:04.780 --> 46:06.420
You could all of a sudden pull into this thing

46:06.420 --> 46:07.700
and start watching for motion.

46:07.700 --> 46:10.940
And so with a relatively small setup, one Raspberry Pi 4,

46:10.940 --> 46:14.380
and I take my Ting MiFi and have this thing sitting there.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.140
So if I need to access it or it needs to send me an alert,

46:17.140 --> 46:17.980
it has internet.

46:17.980 --> 46:19.780
But because everything would be on the Pi,

46:19.780 --> 46:21.860
it wouldn't be using the internet otherwise.

46:21.860 --> 46:23.420
There's no cloud connectivity.

46:23.420 --> 46:25.380
And it can do some of those other similar things.

46:25.380 --> 46:26.940
You can have it export a movie, say,

46:26.940 --> 46:29.660
of an x amount of time around when the motion was detected.

46:29.660 --> 46:31.820
It can send you an email when it does detect motion.

46:31.820 --> 46:33.620
So I can get the picture sent to me.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.580
Yeah, you can get a still picture.

46:34.580 --> 46:36.700
So it's a great way to keep an eye on things

46:36.700 --> 46:39.340
at the barn for a pretty low price.

46:39.340 --> 46:40.540
I've already got the cameras.

46:40.540 --> 46:44.020
It's a webcam and an old, crappy, wireless camera

46:44.020 --> 46:45.900
from like 10 years ago.

46:45.900 --> 46:48.660
But you know, it's good enough to detect motion.

46:48.660 --> 46:49.740
And it pivots.

46:49.740 --> 46:50.460
It moves around.

46:50.460 --> 46:53.260
So it's actually kind of a perfect use for this.

46:53.260 --> 46:55.300
And I'm not using it for anything else.

46:55.300 --> 46:57.740
So I actually think this would be a great use for it.

46:57.740 --> 47:00.340
And I wouldn't want to put an x86 PC in a barn

47:00.340 --> 47:01.380
that I'm not at.

47:01.380 --> 47:03.620
But there's a perfect shelf that has a power plug there

47:03.620 --> 47:04.940
that I can put this on.

47:04.940 --> 47:06.980
I have a Ting MiFi that I'm not using right now

47:06.980 --> 47:08.340
that I'll just set right next to it.

47:08.340 --> 47:09.880
So it always has internet connectivity

47:09.880 --> 47:11.300
whether I'm there or not.

47:11.300 --> 47:12.420
Nice to have a little box too, right?

47:12.420 --> 47:15.340
You can SSH in there if you need to for some reason.

47:15.340 --> 47:15.940
Some here.

47:15.940 --> 47:17.260
It's like you're there.

47:17.260 --> 47:21.180
Does motion allow you to stream multiple cameras at once?

47:21.180 --> 47:27.380
And does motion also allow you to have multiple accounts

47:27.380 --> 47:30.740
creation so that you can, let's say, group cameras

47:30.740 --> 47:34.060
or restrict cameras to user level access?

47:34.060 --> 47:38.180
So let's say if I wanted my mom to have access

47:38.180 --> 47:41.460
to my outdoor cameras but not the indoor cameras,

47:41.460 --> 47:43.340
I could set up an account within Shinobi

47:43.340 --> 47:49.020
to only limit her to see these specific cameras.

47:49.020 --> 47:53.780
And she could even add in her own cameras with her own link.

47:53.780 --> 47:57.220
This is a second recommendation for Shinobi from me.

47:57.220 --> 48:00.460
And a little bit of secret information.

48:00.460 --> 48:04.100
Linux server will be releasing a Docker of Shinobi pretty soon.

48:04.100 --> 48:04.660
That's great.

48:04.660 --> 48:05.820
That's great.

48:05.820 --> 48:09.420
Yeah, so the MotionEye web software

48:09.420 --> 48:11.080
will allow you to add multiple cameras.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.540
Does it do users though, Wes?

48:12.540 --> 48:13.380
It has some users.

48:13.380 --> 48:14.380
I've not played with that yet.

48:14.380 --> 48:15.380
So it might be something to look into.

48:15.380 --> 48:17.140
I kind of wonder if, see, I think

48:17.140 --> 48:19.180
we have two different use cases here, really.

48:19.180 --> 48:21.020
Because motion for us, the primary use case

48:21.020 --> 48:24.140
we're trying to get out of it is motion detection in a video

48:24.140 --> 48:26.340
to then trigger automation events.

48:26.340 --> 48:29.820
I think if you're looking for actual surveillance footage.

48:29.820 --> 48:32.460
More CCTV stuff, Shinobi seems like it's just great.

48:32.460 --> 48:33.460
Right.

48:33.460 --> 48:34.740
I'm not really going for that.

48:34.740 --> 48:36.580
I'm not going to be reviewing the footage.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.260
I don't want to watch people.

48:38.260 --> 48:42.780
I just want to use webcams that I have as a motion sensor

48:42.780 --> 48:44.380
to trigger further automation.

48:44.380 --> 48:45.580
So that's why it's nice for me.

48:45.580 --> 48:48.020
I'm pretty sure that Shinobi can also

48:48.020 --> 48:52.060
do that, where you can tie into it, like the, what is it,

48:52.060 --> 48:53.700
the IFTT or whatever.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.320
Yeah, they may have like a webhook thing.

48:55.320 --> 48:56.220
That'd be awesome.

48:56.220 --> 48:57.700
If there was only a container of it

48:57.700 --> 48:59.300
that I could try out right now.

48:59.300 --> 49:01.060
Oh, jeez.

49:01.060 --> 49:01.660
Well, there is.

49:01.660 --> 49:02.820
Shinobi might one as well.

49:02.820 --> 49:06.220
But Linux serve, obviously, the permissions thing.

49:06.220 --> 49:07.300
And we might give it a go.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.540
You know, it wouldn't be bad.

49:08.540 --> 49:11.420
It wouldn't be bad to have both, right?

49:11.420 --> 49:12.860
I think the nice thing about motion

49:12.860 --> 49:14.660
that I liked a lot about it was that it was just

49:14.660 --> 49:16.260
a really quick install from the repos,

49:16.260 --> 49:17.500
and now we have motion detection.

49:17.500 --> 49:18.860
Yeah, like looking at some of the Shinobi docs,

49:18.860 --> 49:21.100
it seems like just fine there is motion detection,

49:21.100 --> 49:22.620
but there's a little more going on.

49:22.620 --> 49:25.060
And probably this isn't the best or most sophisticated motion

49:25.060 --> 49:25.740
detection, but you're right.

49:25.740 --> 49:28.220
It kind of hit the sweet spot of installed it straight

49:28.220 --> 49:30.340
from the repo, not a lot of dependencies.

49:30.340 --> 49:32.220
And I mean, it's worked for us so far.

49:32.220 --> 49:33.500
And you can throw it on a Raspberry Pi.

49:33.500 --> 49:36.380
I mean, we have a stack of Raspberry Pis around here.

49:36.380 --> 49:37.700
The Pi 4 is doing great.

49:37.700 --> 49:39.860
I'm watching a 30 FPS video.

49:39.860 --> 49:41.980
It's streaming right now from the camera, no problem.

49:41.980 --> 49:42.740
That's what I'm saying.

49:42.740 --> 49:44.180
It's like the Pi 4 has the horsepower

49:44.180 --> 49:45.620
now to do some of this camera stuff

49:45.620 --> 49:48.500
and really keep up with the networking too, which is nice.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.840
Have you considered doing something like a Kubernetes

49:50.840 --> 49:52.980
cluster with them?

49:52.980 --> 49:55.540
I mean, have I considered it?

49:55.540 --> 49:56.060
No.

49:56.060 --> 49:58.060
Am I aware that people are maniacs like that?

49:58.060 --> 50:00.340
Yes, I am aware.

50:00.340 --> 50:02.620
I mean, I guess if you had a whole bunch of Pi apps

50:02.620 --> 50:03.860
you wanted to run, why not?

50:03.860 --> 50:05.820
Well, it's a great educational opportunity too.

50:05.820 --> 50:07.700
It is just great for that.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.540
So yeah, so there are a couple of things

50:09.540 --> 50:11.340
you need to know if you're thinking about buying one.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.180
Because I know some people are waiting for them

50:13.180 --> 50:15.460
to be more generally available.

50:15.460 --> 50:17.860
As you heard us mention, USB boot doesn't work yet.

50:17.860 --> 50:19.580
Also, Pixie boot does not work.

50:19.580 --> 50:20.700
They say that's coming.

50:20.700 --> 50:21.460
Oh, nice.

50:21.460 --> 50:25.620
Some USB-C chargers don't work, specifically the smarter ones.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.380
So watch out for that.

50:27.380 --> 50:30.540
Just for now, get an official one.

50:30.540 --> 50:34.260
And in general, it's more prone to throttling.

50:34.260 --> 50:38.420
Ours, the desktop kit, comes in a plastic case.

50:38.420 --> 50:40.540
And when I started benchmarking it the first day,

50:40.540 --> 50:44.420
it made the entire room stink of plastic.

50:44.420 --> 50:47.100
Because it had heated up the plastic molding.

50:47.100 --> 50:51.060
And as the plastic heated, it released that chemical smell.

50:51.060 --> 50:55.940
And even today, a week later, when I open up the Raspberry

50:55.940 --> 50:57.460
Pi to see if it had a cooler or not,

50:57.460 --> 50:59.860
because I couldn't remember, which it does not,

50:59.860 --> 51:02.020
I got a big face full of that plastic smell.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.580
It's running hot.

51:03.580 --> 51:06.580
And around four minutes of it running out full blast,

51:06.580 --> 51:09.020
it starts throttling pretty noticeably.

51:09.020 --> 51:11.460
That said, if you're browsing the web,

51:11.460 --> 51:13.860
you're doing stuff like bursty here and there,

51:13.860 --> 51:15.260
you generally don't even see it.

51:15.260 --> 51:16.340
It's not a huge deal.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.060
You throw a proper cooler on that thing,

51:18.060 --> 51:20.140
you'll get even more mileage out of it.

51:20.140 --> 51:24.500
And the 4 gig RAM edition is very hard to get your hands on.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.860
The 2 gig and 1 gig are much more readily available right

51:26.860 --> 51:27.500
now.

51:27.500 --> 51:29.180
Keep in mind, when Raspbian ships on it,

51:29.180 --> 51:32.560
it's shipping in 32-bit, even though it's a 64-bit processor.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.260
You only got 4 gigs of RAM anyways, though,

51:34.260 --> 51:35.980
so it doesn't really matter.

51:35.980 --> 51:39.980
Overall, I think it is probably my favorite Raspberry Pi.

51:39.980 --> 51:42.220
And I asked the audience what they're using theirs for.

51:42.220 --> 51:45.340
Seth says that these days, he uses one as a print server

51:45.340 --> 51:47.700
for his i3D printer.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.140
He uses Octopi.

51:49.140 --> 51:52.340
And I think I've heard a few people say they use it for that.

51:52.340 --> 51:56.060
Lenny says he uses his Raspberry Pi as a transmission server.

51:56.060 --> 51:57.140
Oh, nice.

51:57.140 --> 51:58.420
This is a good use for that.

51:58.420 --> 52:01.940
Of course, several people wrote in and said they use Kodi.

52:01.940 --> 52:03.020
They use it for Kodi.

52:03.020 --> 52:04.220
Absolutely.

52:04.220 --> 52:06.020
Which was my first go-to, but I was like,

52:06.020 --> 52:08.220
no, I want to come up with something that's not Kodi.

52:08.220 --> 52:10.340
Because that's like everybody expects that.

52:10.340 --> 52:11.820
I thought this one was interesting.

52:11.820 --> 52:14.740
Salton says he uses it as a co-turn server.

52:14.740 --> 52:18.060
And he's planning to set up also to use it as a NextCloud Talk

52:18.060 --> 52:19.140
server in the future.

52:19.140 --> 52:22.220
And he uses his other Raspberry Pi as a Kodi box.

52:22.220 --> 52:23.100
Excellent.

52:23.100 --> 52:24.820
I'm sure it runs PyHole just great, too.

52:24.820 --> 52:26.380
Yeah, lots of PyHoles came in.

52:26.380 --> 52:29.300
And then Lewis said Cheesy uses it

52:29.300 --> 52:33.540
as an SSH server, which he then hops to the other boxes.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.780
Also, the other one is a Plex server.

52:35.780 --> 52:39.580
And another one, dang, as NextCloud NAS.

52:39.580 --> 52:43.060
And to your point, Alex, planning

52:43.060 --> 52:46.780
to eventually set up a four-node Kubernetes Pi cluster.

52:46.780 --> 52:47.340
Beautiful.

52:47.340 --> 52:47.840
Nice.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.180
And you can't forget the PyHole either, you know?

52:50.180 --> 52:51.580
No, you've got to have the PyHole.

52:51.580 --> 52:52.460
We've talked about that.

52:52.460 --> 52:53.500
The only reason I didn't bring it up

52:53.500 --> 52:55.180
is because we did a whole episode on it.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.900
So that's in the back catalog.

52:56.900 --> 52:58.340
But worth checking out if you don't

52:58.340 --> 53:00.100
know what we're talking about.

53:00.100 --> 53:02.460
That's also a very good use for the Raspberry Pi.

53:02.460 --> 53:06.180
So check out my links when we're in the benchmark sections

53:06.180 --> 53:06.940
of the show notes.

53:06.940 --> 53:10.580
Because that's where you can get my particular tests

53:10.580 --> 53:11.700
that you can compare.

53:11.700 --> 53:14.400
One of the really, really neat things about the Open Benchmark

53:14.400 --> 53:18.940
website is they have a big old identifier hash

53:18.940 --> 53:21.040
at the end of the URL.

53:21.040 --> 53:25.960
You can copy that and do a comma and append it to another one.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.100
And you can compare any system that way.

53:29.100 --> 53:31.860
And you can add another comma and compare another one.

53:31.860 --> 53:34.020
And the website will generate the charts and graphs

53:34.020 --> 53:36.140
to show you all the different systems.

53:36.140 --> 53:37.540
So it's really nice.

53:37.540 --> 53:39.380
If you've done some benchmarks in the past,

53:39.380 --> 53:41.420
you can just go grab my test ID and my identifier

53:41.420 --> 53:42.940
and then just add a comma, paste it in there,

53:42.940 --> 53:45.700
compare it to yours, see if it's worth an upgrade.

53:45.700 --> 53:48.060
You can just see it right there.

53:48.060 --> 53:50.220
And it's funny because I have my own.

53:50.220 --> 53:52.060
I compared it to some of my old systems

53:52.060 --> 53:54.420
that we've had in for review over the years that

53:54.420 --> 53:56.860
are up on Open Benchmark, just to kind of see where it was.

53:56.860 --> 53:57.380
That's fantastic.

53:57.380 --> 53:58.880
So I could kind of get an idea, like,

53:58.880 --> 54:00.940
where does it land in the generation of intels?

54:00.940 --> 54:01.940
And that's pretty neat.

54:01.940 --> 54:02.820
That's all in there.

54:02.820 --> 54:04.180
All right.

54:04.180 --> 54:08.260
One last bit of business before we get out of here.

54:08.260 --> 54:10.900
We have a pic that we've been sitting on for a little while.

54:10.900 --> 54:14.260
Like, this pic needs a round of applause.

54:14.260 --> 54:16.100
It's so good because it's finally

54:16.100 --> 54:18.940
broken us of the Google Docs habit.

54:18.940 --> 54:24.220
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Kodi MD.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.380
The funny part here is I was just going to go look this up.

54:26.380 --> 54:27.680
I wanted to pull the link up for myself

54:27.680 --> 54:28.340
as we're doing the show.

54:28.340 --> 54:30.140
But of course, you're doing it from Kodi MD.

54:30.140 --> 54:30.940
Yeah, I am.

54:30.940 --> 54:35.980
It's a real-time collaborative markdown editor

54:35.980 --> 54:37.980
that is a web-based application.

54:37.980 --> 54:40.660
And its collaborative editing is better than Google Docs.

54:40.660 --> 54:42.260
And one of my favorite things about it,

54:42.260 --> 54:45.460
it has three editing modes, Sublime, Emacs, and Vim,

54:45.460 --> 54:46.420
which is amazing.

54:46.420 --> 54:48.660
You should see Wes whip around this thing in Vim mode.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.180
It's great.

54:49.180 --> 54:50.740
Oh, it's beautiful.

54:50.740 --> 54:52.340
And we've been trying it out internally

54:52.340 --> 54:56.700
because, honestly, we've been down this road 100 times

54:56.700 --> 55:01.540
and ended up back in the embrace of Google Docs.

55:01.540 --> 55:04.540
But being able to self-host this one in particular

55:04.540 --> 55:07.900
on our own system, the real-time updates

55:07.900 --> 55:11.860
are better than Google Docs, the great support for markdown,

55:11.860 --> 55:14.540
the multiple editing modes, including you've

55:14.540 --> 55:16.540
got markdown split pane mode with markdown

55:16.540 --> 55:18.980
on one side, real-time update and rendering

55:18.980 --> 55:20.580
on the other side.

55:20.580 --> 55:23.180
It works for the way I tend to do live shows, where

55:23.180 --> 55:25.580
I need links in a certain format where I can click on them

55:25.580 --> 55:26.860
while I'm talking.

55:26.860 --> 55:28.920
So it checks boxes that I have personally

55:28.920 --> 55:30.420
for how I present on air.

55:30.420 --> 55:33.580
But it's also just such a great editor

55:33.580 --> 55:36.500
that I use it for just my general notes.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.980
And I'm seeing more and more.

55:37.980 --> 55:38.900
It's just taking off.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.700
I'm seeing more and more people use it.

55:40.700 --> 55:42.620
I'm seeing open source projects start to use it.

55:42.620 --> 55:44.620
I'm seeing podcasts that are using it.

55:44.620 --> 55:45.820
It's a really good tool.

55:45.820 --> 55:47.460
And I think it's just time we gave it some love,

55:47.460 --> 55:49.100
because we've been using it internally,

55:49.100 --> 55:50.500
kind of holding our breath.

55:50.500 --> 55:52.220
I mean, initially, like literally,

55:52.220 --> 55:54.700
I think the words you use when you put it up on our system

55:54.700 --> 55:56.420
was, well, I tossed it up on there.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.940
So I mean, I think it's working.

55:58.940 --> 56:02.940
And then we just started using it, and we have not gone back.

56:02.940 --> 56:04.780
And it's been a while now.

56:04.780 --> 56:06.500
So check out KodiMD.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.200
I think their name is about to change.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.820
And so keep an eye out for that, but we'll

56:10.820 --> 56:11.660
have a link in the show notes.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.620
I've seen some.

56:12.620 --> 56:13.980
I followed one of their change logs,

56:13.980 --> 56:15.860
and they're talking about a name change in there.

56:15.860 --> 56:16.620
I don't know.

56:16.620 --> 56:17.300
I don't know.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.740
Well, and it should be said, too,

56:18.740 --> 56:21.540
that I think we've had up to seven or eight people

56:21.540 --> 56:25.580
collaborating on one document at one time in real time,

56:25.580 --> 56:27.580
seven people on one document.

56:27.580 --> 56:29.460
There's been zero hiccups.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.880
No, you know, they're all working.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.260
Especially if they're not in a different area of the doc

56:33.260 --> 56:34.060
futzing with stuff.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.620
You just keep going.

56:36.620 --> 56:40.700
And then our last pick, TopGrade,

56:40.700 --> 56:42.880
which upgrades everything.

56:42.880 --> 56:43.780
Who found this one?

56:43.780 --> 56:44.740
That'd be me.

56:44.740 --> 56:45.540
Yeah, all right, Cheesy.

56:45.540 --> 56:46.340
Tell me about this.

56:46.340 --> 56:47.100
Lazy Chees.

56:47.100 --> 56:51.580
So TopGrade, essentially, we all install all of the things

56:51.580 --> 56:53.180
on our systems.

56:53.180 --> 56:57.700
TopGrade supports Arch, Red Hat, Debian, Gentoo, Soos,

56:57.700 --> 57:02.700
Void, Dragonfly, the BSDs, Mac OS, and Windows.

57:02.700 --> 57:06.060
And it basically will update all of the things.

57:06.060 --> 57:16.020
So whether that be PIP package or Vim, Neo Vim packages,

57:16.020 --> 57:21.380
Python from PIPX, just regular updates, ZHS shell updates.

57:21.380 --> 57:25.060
I mean, everything you could want to do, essentially.

57:25.060 --> 57:28.580
Upgrades for your Windows subsystem for Linux

57:28.580 --> 57:29.860
under Windows.

57:29.860 --> 57:34.380
So basically one tool to kind of rule them all as far

57:34.380 --> 57:37.180
as updating your system and keeping it up to date.

57:37.180 --> 57:39.420
OK, this sounds actually pretty sweet.

57:39.420 --> 57:41.220
Yeah, I was going to mock you for like,

57:41.220 --> 57:43.100
is this like a meta package manager?

57:43.100 --> 57:45.620
Wait, also, it's written in Rust.

57:45.620 --> 57:46.620
All right, well, I'm in.

57:46.620 --> 57:46.980
I'm done.

57:46.980 --> 57:47.420
That's it.

57:47.420 --> 57:47.740
That's it.

57:47.740 --> 57:48.420
That's all I needed.

57:48.420 --> 57:49.780
There you have it right there.

57:49.780 --> 57:53.140
Atom packages, Flatpak, Snaps, so all of the things, man.

57:53.140 --> 57:54.700
I hadn't really appreciated the fact

57:54.700 --> 57:57.660
that I got to run several different updaters now.

57:57.660 --> 57:58.700
You're right.

57:58.700 --> 57:59.980
That's really annoying.

57:59.980 --> 58:01.260
And this does solve that.

58:01.260 --> 58:04.980
Jeez, you solved a problem before I knew it was a problem.

58:04.980 --> 58:08.300
I knew I hired you for a reason.

58:08.300 --> 58:10.300
All right, well, there you have it, everybody.

58:10.300 --> 58:12.540
Popey was in and out, so I think that means he's probably

58:12.540 --> 58:14.620
going to be back on the Ubuntu podcast very soon.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.220
So if you haven't caught that recently,

58:16.220 --> 58:19.460
go check that out at ubuntupodcast.org.

58:19.460 --> 58:22.380
And he's also on my favorite podcast in the whole world,

58:22.380 --> 58:23.180
User Air.

58:23.180 --> 58:26.580
So go check that out at, is it air.show or user air.show?

58:26.580 --> 58:27.620
Air.show.

58:27.620 --> 58:28.140
Air.show.

58:28.140 --> 58:29.020
See, I don't know, because I just

58:29.020 --> 58:29.860
subscribed to my podcast player.

58:29.860 --> 58:30.820
That's way easier.

58:30.820 --> 58:31.980
It is.

58:31.980 --> 58:33.660
You can also do that for this show.

58:33.660 --> 58:36.420
In fact, would you believe this here show

58:36.420 --> 58:39.820
is in the top 60 technology podcasts on all of iTunes

58:39.820 --> 58:40.980
in the US very frequently?

58:40.980 --> 58:41.700
Say what?

58:41.700 --> 58:42.980
I can't say top 50 yet.

58:42.980 --> 58:43.980
But we could crack it.

58:43.980 --> 58:45.540
If you go over there and give us a thumbs up

58:45.540 --> 58:48.020
and a review on iTunes, and I know only a few of you use it.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.060
If you use Apple Podcasts, more of you use that.

58:50.060 --> 58:51.460
We could use your help.

58:51.460 --> 58:54.140
We may crack the top 50 in all tech podcasts

58:54.140 --> 58:55.580
in the United States.

58:55.580 --> 58:57.660
And we're crushing it in some other countries too.

58:57.660 --> 58:59.860
So actually, call out to those of you outside the US.

58:59.860 --> 59:00.700
Amazing.

59:00.700 --> 59:01.020
I know.

59:01.020 --> 59:02.140
It's actually really neat.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.540
Help spread the good word to Linux.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.900
It's called Humble Linux Podcast.

59:04.900 --> 59:05.580
All right.

59:05.580 --> 59:07.100
See you back here next Tuesday.

59:07.100 --> 59:07.620
Ah!

59:07.620 --> 59:31.580
Thank you so much for listening!

59:37.620 --> 59:46.140
All right, let's pick our title.

59:46.140 --> 59:48.820
You know, I just ran download because it's Rust, right?

59:48.820 --> 59:52.720
So you just download the tar and there's a single executable in there and away you go.

59:52.720 --> 59:53.900
So it's upgrading all my things.

59:53.900 --> 59:58.700
I'm not even sure I know how to really update Emacs packages, you know, by hand, but that's

59:58.700 --> 59:59.700
fine now because they're done.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.700
I'm going to try it on my Fedora box.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.700
And here's all the gems.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700
All right.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700
Wow.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700
Really?

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.700
That's pretty neat.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700
Yeah.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.260
So I was about to give cheese a hard time for not using Ansible or something, and then

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.620
I actually read what it did and then shut up because that is amazing.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620
Good job.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.620
Good find.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.740
Well, you know, I know that I've ran into that problem where, you know, I've had additional

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:24.060
pip packages or something that I've installed and yeah, no one checks those things.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.060
No, right.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.060
Yeah.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.380
Like, you know, I'll have to update whatever I'll, you know, and but I never think to update

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.380
that pip package.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:35.080
So having something that I can just boom, any package that's essentially on the system

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080
gets updated.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.900
And I didn't run brew upgrade on my Mac for a year plus.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.740
The only time I ever update YouTube DL is when it fails to download.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.740
Oh, right.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.740
I need to go update that.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740
So now it's on.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.740
I'm on like the YouTube DL direct track.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.740
Yes.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.740
Getting the good stuff direct.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.740
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.100
Well, I wasn't exaggerating.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:58.100
I feel like like this, the stuff that just we just touched the surface of Home Assistant

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.020
and it was like like a new world has opened up to me.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.020
I'm wow.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.020
Yeah, man.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.740
And I told you in my talk at Linux Fest Northwest, right?

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.740
I know.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.700
You have to solve a real world problem.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.940
And then it's just like your eyes just light up and you're like, this is amazing.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.020
It's like I talked about just kind of like a revelation I had with Docker and containers

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020
on Coder recently.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.460
It's like when I get my hands on it, like there's the practical and then there's the

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.460
hands on.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:29.660
And when you go hands on, it's for me, it's just a whole nother level of appreciation

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.660
and fascination.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.980
It's direct meaning, you know, you can actually see it's solving problems that you couldn't

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980
solve before.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.220
Well, Poppy, it was great to have you on the show today.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.220
Welcome back, sir.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.220
How was the travel?

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220
It was good.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.220
Suffering from jet lag.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.220
It's too late.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.220
It's gone.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.220
No, it's gone.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.220
We'll just do it.

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.220
Do you want to?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.220
I mean, if you if you can join us on the Chrome app, if you want, but then you just have to

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.780
record locally is the only downside.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.780
No.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.780
No.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.780
All right.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.780
Well, it was good having you.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.780
Linux sucks.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.780
Yeah.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.780
That's it.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.780
I'm switching to Windows.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780
All right.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.780
Well, it was good seeing you.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.780
Glad you could join us.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.780
If you can get installed by the end of the show, come back on.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.780
Love you all.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:33.780
Love you, Poppy.
