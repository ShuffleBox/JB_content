00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Not to start two shows out in a row with a system D joke,

00:02.880 --> 00:05.640
but Knoppix 8.6 is out,

00:05.640 --> 00:08.040
the new release is based on Debian 10 Buster,

00:08.040 --> 00:10.640
and they've ripped out that system D.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.800
Well, yeah, I mean, you just write whatever you want

00:12.800 --> 00:14.560
in etsyrc.local, Chris.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.560
It's easy.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.960
You don't need a system D unit.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.960
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

00:26.800 --> 00:28.600
your weekly Linux talk show.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.440
My name is Chris.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.280
My name is Wes.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.360
Hello, Mr. Payne, and let's not wait another moment.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.200
Let's bring Brent in too.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.020
Hey, Brent.

00:35.020 --> 00:35.860
Hello.

00:35.860 --> 00:36.680
In studio.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.520
Nice to see you.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.340
Always good to be here.

00:38.340 --> 00:39.360
Nice to see you.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.240
Good to have both of you here,

00:40.240 --> 00:45.240
and of course, we've got Cheesy, Alex, and Drew as well.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.240
Hello, gentlemen.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.200
Hello.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.320
Miss you guys.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.800
I miss you too.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.640
Yeah.

00:51.640 --> 00:52.580
So they're not in studio with us,

00:52.580 --> 00:53.700
but they were last week.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.720
Everybody was in studio last week.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.280
I mean, this is the next best thing.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.520
At least we get to hear each other.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.600
Yeah, it is nice.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.200
I mean, this is what we're familiar with.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.480
We have post-sprint depression right now.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.320
A little bit.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.040
It's nice to have Brent still here

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
cooking me brunch though.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.800
Like, that's kind of helped smooth out the transition.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.960
So I appreciate that, Brent.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.240
It's a community service, really.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.080
It is.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.440
Keeping your podcaster happy keeps the shows good.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.240
And of course, our virtual lug is here.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.020
Hello.

01:20.020 --> 01:20.960
Hello.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.160
Hello.

01:22.160 --> 01:22.980
Hello.

01:22.980 --> 01:23.820
Hello, good to see you.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.440
Bite and Dill's in there, hello.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.360
And of course, Mini Mac as well,

01:27.360 --> 01:29.280
and more joining as the show goes on.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.100
That's cool.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.120
Full house today, I love it.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.360
The Mumble Room is always available

01:32.360 --> 01:33.480
if you'd like to participate.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.080
And we start this week with some community news, as always.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.560
And it's a big headline from System76.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.720
They have a new firmware manager

01:41.720 --> 01:46.720
that updates both from their own repository and from LVFS.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.800
Each components, the System76 firmware

01:50.800 --> 01:53.160
and the LVFS component are also removable.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.620
So if you wanted to deploy this graphical firmware

01:55.620 --> 01:58.560
update tool they've built in Rust, by the way,

01:58.560 --> 02:01.080
you could actually remove the System76 component

02:01.080 --> 02:03.060
and just use it anywhere.

02:03.060 --> 02:05.940
But the beauty is for System76 customers,

02:05.940 --> 02:09.920
they'll now have a central location in GNOME settings

02:09.920 --> 02:12.320
to update both LVFS firmwares

02:12.320 --> 02:14.240
and their vendor-specific firmwares.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.480
And this is important for them in particular

02:17.480 --> 02:20.040
and other distributions like elementary

02:20.040 --> 02:21.560
because they don't use GNOME software.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.320
Right, if you just happen to be one of those distros

02:23.320 --> 02:25.840
that has your own application center,

02:25.840 --> 02:27.840
there wasn't really a solution before this.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.720
This is pretty neat, the way they've built this,

02:29.720 --> 02:32.760
making the System76 part modular.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.600
I like that.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.420
I mean, I think it shows,

02:34.420 --> 02:36.320
that was kind of one of our big criticisms.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.240
It was great that they were managing firmware,

02:38.240 --> 02:39.420
getting it updated,

02:39.420 --> 02:41.720
but there were kind of two players in this space

02:41.720 --> 02:44.080
and okay, maybe they don't have to perfectly mesh,

02:44.080 --> 02:45.560
but at least now we're playing ball

02:45.560 --> 02:47.720
in a polite and friendly, open way.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.640
I think the question has been,

02:48.640 --> 02:50.800
well, why not just use LVFS completely?

02:50.800 --> 02:51.640
Yes.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.200
And my understanding is that's just not quite possible

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
with the current upstream OEM hardware

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
provided that they have.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.280
I mean, you can imagine,

02:58.280 --> 02:59.720
we'd see Apple all the time as an example.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.000
Sometimes it's nice to have control of the complete stack

03:02.000 --> 03:03.320
that you're working and building on.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.280
So they seem to have found something here

03:05.280 --> 03:07.260
that is a nice,

03:07.260 --> 03:09.380
actually, I would say this is above and beyond

03:09.380 --> 03:11.520
what you would expect because it's open source,

03:11.520 --> 03:13.980
it's well engineered, it follows best practices,

03:13.980 --> 03:16.400
it's completely open source up on GitHub,

03:16.400 --> 03:18.800
and it is available in a way

03:18.800 --> 03:21.420
in which you can remove the System76 components

03:21.420 --> 03:23.220
completely, they didn't need to do that.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.440
No, it's like a generically useful open source application.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.720
And it's designed in such a way

03:27.720 --> 03:29.060
that it plugs into GNOME settings,

03:29.060 --> 03:30.480
like it's just part of GNOME settings,

03:30.480 --> 03:33.600
or it can be a standalone GTK application as well.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.780
And the back end is toolkit agnostic,

03:36.780 --> 03:39.840
so if someone wanted to write acute front end,

03:39.840 --> 03:42.160
they could, they would just need to submit the patches.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.960
That's what you mean by well engineered.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.080
It really, it's pretty neat.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.240
So I had a couple of questions.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.860
So I contacted Carl, the CEO of System76,

03:49.860 --> 03:52.920
and I had basically a big picture question

03:52.920 --> 03:55.220
and an implementation detail question.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.080
And I think his email, I'll just read it to you,

03:57.080 --> 03:59.220
he says, so far the coverage has been pretty accurate,

03:59.220 --> 04:00.060
which is great to see,

04:00.060 --> 04:02.680
because I always like to ask when I contact people,

04:02.680 --> 04:05.100
how have you felt the coverage has represented

04:05.100 --> 04:06.540
the accuracy so far?

04:06.540 --> 04:09.080
Because that's a great way to ask them,

04:09.080 --> 04:11.040
like, what are people getting wrong

04:11.040 --> 04:12.200
that you'd like to respond to?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.220
And you get a little insight into their thought process too.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.620
I feel like it's a very revealing question.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.260
And he writes, so far the coverage has been pretty accurate,

04:21.260 --> 04:23.360
and they clarified some of the confusion

04:23.360 --> 04:25.620
about distribution and repackaging,

04:25.620 --> 04:26.960
which was a big part of the question.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.720
But he says, most importantly,

04:28.720 --> 04:30.460
I want to stress that the feature only requires

04:30.460 --> 04:32.440
a small set of standard dependency support

04:32.440 --> 04:34.720
for either firmware from us or LVFS,

04:34.720 --> 04:35.960
which I think is awesome.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.500
And then I asked him about a tweet,

04:37.500 --> 04:40.780
because Carl had tweeted that this was the beginning

04:40.780 --> 04:44.220
of System76 becoming a bigger software player.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.240
And I asked him if he saw a future

04:46.240 --> 04:48.980
where Pop OS could potentially have more users

04:48.980 --> 04:50.720
than they have hardware customers.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.300
And this firmware manager could get adopted

04:55.300 --> 04:58.980
by distros like elementary and others that use GTK,

04:58.980 --> 05:01.220
but don't use GNOME software.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.100
I could see that really taking off actually.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.260
People love Rust is so in right now.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.940
So something built in Rust grabs attention.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.640
It also just means they'll probably be able to ship

05:09.640 --> 05:11.580
an easily installable package, right?

05:11.580 --> 05:14.780
This is going to be available as a modern Linux application

05:14.780 --> 05:16.540
that's easy to get and easy to run.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.220
That's being maintained by an upstream provider

05:19.220 --> 05:21.660
that has business motivations to keep it current.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.540
A reliable, yeah, exactly.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.020
So I asked him, I'm like, there's potential here

05:26.020 --> 05:29.120
where you become just as much of a software shop

05:29.120 --> 05:30.620
as you are a hardware shop.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.980
And his response to that is we create features

05:33.980 --> 05:34.980
with the hope that it's useful,

05:34.980 --> 05:38.140
that everyone can use them,

05:38.140 --> 05:41.440
but they focus on the needs of the customers first.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.900
If the needs overlap with others,

05:42.900 --> 05:44.420
so our work can be valuable to the broader community,

05:44.420 --> 05:46.740
that's kind of great, I think is the implication.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.340
He says, but this is what's special about open source.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.500
There are all these places where the work overlaps

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
without conflicting with the ability to create unique

05:52.500 --> 05:54.420
and focused products and solutions.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.860
That is very well said.

05:55.860 --> 05:56.700
It's profound.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.420
Yeah, I mean, we talk about that all the time,

05:58.420 --> 05:59.820
but that kind of just sums it all up.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.100
We can, sure you compete with people,

06:02.100 --> 06:03.820
but most of the time we can all work together.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.060
And then he ends it with for us,

06:05.060 --> 06:07.460
software and hardware are inseparable.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.900
Hardware is the business model that enables us

06:09.900 --> 06:12.140
to invest in the Linux desktop.

06:12.140 --> 06:15.380
I think I've heard that before from somewhere

06:15.380 --> 06:16.700
that's fairly successful.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.580
Right, I mean, it's kind of an established model

06:19.580 --> 06:20.420
in some ways.

06:20.420 --> 06:21.460
I think they're really proud of the work.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.380
I think they're really proud of something.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.860
I think they feel like they've made something really good.

06:23.860 --> 06:24.700
And I think they have.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.700
Yeah, I don't know how easy it is to get at this moment,

06:27.700 --> 06:29.460
but there is a GitHub repo we'll have linked

06:29.460 --> 06:31.180
in the show notes, so you can go build it yourself

06:31.180 --> 06:32.220
if you've got the Rust tool chain.

06:32.220 --> 06:36.700
Yeah, we poked at it a bit and kind of decided not yet.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.260
We'll wait till it's a little easier.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.380
Maybe somebody's packaged it up a little bit easier

06:40.380 --> 06:41.780
outside of Pop OS.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.300
But we will have a link to the GitHub

06:43.300 --> 06:46.500
with all of the details if you are curious.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.060
But speaking of doing a great job,

06:49.060 --> 06:52.100
the chairman for OpenSUSE has stepped down.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.300
Richard Brown is leaving the project

06:54.300 --> 06:57.980
and he's handing it over to another member of SUSE.

06:57.980 --> 07:01.420
Richard will continue to work for SUSE as a developer,

07:01.420 --> 07:03.660
but he will no longer be the chairman of OpenSUSE.

07:03.660 --> 07:04.860
It's pretty big community news for OpenSUSE.

07:04.860 --> 07:07.420
Yeah, passing the torch on to the next leader.

07:07.420 --> 07:10.100
It seems like it would be sort of obvious.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.980
The elephant in the room, if you will, if I didn't mention

07:11.980 --> 07:13.460
the fact that they're working

07:13.460 --> 07:15.780
on further independence from SUSE.

07:15.780 --> 07:16.980
They're working on this new council

07:16.980 --> 07:19.060
that we talked about before on the show.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.460
He says in his changing of the guard post

07:21.460 --> 07:24.260
that that's not a factor here.

07:25.340 --> 07:28.860
And I just wonder what the root of this story is

07:28.860 --> 07:30.100
because Richard didn't really share it.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.820
So it leaves some to the imagination,

07:31.820 --> 07:34.620
but I think he leaves a good legacy.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.820
Five years, he was a passionate chairman.

07:36.820 --> 07:37.660
Oh, very passionate.

07:37.660 --> 07:39.060
I mean, I think did a good job

07:39.060 --> 07:42.340
of trying to espouse the benefits of running OpenSUSE.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.500
Good luck to whatever next endeavors he takes on.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.580
We'll see what comes on next.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.420
We'll see what other stories develop.

07:48.420 --> 07:51.380
And of course, keep an eye on OpenSUSE in general,

07:51.380 --> 07:53.060
just like we keep an eye on Fedora.

07:53.060 --> 07:55.780
We have an update for Fedora 31.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.940
It looks like the month old proposal

07:57.940 --> 07:59.980
for the upcoming Fedora 31 Linux distribution

07:59.980 --> 08:02.060
to release, to stop, I should say,

08:02.060 --> 08:05.780
releasing the I-686 repositories for everything

08:05.780 --> 08:09.540
and modules was voted on today by the Fedora engineering

08:09.540 --> 08:10.780
and the steering committee.

08:10.780 --> 08:11.860
Say that again, Chris?

08:11.860 --> 08:12.900
No, I'll say it.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.180
Yeah, it's a little- The Vesco Group

08:14.180 --> 08:16.420
gave their formal approval today

08:16.420 --> 08:19.340
for permitting these I-686 repositories

08:19.340 --> 08:22.580
to be removed beginning with Fedora 31.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.980
This also goes hand in step with Fedora 31

08:25.980 --> 08:30.260
having already decided to stop I-686 kernel builds.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.780
Mm, this is doom.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.700
Obviously, all games are ruined.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.500
This is gonna destroy wine on the Linux desktop.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.140
And it was just about to be the year of the Linux desktop.

08:40.140 --> 08:40.980
We're screwing it up.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.860
I know, I can't believe it.

08:41.860 --> 08:42.700
Right, Drew?

08:42.700 --> 08:43.820
It's all- No, no, no.

08:43.820 --> 08:44.660
Hold your horses.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.500
What?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.340
Oh, I was getting so worked up though.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.260
Multi-lib is not going anywhere.

08:49.260 --> 08:53.660
This is just to drop direct I-686 builds.

08:53.660 --> 08:57.500
So they're not going to be releasing an x86 kernel.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.180
They're not gonna have an x86 release,

09:00.180 --> 09:02.780
but they are continuing all of the multi-lib work.

09:02.780 --> 09:07.700
So if you're running 64-bit, which after 30, with 31,

09:07.700 --> 09:10.620
you definitely will be running 64-bit.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.620
You can still run everything that was in the 32-bit.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.060
You're just doing it through multi-lib.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.780
That's such a good clarification, Drew,

09:16.780 --> 09:18.380
because I mean, it's kind of just recognizing

09:18.380 --> 09:19.460
what we're all already doing.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.220
Yes, I need to run some 32-bit applications,

09:21.220 --> 09:23.020
but I want to run a 64-bit system.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.780
Yeah, I know, that's perfect.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.340
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with this pitchfork now.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.860
Dang it, I got it all polished up.

09:30.860 --> 09:33.420
You know, I got the flames, put the kerosene,

09:33.420 --> 09:35.460
whatever it is on there, so it would burn real nice.

09:35.460 --> 09:36.620
You know, I put a lot of effort into that.

09:36.620 --> 09:37.980
Oh, I think you'll find something.

09:37.980 --> 09:39.580
I was up all night working on that.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.220
Well, you know what?

09:41.220 --> 09:43.500
I was wondering why it took so long.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
Why did it take a month for them to decide?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.620
Was it like super hard?

09:47.620 --> 09:50.220
Did they deliberate like just constantly?

09:50.220 --> 09:52.660
No, no, it's just the way time you worked out,

09:52.660 --> 09:55.660
you had flock and you had to punt at once

09:55.660 --> 09:57.220
and there was just a lot going on.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.180
I mean, it's worth considering too, you know.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.100
You don't want to have to take it back.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.580
It is worth considering, yeah, it would be.

10:04.580 --> 10:07.140
Well, you know, I bet, just like with the Ubuntu thing,

10:07.140 --> 10:10.140
if there was some situation where things got a little weird,

10:10.140 --> 10:12.780
something tells me a container or a flat pack

10:12.780 --> 10:14.580
would probably solve the problem.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.620
Put it all in a flat pack, that's what I always say, Wes.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.380
Just put it all in a flat pack.

10:18.380 --> 10:22.260
Now we have a new feed, a new content we're exploring,

10:22.260 --> 10:24.460
minimum viable podcasts, if you will,

10:24.460 --> 10:27.620
fun extras that maybe didn't fit in the show,

10:27.620 --> 10:31.980
an extended interview or, for example, today,

10:31.980 --> 10:34.500
Chris and Wes react to old clips of Linux unplugged,

10:34.500 --> 10:35.340
it's brutal.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.420
Oh, so bad.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.820
We have new content, extras.show

10:39.820 --> 10:42.180
and subscribe at extras.show slash subscribe.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.860
It's the Jupiter Extras, the Jupiter Extras.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.540
I mean, if you're at all curious,

10:47.540 --> 10:49.780
I'd say just, you know, just subscribe, why not?

10:49.780 --> 10:52.660
We're kind of excited about it and have all kinds of ideas

10:52.660 --> 10:55.420
about stuff we're going to put there, so give it a try.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.620
As they say in the biz,

10:56.620 --> 10:58.420
we have a pipeline full of content

10:58.420 --> 11:00.380
already queued up and ready to go.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.100
Stay a while and listen.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.580
Yeah, so extras.show, irregular,

11:05.580 --> 11:07.380
extra content that we're having fun with.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.340
We ended the Friday stream.

11:09.340 --> 11:13.780
We'll be doing more live stream community events.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.300
I don't know if we want to say anything yet, Cheesy.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.140
Should we just hold on?

11:16.140 --> 11:19.420
I don't want to spoil anything, but we got more coming.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.740
Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything either,

11:21.740 --> 11:25.260
but there is some stuff coming around the pike

11:25.260 --> 11:26.340
and I think it's going to be good.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.500
I think it's going to be bigger than the Friday stream was

11:28.500 --> 11:29.580
in a lot of respects.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.140
And with extras, it gives us definitely a platform

11:33.140 --> 11:36.580
to try a lot of things and places to put stuff

11:36.580 --> 11:38.500
that we really didn't have a place before.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.620
So, you know, with a lot of these interviews and stuff,

11:42.620 --> 11:45.620
you can only put so much into the show

11:45.620 --> 11:47.540
without it being too campy almost.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.220
So this gives, you know, that person

11:50.220 --> 11:52.300
that was being interviewed an opportunity

11:52.300 --> 11:54.460
to have the full interview aired.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.940
And I think it gives the listeners something extra.

11:56.940 --> 11:58.580
Extras, you might say.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.660
It's been fun.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.900
It was something that we were considering

12:01.900 --> 12:02.740
during our recent sprint.

12:02.740 --> 12:06.620
Everybody got together and it just like took off.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.780
It took off in a big way.

12:08.780 --> 12:09.900
The first thing we published

12:09.900 --> 12:12.700
was the full Thomas Cameron Linux Fest keynote.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.180
Then the Choose Linux crew got together

12:15.180 --> 12:17.340
for the first time in studio

12:17.340 --> 12:21.660
and recorded Elle's trip to Hacker Summer Camp experience.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.300
Oh man, there's a lot in there.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.380
And then this morning, we published you and I reacting

12:26.380 --> 12:28.340
to old clips of Linux unplugged.

12:28.340 --> 12:32.180
And tomorrow morning, there will be some breaking news

12:32.180 --> 12:33.660
that doesn't fit in anywhere else.

12:33.660 --> 12:34.740
So it'll be in the feed.

12:34.740 --> 12:35.940
Oh yeah, stay tuned.

12:35.940 --> 12:39.980
So go over to extras.show and subscribe.

12:39.980 --> 12:42.220
It's just a little things here and there,

12:42.220 --> 12:43.780
just fun extra stuff.

12:43.780 --> 12:45.460
And we'll have, like I said,

12:45.460 --> 12:48.460
a whole pipeline of content coming soon.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.860
And I'm really happy with the way

12:49.860 --> 12:50.940
the React series turned out.

12:50.940 --> 12:51.780
We might do it.

12:51.780 --> 12:53.420
We might turn it into a series.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.260
Oh, I hope so.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.500
We'll see what people say.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.180
Extras.show, go check it out.

12:58.180 --> 13:00.020
Now, with all of that said,

13:00.020 --> 13:02.060
we should probably talk about

13:02.060 --> 13:04.380
why we're gathered here today.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.620
I spent the weekend on Wayland.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.540
Who's Drew's fault?

13:08.540 --> 13:09.380
We'll get to that.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.220
Oh yeah.

13:10.220 --> 13:13.460
And it meant going gnome shell for a bit.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.580
And then it meant learning how to live with Wayland.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.140
And I've got some observations.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.980
I've got some tools, some tips, some tricks,

13:21.980 --> 13:24.020
and we'll do a little kind of recap

13:24.020 --> 13:25.980
of where Wayland support is at

13:25.980 --> 13:27.180
and why it's taken so long.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.020
So first,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.260
a little of that old housekeeping.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.580
I have to give a shout out

13:32.580 --> 13:35.460
to the Linux Academy YouTube channel.

13:35.460 --> 13:39.460
They've posted two really great tutorials recently,

13:39.460 --> 13:43.100
Scanning Your Network for Vulnerabilities with Nmap.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.900
It's eight minutes long.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.380
It's a great tutorial.

13:46.380 --> 13:47.620
Oh man, what distro is that?

13:47.620 --> 13:48.500
Oh, that's Kali, of course.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.660
That must be Kali.

13:49.660 --> 13:50.820
Yeah, so using Kali in there.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.260
And then there's another video

13:52.260 --> 13:55.140
that was posted just a couple of days ago,

13:55.140 --> 13:57.380
how to copy directories around your network

13:57.380 --> 13:59.300
with SCP recursively.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.700
Three minutes and 49 seconds.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.260
So really quick videos, youtube.com slash linuxacademy.com.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.420
Go check those out.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.820
And then they're continuing to post

14:07.820 --> 14:11.500
longer in-depth tutorials on the Linux Academy blog,

14:11.500 --> 14:13.500
linuxacademy.com slash blog.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.860
Good additional content that often complements

14:16.860 --> 14:17.700
what we're covering in these shows.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.620
Well, yeah, it really does.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.260
So go check that out.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.260
It's youtube.com slash linuxacademy.com

14:23.260 --> 14:24.420
for the YouTube channel,

14:24.420 --> 14:26.820
and linuxacademy.com slash blog.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.100
For that blog.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.780
There's a lot going on with Wayland, guys.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.300
There's a lot going on with Wayland.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.820
It's been a while since we talked about it.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.780
I feel like some distributions,

14:37.780 --> 14:39.580
some people started running it by default

14:39.580 --> 14:41.260
with Gnome, for example.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.100
Yep, yep.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.820
And then we didn't hear anything else.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.060
Is it just going well?

14:45.060 --> 14:46.540
Is no one using it?

14:46.540 --> 14:47.380
We haven't talked about it.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.860
It's almost become a meme, really.

14:48.860 --> 14:52.300
Like, when is it going to ship fully?

14:52.300 --> 14:53.460
Like, everywhere.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.980
Wayland begun in 2008.

14:55.980 --> 15:00.060
Version 1.0 was released in October of 2012.

15:00.060 --> 15:00.900
Wow.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.100
So it's been a few years since this project started

15:03.100 --> 15:05.060
as we record this here episode.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.460
And if you look back at the history,

15:06.460 --> 15:08.220
like the announcements of Wayland,

15:08.220 --> 15:10.940
it wasn't described as the X11 killer.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.180
In fact, it was kind of downplayed

15:12.180 --> 15:14.780
as a tiny display server that might be good

15:14.780 --> 15:19.140
for embedded media devices that, like, are doing displays.

15:19.140 --> 15:23.260
Or maybe this might be the display server that GDM uses.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.100
You'd still use X for your desktop,

15:25.100 --> 15:27.420
but GDM would use this Wayland thing

15:27.420 --> 15:29.980
because they were concerned about the overhead of GDM.

15:29.980 --> 15:34.980
And that's the initial launch intention behind it.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.300
But that started to shift.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.220
Almost, if you look at the history of things,

15:38.220 --> 15:39.700
and we have some links in the show notes,

15:39.700 --> 15:43.540
about six months after Wayland's release,

15:43.540 --> 15:45.020
everything kind of shifts.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.860
You got to figure, like, people were looking for something.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.340
And even the project begins to describe itself

15:50.340 --> 15:53.180
as a simpler replacement for X.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.820
I mean, this was kind of inevitable, right?

15:55.820 --> 15:57.700
X is so old.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.660
It first came out in 1984.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.540
OK, all right.

16:01.540 --> 16:05.100
I mean, we do computing a little bit differently these days.

16:05.100 --> 16:09.100
And I mean, even just like in, say, 2013,

16:09.100 --> 16:10.820
there were already a ton of issues,

16:10.820 --> 16:12.260
and it was showing its age.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.660
I mean, some of these are from the core protocol.

16:14.660 --> 16:19.020
But also, most modern X servers run 23 of the 27

16:19.020 --> 16:20.740
possible X extensions.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.580
Yeah, this extension thing is like spaghetti.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.340
Yeah.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.700
And the policy is basically always

16:25.700 --> 16:27.900
preserve backwards compatibility.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.460
And so X.org, the main implementation

16:30.460 --> 16:33.700
we're all using of X, it has four different input models,

16:33.700 --> 16:36.940
four display models, and two rendering models,

16:36.940 --> 16:40.180
despite the fact that many of those are actually obsolete.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.620
So they were probably needed at some point in history.

16:42.620 --> 16:42.860
Yeah.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.020
And one thing, we kind of talk about what

16:45.020 --> 16:46.340
happens for us as the end user.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.180
And that's important.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.580
But we should think, too, this is an open source project.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.980
There's developers here who are putting time and energy.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.420
And one of the developers describes it

16:54.420 --> 16:59.060
as we've kicked that can as far down the road as we can.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.100
And that's it, right?

17:00.100 --> 17:02.780
If it's hard to work on, that's going to be security problems.

17:02.780 --> 17:06.260
And that's just going to make it so no one wants to contribute.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.100
Yeah.

17:07.100 --> 17:11.460
I recently saw a developer post by the Fedora developers

17:11.460 --> 17:14.180
who are some of the primary developers on Wayland

17:14.180 --> 17:17.740
and, by contrast, also the maintainers for X.org.

17:17.740 --> 17:22.300
And in the blog post, they write very clear, clear as day.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.100
We now consider X.org in maintenance mode.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.300
We are shutting it down.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.700
We are transitioning off.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.940
Wayland is the future, which kind of got this idea in my head.

17:30.940 --> 17:34.180
So when Drew came along and was trying this, I was like, hmm.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.740
That Fedora pusher, Drew.

17:35.740 --> 17:36.700
But how did we get here?

17:36.700 --> 17:41.300
Because initially, the core idea of Wayland

17:41.300 --> 17:44.180
was to be something very simple and something very clean

17:44.180 --> 17:44.700
and small.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.660
And how's it going to replace something

17:46.660 --> 17:50.140
as massive and sort of edge case accommodating as X?

17:50.140 --> 17:50.700
Yeah.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.100
I mean, can it?

17:52.100 --> 17:52.620
Will it?

17:52.620 --> 17:53.140
Will it?

17:53.140 --> 17:56.140
And I think a lot of the concerns we've had have been,

17:56.140 --> 17:59.340
how do we fill all the tiny little gaps, right?

17:59.340 --> 18:01.060
We got pretty early with Wayland,

18:01.060 --> 18:03.480
just basic rendering and compositing sort of stuff.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.100
That's easy.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.620
But making all the little details,

18:05.620 --> 18:07.580
being able to capture windows, having security,

18:07.580 --> 18:10.140
being able to have hotkeys around,

18:10.140 --> 18:12.780
let's not get started about remote desktop connections.

18:12.780 --> 18:15.700
All of those are little extras not used by everyone,

18:15.700 --> 18:18.220
but are crucial to many workflows.

18:18.220 --> 18:21.380
One of my biggest documented fears right here in the show

18:21.380 --> 18:23.700
is some of those things are getting implemented differently

18:23.700 --> 18:25.280
by different projects.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.900
And so I raised that concern about a year and a half ago.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.740
And so I thought this would be a good check-in

18:29.740 --> 18:32.380
to see, how is that really playing out?

18:32.380 --> 18:34.140
Is it really been that bad?

18:34.140 --> 18:36.180
I thought that'd be also a note.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.860
So there's been a few things, a few observations.

18:38.860 --> 18:42.760
So Drew, you were here as part of the overall sprint.

18:42.760 --> 18:49.900
And you run Gnome Shell, Fedora, Wayland on your ThinkPad T480.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.460
And I was watching you and how smooth it was.

18:52.460 --> 18:55.700
But there was one moment, I think, that I think you got me.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.900
It was really a small thing.

18:56.900 --> 18:59.020
It was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.300
Well, and what's funny is it has very little

19:01.300 --> 19:03.340
to do with Wayland, the thing that caused you to switch.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.180
Absolutely.

19:04.180 --> 19:07.740
It was, I went to show you something on my computer.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.400
And you saw my browser.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.540
And you were about to epiphany shame me.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.940
Screen peeker.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.260
And I said, no, no, no, that's Firefox.

19:17.260 --> 19:20.940
And it's just a CSS theme on top of Firefox.

19:20.940 --> 19:26.420
And oh, by the way, Firefox is Wayland native now on Fedora.

19:26.420 --> 19:29.060
And that seemed to be the thing that kicked it

19:29.060 --> 19:32.460
into high gear for you of, OK, well, let's go ahead

19:32.460 --> 19:34.860
and do this now.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.740
I was just seeing, one, how good Firefox could look.

19:37.740 --> 19:42.820
And two, that, oh, wow, browsers are starting to support it.

19:42.820 --> 19:43.320
Yeah.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.860
Maybe it's getting there.

19:44.860 --> 19:48.420
There's something about Firefox having native Wayland support

19:48.420 --> 19:54.020
and being smooth as silk on your desktop and looking.

19:54.020 --> 19:57.500
So when I was epiphany shaming, it sort of says two things.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.340
It says, wow, epiphany is great looking.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.300
And then it also says it's not good enough, right?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.800
But the fact that you've got Firefox

20:02.800 --> 20:04.180
to look as good as epiphany.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.340
Oh, we were both impressed.

20:05.340 --> 20:06.140
It was just like, uh.

20:06.140 --> 20:06.940
And it was smooth.

20:06.940 --> 20:07.780
What?

20:07.780 --> 20:09.820
It's kind of an open source testament, right?

20:09.820 --> 20:12.140
Like, we can have it this good.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.300
Yeah, we'll have a link to that theme in the show notes,

20:15.300 --> 20:15.780
by the way.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.100
Don't you worry.

20:17.100 --> 20:21.100
And to get that browser meant I needed to be on Gnome Shell,

20:21.100 --> 20:23.300
because that was a theme to look good on Gnome Shell.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.020
And you needed client-side decorations

20:25.020 --> 20:26.500
and all of that jazz.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.220
And I had this niggling desire to try Wayland

20:29.220 --> 20:31.440
in the back of my mind anyways.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.500
So this was the moment.

20:32.500 --> 20:37.340
I just took my ThinkPad with XFCE installed on it.

20:37.340 --> 20:40.780
And I did a dnf group install gnome-desktop.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.020
That's all it takes.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.300
That's all it takes.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.780
And then everything.

20:44.780 --> 20:50.340
Oh, I also, using systemctl, disabled LightDM

20:50.340 --> 20:51.940
and enabled GDM.

20:51.940 --> 20:54.980
So then I also got a hot tip from Drew

20:54.980 --> 20:57.620
to enable a certain copper repo.

20:57.620 --> 20:58.340
Yes.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.140
So there is a copper repo out there.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.740
It's called gnome-with-patches.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.780
And it's exactly what it sounds like.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.660
All of those performance patches that

21:07.660 --> 21:10.900
have been trickling in from other distros, some of them

21:10.900 --> 21:14.060
from Canonical, some of them direct from the Gnome project,

21:14.060 --> 21:18.700
but they're not yet in the stable repos for Fedora.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.660
Those have all been kind of consolidated

21:21.660 --> 21:22.980
into this one repo.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.140
And it is technically experimental,

21:25.140 --> 21:28.420
but it is great.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.460
The performance in Gnome Shell is so much better

21:31.460 --> 21:34.460
using this repo for me, personally,

21:34.460 --> 21:38.260
that I'm using it on both a Radeon build on my desktop

21:38.260 --> 21:40.380
and on my laptop.

21:40.380 --> 21:42.900
And there is also experimental support

21:42.900 --> 21:47.220
for enabling the real-time support that is coming in.

21:47.220 --> 21:50.220
I think it's coming in 3.33.

21:50.220 --> 21:54.300
But it's not there in 3.32 yet, but you can get it here.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.380
And you do have to enable a setting through,

21:57.380 --> 21:59.380
is it deconf or gconf?

21:59.380 --> 22:00.460
Gconf, yeah.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.220
Yeah, through one of those to get that support.

22:03.220 --> 22:06.900
So when you say performance improvements,

22:06.900 --> 22:09.540
what perceptively is noticeable?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.380
It's just silky smooth, everything

22:11.380 --> 22:15.540
from moving windows around, windows launching, scrolling

22:15.540 --> 22:17.860
between your virtual desktops.

22:17.860 --> 22:22.940
All of it feels almost as fast as XFCE,

22:22.940 --> 22:24.860
but definitely smoother because you've

22:24.860 --> 22:27.400
got those animations going on at the same time.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.020
So I think that's where I wanted to start my Wayland observations

22:30.020 --> 22:33.060
at right here, is I have felt like everything

22:33.060 --> 22:35.380
has felt smoother on Wayland.

22:35.380 --> 22:38.620
So you're saying it's even smoother with these patches?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.380
Yes.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.020
How smooth can you get, man?

22:41.020 --> 22:44.020
Eventually, I'm going to slip off my computer.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.260
Well, that makes sense, right?

22:45.260 --> 22:47.580
Because if we're just talking about a protocol here,

22:47.580 --> 22:49.660
then the protocol enables that smoothness.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.980
And now we're seeing some of the implementation details.

22:51.980 --> 22:52.540
The refinement.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.700
Yeah, exactly.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.460
Makes sense.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.020
So that's a good way to break it down, Mr. Payne.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.860
I definitely would say, though, my number one

22:59.860 --> 23:04.900
with a bullet observation is Gnome Shell, so far, very smooth.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.740
I'll tell you a couple of things that I think

23:06.740 --> 23:08.140
are necessary to get there.

23:08.140 --> 23:09.340
But everything's smooth.

23:09.340 --> 23:11.120
Firefox is smooth.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.100
Scrolling the settings is smooth.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.020
It's ridiculous.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.200
You're just sitting there scrolling all day,

23:16.200 --> 23:17.280
not getting any work done.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.220
I'm telling you, man, it's like I'm having an ASMR experience,

23:21.220 --> 23:22.220
but there's no audio.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.940
It's just so great.

23:23.940 --> 23:27.380
So that has been my big preferred change.

23:27.380 --> 23:28.180
I really like that.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.620
Now, here's what I haven't liked.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.580
Here's my dislike change.

23:31.580 --> 23:35.320
And that is, surprise, now this is likely the entire stack,

23:35.320 --> 23:39.780
not just Wayland, but it wakes up way slower than XFCE.

23:39.780 --> 23:42.300
XFCE, man, I cracked that lid open,

23:42.300 --> 23:46.100
and it literally wakes so fast that it's

23:46.100 --> 23:48.100
open before I can see the light on the screen.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.420
I mean, it's awake before I can see the light on the screen.

23:51.420 --> 23:54.340
And it's so fast that I question if it was sleeping at all.

23:54.340 --> 23:55.580
Did you actually check that?

23:55.580 --> 23:56.180
Because that would be probably.

23:56.180 --> 23:57.060
I do now.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.180
I do, because it wakes so fast.

23:59.180 --> 24:01.320
I'm like, one of these times it's not going to be sleeping.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.740
So I always look to see if that little red IBM light is

24:03.740 --> 24:05.100
pulsing right now.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.580
It's that fast.

24:06.580 --> 24:10.420
Now that I'm on the Wayland stack with GDM,

24:10.420 --> 24:12.340
and then on Michelle Locker and all that,

24:12.340 --> 24:15.520
I open up the old lid, and 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000,

24:15.520 --> 24:17.220
screen wakes up.

24:17.220 --> 24:20.780
I do the old space bar, log in with my password, hit Enter,

24:20.780 --> 24:24.080
1, 1,000, 2, 1,000 at the desktop.

24:24.080 --> 24:28.900
It's just not that perfect, faster than a MacBook

24:28.900 --> 24:31.220
experience, which XFCE got me.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.620
But all the other experiences of using the desktop

24:35.620 --> 24:36.820
feel very smooth.

24:36.820 --> 24:41.820
And having been away from UI effects for a long time,

24:41.820 --> 24:44.620
and now being back on a desktop that implements them,

24:44.620 --> 24:47.420
but I'd say in a nice way, in a clean way,

24:47.420 --> 24:48.340
it's not over the top.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.700
My windows aren't exploding.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.540
Hey, hey now.

24:51.540 --> 24:52.460
I like that.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.220
But it's very smooth.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.100
It's probably the smoothest I've ever seen it.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.680
Now, I'm going to give it a little bit.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.540
I'm not switching off XFCE.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.180
See, I'm wondering if your experience in,

25:01.180 --> 25:04.180
that's why we got XFCE in the studios, which I agree with

25:04.180 --> 25:05.660
and is appropriate.

25:05.660 --> 25:07.700
But there is a little smoothness, a little butter.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.860
You miss, right?

25:08.860 --> 25:11.460
Like a little just makes it sort of feel special and modern

25:11.460 --> 25:12.060
and snappy.

25:12.060 --> 25:14.860
This is something I was trying to work out with Brent off-mic.

25:14.860 --> 25:17.120
And I was just trying to get his input,

25:17.120 --> 25:20.340
because what I was saying to you was,

25:20.340 --> 25:23.260
it feels like I'm compelled to use something

25:23.260 --> 25:25.040
that I can't quantify in numbers.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.860
It's just simply how it makes me feel when I use the computer.

25:27.860 --> 25:31.100
And I struggle to assign a value to that.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.020
Well, there's something about the user experience

25:33.020 --> 25:35.140
that is so much richer when you can actually

25:35.140 --> 25:37.140
enjoy every single aspect of it, right?

25:37.140 --> 25:39.340
When it just kind of feels good in your bones

25:39.340 --> 25:40.820
when you're using it.

25:40.820 --> 25:43.980
If I don't enjoy using my tools, it

25:43.980 --> 25:46.020
does seem like it's a creative blocker for me.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.980
Like, if I'm frustrated with the experience,

25:48.980 --> 25:50.820
you may have witnessed it recently.

25:50.820 --> 25:54.060
I was doing a quick edit clip, and I busted out.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.300
All the computers are in use.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.420
We have a MacBook here, so I busted it out.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.380
And I haven't used Mac OS in so long

26:00.380 --> 26:03.660
that I became really frustrated with the UI,

26:03.660 --> 26:05.940
like the way the trackpad worked, which I used to love

26:05.940 --> 26:06.980
the trackpad.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.860
I became frustrated with the way that even selecting windows

26:09.860 --> 26:11.020
and resizing them.

26:11.020 --> 26:15.740
I mean, it was like the experience was so awful.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.340
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.580
It really made trying to do something

26:20.580 --> 26:23.940
quick and creative a very frustrating experience.

26:23.940 --> 26:25.980
You were on the edge of a nerd rage, for sure.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.180
Yeah, Alex, you saw it, too.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.100
You saw when I was really having a hard time with the Mac,

26:29.100 --> 26:32.060
and it was like, I'm just not used to having

26:32.060 --> 26:34.020
to fight my tools like this.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.580
And if I don't enjoy using the machine,

26:36.580 --> 26:38.460
I kind of burn out on the work.

26:38.460 --> 26:41.580
Once I got the clip good enough, I was like, oh, screw it, man.

26:41.580 --> 26:44.380
This took way too much work.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.260
I'm done.

26:45.260 --> 26:47.340
I was spent at that.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.740
What kind of maniac am I?

26:48.740 --> 26:50.060
What does that mean about me?

26:50.060 --> 26:51.060
What does that say?

26:51.060 --> 26:52.300
What's wrong with me?

26:52.300 --> 26:53.340
Because you don't have this problem.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.860
Your windows are exploding like a maniac.

26:54.860 --> 26:55.540
You don't care.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.260
No, I don't mind at all.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.260
You can have a crack on your screen.

26:57.260 --> 26:58.300
It doesn't drive you crazy.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.580
If I have a crack on my smart screen,

27:01.580 --> 27:05.220
I don't go to the AT&T store or whatever I got to go to go,

27:05.220 --> 27:07.660
or the Apple store or whatever I got to drag my ass into.

27:07.660 --> 27:08.420
I don't do that.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.340
I don't do that.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.100
But if my screen is cracked, I'm going

27:11.100 --> 27:12.780
into that store like that day.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.900
So sometimes you just got to be a little resilient.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.820
It does help if you don't taste some of the other stuff.

27:19.820 --> 27:20.980
You were on XF.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.060
Now you're experienced.

27:22.060 --> 27:23.580
I kind of just assume it takes a little bit

27:23.580 --> 27:24.540
to wake up from sleep.

27:24.540 --> 27:25.820
So that sounds normal.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.340
That sounds normal to me.

27:27.340 --> 27:28.540
I feel like I can't go back either.

27:28.540 --> 27:29.460
That's the problem.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.620
I mean, it's the same with proprietary stuff.

27:31.620 --> 27:35.860
If you just try the open source solution and you make it work,

27:35.860 --> 27:36.380
it's great.

27:36.380 --> 27:36.860
It's fine.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.180
And sometimes you try the proprietary,

27:38.180 --> 27:39.340
and you're like, now I see the flaws.

27:39.340 --> 27:42.140
Which is useful and good, and we should try to aim there.

27:42.140 --> 27:43.620
But it's kind of a mental thing.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.380
Another way to put that is I'd probably

27:46.380 --> 27:49.900
think Lightworks or Acadian Live could do everything I ever

27:49.900 --> 27:50.740
needed to do.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.360
And anyone who said anything differently

27:52.360 --> 27:55.940
was a dope if I had never used Final Cut.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.820
Or I'd never used Premiere.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.180
But I got access to those first.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.580
And so the other tools to me just never really satisfied me.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.620
Exactly.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.020
But I'm sort of trapped here, because I find the overall

28:08.020 --> 28:09.820
experience to be very pleasant.

28:09.820 --> 28:12.140
My laptop runs cooler.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.820
I don't have a solid read yet, but I'm

28:13.820 --> 28:17.900
getting comparable-ish battery life to XFCE,

28:17.900 --> 28:20.940
which if I even get in the ballpark of XFCE's battery

28:20.940 --> 28:23.220
life, that's a breakthrough for Gnome Shell.

28:23.220 --> 28:24.460
That's a breakthrough.

28:24.460 --> 28:27.180
Now I'm on the ThinkPad T480 using the Intel GPU,

28:27.180 --> 28:29.980
so I'm best case scenario.

28:29.980 --> 28:31.180
So what is the state?

28:31.180 --> 28:32.420
What is the state of Wayland?

28:32.420 --> 28:35.020
Like, do you need to be on very specific hardware?

28:35.020 --> 28:35.940
Sort of.

28:35.940 --> 28:38.620
Now the Ryzen graphics stack is open source,

28:38.620 --> 28:40.740
and the Intel graphics stack is open source.

28:40.740 --> 28:41.940
You have a lot more options.

28:41.940 --> 28:43.180
You can get some good desktops.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.260
Drew, you said there's been some downsides, though,

28:45.260 --> 28:46.340
on your Ryzen system.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.420
Yeah, but it's edge cases.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.500
Describe the system.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
Is it AMD graphics?

28:50.500 --> 28:51.460
Is it a Ryzen CPU?

28:51.460 --> 28:52.980
Like, is it an Intel system?

28:52.980 --> 28:55.060
What is the hardware you're having issues with?

28:55.060 --> 28:58.860
So I have a Ryzen processor, Gen 1.

28:58.860 --> 29:04.380
And I've got a Radeon RX 580, as well as a Radeon RX 480.

29:04.380 --> 29:06.100
But that one's just for pass-through.

29:06.100 --> 29:09.340
So the 580 is really the one that's happening,

29:09.340 --> 29:12.340
doing all of my Linux graphics processing.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.740
And it runs great.

29:14.740 --> 29:18.380
Wayland behaves normally under most circumstances.

29:18.380 --> 29:21.420
But I do have a rotated monitor.

29:21.420 --> 29:25.020
And that's where I get one of these little tiny edge cases

29:25.020 --> 29:29.260
where, every now and then, I'll get a cursor stuck,

29:29.260 --> 29:33.300
rotated back the other way, up in the corner.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.820
And it just stays there.

29:35.820 --> 29:38.340
And a lot of times, I could ignore it.

29:38.340 --> 29:42.700
But like you, Chris, sometimes you look at it, and you see it,

29:42.700 --> 29:47.060
and you just get angrier and angrier.

29:47.060 --> 29:49.660
The good news is that particular bug,

29:49.660 --> 29:54.420
along with other paper cut bugs, if we want to call them that,

29:54.420 --> 29:57.620
are on a list that are actively being worked at

29:57.620 --> 30:02.500
by the Wayland people to get those little paper cuts that

30:02.500 --> 30:07.260
are kind of blocking mass adoption to just wipe those out

30:07.260 --> 30:11.580
and get it working correctly for everybody all the time.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.740
That's it.

30:12.740 --> 30:15.700
Wayland is now at a point where there's some paper cuts.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.220
There's some paper cuts, but you can get your job done.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.820
And there's also appreciable benefits to using it now.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.740
Drew, you've even done some No Man's Sky under Proton

30:25.740 --> 30:26.940
on Wayland, correct?

30:26.940 --> 30:29.660
Yeah, also on an Intel GPU.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.060
That part's ridiculous.

30:31.060 --> 30:33.460
I mean, X-Wayland is so, so smooth.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.940
I have no idea what is a Wayland application

30:36.940 --> 30:38.700
and what is an X-Wayland application.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.940
I cannot tell you the difference at this point.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.380
It's nice not having to know, right?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.860
You just sort of use Windows.

30:43.860 --> 30:45.980
You've been on it longer than I have, though, Drew.

30:45.980 --> 30:48.140
Is there some standout identifiers?

30:48.140 --> 30:51.380
Can you tell when something's an X-Wayland application?

30:51.380 --> 30:55.820
Only when the application itself is kind of buggy to begin with.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.580
And it can kind of show its cracks.

30:57.580 --> 31:00.780
Like Reaper, as great as it is, for example.

31:00.780 --> 31:04.500
And this is proprietary software running its own toolkit on Linux.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.940
But a great audio editor.

31:05.940 --> 31:07.260
A great audio editor.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.140
I love it to death.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.500
But every now and then, it can kind of

31:10.500 --> 31:14.940
show some cracks where it's just not quite as good.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.940
And I get more graphical glitches with Reaper

31:18.940 --> 31:22.740
under Wayland than I do under X. But to be fair,

31:22.740 --> 31:28.180
they're still very minor and are not breaking my workflow.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.820
Just when I resize a window or something like that,

31:30.820 --> 31:33.820
you can just kind of see the cracks at the edge.

31:33.820 --> 31:36.020
But that's about it these days.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.980
Other than that, no, I can't really tell.

31:37.980 --> 31:43.180
Now, if you, like me, have grown to depend on a few core desktop

31:43.180 --> 31:46.540
Linux applications, it is useful to have a Wayland buddy

31:46.540 --> 31:47.420
when you switch.

31:47.420 --> 31:48.860
Drew, you are my Wayland buddy.

31:48.860 --> 31:52.900
And you helped me replace a few of my key go-to Linux desktop

31:52.900 --> 31:57.060
applications with ones that do work better under Wayland,

31:57.060 --> 32:02.580
starting with my favorite beloved built-in screenshot

32:02.580 --> 32:03.900
tool to XFCE.

32:03.900 --> 32:07.020
I had to get something better, something more modern.

32:07.020 --> 32:09.660
And you pointed me to Flameshot.

32:09.660 --> 32:10.380
Yes.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.100
So I came across Flameshot when I first

32:13.100 --> 32:16.580
started playing around with Wayland maybe a year ago

32:16.580 --> 32:19.820
and discovered that Shudder does not work in Wayland.

32:19.820 --> 32:22.300
And I had to find something to replace that

32:22.300 --> 32:23.900
and came across Flameshot.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.260
And it's just a great little screenshot tool.

32:26.260 --> 32:30.340
Works very, very well in Wayland and also in Xorg.

32:30.340 --> 32:33.980
So if you're still on Xorg, you're not missing out here.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.060
You can still use it.

32:36.060 --> 32:36.820
But it's great.

32:36.820 --> 32:39.660
And I just rebound my Print Screen button for it.

32:39.660 --> 32:42.060
And now, anytime I have to print anything,

32:42.060 --> 32:44.180
I can do it with Flameshot where I

32:44.180 --> 32:48.180
can draw a particular size of the screenshot.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.980
I can copy it to a clipboard, publish it to Imgur,

32:51.980 --> 32:52.900
any number of things.

32:52.900 --> 32:54.780
It's just got support for all of this built-in

32:54.780 --> 32:56.780
and a really slick interface.

32:56.780 --> 32:59.060
It is really good, really good.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.420
That was a solid recommendation.

33:00.420 --> 33:03.940
And then there was the moment I struggled with the most.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.860
I even considered some crazy hacks that

33:05.860 --> 33:07.820
were offered by the project.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.660
Side note, one of the project's workarounds

33:09.660 --> 33:13.340
I'm about to mention was log out of your desktop,

33:13.340 --> 33:15.620
choose the X11 desktop, and log back in.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.780
I'm like, what kind of fix is that?

33:17.780 --> 33:19.780
Yes, you still get that sometimes.

33:19.780 --> 33:26.260
But my beloved ULauncher is usable, for sure, on Wayland.

33:26.260 --> 33:29.420
But it is not a native Wayland application.

33:29.420 --> 33:32.780
And one of the big disadvantages is applications in the past

33:32.780 --> 33:36.100
where you'd set a hotkey for kind of don't work great

33:36.100 --> 33:36.980
on Wayland.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.860
It doesn't really let just any application

33:38.860 --> 33:40.500
grab any old key input.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.220
Which, I mean, that is nice.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.220
And you can solve this by using the GNOME shell settings

33:45.220 --> 33:46.140
to do key bindings.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.820
Because that's at the shell level, and that does work.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.940
And you, in the case of ULauncher,

33:51.940 --> 33:54.180
had to load a couple of other things.

33:54.180 --> 33:56.900
And I looked at all of my options.

33:56.900 --> 34:00.060
Drew convinced me, drop ULauncher, which was rough.

34:00.060 --> 34:01.820
You know that GNOME Shell has a.

34:01.820 --> 34:03.700
And he was the built-in GNOME Shell launcher.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.500
And there's a bigger philosophy there, Drew.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.100
Yeah, well, use the tools that you're given.

34:08.100 --> 34:12.020
And in this particular case, the GNOME Shell launcher

34:12.020 --> 34:17.220
already does most of the things that ULauncher can do.

34:17.220 --> 34:20.580
And you don't need to add extra stuff on top.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.940
It's just like with extensions.

34:21.940 --> 34:25.500
The more you pile on, the more chances

34:25.500 --> 34:27.980
you're giving your desktop to misbehave.

34:27.980 --> 34:32.940
So by trying to decide, OK, what's

34:32.940 --> 34:37.500
the smallest number of extensions that I really need?

34:37.500 --> 34:40.060
And granted, ULauncher is not an extension.

34:40.060 --> 34:42.060
But I'm going to kind of lump it in with those.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.540
No, I follow you.

34:43.540 --> 34:48.620
By stripping those out, you can get down to a base that

34:48.620 --> 34:50.720
is still very workable.

34:50.720 --> 34:54.140
And still, maybe you have to kind of relearn the direction

34:54.140 --> 34:56.660
you go for one particular thing.

34:56.660 --> 34:59.500
But overall, you can still do everything

34:59.500 --> 35:03.780
that you need to do, just in a slightly different way

35:03.780 --> 35:06.100
and a much more stable and fluid desktop.

35:06.100 --> 35:08.420
That's what I've found with Wayland and GNOME

35:08.420 --> 35:10.700
in most recent builds.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.500
I think you nailed the trade-off there.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.060
If you're willing to go a different path

35:15.060 --> 35:17.140
to get that task done, you're rewarded

35:17.140 --> 35:20.860
with stability, smoothness, and a modern workflow.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.380
Some compromises may be necessary.

35:22.380 --> 35:25.020
And I mean, maybe you can put some pressure,

35:25.020 --> 35:27.580
file some bugs, and improve the tools

35:27.580 --> 35:29.420
that you have that start out really nice

35:29.420 --> 35:31.580
and just need to grow a few new features.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.940
Well, you've got to have a certain momentum of users

35:33.940 --> 35:36.260
using Wayland to make it worth developer time.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.740
Yeah, absolutely.

35:37.740 --> 35:39.740
And we all just do weird stuff, too, right?

35:39.740 --> 35:41.260
I mean, there's no way to figure out

35:41.260 --> 35:42.940
how it doesn't work until you've run into it.

35:42.940 --> 35:43.420
Oh, yeah.

35:43.420 --> 35:45.180
Everybody's got their own workflow.

35:45.180 --> 35:48.500
So yeah, I also am subscribing to the philosophy

35:48.500 --> 35:50.780
of minimal extensions.

35:50.780 --> 35:55.500
In fact, I think I've pared it down now to only three.

35:55.500 --> 35:59.020
The hardest one since day one of using Gnome Shell,

35:59.020 --> 36:05.780
well, since 3.12, that's like when Gnome Shell 3.12 launched,

36:05.780 --> 36:06.980
I just see it as a new point.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.900
It was like a new turning point in Gnome Shell.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.940
That's when I really became.

36:09.940 --> 36:12.580
Gnome Shell timeline, because there

36:12.580 --> 36:16.220
was some stuff in the early 20 series that was also huge.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.220
And there's some huge stuff in these reviews.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.100
Right now, yeah.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.940
And so it's also why it's kind of fun to check it out,

36:22.940 --> 36:24.740
to not just totally dismiss the project

36:24.740 --> 36:25.940
and see what they're doing.

36:25.940 --> 36:28.100
Because they're kind of an important desktop.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.260
So I kind of feel like it's my responsibility.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.140
Well, and even if you don't like whatever they're exploring,

36:32.140 --> 36:34.860
you can't deny that they are exploring a different way

36:34.860 --> 36:36.140
of doing a desktop, right?

36:36.140 --> 36:38.560
So I gave up the old dock, which I've

36:38.560 --> 36:41.700
used Dash to Docker canonicals implementation to,

36:41.700 --> 36:42.660
which is great.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.140
I've used it on every Gnome Shell install

36:45.140 --> 36:47.540
I've had since Gnome 3.12.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.180
And that was the hardest one to give up,

36:50.180 --> 36:51.900
because I've always used that one.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.140
But Drew convinced me.

36:53.140 --> 36:55.860
And I've pared it down to three extensions.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.180
And I want to give you one of them.

36:58.180 --> 36:59.740
I think it's really important.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.660
It's made Gnome Shell more on par with Plasma for me.

37:03.660 --> 37:07.180
One of the key things I love about Plasma desktop

37:07.180 --> 37:09.380
is those fricking KWIN rules.

37:09.380 --> 37:11.620
Once you learn to embrace KWIN rules,

37:11.620 --> 37:13.120
your workflow changes forever, girl.

37:13.120 --> 37:13.780
Let me tell you.

37:13.780 --> 37:14.340
It is.

37:14.340 --> 37:14.780
It's great.

37:14.780 --> 37:15.820
You showed me the way, yeah.

37:15.820 --> 37:16.540
Yeah, it's great.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.580
I mean, we use it here in the studio for a lot

37:18.580 --> 37:21.620
because some of our applications open up like 12 windows.

37:21.620 --> 37:27.300
And there's nothing quite like it in Gnome Shell or in XFCE.

37:27.300 --> 37:31.460
Now, in Gnome Shell, you could replicate the functionality

37:31.460 --> 37:35.020
with two extensions, minimum workspaces,

37:35.020 --> 37:37.660
and then another one where you'd say whenever this application

37:37.660 --> 37:39.620
opens up, you always put it on this screen.

37:39.620 --> 37:40.540
Ah, yes.

37:40.540 --> 37:43.340
Minimum workspaces and that other extension,

37:43.340 --> 37:44.660
they don't work under Wayland.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.380
Of course not.

37:45.380 --> 37:48.140
Not all Gnome Shell extensions work under Wayland.

37:48.140 --> 37:48.980
I have discovered.

37:48.980 --> 37:50.420
Well, it wouldn't be so easy, Chris.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.020
This also encouraged me paring it down

37:52.020 --> 37:54.340
to like three extensions, I'll add.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.900
So I want to mention Auto Move Windows.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.960
This is not perfect.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.700
It won't recognize all Windows types.

38:02.700 --> 38:06.300
But it recognizes the couple that I need, Telegram, Slack,

38:06.300 --> 38:09.500
Chrome, Firefox, Thunderbird, that kind of stuff.

38:09.500 --> 38:13.100
It will, when they open, automatically move them

38:13.100 --> 38:15.540
to a workspace that you designate.

38:15.540 --> 38:17.020
It's so beautiful.

38:17.020 --> 38:20.860
So if I click a link when I'm like in Telegram chatting

38:20.860 --> 38:23.100
with Wes Payne and he sends me a link to something fancy

38:23.100 --> 38:25.220
and I want to click it, as you do.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.020
Of course you do.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.300
I send great links.

38:27.300 --> 38:27.860
The best.

38:27.860 --> 38:30.820
And I click that link, it always opens up

38:30.820 --> 38:33.460
the browser in that workspace.

38:33.460 --> 38:34.580
It's messy, you know?

38:34.580 --> 38:35.500
So no, I move that.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.700
Oh, you want that move.

38:36.700 --> 38:37.660
I move it.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.220
I move it with this Auto Move Window.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.660
It moves it to the workspace I designate for Firefox.

38:41.660 --> 38:43.060
So every future Firefox window opens.

38:43.060 --> 38:43.060
I see.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.020
That's perfect.

38:44.020 --> 38:44.300
Right.

38:44.300 --> 38:45.980
So then it keeps just Telegram clean.

38:45.980 --> 38:47.740
So I have just Telegram on that workspace.

38:47.740 --> 38:50.580
And it puts the browser in a different workspace.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.280
And when I want to go see your fancy link,

38:52.280 --> 38:53.540
I just move to that workspace.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.580
But if you want to go pop over and find out

38:56.580 --> 38:59.180
what's for brunch with Brent, then you'll know.

38:59.180 --> 38:59.420
Right.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.540
Well, it's always delicious.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.100
I don't even need to check.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.300
Like here in the studio, when we open up Quasl,

39:05.300 --> 39:08.340
we have a KWIN window rule to always put it on desktop too.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.380
It's so nice.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.180
Now I kind of have that same functionality.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.260
Is it all the way?

39:13.260 --> 39:13.820
No.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.860
No, it won't do like this particular size

39:15.860 --> 39:18.180
in this particular region.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.700
But most applications will remember their size

39:20.700 --> 39:21.300
and position.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.100
So if you put them on the right workspace,

39:23.100 --> 39:28.020
they'll just resume in the spot that they were at.

39:28.020 --> 39:28.580
So that works.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.340
That's nice.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.220
Auto-move windows, and then I had

39:31.220 --> 39:35.740
to change up and get rid of my beloved Guake.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.140
It just was time.

39:37.140 --> 39:37.660
Of course.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.780
I mean, there's some hotkeys involved, right?

39:39.780 --> 39:43.400
And it's not a Wayland native application yet.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.060
And Drew recommended Tilex.

39:45.060 --> 39:45.860
We've heard of it before.

39:45.860 --> 39:47.460
It may have even been a pick years ago.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.820
I'm sure it was.

39:48.820 --> 39:53.540
And it's a great tiling terminal emulator.

39:53.540 --> 39:56.740
And my second Gnome Shell plug-in

39:56.740 --> 39:59.660
uses Tilex to do the drop-down terminal.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.380
So I can hit the tilde key, and I get a drop-down terminal,

40:02.380 --> 40:03.700
and it's using Tilex.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.220
Slick.

40:04.220 --> 40:04.700
Yeah.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.700
So it's, you know.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.380
Well, what do you think?

40:06.380 --> 40:07.900
Are you liking it as a terminal?

40:07.900 --> 40:08.980
That's an important thing.

40:08.980 --> 40:09.820
It's great.

40:09.820 --> 40:11.700
Tilex has always been a solid app.

40:11.700 --> 40:16.340
I just never had a strong need to use it.

40:16.340 --> 40:20.380
And Gnome Shell's terminal's fine, but Tilex is great.

40:20.380 --> 40:21.740
It's great.

40:21.740 --> 40:23.620
Drew, what are your favorite Tilex features?

40:23.620 --> 40:26.100
Because I'm brand new to it, and it's like my go-to now

40:26.100 --> 40:26.940
already.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.500
First of all, just UI, it's great.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.060
Second of all, feature-wise, it's kind of unmatched.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.260
Yeah, so it has the features where

40:35.260 --> 40:38.500
you can split the terminal window

40:38.500 --> 40:43.620
into multiple sections, left, right, or top, bottom.

40:43.620 --> 40:44.780
As the name implies, sure.

40:44.780 --> 40:45.540
Right, exactly.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.300
So it's tiling.

40:47.300 --> 40:51.460
But in addition to that, you can open up multiple tabs.

40:51.460 --> 40:55.020
Except the tabs, you can do them several different ways.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.060
You can either have it as a list down the left or right side

40:58.060 --> 41:00.980
with previews, where you can actually

41:00.980 --> 41:06.120
see what each tab looks like, including with their tiling.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.260
And that's kind of the biggest part of what makes it up

41:10.260 --> 41:11.500
as an application.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.620
Beyond that, I think it's just kind

41:13.620 --> 41:15.660
of quality of life improvements.

41:15.660 --> 41:21.140
Like, for example, using the newer style GTK scroll bars

41:21.140 --> 41:25.780
versus using Gnome Terminal, you've got that static scroll

41:25.780 --> 41:27.780
bar that's just kind of over there on the right

41:27.780 --> 41:31.380
and looks a little old, whereas with Tilex,

41:31.380 --> 41:34.280
it's got the thin scroll bar until you go over it,

41:34.280 --> 41:35.860
and then it expands.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.940
And it goes directly over top of the content,

41:37.940 --> 41:41.020
so it's not like this whole separate thing.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.860
So the whole thing to me just feels

41:42.860 --> 41:46.660
like if you took Gnome Terminal and pushed it

41:46.660 --> 41:50.740
to the modern equivalent of what it should or could be,

41:50.740 --> 41:53.180
and that's kind of where it is.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.780
It's also, and this is some of the features

41:55.780 --> 41:59.220
that I find to be, like this is where I'm going to Tilex

41:59.220 --> 42:01.860
all the time now, is it has some great different options around

42:01.860 --> 42:04.260
how it handles copy and pasted content.

42:04.260 --> 42:06.020
And that's really fancy, so check it out.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.820
We've mentioned it before, so enough with that.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.780
But I want to do a little update on how some

42:12.780 --> 42:14.660
of the different projects are getting along

42:14.660 --> 42:15.700
with Wayland support.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.260
So the number one question, probably the elephant

42:17.260 --> 42:20.140
in the room at this point, is what about NVIDIA?

42:20.140 --> 42:22.060
The story there isn't great.

42:22.060 --> 42:24.820
You've noticed we haven't really mentioned any of us

42:24.820 --> 42:25.460
are using it.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.940
However, different projects are getting along with support.

42:28.940 --> 42:33.780
In fact, the Kaywin project for Plasma Desktop

42:33.780 --> 42:37.740
now lists initial support in Plasma 5.16

42:37.740 --> 42:39.260
for the NVIDIA binary.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.620
Oh, nice.

42:41.620 --> 42:44.460
Partial work around, they say.

42:44.460 --> 42:45.420
OK, maybe it's gross.

42:45.420 --> 42:45.940
I don't know.

42:45.940 --> 42:47.380
Yeah, I don't know.

42:47.380 --> 42:48.980
But the situation is getting better.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.780
I think that's the overall story there,

42:50.780 --> 42:52.620
is the situation is improving.

42:52.620 --> 42:55.700
For GNOME, especially GNOME 3.34,

42:55.700 --> 42:57.820
there's refined X Wayland support.

42:57.820 --> 43:00.980
So X11 applications run even better,

43:00.980 --> 43:03.900
smoother, and with pseudo support, which is great.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.660
That is nice.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.460
Yeah.

43:05.460 --> 43:10.140
And the Amate desktop is working on implementing Wayland support

43:10.140 --> 43:11.740
via Mir.

43:11.740 --> 43:14.500
There is a demo video up on YouTube you can see now.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.340
But Mir essentially acts as a stable API

43:17.340 --> 43:19.020
to interface with Wayland.

43:19.020 --> 43:20.940
Yeah, you can sort of bridge right over to it.

43:20.940 --> 43:23.740
That's a really interesting use case for it.

43:23.740 --> 43:26.780
And that work is primarily being done by a canonical developer

43:26.780 --> 43:28.620
who is not Martin Wimpress.

43:28.620 --> 43:31.660
And then we'll have a link to the Plasma state of affairs,

43:31.660 --> 43:36.180
which looks pretty strong, and Drew DeVault's blog post

43:36.180 --> 43:38.220
on Wayland misconceptions.

43:38.220 --> 43:40.700
Yeah, there's a lot of good info there.

43:40.700 --> 43:43.420
In his, let's say, traditional style,

43:43.420 --> 43:45.500
there's a little bit of brazenness at times,

43:45.500 --> 43:47.420
let's say, because sometimes it's true,

43:47.420 --> 43:48.660
like there are missing features.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.460
But the only way to get those features

43:50.460 --> 43:53.220
is for the people who want them to show up, as he says,

43:53.220 --> 43:54.500
and get to work.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.740
They're happy to offer whatever support.

43:56.740 --> 44:01.220
He develops the WL roots project along with others.

44:01.220 --> 44:02.700
So there's a lot of work going on.

44:02.700 --> 44:05.180
We just kind of have to try it all out,

44:05.180 --> 44:08.860
figure out what's lacking, and then support

44:08.860 --> 44:11.140
development of those features however we can.

44:11.140 --> 44:14.500
Mobile Room, any of you on Wayland for a daily driver

44:14.500 --> 44:16.180
or a frequently used machine?

44:16.180 --> 44:18.940
Anybody rolling that particular dice at this point,

44:18.940 --> 44:20.820
or are you all X11 users in there?

44:20.820 --> 44:23.860
Well, I tried Wayland on my Chromebook,

44:23.860 --> 44:26.020
and I was pretty happy with it.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.860
But I have certain workflows.

44:28.860 --> 44:33.300
And Wayland has still some missing features.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.980
Like you say, I have, for example,

44:34.980 --> 44:38.020
mouse clicks based on window names.

44:38.020 --> 44:42.980
So if I have Firefox and do a left click, it goes side back.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.420
And if I do the same thing in Audacious and Lollipop,

44:45.420 --> 44:47.980
it goes last song.

44:47.980 --> 44:50.980
And I'm missing these kind of features in Wayland.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.580
If we get that, I'm ready to switch, probably.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.180
What about you, Dan?

44:56.180 --> 44:59.220
Are you, by any chance, a Wayland roller?

44:59.220 --> 45:03.020
I tried it a while back on Ubuntu with Gnome.

45:03.020 --> 45:07.300
But I'm using Ubuntu Mate now, so I'm

45:07.300 --> 45:09.300
struggling to get that running.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.700
And in that situation, I would imagine

45:11.700 --> 45:13.700
you're probably like most, you'll probably

45:13.700 --> 45:16.500
switch when the project switched as a default, right?

45:16.500 --> 45:17.420
Yeah, I will.

45:17.420 --> 45:18.060
Yeah.

45:18.060 --> 45:18.660
What about you, Byte?

45:18.660 --> 45:19.660
Have you tried out Wayland?

45:19.660 --> 45:21.860
Are you a Wayland roller, as I'm now calling it,

45:21.860 --> 45:22.980
which is kind of obnoxious?

45:22.980 --> 45:24.780
I love it.

45:24.780 --> 45:28.980
No, I'm just waiting until a WM-based distro comes up

45:28.980 --> 45:30.340
with the standard.

45:30.340 --> 45:31.220
Fair enough.

45:31.220 --> 45:34.180
I mean, I'm curious to see where the Monte project gets

45:34.180 --> 45:36.260
with a mere back end.

45:36.260 --> 45:39.860
Because that could be what I'll just

45:39.860 --> 45:45.220
say more niche desktops end up using, potentially,

45:45.220 --> 45:46.500
however that plays out.

45:46.500 --> 45:49.260
Because you're not really seeing a lot of progress

45:49.260 --> 45:52.580
on the desktops outside of Plasma and Gnome Shell

45:52.580 --> 45:53.740
at this point.

45:53.740 --> 45:54.580
Strong words.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.940
And with the new XFCE release just out, wow.

45:57.940 --> 46:00.300
Well, if I was the XFCE project, and I

46:00.300 --> 46:01.860
needed to start working on something,

46:01.860 --> 46:04.340
it'd be nice to have a stable API to develop against.

46:04.340 --> 46:05.660
And that's what Mir is offering.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.780
And if there is code that the Monte project uses,

46:07.780 --> 46:11.260
which is another GTK-based desktop that I could also

46:11.260 --> 46:14.540
take advantage of, that would be pretty compelling.

46:14.540 --> 46:18.340
And if you look at it, there's a lot of desktops out there.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.380
And they're all pretty dependent on X11.

46:20.380 --> 46:22.700
They're going to be looking for some kind of solution.

46:22.700 --> 46:27.060
Now, projects like Plasma and Gnome Shell, debatably,

46:27.060 --> 46:30.660
have the resources to develop for the full protocol

46:30.660 --> 46:31.820
on their own.

46:31.820 --> 46:35.180
But not every project has that amount of horsepower

46:35.180 --> 46:36.540
to do that kind of development.

46:36.540 --> 46:41.860
But also, if you aren't that different or can share,

46:41.860 --> 46:44.540
we could share and then have some sort of common back end,

46:44.540 --> 46:46.820
which might mean we can concentrate development there

46:46.820 --> 46:47.940
and have something better.

46:47.940 --> 46:49.700
But if you want to give it a go, check out

46:49.700 --> 46:52.340
some of the links we have in the show notes for extensions

46:52.340 --> 46:54.860
or application replacements.

46:54.860 --> 46:58.260
And live the lean extension lifestyle, if possible.

46:58.260 --> 46:59.620
You won't have much of a choice.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.380
There are still enough extensions available

47:01.380 --> 47:02.380
to get you in trouble.

47:02.380 --> 47:04.180
So there's still plenty out there.

47:04.180 --> 47:05.300
Be careful.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.500
Single-threaded.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.980
All right, well, let's move on to a question I think

47:07.980 --> 47:09.820
might just be perfect for Alex.

47:09.820 --> 47:12.340
Ed wrote to me on Twitter, at ChrisLAS,

47:12.340 --> 47:13.900
I've been out of the loop for a while,

47:13.900 --> 47:17.180
and now I need to back up a bunch of family data.

47:17.180 --> 47:19.300
I'm looking for a good incremental backup solution

47:19.300 --> 47:22.060
that will use little storage.

47:22.060 --> 47:26.060
He plans, if possible, to upload the backup to Google Drive.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.460
His server is Ubuntu 19-something.

47:28.460 --> 47:29.540
He doesn't say what.

47:29.540 --> 47:33.580
I'm going to assume 1910, 1904, probably one of those.

47:33.580 --> 47:34.540
It's a good bet.

47:34.540 --> 47:37.380
And if you have any suggestions, he says, he'd love to know.

47:37.380 --> 47:38.980
And thanks for our time, Alex.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.460
I'm curious to know if you have any go-to backup strategies

47:41.460 --> 47:42.980
to get data up on Google Drive.

47:42.980 --> 47:46.540
I might, yeah.

47:46.540 --> 47:47.500
Share them with us.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.580
Give us a little taste.

47:49.580 --> 47:52.060
The one that I use the most is called rClone.

47:52.060 --> 47:56.860
And this uses the fuse to translate transparently

47:56.860 --> 48:01.660
a Google Drive and many other endpoints, for that matter,

48:01.660 --> 48:04.260
transparently to the host operating system.

48:04.260 --> 48:05.020
That's a good one.

48:05.020 --> 48:06.700
There's so many solutions out there.

48:06.700 --> 48:08.260
There's so many different ways you could go that

48:08.260 --> 48:09.860
depend on your setup that you just,

48:09.860 --> 48:11.780
there's a lot of complex issues around this

48:11.780 --> 48:12.900
that you have to consider.

48:12.900 --> 48:15.460
So Wes, you have some sort of resource

48:15.460 --> 48:17.660
people could use that will help them at least see their options?

48:17.660 --> 48:19.940
Yeah, I was just looking around and found

48:19.940 --> 48:22.380
it looks like a new list put together.

48:22.380 --> 48:24.260
They kind of just had a lot of these keys,

48:24.260 --> 48:25.500
little tags for each program.

48:25.500 --> 48:26.540
Because it kind of depends.

48:26.540 --> 48:28.580
Are you considering integrating lots of cloud support,

48:28.580 --> 48:30.080
or are you just looking for something

48:30.080 --> 48:33.620
that can cryptographically verify and encrypt

48:33.620 --> 48:35.340
and then supports incremental?

48:35.340 --> 48:38.100
Or you want the replication as part of the backup tool

48:38.100 --> 48:39.140
or not, right?

48:39.140 --> 48:41.300
Back in the days of TechSnap with Dan,

48:41.300 --> 48:44.220
bacula was a common option that he really liked for managing

48:44.220 --> 48:46.180
big systems for backups.

48:46.180 --> 48:49.940
For some personal stuff, I've used RESTIC before,

48:49.940 --> 48:51.140
which I've enjoyed a lot.

48:51.140 --> 48:54.620
And I have a few things up in TARSNAP, which is not

48:54.620 --> 48:58.740
necessarily open source, but is a nice program, nice setup.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.380
And you can read the code.

49:00.380 --> 49:03.100
And the developer is brilliant.

49:03.100 --> 49:06.900
Another one that I use, which Linux Server Maker Docker for,

49:06.900 --> 49:09.060
is Duplicati.

49:09.060 --> 49:12.160
And this allows you to do incremental file level backup.

49:12.160 --> 49:14.660
I've heard from a good handful of folks in the audience

49:14.660 --> 49:15.580
that use Duplicati.

49:15.580 --> 49:18.100
So I think I've looked at it lightly.

49:18.100 --> 49:20.420
And it sounds like it's pretty popular in the audience.

49:20.420 --> 49:23.020
So Duplicati could be another one to look at.

49:23.020 --> 49:24.580
Put those in the show notes.

49:24.580 --> 49:28.020
If Google isn't your endpoint, there's always rsync.

49:28.020 --> 49:29.100
Just keep it simple.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.300
Yeah, all right.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.900
If you have any suggestions, tweet me.

49:31.900 --> 49:33.100
Let me know, at Chris Elias.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.500
Or join our Telegram, jupitabroadcasting.com

49:35.500 --> 49:36.100
slash telegram.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.500
I'm sure we've missed your favorite backup tool,

49:38.500 --> 49:40.140
because there are 1,000.

49:40.140 --> 49:41.140
Yeah, there are a lot.

49:41.140 --> 49:41.780
There are a lot.

49:41.780 --> 49:43.900
And maybe we'll get a few good suggestions,

49:43.900 --> 49:46.380
and we can integrate them into future coverage.

49:46.380 --> 49:47.580
Carry a pigeon.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.900
Now, we have a couple of picks this week.

49:49.900 --> 49:52.580
Alex, you saved the segment, because I

49:52.580 --> 49:55.100
got a pick in here that I'm kind of meh about,

49:55.100 --> 49:57.660
because it's sort of limited.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.180
It's early days.

49:59.180 --> 50:02.700
It's an open Apple AirDrop implementation

50:02.700 --> 50:04.580
written in Python.

50:04.580 --> 50:09.060
As iPhone users out there really, really need

50:09.060 --> 50:10.500
an AirDrop solution on Linux.

50:10.500 --> 50:14.180
AirDrop is a great solution for Mac to Mac or Mac to iPhone.

50:14.180 --> 50:16.140
But Linux users, we don't get to participate in this,

50:16.140 --> 50:19.140
because all this interesting implementation details.

50:19.140 --> 50:22.380
So that's where OpenDrop comes in.

50:22.380 --> 50:26.300
It is an AirDrop implementation written in Python.

50:26.300 --> 50:26.900
We'll see.

50:26.900 --> 50:27.820
We'll see.

50:27.820 --> 50:29.180
It has certain requirements.

50:29.180 --> 50:31.220
I think it might only work from Linux to Mac.

50:31.220 --> 50:35.220
It requires that you install a few packages via brew on Mac OS.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.020
So I wasn't feeling good about this.

50:37.020 --> 50:39.700
But I wanted to let those of you out there know that need this.

50:39.700 --> 50:41.380
There could be something.

50:41.380 --> 50:45.740
And Alex came in with a Hail Mary for our pick segment today.

50:45.740 --> 50:48.300
And it's special.

50:48.300 --> 50:51.220
It's really something that's going to drive you crazy.

50:51.220 --> 50:52.860
It's called Process Wallpaper.

50:52.860 --> 50:54.140
Tell me about this, Alex.

50:54.140 --> 50:58.620
Have you ever wanted your wallpaper to be a cloud of words

50:58.620 --> 51:00.740
showing your most used process?

51:00.740 --> 51:03.620
Well, if you have, great news.

51:03.620 --> 51:04.540
I've never wanted that.

51:04.540 --> 51:05.820
Never in my life wanted that.

51:05.820 --> 51:06.620
But now you see it.

51:06.620 --> 51:07.940
You do want it, right?

51:07.940 --> 51:08.500
I kind of do.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.940
It uses pleasant colors.

51:10.940 --> 51:12.260
Oh, yeah, it looks kind of nice.

51:12.260 --> 51:13.380
I almost want to try it.

51:13.380 --> 51:16.740
Now, do be careful that you're only running things

51:16.740 --> 51:19.420
with polite names now.

51:19.420 --> 51:20.740
I suppose so.

51:20.740 --> 51:24.180
It looks like if you want Spotify and Gnome Shell

51:24.180 --> 51:25.820
on your background, this is a good picture.

51:25.820 --> 51:26.580
That's a good way to do it.

51:26.580 --> 51:28.900
I am now a little curious what mine would look like.

51:28.900 --> 51:29.900
You should try it.

51:29.900 --> 51:30.580
It's pretty neat.

51:30.580 --> 51:32.700
It's a Python script that basically looks

51:32.700 --> 51:34.580
at all your processes and then puts together

51:34.580 --> 51:39.020
a nice color-coordinated word cloud

51:39.020 --> 51:40.420
and sets that as your background.

51:40.420 --> 51:42.620
And it's neater than you'd think, actually.

51:42.620 --> 51:43.740
It looks kind of good.

51:43.740 --> 51:46.940
But doesn't that just chew up more CPU cycles?

51:46.940 --> 51:49.260
Well, you'll know if it shows up on your background.

51:49.260 --> 51:50.020
Yeah, exactly.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.820
That's the one thing that seems to be

51:51.820 --> 51:55.260
missing on their example wallpaper

51:55.260 --> 51:56.980
is their own application name.

51:56.980 --> 51:59.900
It's interesting that ex-Wayland shows up, but not much.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.180
So whoever took the screenshot is a Wayland user.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.460
How fitting for today's episode.

52:04.460 --> 52:06.220
That is perfect.

52:06.220 --> 52:08.420
Diddle down in the chat room saying Konki.

52:08.420 --> 52:08.980
Oh, yeah.

52:08.980 --> 52:13.140
If you've got weeks and weeks to spare, sure.

52:13.140 --> 52:15.380
Good memories and bad memories with Konki right there.

52:15.380 --> 52:17.500
It's been a while since I've sort of tuned my desktop

52:17.500 --> 52:19.020
and gone to that level.

52:19.020 --> 52:20.180
What's the install process?

52:20.180 --> 52:20.820
I've got to look at that.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.300
Oh, yeah.

52:21.300 --> 52:21.820
So it's easy.

52:21.820 --> 52:22.900
It's just a Python script.

52:22.900 --> 52:26.140
You probably already have Python 3.

52:26.140 --> 52:29.900
A GNOME desktop environment is required for setup.ssh

52:29.900 --> 52:31.460
to change the wallpaper automatically,

52:31.460 --> 52:33.500
but it will export just a PNG.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.860
So you can hook that up to your desktop however you want.

52:35.860 --> 52:38.740
Wow, this is a really on-topic pick, Alex.

52:38.740 --> 52:40.500
See how he just saved the segment right there?

52:40.500 --> 52:41.260
He just saved it.

52:41.260 --> 52:42.100
You're welcome.

52:42.100 --> 52:45.340
I was coming in with this crappy half-working open AirDrop

52:45.340 --> 52:49.780
alternative, and you gave us a lemonade, so I appreciate that.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.940
Thank you, Alex.

52:51.940 --> 52:53.220
It's a pleasure.

52:53.220 --> 52:55.140
All right, thank you to the mumble room as well.

52:55.140 --> 52:55.900
What do you got there, Wes?

52:55.900 --> 52:56.220
You tried it?

52:56.220 --> 52:57.580
Oh, yeah, I tried it.

52:57.580 --> 52:59.140
Actually looks kind of good.

52:59.140 --> 52:59.860
Doesn't look bad.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.340
Chrome is using a lot of resources.

53:01.340 --> 53:05.100
Yeah, I forgot that I was running wine for some Jack

53:05.100 --> 53:05.940
plugin.

53:05.940 --> 53:07.300
What's going on here?

53:07.300 --> 53:08.380
You say Electron.

53:08.380 --> 53:10.180
I say Flash 2.0.

53:10.180 --> 53:11.220
That's right.

53:11.220 --> 53:14.900
All right, so that's the show, I guess.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.900
Thanks for coming.

53:15.900 --> 53:20.140

53:31.420 --> 53:32.100
You do the math.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.220
See you next Tuesday!

53:33.220 --> 53:46.220
I'm going to go get some coffee.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.220
See you.

53:47.220 --> 53:48.220
Bye.

53:48.220 --> 53:49.220
Bye.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.220
Bye.

53:50.220 --> 53:51.220
Bye.

53:51.220 --> 53:52.220
Bye.

53:52.220 --> 53:53.220
Bye.

53:53.220 --> 53:54.220
Bye.

53:54.220 --> 53:55.220
Bye.

53:55.220 --> 53:56.220
Bye.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.220
Bye.

53:57.220 --> 53:58.220
Bye.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.220
Bye.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.220
Bye.

54:00.220 --> 54:01.220
Bye.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.220
Bye.

54:02.220 --> 54:03.220
Bye.

54:03.220 --> 54:04.220
Bye.

54:04.220 --> 54:05.220
Bye.

54:05.220 --> 54:06.220
See you later.

54:06.220 --> 54:07.520
Hey, Unplugged program.

54:07.520 --> 54:08.520
Oh—all right.

54:08.520 --> 54:13.440
Now, we've got to title this thing.

54:13.440 --> 54:16.320
There's a story that didn't quite make it into the show I was looking at.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.280
Oh, it's just what you figure.

54:19.280 --> 54:24.120
If you were going to place a bet on if vendor firmwares work patched and following modern

54:24.120 --> 54:25.760
practices, you'd probably bet that they're not.

54:25.760 --> 54:26.760
Right?

54:26.760 --> 54:27.760
Yeah.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.760
Oh, yeah.

54:28.760 --> 54:29.760
Shocker.

54:29.760 --> 54:30.760
It's true.

54:30.760 --> 54:36.280
is what one researcher found. That's, according to Sarah Zataco, she's the chief scientist

54:36.280 --> 54:40.880
at the Cyber Independent Testing Lab, which is a nonprofit organization that conducts

54:40.880 --> 54:46.740
independent tests on software security. Quote, we found no consistency in vendor or product

54:46.740 --> 54:51.560
line doing better, or even showing improvement. There was no evidence that anybody is making

54:51.560 --> 54:56.680
a concerted effort to address, to address, I like this, safety hygiene of their products.

54:56.680 --> 55:00.840
Yeah, oh man, Microtech's looking pretty bad in this little result, as is Belkin.

55:00.840 --> 55:07.600
Well, Asus doesn't look so good either, and sorry Ubiquiti fanboys, which there are many

55:07.600 --> 55:17.000
of, the UAP AC Pro wireless access points, as well as the D-Link DWL 6600 access points,

55:17.000 --> 55:22.860
suck. They only did slightly better than average on the overall assessment. Yeah, sorry.

55:22.860 --> 55:27.920
I have three, five, nine of those in deployment right now.

55:27.920 --> 55:34.720
You know, I looked at doing this, covering this story in the TechSnap episode that's

55:34.720 --> 55:37.400
coming out later this week, but it was just too depressing.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.800
It is a bit of a bummer, and I think it continues to validate why it's important that we as

55:41.800 --> 55:44.760
consumers have the option to install our own firmwares.

55:44.760 --> 55:48.160
Yeah, and we need to figure out a way to make this, you know, a thing that, like, how do

55:48.160 --> 55:51.160
we get this in the culture so that we have ways to know? Because if you don't know, you

55:51.160 --> 55:53.800
can't actually choose what you're buying with any validation.

55:53.800 --> 56:00.040
I kind of think you could get awareness about the issues with the firmware via the conversation

56:00.040 --> 56:02.880
about why it's important consumers can install a firmware.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.880
Right.

56:03.880 --> 56:08.040
Because it'll sort of beget the question, well, why? And then in that conversation,

56:08.040 --> 56:12.840
you'll talk about all of the issues. And I think the way to start having that conversation

56:12.840 --> 56:18.920
is to really hammer on the point that these are devices in our homes. We buy these, we

56:18.920 --> 56:21.720
own these, and then we put them in our homes.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.040
Oftentimes, they control access, right? They're like a gateway to our home.

56:25.040 --> 56:31.000
So it should be my right to install anything I want. If I want to attempt to put Windows

56:31.000 --> 56:32.920
10 on a Linksys, I should have...

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
You are a madman.

56:33.920 --> 56:38.080
I would never, but I should be able to at least flash it with my own firmware. It is

56:38.080 --> 56:42.760
just like if I wanted to, for some reason, take the door off my microwave. You know,

56:42.760 --> 56:44.520
it's a dumb thing to do in some cases.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.080
That's why the studio looks like this.

56:47.080 --> 56:50.000
Have you put a fork in there yet? Try a CD. It's great.
