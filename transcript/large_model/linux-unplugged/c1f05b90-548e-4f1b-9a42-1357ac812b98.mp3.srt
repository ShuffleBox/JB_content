1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
So, we kind of got this all thrown together.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,820
We weren't quite sure where we were going to get a spot, and we weren't quite sure what

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,500
kind of connectivity we were going to have, but they do have like these connectivity stations

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,280
with power and USB, and like these tables, and they built these boxes on top with plugs,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,460
four plugs on each side, and so we kind of just came over and commandeered one and took

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,200
it over, and now that's where we're broadcasting from.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,360
I actually predicted that as we were walking in.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,680
I said, you know, and he goes, how are we going to make sure we get that spot?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,160
And I said, well, if we just start setting down microphones and mixers and like, excuse

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,240
me, sorry, everyone will just kind of move, and sure enough, they moved.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,040
It was great.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:55,360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 106 for August 18th, 2015.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's live from LinuxCon 2015 in

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Seattle, Washington.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
My name is Chris.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
And my name is Noah.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Hey, Noah.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Are you ready for an exciting show today?

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Jeez, am I ever.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,440
It's only taken us two hours to get here, three hours to get here.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,480
It's exciting for us because we're live on the floor, and that's always, especially when

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,040
you get here and you don't know where you're going to be live from, it's a bit challenging,

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,560
but not only are we here, but we took the con experience up to the next level because

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,480
we're also here with our Mumble Room, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Hello, guys.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm glad our virtual Lug could be here.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
They know the Seattle Greater Linux Users Group is upstairs.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
We should talk to them at some point.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
They have-

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
That'd be really cool.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Their Lug is here.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,200
And it kind of got me thinking, we could bring the Mumble Room with us to after show parties

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
and just bring them on a phone.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
That'd be really cool.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh, that'd be heck of fun, yeah.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Maybe if we do that.

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
I got the Mumble Client installed on my phone.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah.

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,120
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, we have a couple of things from

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,320
the floor we're going to play.

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Bruce Schneier, renowned security expert, gave a keynote talk this morning and he had

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,120
some interesting points he wanted to make.

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
You-

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Me?

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,160
You managed to finally get somebody from HP to go on record and talk about some of the

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,200
behind the scenes stuff that they have not shared publicly that they're doing on Linux.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I did.

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,640
I've been sitting on that information for over a year and it was driving me nuts.

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Yeah.

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Absolutely nuts.

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,040
Because they would not confirm it publicly.

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,520
It's like this big thing, this big huge thing inside of HP that everyone's using Linux and

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,120
they wouldn't talk about it on camera.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,320
And I harassed the heck out of them last year and I didn't get anywhere.

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,520
And then this year, a person found a guy who found a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,460
that was able to talk on camera about it.

59
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,440
And so we got it.

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,080
So LinuxCon Seattle is about three floors of goodness.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,480
There's your basic floor, then you've got your second floor where, to be honest with

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,160
you guys, we thought was the main floor when we first got here.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,320
And we'll get to that in just a second.

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,200
And then there's a third floor where people have sponsored and some other showcases are

65
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
up there.

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,640
And it's right here in Seattle on sixth and I think it's Pike.

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,120
It's at the Sheraton Hotel and it's a really, really, really nice location because if you

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,400
get a little burned out and you want to go get some fresh air, you can just go for a

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
walk.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,800
And there's tons of nice places here in Seattle to go to and so we've taken advantage of that.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,640
And we'll probably tell you a little bit more about that later on in the show today.

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,540
But I wanted to tell them about our first impressions when we walked into LinuxCon.

73
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,400
It's a little embarrassing but I'm willing to admit it.

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Kind of.

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
But I mean I don't think that was really our fault.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I think that's more of a layout issue.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Yeah.

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
You think so?

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,280
So we got in and the first thing you find is the registration desk and that's where

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,360
you get your badge and your shirt and your swag bag and stuff like that.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,680
So we go over there and had a nice lovely conversation with the lady who, by the way,

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,600
told me to walk through a wall and she sends us upstairs because you register at one booth

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,920
and then they send you up to another floor which there's another registration booth where

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,640
you hand a ticket from the first registration booth to get the rest of the stuff that you

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
thought you were going to get at the one that you went to to begin with.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,520
So after we got through the two registration booths, one to register and one to get the

88
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,480
stuff that I should have got the first one, then we walk out like right out of that second

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,960
registration area and we see what appears to be the show hall.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,480
And there are like nine booths and Chris looks at me and goes, well, is this all there is?

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,140
And I remember last year the expo hall was actually so small that they actually put it

92
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,720
inside of the keynote room and it was just, there was the keynotes and then at the back

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,000
wall, along that back wall were the booths.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That was it.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,320
You missed a key part of our trip too because our first stop was actually the media room.

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
That's where our first, we didn't actually go to the expo floor first, we went to the

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
media room.

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh, that's right to drop stuff off.

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,600
And then we bumped into a friend of ours and he said, did you guys see how small the floor

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
is?

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
And I said, what?

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
And he's like, did you see how small the floor is?

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
It's unbelievable.

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,400
And that is why when we got there we thought, oh, this must be it.

105
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
This must be the floor.

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
And the other thing that was sort of fascinating about it is when we got there, we realized

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,440
every single one of these booths was basically a deviation on itself.

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,500
Like they were all the same product, just different makers, like it was all container

109
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
management software.

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,160
And we were like, oh wow, this is it?

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,840
And so then I was a little bummed, I'm like, I'm not sure who we're going to talk to.

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Container Con 2015, man.

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Yeah.

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,440
And it really, you know what, that first impression does kind of stick.

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,040
It really is Container Con 2015.

116
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,480
Docker, and we're going to talk about that more in a moment, but this is Container Con.

117
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,560
But however, it turns out when you go up to the third floor, you get your more traditional

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,800
vendors like here we've got Cloud Foundry and Cisco and Citrix and Canonical and Docker

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,000
and Digital Ocean is here, GitHub's here, and Google is here.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course, the Linux Fest Northwest guys are here and SUSE is here and Stack Exchange is

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,680
here and Samsung and SanDisk and a couple other well-known folks.

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,200
You probably know of Amazon Web Services is here, Atlassian is here, and a couple that

123
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,640
we're going to place some interviews for you are from here too.

124
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,720
So once we got to the third floor, it was actually, it seems like a pretty happening

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
event and the sessions are really intense.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,040
A lot of sessions this time all about containers, not all containers, but a lot of sessions

127
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,280
about running software in container, managing applications in containers, putting your desktop

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,720
applications in containers, like it's all about the different specs, the app spec, and

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
the different initiatives.

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Maybe that's why they've codenamed it Container Con.

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Yeah, it's definitely the theme here.

132
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,280
I got a couple of clips I want to play, a couple of interviews I want to get into.

133
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
We had a few people in the chatroom that asked us to kind of compare the difference between

134
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,500
Linux Con and Linux Fest, so I want to do that in a little bit as well and kind of give

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
you our general impressions.

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,160
So before we get to the first interview, I do have a bit of an outtake I could play.

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
Do you want me to play our first outtake?

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Sure.

139
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Yeah, let's do that.

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,800
This is Chris and Noah entering the Linux Con and I was going to record, you know, build

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,280
this beautiful theater of the mind for you guys so we'd really be able to illustrate

142
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,400
what it's like to get here, but, well, Noah was very, very enthusiastic about creating

143
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,960
that theater of the mind and he might have gone a little overboard with painting the

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,280
picture.

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Here we go, Noah.

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Linux Con 2015.

147
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
All right, let's walk through the door.

148
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Inside.

149
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Head to the escalator.

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Step on here.

151
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
You're so bad.

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm trying to give them a story.

153
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
What's happening?

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
You're too obvious.

155
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
What's happening right now?

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
You don't know.

157
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
You don't know.

158
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
You just paint the scene with the sound.

159
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Paint the scene.

160
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
There's no sound.

161
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:26,840
So we got here and we do have a couple of interviews to play.

162
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
We went to it.

163
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
The first thing we got to work was we knew we had to get some stuff for Linux Unplugged

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,400
because we had a live broadcast and that was our first drop-dead thing.

165
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
So before we get into that, I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean, the first sponsor

166
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,960
on today's Linux Unplugged.

167
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,720
Digital Ocean is super, super handy.

168
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,480
We're bouncing clips around and things like that and it's very, very easy to spin up droplets

169
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,260
and when you combine it with something like Docker and man is Docker huge here at Linux

170
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,760
Con and of course Digital Ocean is here as well.

171
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,800
You really have something special.

172
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,760
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get a $10 credit and here's the best part.

173
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,540
Digital Ocean has $5 a month plans.

174
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,320
So for $5 a month and less than 55 seconds, you can spin up a droplet with 512 megabytes

175
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,760
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and they've got data center locations

176
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,720
in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London and a brand new one in Germany with

177
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
lots of great connectivity and good regional locations and Digital Ocean's interface is

178
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,000
so slick and straightforward.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Zero resistance to get something up and running or deploy an application.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,240
You want to do Ubuntu LTS with Apache or something like that.

181
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
It's clicks away.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
There's so many great ways to deploy software using their interface but even better, they

183
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,920
have a straightforward API you can take advantage of and snap it into your existing management

184
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
infrastructure or just use some of the great apps.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,160
They have so many good community tutorials that have been written by the community with

186
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,680
professional editing done to them.

187
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,840
They pay people to edit them.

188
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,400
It is a really good experience and it's great for testing and production.

189
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,240
We use it for all of the above and it is our go-to Linux deployment platform in the cloud

190
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,400
and if you use Docker, if you use CoreOS, if you're using FreeBSD, if you're using

191
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,720
CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, you name it, you can deploy it on Digital Ocean in seconds.

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

193
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,660
You can use that at any time and that'll apply a $10 credit to your account and you can also

194
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,040
support the Unplugged podcast.

195
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
Go to digitalocean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to Digital

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,040
Ocean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

197
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,560
All right, Mr. Colonel, Linux over there.

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,720
What do you say we jump into a couple of our interviews that we got here and then we'll

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
kind of chat about it a little bit.

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,040
Man, would I like to do that.

201
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,120
And I wanted to start with the core infrastructure projects announcement this morning.

202
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,040
They had a keynote this morning and they covered a lot of things but one of the initiatives

203
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,800
that keeps getting better and better is in the wake of Heartbleed and Shellshock.

204
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,720
We saw the Linux Foundation along with a bunch of other stakeholders in the industry come

205
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,920
together and launch the core infrastructure initiative.

206
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,840
And the core infrastructure initiative project has been giving out money.

207
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,160
They just announced they're going to be paying for the main developer of NTP, Father Time

208
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,200
is what people call him.

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,320
And he's been working on NTP just making nothing but pennies.

210
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,080
And now they just announced they're going to support him which is great.

211
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,440
Hopefully they'll help with some of these NTP reflection attacks.

212
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
All the different projects they're investing in have been extremely important.

213
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,800
But there's been one thing that we really haven't been able to kind of agree upon industry

214
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,040
wide and I think we could all agree that if we don't come up with a common set of agreements

215
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,420
and standards, governments will.

216
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,520
And so the core initiative project is setting out to create a open source best practices

217
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,120
program that's going to be hosted up on GitHub and this clip tells us a little bit about

218
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
it.

219
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,040
What we're doing is announcing essentially an open source project which will be rolled

220
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,440
out later this year but we wanted to get community feedback on a best practice program that essentially

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,640
allows open source projects to meet a set of criteria whether it's having a security

222
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,680
mailing list, peer checking of code, doing static analysis on your code, doing threat

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,560
modeling on your code to essentially indicate that you care about security and that it's

224
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,460
important to your project.

225
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,040
People who receive that badge will be able to display it on their project site or in

226
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,840
GitHub and indicate that they have met that criteria.

227
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,320
What we really want is all of your feedback and we don't want it in the form of a bunch

228
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
of comments.

229
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,460
We would love it in the form of GitHub poll requests.

230
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,280
So we are doing this, this goes live today.

231
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,000
We're actually announcing this later on this afternoon at a media exclusive luncheon on

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,120
the core infrastructure initiative so you all are getting a sneak preview of this today.

233
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,040
Now I think this is a fascinating idea so it's sort of a voluntary program submission

234
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,480
and you get a certified, you meet the best practices and I've been talking about this

235
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,280
on and off with Alan on TechSnap but how do we solve this problem where as a business

236
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,360
you want to use open source in your enterprise but you don't know if it meets a certain,

237
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't know if quality standards is the right word but security standards.

238
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,960
You want it to meet a standard, whatever standard that is and actually that makes a lot of sense

239
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,080
right because we do that in basically every other field.

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,520
Aviation, anyone can make something but they rate it to be used in aviation.

241
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Or like for example Oracle right?

242
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,920
They go out and get their software better business bureau certified for certain amounts

243
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,920
of software to be free of certain amount of flaws which is kind of a total joke but there

244
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,400
are industry certifications now and this is one that I think what's cool about this is

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,560
it's going to be open up to the general public and I don't know if anybody in the Mubroom

246
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,120
has any thoughts on a program like this or maybe any potential downsides but since it

247
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,100
seems volunteer based to me, it seems like a pretty good approach to this and I like

248
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,840
this being run by the Core Infrastructure Initiative because they seem to have their

249
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,720
priorities pretty well aligned.

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
Anybody in the Mubroom have any thoughts on this?

251
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Going once?

252
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Twice?

253
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
No takers.

254
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,520
Okay, all right, well then we'll move on.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I thought it was a good move.

256
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,360
I think I really like what the Core Infrastructure Initiative is doing in the wake of Shellshock

257
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
and things like that.

258
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm very, very happy about that.

259
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,400
All right, Mr. Noah, then I'm ready for my next clip here and this one was kind of interesting.

260
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,560
It was from Bruce Schneier and he was talking about attributions of cyber attacks and why

261
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,720
attribution is so hard and kind of using the Sony attack in sort of the lens to look through

262
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,720
this problem and if you recall, Sony was using Linux and Apache web servers and things like

263
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,940
that so it's kind of relevant to us because a lot of times Linux is in the server infrastructure

264
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,920
so if there's a problem there, it very much falls on the Linux system administrator to

265
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
manage that.

266
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,280
So Bruce Schneier, he was connected in via Google Hangouts this morning for the keynote.

267
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,580
There's a little bit of audio glitchiness because his computer had bad audio but the

268
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,400
content is super critical and important especially with what's going on these days in cybersecurity.

269
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,800
So here's Bruce Schneier talking about how attribution is difficult.

270
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,880
The other big issue and I think the biggest issue that Sony brought out is that attribution

271
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
is difficult.

272
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,640
I mean, compared to attacks, in 2006, Israel attacked a Syrian nuclear power plant.

273
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:03,080
They did it with planes, planes and bombs and the recipient of the attack, Syria, could

274
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,480
look up in the sky, see the planes, see the flags painted on their tails and know where

275
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,160
the attack came from.

276
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,600
2010, US and Israel attacked an Iranian nuclear power plant.

277
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,800
We did it with a cyber weapon, with Stuxnet.

278
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,320
The difference is that there was no way for Iran to attribute the attack.

279
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,920
Actually, Iran didn't seem to have known it was an attack until either the press outed

280
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,660
it or possibly Israel or US called Iran on some diplomatic channel and told them.

281
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,640
It's very difficult to attribute attacks on the internet.

282
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,200
We know this is true, packets don't come with return addresses and it's easy to false flag.

283
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,920
It's easy to pretend your attack comes from somewhere else.

284
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,680
My belief is that a lot of attacks from the western countries go through China simply

285
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,680
because everyone knows a lot of attacks go through China and that's a perfect way to

286
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,160
hide where you're from.

287
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,960
I actually was really glad he made that point.

288
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,400
It's very possible that attacks from western countries are just being routed through China

289
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,640
because a lot of times they're just a Chinese attack.

290
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,480
Now one of the things that jumped out at me about that talk, and he's talking about security,

291
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,480
is one of the main things that the vendors here are showcasing is how to patch your applications

292
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
in containers.

293
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,560
Everybody has a different solution for that, how to manage container security, how to update

294
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,280
applications in containers, how to know when the applications in the containers have gone

295
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,360
behind, how to know when the application quits working.

296
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,240
All of that is, I would say, and maybe do you agree that it seems to be the number one

297
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,360
product that's being talked about here, the number one problem?

298
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,560
The container technologies themselves, we've built communities and the standards exist

299
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
for that.

300
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,280
What's left, where the market is, where there's left to make a business or money is in products

301
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
managing those things.

302
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,600
It's like we're talking about the drive, is you're not going to, nobody is going to manage

303
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,640
that stuff from the command line, even if it's possible.

304
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,200
You need some sort of a solution, especially if you're doing it at a stand.

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,200
The other thing is containers encourage you to have a lot of them because not only is

306
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,480
your density higher versus virtualization, so on a server that could have 10 virtual

307
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,000
machines maybe you can now have 20 containers because you don't have the emulation overhead,

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,800
but you also are encouraged to do a container per application.

309
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,560
You put your mail server in a container and your web server in a container and your group

310
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
collaboration thing.

311
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,000
All these different things go in containers, all of a sudden you have a dozen containers

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
for one small office.

313
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,820
One of the things that they're finding and talking about here is that container proliferation

314
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,600
is just exploding and then even small shops have all of these containers they have to

315
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
manage.

316
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,880
Then the other thing they want to do is move them between services depending on which is

317
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,560
more cost effective.

318
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,240
Schneier talking about attribution and tracking all of this and security patches and updates

319
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,560
is kind of relevant, so that is a problem they're trying to solve here.

320
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,720
I actually really liked his point about why we are seeing so much attribution to China

321
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
and Russia these days.

322
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
Whenever you hear about a cyber attack, it's Iran, China, North Korea, or Russia every

323
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
single time.

324
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
It's never anybody else.

325
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
It's never Canada.

326
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,520
It's never Mexico.

327
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,960
Sometimes it's the Syrian Electronic Army, but not so often.

328
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,000
It's usually one of those guys.

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,800
He tells us why and it's genius.

330
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,680
What I love about Schneier is for the first 5, 10 minutes of his talk, I was like, oh,

331
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,280
this is no good.

332
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Why is this at LinuxCon?

333
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
Why is he saying this stuff?

334
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Then the second half of his talk was all like he took what he had set up and kind of re-looked

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,960
at it in another lens.

336
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,340
He's connected a few dots for me that I'm not quite like why are we just so publicly

337
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,280
slamming these massively powerful nations and saying you're hacking us with the OPM

338
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,840
breach or whatever it might be.

339
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,240
It's China.

340
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Why are we doing this?

341
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
He explains why.

342
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I thought it was fascinating.

343
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,720
Then after that, we have the HP interview, which they also were here talking about the

344
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
machine.

345
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
That was interesting too.

346
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Before we get to that, I'll tell you about Linux Academy because we were chatting with

347
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,280
some folks in the hallway about different educational resources.

348
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,360
I think Linux Academy has something unique that the other guys don't have.

349
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,600
I tell you, it comes up all the time, especially with containers, is this technology is a moving

350
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
target.

351
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,960
App spec is relatively new.

352
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,720
Not much of the courseware out there really reflects that fact.

353
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,760
In fact, pretty much almost none of them do.

354
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,500
The difference with Linux Academy is those enthusiasts there at Linux Academy are following

355
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,520
this stuff because they want to.

356
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,320
They're following this stuff because that's what they're passionate about.

357
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,360
Then they got together with educators and developers and they created the Linux Academy

358
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,720
education platform.

359
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,000
You go there, you figure out what you want to learn, they tell you how long it's going

360
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to take.

361
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,680
They automatically spin up the virtual machines to match the distribution you choose from

363
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,000
and the courseware adjust.

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,280
They've just added new courses as well because they're adding new content constantly.

365
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,200
They have team accounts as well, so if a few people want to go in and learn something,

366
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
you can.

367
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
That's a good way to motivate each other.

368
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
They have an active community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

369
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
I encourage you to go there and look at the different programs.

370
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,560
Get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

371
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,760
That'll give you our 33% discount.

372
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
When you're there, log in.

373
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,880
Look how long it's going to take you to learn Python or Ruby or Apache or backing up your

374
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,160
machine using TAR, whatever gap you have in your knowledge set that you want to fill in.

375
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Linux Academy has courses on it.

376
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,920
They also have these nuggets.

377
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,840
You can find them and you go there in like two minutes to 60 minutes long.

378
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,940
They just deep dive right into exactly a course that you want to learn about, which is really

379
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,200
kind of nice because I've been able to use their time availability planner when I'm kind

380
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,580
of like getting on more of a routine, and then when it comes time to just really focus

381
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,920
in on work and I don't really have time to get in something deep, I can still do a nugget

382
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
from time to time.

383
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,440
My certification's coming up at the end of this year for Red Hat.

384
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,960
My last certification was in RHEL 6, and now I'll be doing RHEL 7.

385
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
I have gotten the practical things nailed down so that I can start rolling out because

386
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,820
we want to be using the... RHEL is, I don't want to say behind, but as stable as it is.

387
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:11,880
When you go to... If you're not using the latest stable version, it's really stable.

388
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,360
I have nailed out the practical things, but what I haven't quite got down is all the nuances

389
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,160
that they're going to ask me on the test.

390
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,800
I don't have time, as you might imagine, to take off a week to go do all of my recertification

391
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040
stuff, but I need to learn all the stuff that they're going to ask me.

392
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,880
I found out Linux Academy actually has a course on that.

393
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
I use them to learn the practical things.

394
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Now I'm going to go back and I'm going to actually retake the course this time and go

395
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,480
all the way through and learn all of the differences between RHEL 6 and RHEL 7.

396
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,800
That's only possible because I can do that from my laptop while I'm here in Seattle because

397
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,800
everything always takes longer than they think it's going to, you know what I'm saying?

398
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
That'll be great.

399
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
That's nice.

400
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
Go to linux.com slash unplugged to go get the Linux Unplugged discount and support this

401
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,360
show and just take your skill set up a notch.

402
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Linux Academy.

403
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Thanks Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

404
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
You guys rock.

405
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,080
Okay, let's play this Schneier clip here.

406
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,000
This Schneier clip is our last one from Bruce, although I might go through his talk and see

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
if there's any more we want to pull out, but I wanted to grab these ones because I thought

408
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,920
these were short enough but extremely poignant and just for anybody involved and interested

409
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,720
in technology, very relevant.

410
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,120
So here's Bruce Schneier on why we're seeing so much attribution these days, basically

411
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,760
why we're seeing the blame game from different nations.

412
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,960
And there's an arms race here, which I think is important to think about this arms race

413
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,680
between attributing attacks and hiding the origins of attacks, attribution versus deception.

414
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,640
And the US is in a singularly powerful position here.

415
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,520
The NSA surveils much of the internet for a bunch of reasons, right?

416
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,780
They have a bigger budget than everyone else, actually than everyone else combined.

417
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,000
And the way the internet is routed, a lot of traffic goes through the United States.

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,240
Big article on the 15th last week on how AT&T is doing quite a lot of eavesdropping for

419
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:02,720
the NSA, both within the United States and in their network points all around the world.

420
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,760
2012, the US Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, he said publicly, he's talking publicly about

421
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,800
attribution and I'm going to read a quote of his, that the US has made significant advances

422
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,360
in identifying the origins of cyber attacks.

423
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,160
That's an interesting statement.

424
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,080
And we actually don't know what that means.

425
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,760
We don't know if the NSA has some fundamental technological advance in identifying packets.

426
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,660
Probably not, or that their espionage is so good that they're monitoring the planning

427
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
process.

428
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,520
I mean, we don't know what sort of secret evidence the NSA had.

429
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,080
I mean, did they have recorded phone calls from North Korea discussing the plan?

430
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,720
In my fantasies, I think they have the document of King Jong Un's signature on the approval

431
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,640
to go through with this.

432
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,860
We actually don't know what.

433
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,920
But it's interesting that attribution leads to deterrence.

434
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:11,100
In the past couple of years, the United States has been more forthcoming in identifying who

435
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,840
attacked them.

436
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,360
They've in several cases identified North Korea.

437
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Last year, we indicted five North Korean government officials in absentia for hacking.

438
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,880
We've attributed Russia, oddly in the OPM attack, there was one statement by Clapper

439
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,040
where he said it was China and then everyone kind of backed off and there's no official

440
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
attribution.

441
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,600
But by and large, we're seeing more attribution.

442
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:49,000
I think that's because it's in the U.S.'s best interests to signal that they can attribute,

443
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,840
to say to the world that if you try this, we will know it's you.

444
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,080
And there is deterrence here.

445
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,280
Actually, I think that leads to over attribution in some cases.

446
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,880
But the thing about attribution in cyberspace is that providing evidence is tricky.

447
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,400
Initially, the United States fingered North Korea, but provided very minimal evidence.

448
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,060
And there's broad mistrust in the security community.

449
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,760
So there was a lot of people, myself included, who just didn't believe them.

450
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,280
And if you think about it, there are several types of attribution.

451
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,760
There's the lowest, where I know you did it.

452
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,560
There's a little harder, I know you did it and it can prove to you I know you did it.

453
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,200
And then the hardest of all, I know you did it and it can prove to the world I know you

454
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
did it.

455
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,200
The United States succeeded at one, possibly we succeeded at two, but we failed at number

456
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,840
three.

457
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
Attribution based on secret evidence is untrusted.

458
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,120
We all remember Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.

459
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:07,760
And this problem only becomes worse as more of our attribution relies on secret evidence.

460
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,800
We're going to announce who attacked, we're going to expect the world to support us in

461
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:20,920
retaliatory action, and yet we won't be able to prove who did it.

462
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,880
And this is going to be complicated.

463
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,560
Hmm, complicated indeed.

464
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,640
So sorry about the little crackly of the audio there, but that was just his feed coming into

465
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
the con today.

466
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,400
It wasn't anything we could do about that in the recording.

467
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
But I thought it was really interesting.

468
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
He says, essentially, one of the reasons we're doing attribution is because it kind of defers

469
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
people from doing further attacks because they know we'll call them out.

470
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's kind of interesting.

471
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,720
Maybe that is why we call out China or call out...

472
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,280
You can tell he's from the internet.

473
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Why is that?

474
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,480
It's just that that's the recourse that you have on the internet, right?

475
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,200
Just calling people out on things.

476
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Yeah.

477
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Trolling, I guess.

478
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Yeah.

479
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,560
So Schneier went on for a little bit longer and talked more about the problem.

480
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,680
And I'll see if there's any more clips you want to pull out of that.

481
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,280
No, I want to talk a little bit about the differences between LinuxCon and a LinuxFest.

482
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,120
And I think, trying to keep in mind, there's two different audiences for each.

483
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,760
Do you want to describe what you think?

484
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,040
So I tell you what, maybe you want to take the...

485
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,480
Maybe you can take one and I'll take the other.

486
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,460
So I'll come at it from the ultra-speed perspective.

487
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,880
So I have attended LinuxCons for many, many years, probably going on, well, since 2009.

488
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,740
So I've been there numerous times.

489
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:38,680
And only in the past year, I have come from the eyes of the community member that's interested

490
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
in the projects.

491
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,480
Prior to that, I've always come to LinuxCon with the idea of I need to come back with

492
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,480
ways, with solutions for my customers, and ways that I can make money.

493
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,320
Because at the end of the day, while talking about the community and open source and software,

494
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
that's all great.

495
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,840
Somehow, I have to find ways to buy McDonald's and buy hotels to come out here and do stuff.

496
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,360
I can't do that if I can't sell solutions.

497
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,480
And so LinuxCon, and OSCON really, are both conferences that are really geared towards

498
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
doing that.

499
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,360
And I know that that kind of rubbed you the wrong way in some circumstances, in that this

500
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,960
idea that everyone is selling something.

501
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,320
And there is a difference there.

502
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,540
And as a community member, as somebody who's just interested in seeing Linux and playing

503
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,440
with Linux, it's really not that exciting.

504
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,840
But for somebody who can take a solution back and say, you are selling a solution that's

505
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,200
maybe $10,000 or $15,000, but I could put that into, I have four or five clients that

506
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
we could implement that in, and then we could net a $50,000 profit to me.

507
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
That's very valuable.

508
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,720
What do you think about this as a high-level differentiator between the two?

509
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,320
Linux Fest is where you go to meet the people who are creating the code.

510
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,560
LinuxCon is where you go to meet the people who are selling the code, or OSCON.

511
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:59,080
The only objection I have to that is there is a lot of development-focused sessions.

512
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,640
If you look at the sessions, a lot of the people that are speaking here at LinuxCon

513
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,280
are speaking as a developer and two other developers.

514
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
So I don't know...

515
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
It's a bit of a mix.

516
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,400
You could also kind of tell, another way to tell is you can kind of tell by the attendance

517
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
price.

518
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Yeah, yes, yes.

519
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Very good.

520
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,280
So these are the ones that are a little more expensive, where generally they kind of probably

521
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,360
are figuring maybe your department or your business is sending you.

522
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Picking it up, yeah.

523
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,960
I guess I would change developer focus to you're meeting the people in the community

524
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,720
versus you're meeting the people selling the products.

525
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,960
I think that, I might twist it a little bit that way.

526
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,480
And that's not to say that this isn't a good conference, or it isn't a pertinent conference

527
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
or valuable conference.

528
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,800
Oh, I think for some people it's extremely valuable.

529
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,040
One of the conversations I've noticed a lot happening here is folks that don't quite understand

530
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,280
everything that's involved in sort of switching their infrastructure over, and so they're

531
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
coming here.

532
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,320
And I overheard a couple of conversations, I forget the name, but it's one of the Docker

533
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,160
container managements just right here on, it starts with a ranch or something like that,

534
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
right here on the corner.

535
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Sure.

536
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,120
And a couple of different gals were talking about how they're coming from some Microsoft

537
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,080
mom management system and they're moving over to different systems and they don't really

538
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
quite understand.

539
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,560
There's the one gal, there's why this story even sticks out, it's because she called it

540
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,760
the, I don't quite understand this whole open source trend and I just kind of thought, oh

541
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
how cute.

542
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
It's not a trend anymore, sorry.

543
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,360
We have taken over the world, kind of.

544
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,080
Yeah, you deploying a Windows machine would almost be a trend.

545
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,760
So yeah, I thought that was particularly funny, is there are a lot of people here who are

546
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,960
not necessarily totally plugged in to the community aspect, but they're more plugged

547
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,440
into the utility aspect of it.

548
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,720
And in their defense, there's nothing wrong with spending your money to come to a conference

549
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,640
to learn how to make more money using a technology that, let's be frank, is actually very profitable.

550
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Yeah.

551
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
There's nothing wrong with that.

552
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
And good, secure, scalable.

553
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Right.

554
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,800
It's just that it is a very different lens than you or I might take to get there.

555
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,560
I think that's why we're having a little bit of a challenge keeping our get go up.

556
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,720
Yeah, I don't know.

557
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Yeah, I suppose so.

558
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,560
I think, yeah, well, I'm looking forward to, in the Linux action show, kind of putting

559
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,440
it all together, the whole, like we want to really kind of try to capture the experience

560
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
coming.

561
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
I don't know how successful we'll be, but yeah, we're going to try to give you more

562
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,400
of the, this, what you're getting right now is really, you know, we've been here for one

563
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
day.

564
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
This is our mid-game impression right now.

565
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,600
We're only midway through the game.

566
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,040
We still have the shirt contest tonight.

567
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,760
We still have the booth crawl tonight.

568
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
We still have the meetup.

569
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,320
Yeah, the meetup, I think, is where the rubber is going to meet the road, because that is,

570
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,200
I think, if there is anyone that's coming from the meetup that's been at LinuxCon, great.

571
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,920
If they're not, just fine, yeah.

572
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,480
But that is where we're going to hit that, that's where we're going to hit the community

573
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
part of it.

574
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,720
And I think that's where you and I kind of both have our passion.

575
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,600
We both kind of shine, is in that space.

576
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,240
And so, but nonetheless, what we're trying to do here, what we're trying to accomplish

577
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,400
is we are trying to be that network that goes to these conferences.

578
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,320
We bring all this equipment here, we set up and we stream, and give people that don't

579
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,080
have the opportunity to be here an idea of what's here, and pick the best parts.

580
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,680
I just realized something, too, that would be kind of fun, maybe, if you're not normally

581
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,120
at these events, especially LinuxCon, more so than almost the other ones I've been to,

582
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,200
because LinuxCon is a Linux Foundation event, so this is kind of like the official Linux

583
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
event, right?

584
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Right.

585
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,000
And so that brings out all of the open source journalists, for the most part.

586
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,480
Like a lot of them are here, and a lot of people in the industry, like Mark Shuttleworth

587
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,920
is here, the CoreOS guys are here, the Docker guys are here, SUSE guys are here, tons and

588
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,760
tons of Red Hat people are here.

589
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,600
And what's kind of neat is you get to meet people that have built things that you're

590
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,380
familiar with, packages that you've installed, tools that have solved a problem for you.

591
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,160
And these people are here, and in some ways, for some of us nerds, they're kind of celebrities

592
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
in a sense.

593
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Yeah, very much so.

594
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,600
And, you know, hey, that's that name I've seen on a blog post a thousand times, or their

595
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
picture next to their post.

596
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,420
And literally as we were going on air, we had a journalist stop by and take a selfie

597
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,160
with me, because he and I have never actually seen each other in person, we've only seen

598
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,640
each other online, and it's like, hey, good to see you.

599
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,280
And so it's kind of neat, like when you're coming from the outside, you get to kind of

600
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,600
see the people behind the scenes that work on a lot of this stuff at LinuxCon.

601
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,840
Like even eventually, the rumor is Linus will be here at some point, he doesn't go to the

602
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,720
other ones, because this is LinuxCon.

603
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,800
Well, this is really ContainerCon, but this is LinuxCon.

604
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,040
It might be a little more than a rumor, it might actually be on the schedule.

605
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,400
I just don't, you know, until we have tape of it, I don't want to commit to it, but we're

606
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,520
going to attempt to get tape of Linus Torvalds, I guess they said tape.

607
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,920
Yeah, so, I don't know, NorthRanger says, I'm curious how it compares to LinuxCons from

608
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
the first dot com bubble.

609
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,080
Back then it was all venture capital, now it's real profits driving attendance.

610
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
That's a really interesting observation, NorthRanger.

611
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,040
It's smaller in scale?

612
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,160
Yeah, they have been on the decline.

613
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,040
So I guess, to me, this looks smaller than it was last year.

614
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,920
I guess the attendance is up, though, from last year, which is a good sign.

615
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Yeah.

616
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,240
Well, that is actually the interesting thing, is both last year, OSCON, oh, I'm sorry, Ohio

617
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,800
and LinuxCon have scaled down, but their attendance has gone up, and the vendor participation

618
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,880
has gone up.

619
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,080
So the interest from the public and the vendors is going up, but the con organizers are scaling

620
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,080
down, because I think cons in general, with a few exceptions, are scaling down.

621
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,080
Yeah, I think so.

622
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,720
And part of that is that you are able, that as people become more self-reliant and become

623
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,000
more educated themselves, I think that they're able to find the information that a lot of

624
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,360
people would have gotten at a conference, and then as the internet kind of exploded

625
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,680
and things like blogs and wikis and forums have taken off.

626
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,600
Sorry to interrupt you, the head of the Fedora project just walked by and gave us a wave.

627
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Yeah.

628
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
So that's nice.

629
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,120
I think that as that happens, people are able to get that information and they go, I don't

630
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
need to spend that money to come out to the conference.

631
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,760
And I got to tell you, speaking from my own wallets, I have always made money coming to

632
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
LinuxCon.

633
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Coming to LinuxCon and taking those solutions home and reselling them, I have always come

634
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
out ahead.

635
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,680
You know, and the key point of that, and I've liked it a lot, is TechDog in the chatroom

636
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,840
says I'm used to the kind of CES show, where most of what interests me turns out to be

637
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
vaporware.

638
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,680
But here, everything here is a shipping product that they're demoing.

639
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,440
There might be a couple things that are about to ship, but 98% of everything here, if you

640
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,720
get an introduction to it, if you get hands-on information and you get a name and a number,

641
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,160
when you go home, you can call that person and they can ship it to you.

642
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
That's true.

643
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,200
But as far as the feel of the conference, very similar to CES.

644
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Have you ever been to CES?

645
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,720
It's a very similar feeling conference.

646
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
But yeah, that's true.

647
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,400
I guess they don't show not released stuff yet for them.

648
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
There's a couple of that, actually.

649
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Yeah.

650
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
There's a couple of things here and there.

651
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,480
And that's actually, though, but you don't really mind that.

652
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,100
You like seeing the code before it's finalized.

653
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,720
And so one of the things that was announced here that is pretty neat, in fact, before

654
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,800
we go, I want to get a picture in front of it, is IBM's mainframe one.

655
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Oh, yeah.

656
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,680
Making a big stink about that here at LinuxCon.

657
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,400
And that, are we allowed to say that that's going to be coming out on last?

658
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,280
So we have an interview with them and we have, that's probably the coolest video I think

659
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
we've ever shot.

660
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Yeah.

661
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
And that's going to be, we'll have that uploaded.

662
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
In the Linux action show this weekend.

663
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,400
Which right now, we tentatively are planning to do Friday at 3 p.m.

664
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,480
But that might change, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

665
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,160
So yeah, and the Canonical guys here announced, I don't know, I don't know if you know anything

666
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
about that.

667
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Not to put you on the spot.

668
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I don't really know anything about it.

669
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
But if you do, you're more than welcome to chime in.

670
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,200
But Canonical announced that you'll be able to get Ubuntu.

671
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,280
They are, yeah, they are shipping, they have just released Ubuntu 4, this IBM Z series

672
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
mainframe.

673
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Of course, the SUSE guys are doing it too.

674
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
And you know, but it's really neat.

675
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
And Shuttleworth, Shuttleworth did a surprise.

676
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Go ahead, Pope.

677
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,600
Giant, pretty black box with orange stripes down the side is all I know from the photos

678
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm seeing.

679
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Yeah.

680
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
And Mark was there up on stage.

681
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,280
He came up and surprised everybody during the announcement.

682
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
So that was pretty neat.

683
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,600
But we're not here to talk about HP.

684
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
We're going to talk about IBM.

685
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
We're going to talk about IBM and Linux Action.

686
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,840
So why don't we talk about HP?

687
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
You want to do this?

688
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah.

689
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
All right.

690
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,820
So this next clip, Noah tells me, is super cool.

691
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,400
It's one I've really wanted to get to for a long time.

692
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,800
So last year, I think I can tell the story now because they've come out on camera and

693
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
addressed it.

694
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,600
But last year I was here and I was talking to a couple of the HP guys and I said, you

695
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,840
know, I wish there were more big names that like actively supported Linux like inside

696
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,640
like on the desktop, not just on servers, but actually running it.

697
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
And the guy tells me, he goes, I run Linux on my laptop, my work laptop.

698
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
This is an HP employee?

699
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah.

700
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
This is last year.

701
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
And he goes, I run it on my laptop.

702
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,760
And he looks over and he goes, her over there?

703
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
She runs Linux.

704
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,920
We've never even installed Windows.

705
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,120
Our work laptops come this way.

706
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,600
I said, well, how does the company treat you?

707
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,680
All they treat us great.

708
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
All the software supported.

709
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
They support it.

710
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,380
And he goes, and it just works out of the box.

711
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Everything works.

712
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,640
And there's a big majority of us that are doing that.

713
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
And I said, wow, that's really cool.

714
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
Would you talk to me about it on camera?

715
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,040
And he goes, no, I don't want to do that.

716
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,120
So this year I came here and I walk up and same story.

717
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,920
I started running into the HP employees and they're like, oh yeah, we all use Linux.

718
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,440
I'm like, why won't anyone talk to me?

719
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,940
And they're like, well, we know a guy who knows a guy and he's friends with this other

720
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,720
guy who knows this guy who was trained to speak on camera.

721
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
He'll be able to talk to you.

722
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
And I'm like, does he work for HP?

723
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
And they're like, yeah.

724
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
And I'm like, does he use Linux on the desktop?

725
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Oh yeah.

726
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I'm like, find him.

727
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,720
And they're looking all over the conference hall and this guy comes over and he goes,

728
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
can I help you?

729
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
And I'm like, do you run Linux on your desktop?

730
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
And he goes, yes, I do.

731
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
And I'm like, I have a camera.

732
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Stand right there.

733
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Yes, you can help me.

734
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
All right.

735
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
So we're going to play this interview.

736
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
You know what?

737
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Before we play it, why don't I tell you about our last sponsor in the show today?

738
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
That'll be Ting.

739
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
And I want you to check them out because right now this whole show is running off of Ting

740
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
and it's pretty awesome.

741
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,040
We actually started on the event Wi-Fi, which is pretty solid during the setup and we thought

742
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,240
we'd be okay with that because they're like a dog with a bone when it comes to finding

743
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,960
rogue wireless signals around here.

744
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,840
So we started on the event wireless and that was walking for a little bit, but I got to

745
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,600
tell you, you go to linux.ting.com because at the end of the day we were so glad to have

746
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,320
backup connectivity, linux.ting.com, Ting is mobile that makes sense.

747
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Look at the signal strength.

748
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Look at that.

749
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Full signal.

750
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Full bars.

751
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Yeah.

752
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Full bars of LTE.

753
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
That's nice.

754
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Inside of here.

755
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
And you can look around people dropping on and off.

756
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,400
Well, we were, now the only thing we did a little clever is we positioned ourselves next

757
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
to a gorgeous view.

758
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Yeah, that's true.

759
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
So we have beautiful windows nearby.

760
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,840
So that's helping, but that's just us being savvy.

761
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,360
And so go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off your first Ting device or $25 off

762
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,820
your Ting account or credit wise.

763
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,720
So you get $25 of service credit and then just like for me in my first month, that paid

764
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
for it.

765
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,000
It's wireless service with no contract and you only pay for what you use.

766
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,460
It's a flat $6 for the line and there's just your usage on top of that and that's what

767
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
you pay.

768
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,240
They have CDMA and GSM, we're on CDMA right now, right?

769
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Actually we're on GSM.

770
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Oh, okay.

771
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,200
We're on the GSM Ting network right now rocking that and you can too and you only pay for

772
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
what you use.

773
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,640
And what's great is when you need to use a lot of data, maybe one or two months out of

774
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,080
the year you pay a little more.

775
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,960
The rest of the year your bill's so low that it more than evens out.

776
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
It's gorgeous.

777
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,920
Linux.ting.com, go there and try out their savings calculator, plug in your actual usage,

778
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
see how much you would save.

779
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm saving more than $2,000 in two years.

780
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,900
I can buy a laptop.

781
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
That's nuts.

782
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Of course I need a laptop more often than that.

783
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,800
Actually my Bonobo was more than three years old.

784
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
And still going strong.

785
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Yeah, so there you go.

786
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
That's not so bad.

787
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Linux.ting.com.

788
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Try out the dashboard.

789
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Check out their blog.

790
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
It's a great service.

791
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
We're using them here at LinuxCon.

792
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,240
We're broadcasting to our Mamba Room and to our IceCast server using Ting.

793
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Live LinuxCon coverage powered by Ting.

794
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,140
It's great to have data in your pocket if you're in IT and they have great phones.

795
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,280
Everything from super, super, super value phones for like under $60, you know, like

796
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,240
feature phones, up to like the greatest hot rods like the S6, the Nexus 6, Moto X2, all

797
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
that good stuff.

798
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Linux.ting.com.

799
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,760
Noah, I'm going to play this interview you got from HP.

800
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,880
I'm really looking forward to this because I haven't heard this yet.

801
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I've been waiting.

802
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
So here we go.

803
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,440
Here's Noah and HP.

804
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,720
We're here with HP and with Keith.

805
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,080
And I noticed that in the back here he has this big sign that says HP breathes open source.

806
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,040
And as a fellow breather of open source I thought it might be interesting to stop and

807
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
talk with Keith.

808
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,640
So tell me Keith, anyone at HP use Linux?

809
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,040
A few people, yeah.

810
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,720
So I'm actually the architect for Linux on the machine.

811
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,640
The machine's a new hardware project we're working on and the operating system we're

812
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,120
developing that we're porting to that hardware is Linux.

813
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,800
So we're doing kernel modifications, user space modifications for that new hardware

814
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,080
project.

815
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,800
We also support Debian Linux in our cloud offering.

816
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,500
So our public and private cloud, HP Helion environment uses Debian natively.

817
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:19,800
And we use Linux for all of our other server hardware runs Linux as well.

818
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,960
How about people, how about customers that purchase your machines and want to go install

819
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Linux on them?

820
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,760
Do you think that's going to be a smooth experience for them?

821
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
Is that something that HP supports?

822
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,880
Yes, we've supported Linux on our hardware for the last 15 or 20 years.

823
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,900
And we've always tried to make it as seamless and easy process as possible.

824
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,840
We provide Linux drivers.

825
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,640
We work with the upstream projects to make sure that the Linux kernel and the Linux user

826
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,200
space stuff works well on our hardware out of the box.

827
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Outstanding.

828
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Tell me a little bit about some projects that HP is either working on or projects that HP

829
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,520
uses or projects that HP supports.

830
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,300
So obviously we work at Linux kernel because we have hardware that needs to run on that.

831
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,520
And then we also have a large investment in the OpenStack ecosystem with a huge number

832
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,520
of contributors to major OpenStack pieces in the HP cloud environment.

833
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,760
And then we also work on other networking NFV stuff, telco stuff, the whole gamut of

834
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
enterprise computing.

835
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,880
HP aside, what's your personal favorite distro?

836
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I run Debian.

837
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Oh, okay.

838
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,300
And how long have you run Debian?

839
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,480
I've run Debian for almost 20 years.

840
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Okay.

841
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,000
And is that something that you find that it may, can you get your work work done on Debian?

842
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,760
My business laptop runs Debian exclusively.

843
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,240
Really?

844
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
That's pretty impressive.

845
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,880
And HP is pretty supportive of you doing that.

846
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Oddly, yes.

847
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,980
Debian is a very important operating system to HP.

848
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,000
And so they're very supportive of me running Debian as my daily work environment.

849
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's outstanding.

850
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,400
Well, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us.

851
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
We really appreciate it.

852
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Of course.

853
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Thank you very much as well.

854
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Oh, that was cool.

855
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
That was pretty neat.

856
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,800
So that last line there, Debian is very important to HP.

857
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Yeah.

858
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,760
And I'm actually listening back.

859
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,160
I wish it was culturally appropriate to set a camera up and then film all of the surrounding

860
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,080
stuff because it leaves off, it leaves off some of the picture if you don't get the surrounding

861
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,800
thing of like all the people that were standing there that were running Linux on their work

862
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,040
computers as well, you know, and I don't know, I just want to lurk there and watch, show

863
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
them.

864
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
It doesn't quite paint the picture as well as it did it in person, but I guess you have

865
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
to take my word for it.

866
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
No, no.

867
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
That's neat.

868
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,700
I like to hear the passion there about in that too.

869
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
I thought that was pretty cool.

870
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,760
You know, one of the things that was pointed out to me and I haven't seen it anywhere yet

871
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,640
on any of the brochures, but somebody mentioned to me in the hallway that LinuxCon is also

872
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
offering childcare.

873
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Oh, no way.

874
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Yeah.

875
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Isn't that cool?

876
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Oh, that's awesome.

877
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,240
And you know, when it's kind of an expensive conference, that's really a nice perk.

878
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,680
It is, especially because I know firsthand couples that both work in the open source

879
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,760
community and have kids and that is an issue for them.

880
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Yeah.

881
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
That's really nice.

882
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,240
And they, for a lot of folks, not all folks, but for a lot of folks, they've provided lunch.

883
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,280
You know, they treat the media exceptionally well here.

884
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Yeah.

885
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
We have.

886
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Yeah.

887
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,600
So that actually, a shout out to Dan Brown has been outstanding.

888
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:17,320
I mean, every little thing I have, I just, my email to Dan is like my lifeline for our

889
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,840
lifeline really to get things done here.

890
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,280
You know, when we need permission for something or when we needed them to make a couple exceptions

891
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,520
for us and a couple of rules, just everything is that guy's animation.

892
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,800
Or even when it was just a sandwich, you know, Andrew's able to grab me a sandwich that they're

893
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,080
giving out to the media folks and they provide a media lounge, which isn't too uncommon,

894
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
but still really nice.

895
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Yeah.

896
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,880
And I think that everyone at LinuxCon has done exceptionally well.

897
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,840
And you can actually tell it's a really polished conference.

898
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,640
If you look at the way that they have the keynote hall set up, right?

899
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Yeah.

900
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,120
They take the time to put all of the par and all of the DMX, by the way.

901
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,120
So I have a lot of sympathy for the poor guy who had to set all those up and channel them.

902
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,000
But you know, they put the little extra pizzazz to make it, you really do get your money's

903
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
worth coming out here.

904
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah.

905
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And they got display screens up everywhere.

906
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,200
I mean, it feels like a high value production.

907
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Yeah.

908
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,080
They do a really good job.

909
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,360
With that, there is the highly sponsored angle.

910
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,240
So the companies that sponsor, they get placed in an area called, let's see, where is it

911
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
right here?

912
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,840
It has a name that's essentially like the sponsor ballroom or something like that.

913
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,760
And if you, yeah, here we go.

914
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Let's see.

915
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,960
Sponsor ballroom, which is harder to find than everyone else.

916
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Yeah.

917
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,880
But if you're a sponsor, you get like really fancy placement, which I guess that's fair.

918
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I don't like.

919
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,840
Because the difference is stark.

920
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,460
It's like the sponsors go in a brightly lit room that looks the nicest room.

921
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,460
And then everybody that's in exhibit that wasn't a sponsor is like out in the hallways

922
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,280
and kind of in the peripheral.

923
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,680
As a business owner, I have no problem with them treating the people who make it financially

924
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,480
possible to do a conference like this, treating them, giving them a little extra treatment.

925
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
That's perfectly fine.

926
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,720
But what I object to is the fact that it is so much more difficult to find that room than

927
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,880
what we originally thought was the expo hall.

928
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,040
If you're going to have an overflow of the expo hall, have it somewhere else where-

929
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,560
It's not the first thing you walk into.

930
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Right.

931
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Exactly.

932
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,680
And have it maybe in a room that is maybe a little bit more difficult to get to than

933
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,160
the people that are paying the money to be there.

934
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,280
And that's a personal preference.

935
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,780
I'm sure that the fine people at the Linux Foundation had a very good reason for organizing

936
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,280
it that way, and they spent a lot more time planning this stuff and thinking about it

937
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
than we do for certain.

938
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Yeah.

939
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
And it is nice.

940
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
But it didn't make a lot of sense to me.

941
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,400
They have a giant hacking lounge, which is kind of cool, and they have a Birds of Feathers

942
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,800
signup lounge.

943
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,880
So the sponsor area is done really well, and Microsoft has a decent booth there.

944
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,840
So does IBM and HP.

945
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,560
And I'd say one of the nicest booths here, too, is the SUSE booth.

946
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,880
I really like the SUSE booth because they have green apples out.

947
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,440
They have green snacks and stuff, so that was really neat.

948
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,760
And the Red Hat guys are handing out red hats for certain folks.

949
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
That was pretty cool.

950
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,760
Yeah.

951
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
And I think you stopped by that, didn't you?

952
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Yeah, I did.

953
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
I got a chance to talk to them.

954
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
But don't spoil it.

955
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
That's coming on Sunday.

956
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Oh, that'll be on last, too?

957
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Yeah.

958
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Yeah, that'll be on Friday.

959
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Man, we've got a big Linux action show coming up.

960
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,960
This is the last chance as we wrap up here, chat room or mumble room, if you guys have

961
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,560
any questions from LinuxCon.

962
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Hey, Ange.

963
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Ange.

964
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Yeah?

965
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,640
Why don't you come over here and give the people a quick five-second, your impressions

966
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
of LinuxCon.

967
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,440
What did you think of those since you've been here today?

968
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,340
What do you think of it so far?

969
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,340
It's pretty cool.

970
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,340
I love seeing JB shirts.

971
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,840
I've seen a couple.

972
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,760
I've seen a couple of people that we saw at LinuxFest Northwest, and I'm already angling

973
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,840
for a booth at another con or fest or whatever.

974
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:41,760
Yeah, it's definitely, I say a lot of suits, but there aren't a lot of suits, but it feels

975
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
that way.

976
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,760
It's very business-y.

977
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Yeah.

978
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,760
Yeah.

979
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,680
All right, Mr. WW, you had a question about the con in the mumble room.

980
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,080
Go ahead, sir.

981
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,760
So have you come to a conclusion yet what the cons or pros are of going to LinuxCon

982
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,600
versus going to like a fest where it's more casual, or do you think you'll have to?

983
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
It kind of goes back to our answer.

984
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,640
It's like if you want to kind of rub elbows with more community aspect, people that are

985
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,600
more writing the code and thinking about the code and thinking about community and standards

986
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,080
and collaboration, then you kind of want to go to a fest.

987
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,880
If you want to meet the people that are creating solutions and selling the code and that maybe

988
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,280
you're going to solve a problem you have at work, then you might want to go to a con.

989
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,000
Not that Fest doesn't have that stuff too.

990
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I would just ask, what are you going to get out of it?

991
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,320
Do you want to talk about your passion for Linux or do you want to sell Linux?

992
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,240
That's a little black and white, but that's kind of what it comes down to.

993
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,280
If you have to make a decision about a flight and a hotel and the tickets, then you need

994
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,280
to know that.

995
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,280
Yeah.

996
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,560
I guess I say that because that's the metric that I've used.

997
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,420
I would never go to a... I mean, being honest here, I would never go to a fest and expect

998
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,480
to come back with profitable material for my business.

999
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:59,360
I would never go to a con without expecting to be able to make a profit on it, and transversely,

1000
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,800
I would never go to a fest and not expect to build some relationship, but I would be

1001
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,040
perfectly okay with going to a con and coming back with nothing more than a business sense,

1002
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,520
even if we didn't have a community bonding.

1003
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,220
There is no going out to the range and shooting here.

1004
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:20,280
There is no going out for burgers and stuff unless you range it privately, as opposed

1005
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
to...

1006
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,280
What do you think of North Ranger?

1007
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,480
He says, maybe it's a mullet.

1008
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,120
It's a mullet of gatherings, business in the front, party in the back.

1009
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
That's not bad.

1010
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
That's not bad.

1011
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
I like that.

1012
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
Okay, that's a good...

1013
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
We can go with that.

1014
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,360
All right, so Linux Unplugged is live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

1015
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
We do the show at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1016
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,640
You can go to cheaperbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local

1017
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
time zone.

1018
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,540
We'd love to have you join us live in our virtual lug in our mumble room.

1019
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,280
You bang mumble in our IRC chat room, and you can go to cheaperbroadcasting.com slash

1020
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,000
contact to send us an email, or if you'd like to get content or discussions or any kind

1021
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,480
of feedback or topic generation like that, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1022
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,720
Noah, is there anywhere you'd like to send people throughout the week?

1023
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,400
Yeah, I'd send them to ultispeed, ultispeed.com.

1024
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,320
We are continuing to work on expanding the ability to do remote support.

1025
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:13,000
We just finalized the final in-production test of doing cloud-based Wi-Fi.

1026
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,620
We now have the ability, yeah, we now actually have the ability, and this hasn't actually

1027
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,920
gone out to the website, and we haven't sent flyers and product literature and stuff, but

1028
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,700
we actually now have the ability, if you have a property and you want Wi-Fi on that property,

1029
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,500
we can actually ship you an entire box of stuff, and you plug the cables in, and we

1030
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,500
take it from there.

1031
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Wow.

1032
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
And we manage the whole thing remotely.

1033
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Ultispeed.com?

1034
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
Yeah, ultispeed.com.

1035
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,120
We rolled that out at a hotel in Mankato, Minnesota.

1036
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,240
There was actually a guy on Twitter that was asking where he could stay where we had

1037
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
managed the Wi-Fi.

1038
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,240
It was a quality in Mankato.

1039
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,760
That's our first place that we've rolled that system out, and so far, it's been 100%.

1040
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,760
So cool.

1041
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,760
All right, everybody.

1042
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,560
Well, thank you so much for tuning in to this episode of Linux Unplugged, and we'll see

1043
00:49:47,560 --> 00:50:14,560
you right back here next week.

1044
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:36,160
Hey, Noah, I have a question for you.

1045
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
All right.

1046
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
I have an answer for you.

1047
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,080
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if your question and my answer match up?

1048
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,320
Could we have done this whole transmission over SIP back to the-

1049
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,320
Yes.

1050
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Yes, we could have.

1051
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,320
So why didn't we just use SIP?

1052
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,800
Well, I have never tried a SIP call that long to know if, A, the quality would be sufficient,

1053
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,880
although I suspect it would, but my big concern is I don't know if the... SIP is very, very

1054
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,440
finicky if you actually lose internet because it has to re-register with the server, and

1055
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,680
then we'd have to reinitiate the call, and we'd have to try a test call for an hour before

1056
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,600
I would really feel comfortable saying try it, although I suppose technically it's no

1057
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
worse than Skype.

1058
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Skype has to...

1059
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Hey, Noah.

1060
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,280
I do SIP calls to conference calls all the time for very long periods, like two, three

1061
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,400
hours at a time, and on my home Wi-Fi, it never drops off just to be able to call SIP

1062
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
client.

1063
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Really?

1064
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,400
Well, obviously, you're on conference Wi-Fi.

1065
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
It might be a bit tricky.

1066
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Yeah, we're not actually.

1067
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,840
We've provided our own, and our internet's actually pretty strong, so I'll have to give

1068
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
that a shot.

1069
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,880
Now, Popey, did you modify the codex at all, or are you just using the default ones, whatever

1070
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
comes set with the SIP client?

1071
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,880
I was just using the default that was on Android.

1072
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,600
I'm connecting to an asterisk server in the office.

1073
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Oh, my gosh.

1074
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,020
You're doing it over Android?

1075
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
So we could...

1076
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,020
Yeah, that's fine.

1077
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,020
So we just bring a little interface?

1078
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, my gosh, dude.

1079
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
How cool would that be?

1080
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
All this can go away.

1081
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We just plug into...

1082
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah, it'll work.

1083
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
What could go wrong?

1084
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
What could go wrong?

1085
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Run the whole show on Android.

1086
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I don't think anything could go wrong.

1087
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
No, it'll be fine.

1088
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That'll be fine.

1089
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It should be nice.

1090
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,960
Actually, and the app has local recording as well, so it can just record the whole conversation.

1091
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,560
I use it when we're having internal calls, and we call them and then make them available

1092
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
for other people.

1093
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,560
That's a good idea.

1094
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,560
All right, so we've got to pick our title.

1095
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,800
We've got to go to JBtitles.com and pick this thing.

1096
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
Hey, I suggested a title.

1097
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
You did?

1098
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,800
Yeah.

1099
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
For once in my life.

1100
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,800
How was it?

1101
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
I don't know.

1102
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
I don't remember what it was.

1103
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Do you want to vote?

1104
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,800
JBtitles.com.

1105
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Yeah, sure.

1106
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
Sure.

1107
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Sure.

1108
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Why not?

1109
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Sure.

1110
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Oh, I went to JBlive.tv.

1111
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,800
Oh, how come I have no JBtitles.com?

1112
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
I don't know.

1113
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Why don't you?

1114
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Oh, I don't either.

1115
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Oh, here it goes.

1116
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Now it's going.

1117
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Connecting the Docs.

1118
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
That's kind of funny.

1119
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Connecting the Docs.

1121
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
That actually is.

1122
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
That kind of works.

1123
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
That kind of works.

1124
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Containing LinuxCon 2015.

1125
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
That's not bad.

1126
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
LinuxCon 2015.

1127
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Molot Party.

1128
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
That's not bad either.

1129
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
There goes Greg KH.

1130
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
All right.

1131
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
I have voted for...

1132
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Colonel Maintainer Extraordinaire.

1133
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Absolution of Attribution.

1134
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Hobnobbing with the celebrities.

1135
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Look at us.

1136
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Hobnobbing.

1138
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
That must be...

1139
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,800
That must be a...

1140
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,800
That must be a...

1141
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
I've heard of Hobnobbing before.

1142
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Oh, really?

1143
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Oh, yeah.

1144
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Totally.

1145
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
All right.

1146
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
I'm trying to educate, man.

1147
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,800
Has Popey told you about his new snack that he really likes?

1148
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,800
Haggis.

1149
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,800
What?

1150
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Haggis.

1151
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
What's Haggis?

1152
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Am I pronouncing that right?

1153
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
That's delicious.

1154
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
Yes, it is.

1155
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,800
Tell them what it is, though.

1156
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,800
It's awful.

1157
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Mixed with oats and spices.

1158
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
It's awful.

1159
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
So it's like a breakfast?

1160
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Boiled.

1161
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah, you often have a slice of it fried with breakfast.

1162
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Fried?

1163
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
If you have like a full English breakfast, you'd have like a...

1164
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:43,640
Sausage, bacon, eggs, beans, and all that, and black pudding, I'm thinking of black pudding,

1165
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
but black pudding and, yeah, Haggis, very similar.

1166
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,080
But no, you'd normally have Haggis with potatoes and vegetables.

1167
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,980
It's lovely.

1168
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,440
It's like stomach and kidneys and stuff.

1169
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,440
What are you fried in?

1170
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,440
Like what kind of grease or oils?

1171
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,440
I don't know.

1172
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Sorry, I was confusing.

1173
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Oh, that was black pudding you fried.

1174
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
Got you.

1175
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,920
Yeah, but Haggis comes in like a bag.

1176
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
It used to be like sheep stomach, but now it's like a bag.

1177
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
A bag.

1178
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Sheep stomach, yeah.

1179
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
And you boil it.

1180
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah.

1181
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Boil sheep stomach.

1182
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,920
Come on.

1183
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Come on.

1184
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Let's not.

1185
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
It's delicious, man.

1186
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
Delicious, see?

1187
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah.

1188
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,920
Yeah.

1189
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
My wife won't eat it.

1190
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
She won't go anywhere near it.

1191
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
What's it smell like?

1192
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
You married up.

1193
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
When she goes out, it smells delicious.

1194
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
It smells like a bag of offal boiled.

1195
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
What else is it going to smell like?

1196
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,920
You married up, my friend.

1197
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,560
Do you put any sauce on it, or you just eat it as is?

1198
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:31,200
Actually, I had it the other night with some sriracha on it, which was even better, because

1199
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
sriracha makes everything better.

1200
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,800
Sriracha does.

1201
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,280
You know what Rekai put sriracha on?

1202
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,280
Pizza.

1203
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,280
Sure, yeah.

1204
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,280
Sure, yeah.

1205
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,280
Totally ordered pizza with sriracha.

1206
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
It was really good, actually.

1207
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Yeah, yeah.

1208
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
No, I've seen that.

1209
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,280
That's a thing.

1210
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
That's good.

1211
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,280
But can you barbecue a Haggis?

1212
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,280
Oh, stop it.

1213
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
Damn it.

1214
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
If you dig a pit.

1215
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
If you dig a pit.

1216
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
If you dig a pit.

1217
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
Connecting the docks containing LinuxCon 2015 are my favorite.

1218
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Connecting the docks is good.

1219
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,440
There is a vegetarian Haggis, by the way.

1220
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,640
Connecting the docks is good, but containing LinuxCon suggests LinuxCon.

1221
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,200
I think actually connecting the docks is good.

1222
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Yeah.

1223
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,900
If you're going to have containing, it should be can't contain LinuxCon.

1224
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,900
Containing LinuxCon 2015.

1225
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,900
Can't contain.

1226
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,900
You can't contain LinuxCon.

1227
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,400
I don't know if you get it.

1228
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
You don't get it.

1229
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
I think connecting the docks is better.

1230
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,600
If you don't watch the episode, you don't get it.

1231
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,400
So I think I like connecting the docks better.

1232
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,980
All right, NorthRanger, you win, sir.

1233
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,980
You win.

1234
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,980
What was yours, ColonelLinux?

1235
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,980
Can't contain LinuxCon?

1236
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,980
Ah, I see.

1237
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,980
See?

1238
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,980
Get it?

1239
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,980
I got that.

1240
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,480
So, Mumbo, were you able to hear the clips okay?

1241
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Yeah.

1242
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,480
Yeah.

1243
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
Yeah.

1244
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
It's a little hokey.

1245
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
Hey.

1246
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
But every time we get it, we learn.

1247
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,480
So, thanks for making it, you guys.

1248
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
I love your faces.

1249
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
Welcome.

1250
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,080
We actually didn't even remember you guys until this morning.

1251
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
That's not true at all.

1252
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,080
Chris remembered you.

1253
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,080
Oh.

1254
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,080
Well, Noah didn't.

1255
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,120
And so since I was planning equipment, I was still figuring out how I was going to do

1256
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,120
this morning.

1257
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,120
That's true.

1258
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,120
That part is kind of true.

1259
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,120
All right, you guys.

1260
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
What?

1261
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,400
We're going to expect some flowers and then we'll be fine.

1262
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Okay.

1263
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400
All right.

1264
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
I can do that.

1265
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Flowers and Haggis.

1266
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
What about chocolates?

1267
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
And Haggis.

1268
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Oh, and Haggis.

1269
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah.

1270
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Poppy can supply the Haggis.

1271
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,400
All right.

1272
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Question on Bruce's talk.

1273
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,400
Will they have a full link to that somewhere?

1274
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,400
I think so.

1275
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,400
Yeah.

1276
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Yeah.

1277
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Yes.

1278
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Yes, they will.

1279
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,400
They will publish it.

1280
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,560
They send it off to their media guys and then they send it out to Mount Kilimanjaro where

1281
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,680
monkeys chew on it for a while and then spit it back out and then a hiker brings it back

1282
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,520
down from Mount Kilimanjaro and they publish it and that takes a couple of weeks.

1283
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
I believe that's how it works.

1284
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:50,440
It's a big mountain, you know?
