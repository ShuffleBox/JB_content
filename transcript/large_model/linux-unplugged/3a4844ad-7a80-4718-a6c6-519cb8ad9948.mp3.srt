1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
I guess screw the rest of August, it's almost time for Halloween.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,160
So Humble Bundle has got some pretty good priced Linux games out.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah, I'm surprised this isn't coming out in October.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
I know.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,840
Well, and weren't you just telling me about a sale for a Steam game on Linux 2?

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
It's like for sale.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Hell of a sale.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
It's like free, right?

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Yeah, it's free.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
What was it called?

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Shadow Warrior?

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Yeah, Shadow Warrior.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
Yeah, so you have the Humble Spooky Bundle, which is available for 13 days, and then Steam's

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,560
got the Shadow Warrior game for free right now for Linux users.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,720
Actually, I think the best game on the Humble Bundle is actually Alien Isolation.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Alien Isolation.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Is that available for Linux?

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Yes.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
That would be awesome.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Yes, it is.

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
Alien Isolation, huh?

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
That sounds cool.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,080
Discover the true meaning of fear in Alien Isolation.

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,760
It's based on the Aliens series.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Yeah.

27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,840
It looks interesting.

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,600
Supposedly I saw a review that was saying that the story mode of it is fantastic.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Yeah, it is.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Really?

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, guys.

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
It's pretty intense, too.

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Might be worth the bundle right here.

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Here, I'm going to watch a little bit of the trailer.

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
This might be...

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Oh, it's a Sega game.

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Yep.

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Okay.

39
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
All right.

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I already love it.

41
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,120
The graphics look great.

42
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Good sci-fi graphics.

43
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Yeah, it's a AAA title.

44
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,160
Oh, this looks super creepy.

45
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
It's about your mother.

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,440
Oh, I'm getting this.

47
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Yeah.

48
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm probably going to be playing that on Halloween.

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:57,200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 211 for August 22nd, 2017.

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,620
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that really wished more cars were

51
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,960
running Linux these days.

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,120
Yes, I mean it.

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
My name is Chris.

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
That's your cue there.

55
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Oh, hello.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Yeah.

57
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Hello, beard.

58
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,520
I thought normally where Wes would jump in, we're going to have the beard jump in.

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Now that worked out.

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
I actually thought you'd be filling in for me sooner than you'd be filling in for Wes.

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,160
You know, I can just fill in for everyone and do the show alone.

62
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
You probably could.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,940
That's some sort of beard superpower.

64
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,760
Would you cut yourself to reply to the answers or would you just work two mics?

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Have you thought that through?

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,560
I mean, I figured I'd just put the mics together and have this nice stereo warbly sound.

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Well, while I'm still here, I'm going to try to put together a great show for everybody

68
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
today.

69
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm going to give you just a quick update on the solar eclipse trip I went on, but then

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
then there is a rumor that some solar is powered.

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Maybe maybe actually.

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I already don't believe it.

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
OK, all right.

74
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,400
What about what about rumors about Ubuntu Budgie Edition shipping on hardware?

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
What about that?

76
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,960
No, that's that's that sounds crazy.

77
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Crash plan users got screwed this week.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We'll cover what Linux users can do to move off of there.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,040
There is an app based around Electron that, well, it may be a line too far.

80
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,000
Even for me, Chrome OS is coming for Linux in the enterprise.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,360
There's a great way to generate your bash files.

82
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,640
Ubuntu is showing every other distribution how it should be done.

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,440
We've got some interesting conundrums from Firefox and Plex, and then we'll wrap it all

84
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,560
up with something that's so amazing.

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,640
It's probably going to change your life.

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,440
And it's based on the real engine for and it's essentially the Oasis.

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,640
If you have a ready player one, prepare to have your entire life sucked away.

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
You're welcome.

89
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
We'll tell you more about that.

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Yes, of course, it runs on Linux.

91
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course it does.

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,680
We'll tell you more about that, though, as this here show goes on.

93
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Beardsley, what's up?

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,420
We must go no further.

95
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,080
We must welcome in our virtual lug.

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Greetings.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hello.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Pip, pip.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It is nice to see some of you in there.

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,800
We have a lower showing today, and I would imagine it's probably because Wes isn't here.

103
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,440
Since everybody's like, screw it, I'm not showing up.

104
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,600
Well, usually people show up for the beers Wes brings.

105
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, well, and they knew he wasn't coming somehow, even maybe before we even knew.

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
Well, he probably matches them first.

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,060
So yeah, I just got back hours ago, actually, from going down and seeing the Tote Solar

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,080
Eclipse 2017 of the Heart in Oregon.

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
And it was pretty great.

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
Bumped into a listener down there who is a Linux user.

111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,320
Didn't bump into another listener I expected to, but I bumped into somebody that I didn't

112
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
expect to, and that was great.

113
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,920
We chatted a little bit about all the crazy things going on in Linux right before the

114
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,200
solar eclipse hit, which was pretty neat.

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,840
And drove down there in one long, just crazy six hour, seven hour-ish.

116
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,920
There was a lot of traffic getting down there.

117
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,040
And got down there, slept in the car, woke up, and then we had to take care of a few.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,120
There were some challenges that we faced.

119
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,800
Took care of all that, bumped into the listener, had a good chat, saw the eclipse, then hightailed

120
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,520
it back up here so that way we could do Linux Unplugged this week.

121
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
So there you go.

122
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
I'll give you, I'm going to give, I'll do the whole story on my vlog, eventually.

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Yeah, I was going to say.

124
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,720
I think you can get the full story.

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I got to edit it all together.

126
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
There was some pretty good stuff going on.

127
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,760
And of course I managed to actually end up with a few of my own really amateur shots

128
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,920
of the eclipse, so that's pretty cool.

129
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,880
And I had the drone up in the sky during the eclipse.

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
And your eyes still work.

131
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,480
As far as I know, although sometimes I think it takes a while for it to set in, so you

132
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
never know.

133
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
But having the drone up in the sky during, it wasn't, you know, I wasn't really watching

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,440
it because I was watching the eclipse, but it really shows you how dark it got down there.

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
That's a crazy progression.

136
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Yeah, yeah.

137
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,820
We're showing it in the video version, a progressive shot that was taken down from Oregon.

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,720
There is, it was pretty neat.

139
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,080
It was a pretty cool event.

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,680
It's so impressive in person to see something like that.

141
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Yeah, I'm really glad I made it.

142
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,520
And I only got to say hi to a couple of people, but I'm glad that we were able to say hi.

143
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,560
So that was, I think our next meetup will be here at the studio again.

144
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,640
I think maybe we'll do like an end of summer barbecue soon.

145
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,200
We're going to do another one of those.

146
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
I was thinking too about maybe doing a raffle.

147
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,620
I got to look into the details around that, but maybe taking some Jupiter broadcasting

148
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,160
gear and raffling it off during the next barbecue.

149
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
So I got a few ideas.

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,420
So that'll be, we'll have another meetup soon.

151
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,280
And then eventually, eventually, so that way I can start prepping for the 2024 eclipse,

152
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,320
I'll make trips over to the East coast.

153
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,060
And if I hold up to my promise, I'll eventually make it across the pond too.

154
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,640
I have one question for you, Chris.

155
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,920
Were the crowds as crazy as you expected?

156
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,840
Yes and no.

157
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,560
So getting down out of Washington was a nightmare and it was super packed and I-5 was all screwed

158
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
up.

159
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,720
Once we jumped down the highway 101, which runs along the Pacific coast, the Pacific

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,000
ocean coast really was no big deal.

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,760
And then we high tailed it out of there.

162
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,000
But for the most part, actually just everybody was cool.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Everybody was super, like there was a lot of people and there was zero issue.

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,520
It's all them hippies are going to check out the eclipse.

165
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,720
People came from all over.

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,100
Behind us were people from Canada and then in front of us, parked alongside the road

167
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,840
because where we ended up, were people from Utah.

168
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,400
So people just came from all over to see it.

169
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
It was pretty neat.

170
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,960
People come all over, from all over to run Ubuntu Budgie 2.

171
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
I've been hearing more and more about Ubuntu Budgie Edition.

172
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,600
So it's Ubuntu but with the Budgie desktop from Solus and there are rumors are percolating

173
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,480
that there could be hardware shipping very soon with Ubuntu Budgie Edition pre-installed

174
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
on it.

175
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
There's a rumor circulating around today.

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,440
This is a post over at OMG Ubuntu and it's based on hints that were dropped by Ubuntu

177
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,560
Budgie's social media page, which I noticed that none of them are in the room for today.

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
Some of them are often in the room but nobody's there today from here.

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,040
So if you take the image that they tweeted out, right, right, they did two context-free

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
images on their Twitter feed.

181
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,280
They just posted like an iMac looking rig and a ultra-thin laptop looking rig with the

182
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
lid closed.

183
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,640
So you take those images and you do a reverse image search and you know what you end up

184
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
with?

185
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Clevo!

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah, you end up with Clevo which is the same hardware ODM that Entraware and System76 use

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
and Nimbusoft and others use.

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,820
And you know, the thing I say with the Clevo is it's like getting a nice midsize sedan

189
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
or something.

190
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,720
It's like when you get a mid-level car, it's very reliable like a Camry or like a, you

191
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,280
know, an Accord which I've owned.

192
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,040
Those are great cars but they're not like, they're definitely not Tesla, Teslas and they're

193
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,920
definitely not BMW i-series, you know, they're not like, they're not crazy performance.

194
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,120
And they're not like, you know, super broken down cars either.

195
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Sometimes depending on how the ODM chooses to tweak it though, they can really put together

196
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,980
something that's very, very compelling.

197
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,600
And so if they could get the balance right, you might have something here.

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,360
Now there's two laptops it looks like from Clevo that are two different rigs because

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
one was an iMac.

200
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,000
One's the Bologna laptop and the other is the Neptune all-in-one.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,640
And Nimbusoft, which is a company out of the UK that resells Clevos, already actually sells

202
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,400
both of these devices with Ubuntu Mate, Kubuntu on it.

203
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
So you could see them pretty easily adding Ubuntu Budgie for Ubuntu Budgie users who

204
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
want to grab that.

205
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,720
Which could be great for people that are looking for something that's still GTK heavy as Canonical

206
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
moves away from Unity, but they still want something with an Ubuntu base.

207
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Could be good timing.

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
I haven't heard anything from Nimbusoft in the past.

209
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,360
I've never reviewed any of their equipment and I'm not very familiar with the company.

210
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
I've never heard anybody in the audience has ever bought from them.

211
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,200
But they apparently are also working on their own distribution called Eloquent OS.

212
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,760
There's apparently every hardware OEM except for the ones like Dell and HP and IBM.

213
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Except for the ones that are shipping lots of product.

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,440
Yeah except for the one.

215
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,920
Yeah there's an OEM program and then there's roll your own distribution apparently.

216
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,000
And to hell with even bothering being a flavor anymore.

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Screw end users.

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Speaking of screwing end users, CrashPlan is doing just that and shutting down its consumer

219
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,360
backup service.

220
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
And I'm bringing this up on this show because CrashPlan is something I've mentioned as a

221
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,800
very cost effective, unlimited, or close to it backup solution for Linux users.

222
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,880
And one of the things I loved about CrashPlan is A, they actually had a client that worked

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,760
on Linux and B, they had command line integration and C, you could ship them a disk.

224
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,240
You could just ship them a four terabyte spinning rust to seed your backup and then just back

225
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
up the updates and differentials.

226
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,960
Which was huge for me back in the day.

227
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,320
But unfortunately of course anything too good eventually has to go away.

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Yep.

229
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Have you experimented much with online backup?

230
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
You just use like Google Drive or what do you, because I know you recently suffered

231
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,040
some pretty serious data loss.

232
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
Like have you thought a lot about this?

233
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,520
Yeah, I've mostly been leaning towards actually trying to use TarSnap.

234
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Oh yeah, yeah.

235
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Yeah, that's definitely one of my recommendations.

236
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Because they recently just came out with version 1.0 of the TarSnap GUI apparently.

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh really?

238
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Which makes it a lot easier I imagine.

239
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,320
Anybody in the mumble room using CrashPlan now or using a competitor to it that they

240
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,360
would give a recommendation to?

241
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
I was using CrashPlan.

242
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Oh really?

243
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Yeah.

244
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,560
But I was also, I actually had people who were friends and I had a couple of clients

245
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
that were using CrashPlan.

246
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
So that's going to suck.

247
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Yeah, I'm definitely in that situation.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,600
Some of my former clients are using CrashPlan and definitely like my mom's on CrashPlan.

249
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,760
I got a few family members on it too because it was so economical.

250
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,880
Which is probably why it's going away.

251
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,760
I was using it because, well I was also, some setups I was using it because it was free.

252
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,560
Because you can do it where you can do an FTP over SFTP over to multiple networks.

253
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I love that feature.

254
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,960
You have your own computers and it was like it was fantastic but then I would still pay

255
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,440
for one of the premiums just because it was so useful but I wasn't going to deploy it

256
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
everywhere.

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,640
But now, you know, drawing board.

258
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Man.

259
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,480
Yeah, most of the alternatives are really expensive too.

260
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Yeah.

261
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,560
So I've been looking, Backblaze is very competitive but they don't and have no interest in making

262
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,840
a Linux client.

263
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,480
Which really pisses me off because it's not even a matter of, it's not even a matter of,

264
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,160
well we can't be bothered to even write a command line interface which would obviously

265
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
be simple.

266
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,820
Which there is a Python way to do this but anyways, let me get back to the main point.

267
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,140
They've been asked about it numerous times and they're very upfront about it.

268
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,760
You can ask them, we asked them today on Twitter.

269
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,680
And they'll just say, yeah, it's not really in our, it's not really in our business priorities

270
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
right now.

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,960
Nothing against Linux, just not really our business priority.

272
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,360
But they do have this B2 cloud storage system and I don't, again, never, I'm not personally

273
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,400
a customer of this, although Angela does use them now after CrashPlan.

274
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,040
But B2 is like a cloud storage service and there's going to be a cost associated with

275
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
that.

276
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
So keep this in mind.

277
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,360
But there's a tool you can use on Linux that works with B2 storage, it works with Amazon

278
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,320
Drive, obviously S3 Dropbox, Google Cloud Storage, Local Disk, Microsoft OneDrive.

279
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,000
It also will just do SSH and SFTP, it'll do a Yandex disk, which is kind of neat.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,420
It's called rClone.

281
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,920
And rClone is sort of like rSync but it allows you to sync to these cloud storage services

282
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,060
that I just mentioned, including Backblaze's B2.

283
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,920
This might be something you could look into.

284
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,480
rClone might be a good way to move the data around to a new service as well.

285
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
So rClone.org is where you find that.

286
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
We've talked about it in the past, rSync for cloud storage.

287
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,040
And if you want to know specifically about the Backblaze integration, it's rClone.org

288
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
slash B2.

289
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,120
rClone also apparently has support for Amazon Cloud Drive.

290
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,960
Or Google Drive, you could do that as well if you're okay with that or you want to encrypt

291
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,360
your data or Dropbox if you're already paying that monster.

292
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
None of these really exciting.

293
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,160
Is it just storage cloning or is it just incremental cloning?

294
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,080
I think it's more file system based, so I don't think it's like doing block images or

295
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,880
anything like that.

296
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,040
Because it's more like rSync than it is like a block backup or something.

297
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,840
And it does support some of the same syntax as rSync too, like the commands to preserve

298
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,920
timestamps and those kinds of things, some of those same flags, like the archive flag

299
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,640
and stuff are the same.

300
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,400
The other thing that I find kind of useful about it is it does support syncing one data

301
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,240
set to multiple cloud storages, which is kind of a neat feature if you think about it.

302
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
So you could spread out your risks.

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,520
Say you have a locally encrypted set of data or something to that degree and then you could

304
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,140
blast a copy of it on Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud.

305
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,720
Now would I really want to do that?

306
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,360
Generally no, however there's something that I feel like we as a society at whole have

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,640
not really wrapped our brains around and that is the ephemeral nature of digital media,

308
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,960
specifically our pictures.

309
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,440
And one of the things that stands out for me is a very strong memory from childhood

310
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,020
is going through family photo albums and seeing pictures of grandma and grandpa getting married

311
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,860
and how young they looked and seeing pictures of my mom and dad as kids and how they kind

312
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,360
of looked like me and my cousins and my uncles and my aunts.

313
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,200
These are pretty clear memories I have of going through these old photo albums and those

314
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,880
do not exist anymore for most people that are shooting digitally.

315
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,620
Some people print it out but for most of us they don't and then you move between computers

316
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,480
and you move between phones and all of a sudden you don't have the video of the marriage or

317
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,880
whatever it might be, the kid's birthday that was super important, and it's just gone.

318
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,420
It's just gone forever and there's nothing for your kids to flip through down the road

319
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,000
or your grandparents to flip through down the road because there's no physical object

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,840
to represent it and there's no solution to this problem.

321
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,520
There's nothing, you can update and upload all day long to Dropbox and Google Drive and

322
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,600
S3 and there's no way your kids are going to download that or your ancestors are going

323
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,560
to download that and look at it later on but at least it is preserving it in a way that

324
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
you could manage it and you can get access to it at some point.

325
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,000
And so spreading that out and the fact that this supports FTP, SFTP, the local file system,

326
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,440
so you could do an NFS mount if you wanted to or it supports multiple cloud storages

327
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,760
and it'll do hashes to make sure everything goes up there, everything's got good integrity.

328
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,320
It does partial syncs if your upload gets canceled.

329
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,740
So if you got to move off of CrashPlan, rClone could be a solution for you.

330
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,000
There's also kind of nice for restorations especially for basic end users is there's

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,400
an optional fuse mount called rClone mount and as you'd expect that makes it kind of

332
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,520
easy for regular people to browse through their backup and you could just have this

333
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,400
as an icon on the side of their file manager that they click on, kicks off using the background,

334
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,520
it does a mount and of course you just have to have rClone installed to do that and you

335
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:57,700
could also even use WinFCP and there is actually a proxy module available for Windows which

336
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,640
uses a combination of rClone and CG GoFuse, I can't remember what it's called because

337
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,880
I have never needed to use it, but there's actually even a way to mount rClone backups

338
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,560
on Windows desktops which could be great for clients or people that you're setting up in

339
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,040
an office that need access to that but you're backing it from a Linux file server.

340
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,240
That's a situation I've been in where I've used a backup system on Linux for Linux file

341
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,360
servers and then guess who needs to restore the data?

342
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
Some user on Windows and that has a solution for that.

343
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,360
So links to all of that crap in the show notes.

344
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,400
So I was doing a bit of research while you were talking, apparently Duplicity and by

345
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,720
extension DejaDup, since it's the front end to it, can directly sync or directly backup

346
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
to Amazon Cloud Drive.

347
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
I am so glad you brought up Duplicity because that's a great one.

348
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:51,120
On top of that, there's an asynchronous upload flag that will encrypt as it uploads.

349
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,880
So you can encrypt your backups and not have to worry about Amazon looking into your backups.

350
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,840
There's also sort of name collision but there's also Duplicati which is a backup software

351
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,400
for Mac, Windows and Linux they say that does local encryption and then backs up to probably

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,680
using rClone on the backend all the same cloud services that rClone supports but this gives

353
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,560
you a big old stinking web GUI for it which makes it nice and easy for people to manage.

354
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,100
So it might be something worth looking at too.

355
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,360
That's Duplicati and Duplicity.

356
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,880
Duplicity is like a GTK based app that you run on Linux desktop.

357
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Duplicity is the command line app.

358
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
DejaDup is the GTK app.

359
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Oh, okay.

360
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Oh, right, right.

361
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Thank you.

362
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
So DejaDup is the GTK front end.

363
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,840
Duplicati is a web based like a project around rClone.

364
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,120
That's a lot of things we just dropped at you.

365
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,700
I know that's all confusing because all the names sort of collide.

366
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,000
So here's what I'm doing right now is I'm putting links to all of this stuff in the

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
show notes, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

368
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,440
Go to Linux Unplugged 211s and you'll see the big section on rClone there that lists

369
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,720
all of the cloud services that it features.

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah, DejaDup has been an app pick before too.

371
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,080
If you want good advice for data stuff in general, the Data Hoarder subreddit is a great

372
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
place to go.

373
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Oh, yeah.

374
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah, I haven't been there in forever.

375
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,560
And also anybody in the mom room, if you have any other like backup apps or tips.

376
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,880
Plus it has some really nice storage porn.

377
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
Yeah, it is a great subreddit to hang out in.

378
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,480
And like if you're ever like in the mood to like research and set up like a new NAS.

379
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah, some of the most chill, informative guys on Reddit.

380
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
All right.

381
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
I think I got links to everything now.

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Duplicity, DejaDup.

383
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Go ahead.

384
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,560
DejaDup is also great because it's really easy to use.

385
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Yeah.

386
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,960
And it's like even like, you know, for basic end users that could pick it up.

387
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
All right.

388
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
So I think that's...

389
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
And it has a fun name.

390
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Look at that.

391
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
All of that.

392
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Look at that.

393
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Live show note editing right here on the show.

394
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Proud of us.

395
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
So those of you that are getting screwed up by CrashPlan, hopefully some of these will

396
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
help out.

397
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
I feel really bad about that because I've recommended CrashPlan in the past.

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I wonder if DejaDup can upload to Tarsnap.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That'd be interesting.

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah.

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I got to play around.

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,920
If Tarsnap has a GUI, I got to play around with that too because that would...

403
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
That's a slam dunk.

404
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,480
It apparently just like hit 1.0 like this past week.

405
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
That's worth it.

406
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,660
That is a slam dunk, I think.

407
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,960
Also feel free to tweet us or leave a comment wherever you're watching this to let us know

408
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
how you're doing your offsite backups on Linux.

409
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,160
I am more particularly interested in offsite backups.

410
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,600
Local backups is good too, but offsite is really sort of the sweet spot.

411
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
And however you do it, let us know.

412
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,440
Leave a comment where you watch this or go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact

413
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,300
or tweet me at Chris LAS.

414
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,980
Also got the subreddit, linuxunplug.reddit.com.

415
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,160
Let's talk about mobile.

416
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
This is my mobile service provider.

417
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,120
It's also Reiki's mobile service provider, and it's a Ting, linux.ting.com.

418
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,480
It's just a better way to do mobile.

419
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
There's no contracts, no nationwide coverage.

420
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
You just pay for what you use.

421
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,580
This is so nice, especially when new phones are getting released.

422
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,440
You don't have to sit here and try to do the crazy complicated, am I eligible for an upgrade?

423
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,680
Do I have to go into a quote-unquote agreement if I do that?

424
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,720
It's just so straightforward, especially with some of the leasing programs that the iPhone

425
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,360
has, or if you want to go grab a used phone off of Gazelle when the new phones come out

426
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,040
for a crazy great price or eBay, this is the perfect time to bring it over to Ting, because

427
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
you can just add a SIM.

428
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,100
You just go get the SIM card from their store, and if you go to linux.ting.com, they'll give

429
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,780
you $25 to play with, either off a device or in service credits.

430
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,760
And if you get that SIM card for nine bucks, they'll probably just give you... I think

431
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,640
they just attribute it all in service credits.

432
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,400
That first month you bring that phone over will probably be paid for.

433
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It's nice.

434
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
Do you want to know a secret, Chris?

435
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
Sometimes they even cut the price of those SIMs.

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah, they do.

437
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And sometimes they have them on sale on Amazon, too.

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,940
I will say, the only time I've ever had to contact Ting was to get my unlocked phone

439
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,920
on Ting, and it only took like five minutes.

440
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,720
I feel like on other carriers, it doesn't take nearly as-

441
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,660
You know what will really sell you on Ting?

442
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,400
If you can do the whole bring your device process online through their website, and

443
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,080
it's done in minutes, and you never even have to talk to... It's so well done.

444
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,280
You start using different aspects of Ting, and it's how you just immediately realize

445
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,600
it's how every carrier should do it.

446
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,040
It's how they would have to do it in the US today to be competitive if the industry was

447
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
starting over.

448
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Yeah.

449
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,360
The only reason I even needed to call them is because the other carrier screwed it up.

450
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Yeah.

451
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Yeah.

452
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,720
You can also get some great... Like Rika was just mentioning, when they bring things

453
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,440
up on sale, you can get that kind of information on their Twitter account.

454
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
They also have TingTips.

455
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Look at this.

456
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Look at that.

457
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
They got TingTips on there.

458
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I didn't know they had TingTips.

459
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,480
That was pretty hip Ting music too.

460
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,040
Oh, I like that.

461
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,360
So they got tips and stuff on their Twitter page, at TingFTW on Twitter, where you can

462
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,220
find out about giveaways, sales, like on the SIM cards and whatnot.

463
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,920
It's no contract, no early termination fees, you only pay for what you use, they don't

464
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,880
play that crazy OEM game where they want to flash a certain experience on your phone,

465
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
so they hold back updates.

466
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,440
If you get a device that gets updates from Google or gets updates from Motorola, they

467
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
don't get in the way.

468
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
They ship it.

469
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,200
It still blows my mind to have an internet savvy phone company.

470
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Yeah.

471
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
It is really nice.

472
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
It's finally the way it should be.

473
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,360
Linux.ting.com, and thanks to everybody who supports the show by visiting that site and

474
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,600
checking out Ting, and checking out their blog, and signing up, Linux.ting.com.

475
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,080
Now here's something you never thought Electron would be used for, and this is a line that's

476
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,280
just even too far for me.

477
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't even with this, guys, a file manager built using Electron.

478
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I love it.

479
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Check it out.

480
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,680
It's JMPfm, JMP file manager, and it's described as a dual-pane file manager, cross-platform

481
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,360
Qt based, and it has a terminal tool built in that lets you do certain things.

482
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,280
In fact, it takes its key influences from the LS command, it says.

483
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:35,400
It's a keyboard-driven file manager, and as you might expect, I have it loaded right here.

484
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,120
I've been trying it out, and I'll tell you one thing.

485
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,920
Its main gimmick is pretty cool.

486
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,880
If you type the J key, it brings up the JMP menu, JMPfm is the name, and it shows you

487
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,720
all your favorite directories, and you can just bam right through them super quick.

488
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Bam.

489
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,040
It also, I think, has a flat file mode where it will show you all the files in the directory

490
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,840
you're in, as well as all the subdirectories.

491
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Okay, let's see here.

492
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,040
So it's got a whole series of plug-ins, too.

493
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,720
The configuration's done through a series of text files and whatnot, though.

494
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
That's kind of a turn-off.

495
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Well, it's early.

496
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah, it is early.

497
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
It is early.

498
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,880
So I've been running this and Nautilus all day, been browsing files in both of them,

499
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,200
so I thought we'd just check in and do a little memory usage.

500
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,880
So how much does an Electron file manager take?

501
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
Now I'm not normally this guy.

502
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,480
I just had a whole soapbox on last week's quarter radio about how I think Linux users

503
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,060
are too hard on Electron apps, but I've got to do this.

504
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
We have to go here.

505
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,200
So sorting by memory usage, the only thing on my system that's taking more memory is

506
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,320
definitely Chrome.

507
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,440
Chrome's taking a lot more memory.

508
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Geez, look at Chrome.

509
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,000
That is really something.

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,360
Well, it's isolating every process.

511
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,920
So Jump FM, if you look at just the...

512
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,520
If you look at just the Jump FM main process, and it has a couple of processes, but if you

513
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,680
look at just the main process right now, this is really remarkable, actually.

514
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,480
This is not the results I had earlier.

515
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,280
Jump FM is currently consuming 27.9 megabytes of RAM, and Nautilus is currently consuming

516
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,120
23.4.

517
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,840
So Nautilus is only a few megabytes lower.

518
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,160
It's 23 megabytes for Nautilus, 27 megabytes for Jump FM.

519
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,920
So if you go back into Jump FM, Chris, and you pick a folder, and you hit R, it'll do

520
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
the flat mode.

521
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Oh, okay.

522
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
One more thing on the memory usage, though.

523
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,480
So Jump FM's main thread, 27.9 meg.

524
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,220
So essentially 28 megabytes.

525
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,560
But then there's also an app image thread that gets launched when I mount it via app

526
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
image.

527
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,200
That takes up five megabytes of RAM.

528
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,720
There's also a dedicated thread for the GPU with no sandbox mode turned on, dual GPU turned

529
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,020
off, and driver bug workarounds enabled, and certain GL extensions disabled.

530
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,000
That thread is taking an astonishing 62 megabytes of RAM, taking more RAM than the main file

531
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
manager thread.

532
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,640
And then there is a tertiary thread besides the main thread that is taking 5.8 megabytes

533
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,920
of RAM that is just apparently some sort of like no sandbox thing.

534
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,680
Anyways, so that is quite a bit of memory usage.

535
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,800
But if I go into flat mode here, that is kind of great, actually.

536
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,040
Yeah, it shows you all the files in the directory and in all the subdirectories.

537
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Wow, that's a lot of files.

538
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
That's a lot of crash files.

539
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,060
And it's really quick, too.

540
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
It is quick.

541
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
I'll give it that.

542
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
It is quick.

543
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,080
Once it's loaded, like all Electron apps, it loads a little awkwardly for a moment.

544
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,560
But then once it's loaded, it is very quick.

545
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,400
And then it's got other crazy stuff like filtering where you can hit F and just type in part

546
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,760
of a file name and it will find the file for you.

547
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
All right.

548
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
So let's do jump.

549
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Let's see if it helps if I spell it right.

550
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Jump.

551
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Hmm.

552
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
I don't know.

553
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
You might be searching the directory you're in.

554
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,880
I just feel like this is a line too far for me, dude.

555
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Where do we stop building Electron apps at?

556
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,840
And for coders, if you hit Control-G on a file, it'll instantly make a gist.

557
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Huh.

558
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Okay.

559
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,720
So here was my thought on this is there is some value to just maybe Control-G.

560
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,040
Yeah.

561
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,320
That's pretty great, actually.

562
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,640
It's creating a gist right now.

563
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,360
That's pretty great.

564
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
There is some...

565
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,120
Yeah, I guess if I am stuck on Mac, Windows, and Linux...

566
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Yeah, there's my gist.

567
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,680
Of course, I did it out of an image file, so of course it's ass, but it did it.

568
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
It did it.

569
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,840
If I'm stuck on Mac or Windows, but my main OS is Linux, maybe then I would want to have

570
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,980
a file manager that's cross-platform like this.

571
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
But come on.

572
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
Go with me, dude.

573
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
Would you ever use this?

574
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Yeah.

575
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Why not?

576
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Well, Explorer sucks.

577
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
Maybe that's why.

578
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,980
Nautilus sucks too.

579
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
Yeah, but not as bad as...

580
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,200
I mean, I don't know.

581
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,920
Just look at them side by side.

582
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,960
So here is JumpFM, and here, let me bring up Nautilus.

583
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
Nautilus looks so much better.

584
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I disagree.

585
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,400
I hate how Nautilus looks.

586
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,840
This looks like a Flash application on my desktop.

587
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,720
It looks like it's weird.

588
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,160
It doesn't follow my desktop convention at all.

589
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,480
Yeah, but that's just a problem with the implementation of the app.

590
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,000
You can make Electron apps follow your desktop.

591
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Man, I don't know.

592
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,120
To me, it seems like Nautilus is way better looking.

593
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,720
It also doesn't help that you're running a cute app in a GDK environment.

594
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Yeah.

595
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:15,040
Well, I mean, I just tried Jump inside of Plasma, and it looks like...

596
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
About the same?

597
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Yeah.

598
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
So what are your impressions?

599
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,360
I mean, it looks interesting as far as the speed of its searching.

600
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,280
The find tool is not that useful, it seems so far.

601
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:35,000
The flat thing is cool, although it's not as effective as you would assume.

602
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,680
It flattens some of the stuff and shows you some files, but it also skips other files.

603
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,520
If I just flatten this, it should be showing me files that are in the main folder, but

604
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,400
it's skipping that and showing other folders, so that's weird.

605
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:56,080
But overall, I mean, it's interesting, although 200 megs total on my system is not acceptable

606
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,120
for a file manager.

607
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm so tired of the whole memory usage argument.

608
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,240
But 200 megs for a file manager?

609
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:14,400
We're in a world where 32 gigabyte PCs are common.

610
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,480
It's 32 gigabytes for a file manager that is not even that good.

611
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm looking at my folder right now.

612
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
At this point, I'm just talking about the whole memory usage argument in general, not

613
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
specifically for this app.

614
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,520
Okay.

615
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,440
I agree with the argument in general.

616
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,960
There are some Electron apps that manage it very well and even do hibernation in certain

617
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,600
cases and stuff, so those are fine.

618
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,120
It's just the ones that recognize that Electron needs to be managed, I'm okay with those.

619
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,960
Things like this, where the features it's offering are not even implemented very well,

620
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,880
like if you go to the flat mode, it looks cool, but I have stuff in the home folder.

621
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm in the home folder just to see what happens if it finds every file.

622
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,480
It finds random files in some folders and it skips the rest.

623
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,440
I feel like if we crapped on every project that didn't work on one of its earlier releases,

624
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600
then we'd have a lot less projects.

625
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,520
I guess where I go with it is, is there a line?

626
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,080
Is there a line where you say, these things should be native applications on a platform?

627
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,880
Like for a house, you have to have a foundation for your house.

628
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,520
You could build the house materials out of anything, but the house has to be a solid

629
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
foundation.

630
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Yeah.

631
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,800
I mean, I don't think that native really matters anymore.

632
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Look at Discord.

633
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
It's not native.

634
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,640
You got to have something to launch the web browser.

635
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Well, yeah.

636
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:48,320
I mean, native is not that necessary, sure, and Discord is a good example, but it is still

637
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
important.

638
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,760
In a file manager, native is important and just because it's going to be faster, because

639
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,280
this is fast, but it's also incredibly inaccurate.

640
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,780
If you do the flat system and it shows you these files and it's cool, but it's skipping

641
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,480
files that are in the current folder I'm in and going to other folders, it's not reliable

642
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
in any way whatsoever.

643
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
For me, it's not fast enough, to be honest.

644
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,960
I mean, it's fast once it's running, but it does that thing that some Electron apps do

645
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,520
where the frame of the application comes up and then the inside of the application flashes

646
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,520
white, and then the UI elements render in, sort of like how a webpage loads, actually.

647
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,520
When I want to just open up my file manager super quick, I've already had to do the mental

648
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,440
gymnastics of, is this something I do on the terminal with LS, or is this something I bother

649
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,840
firing at my file manager?

650
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,280
So I've already made that decision tree, which already takes time, and then I go through

651
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,220
that decision tree and I end up with this app that's taking me, I don't know, noticeably

652
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,440
longer than my native app to load.

653
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,360
The thing is, you guys are making arguments for problems that can be solved by better

654
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
code.

655
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Would you...

656
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,280
Yeah, I suppose, like they could do a TSR in the background and leave it always running

657
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,480
to launch faster, I suppose.

658
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,240
Well, no, you can just optimize the code so it launches quicker.

659
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,640
I don't really know any Electron app that launches as quick as a native application.

660
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,840
Once it's up and running, I agree, you can have it pretty competitive, but launch time

661
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,360
seems particularly important for a file manager, like your terminal, too.

662
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,800
That also seems like something you want to launch really fast.

663
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I'm playing around with it.

664
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,080
Discord takes forever and just has little splash messages like these weird, like the

665
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,800
rabbits are loading or something.

666
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
That's not a bad way to go.

667
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,280
A splash message isn't a bad way to go, at least then you know it's working.

668
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,360
I think Discord takes long because it's loading all the messages from the server and stuff.

669
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, and it's checking for updates and every time, too.

670
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,540
I would say that this jump FM is interesting, but it doesn't do what it claims to do.

671
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,160
If it didn't claim these things and say these things are good, that's one thing, but it's

672
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,520
claiming like the flat system doesn't work, the searching isn't useful, it's not finding

673
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
any things.

674
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,320
I'm like searching for files that I know are in like one folder, like lower, and it's not

675
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
finding that at all.

676
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,240
Have you turned on the syntax highlighting, the quote unquote, where it does different

677
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,120
color coding for different file types?

678
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
No.

679
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I think that's useful.

680
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,120
That's actually kind of nice, especially when you're working on like a website, and

681
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,360
they have a screenshot here, and you've got-

682
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,920
You need to skim to the greens.

683
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,880
Yeah, you got your index.html, which is always green, your JSON files are always red, your

684
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,120
CSS is always gray.

685
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,320
It's interesting, but if it doesn't do the rest of the stuff, then what's the point?

686
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,720
Yeah, there's stuff in there I like.

687
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,840
Actually, I think their jump menu is pretty great.

688
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,160
I would like every freaking file manager to do this jump menu thing.

689
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, I'm not saying the app is great as it is, I'm saying it has potential.

690
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, I agree with you.

691
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The jump menu's pretty cool.

692
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah, like the-

693
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
It reminds me of Sublime Text.

694
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Yeah, exactly.

695
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,000
It's just like the Sublime, or Gnome do essentially, or whatever.

696
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,640
But the other thing is, is like being able to upload a gist, and files that are displayed

697
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,840
depending on their git status, the jump menu and the git integration is really shit that

698
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,120
every important Linux file manager should be shipping already, if you think about it.

699
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,480
Because we keep talking about on this show and other shows, and obviously Dell and other

700
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,780
companies, and System76 keep talking about focusing on users that are creating software.

701
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,040
People like the Sputnik program, for example, is going really after the web developer, sysadmin

702
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,040
market that is using Linux on production and using Linux on the Sputnik laptops.

703
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,800
And that focus, they have seen 100% year over year growth by focusing on that niche within

704
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
a niche of Linux users.

705
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,480
They realized they had to hyper focus at a certain niche of Linux users, which is incredible

706
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,960
if you think about it, because Linux is already such a niche.

707
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,460
And these users, these are kinds of features that they want.

708
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,200
And I feel like our...

709
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:51,360
This is just a short rant, but I feel like our projects, like GNOME, are so focused on

710
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:58,400
bringing in the new user that it takes a damn memory eating monster to come along and actually

711
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,440
ship something that's new and innovative.

712
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,520
We haven't had anything interesting happen in our file managers in years.

713
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,320
In fact, on the GNOME side, features have literally just gotten removed year after year.

714
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,560
Some have finally been re-added recently.

715
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,400
And this kind of stuff, meanwhile, has just been sitting out there.

716
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
This should be...

717
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
This should be...

718
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,360
This GNOME file should have been shipping this a year ago.

719
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Dolphin should be doing this already.

720
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,100
This needs to already be happening.

721
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,960
And this is kind of sad you have to go get it from an Electron app.

722
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,500
Dolphin does have the syntax thing.

723
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,880
Dolphin has everything else like the Git integration and stuff.

724
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,840
Oh, I was specifically talking about Git and the jump thing.

725
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,640
So if it's got that, then I take it back for Dolphin, because that's the thing I really

726
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
think.

727
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,120
Can you, does Dolphin do that?

728
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I don't think so, no.

729
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
So that would be great.

730
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
It does have the Git thing.

731
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
The Git stuff is good, too.

732
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
That's awesome.

733
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
So I've got to play with that.

734
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Dolphin just feels terrible to use.

735
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,880
Is it like the services KIO slave stuff?

736
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,600
Or is it like legit, because the thing about this is you can actually sort the files in

737
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,920
your file browser based on their Git status.

738
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,080
That's a whole other level.

739
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,120
I think it's KIO stuff.

740
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Yeah.

741
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,720
Even having something is nice, though.

742
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,040
And then, of course, it's got plugins and filtering and stuff like that.

743
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
So yeah.

744
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
There are filterings.

745
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,040
There's the filter in the search bar and stuff like that that does something, but it's not

746
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,840
like automatically loading stuff like the jump thing is doing.

747
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,360
The jump thing, I think, is particularly great.

748
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,680
I think the Git stuff is particularly great.

749
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,000
The plugin stuff, I don't really know if I need that in my file manager.

750
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Filtering stuff, yeah.

751
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You can basically do that.

752
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't know, Chris.

753
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You've got plenty of plugins in GIT.

754
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,080
You know, if it let Google finally release a Google Drive client for Linux, maybe that

755
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
would be worth it.

756
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Well, I think you need-

757
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
There's Google Drive support for Dolphin.

758
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Yeah.

759
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,880
It'd probably be pretty easy to implement in Jump FM.

760
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Yeah.

761
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Oh, gosh.

762
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah, probably.

763
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Nice web extensions.

764
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah, really.

765
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Yeah, no kidding.

766
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,280
Anyways, it's an interesting thing to play around with if you want to play, A, with an

767
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,200
app image, because that's what it is, and, B, with a file manager that's actually trying

768
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,760
to do something different for the first time in a few years, so you could check that out.

769
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,120
I definitely like the thought of being able to just take all of my apps with me on whatever

770
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
platform.

771
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Yeah.

772
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
I completely agree.

773
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,920
I think one of the things that I've said for a long time is a great way to convert people

774
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
to Linux and-

775
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,740
Just have a completely portable workflow.

776
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,120
Put people on LibreOffice, Firefox, and now Jump FM, and they're ready to go.

777
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,920
You put them on Windows and let them run that for six months, then move over to Linux, use

778
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,800
the same apps, nothing changes.

779
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,080
It's legitimately the smoothest way to move people over to Linux, but they're not going

780
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
to need to anymore.

781
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,200
That's going to come to an end, because Google is launching Chrome Enterprise subscription

782
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,900
service for Chrome OS, essentially signaling to the entire world that, okay, we're ready

783
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,160
for Chrome OS to take over in the enterprise.

784
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,400
They've experimented with this a little bit, actually, in the past with Chromebooks for

785
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,280
Work was the program, but this is a totally different beast.

786
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,320
First of all, it's $50 per device per year, which for a business is just an unbelievably

787
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
low price.

788
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,440
They could have charged legitimately 50 bucks per month, and businesses would have paid

789
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
this.

790
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Chrome OS as a service.

791
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Yeah.

792
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
So you get a number of nice capabilities.

793
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,040
They have a little chart here.

794
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Holy crap.

795
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Can I zoom in on this?

796
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Because this is quite the chart.

797
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,360
So additional things that you get above and beyond stock Chrome OS with Chrome Enterprise,

798
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
and this isn't the browser.

799
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
This is the OS.

800
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
They just call it Chrome Enterprise.

801
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,000
They dropped the OS for whatever reason.

802
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,600
You get managed Google Play beta support for the apps that can be installed on Chrome OS.

803
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,120
You can manage the browser better that's on Chrome OS.

804
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,800
You get full-fledged remote printer management support, but this is the big one that they're

805
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,960
really marketing right here.

806
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,400
Full-fledged Microsoft Active Directory integration, including single sign-on with their Google

807
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,920
accounts and everything, all authenticated via Active Directory.

808
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,200
You also get kiosk mode and public mode that it automatically delete.

809
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,080
You get managed network and proxies that you can remote push to the devices, which I thought

810
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,540
you could do with regular Chrome, but they say Chrome Enterprise.

811
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:02,300
You get theft prevention wherever the hell that is, and of course, of course, 24-7 enterprise

812
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,760
support for $50 a year per device.

813
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,040
All at a much cheaper price than Windows licenses.

814
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,440
Much, much, much, much cheaper, and the hardware is cheaper.

815
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,980
It's more interchangeable.

816
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,840
There's this thing that has happened many times, and I bet a lot of you that are in

817
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,880
IT know this story.

818
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,440
There is a thing about the very high levels of a company.

819
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,520
Every now and then, you get one of these employees, it's man or women, who are high enough in

820
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,600
the company where what they do is so damn important that any disruption is immediately

821
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,760
addressed, even if it means they go through computers at least once a year.

822
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,360
I had this client every six months.

823
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,160
It was his computer.

824
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,840
We finally got to the point, I think I talked about this in one of our shows, where we just

825
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:52,720
built this monster maniac system, when SSDs were still really expensive, and Xeon processors

826
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,760
put this thing in a raid, started doing image snapshot backups every single night, just

827
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,320
went all out, and he burned through that system.

828
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
He just burned through that system.

829
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,480
The thing for him was, in a day, he's working with five, six million dollar deals a day,

830
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,200
maybe more, so a $7,000 monster machine was no big deal to him.

831
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,760
There were other employees who would just get some of his hand-me-downs that would still

832
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
work.

833
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
He was all filtered down.

834
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,600
These things, these things are so cheap to replace that your employees can destroy them.

835
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
They can lose them.

836
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,280
You can wipe them.

837
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,560
It's such an enticing business proposition, especially when you look at their other cloud

838
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,320
services that this ties in with, because when you start integrating Microsoft Active Directory

839
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,280
with single sign-on to the Google cloud services, you get the Google App Suite with this thing.

840
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
You get Chrome OS.

841
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
You get cloud storage.

842
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,360
You can authenticate and manage the permissions via Active Directory.

843
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:57,160
This is that final piece that clicks Chrome OS into this really ideal position for businesses,

844
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,760
and then, for some really stupid reason, they're only charging $50 a year.

845
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,960
Like I'm saying, people would pay $50 a month for this.

846
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,520
Well, it's a good way to lock them in for all the other services.

847
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,680
You'll also be able to have a managed enterprise app store for just your users.

848
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,720
It's something that's in beta right now, but it's going to use Chrome OS's new ability

849
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,800
to run Android apps, and you'll be able to give them a branded Play Store page that's

850
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,600
the only section of the Play Store they can access that has all of your company apps on

851
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,680
it.

852
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,720
Google is working their ass off to compete with Microsoft.

853
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,280
I sort of set this up as Linux is a little screwed.

854
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,720
All these companies that run Linux are just going to go with this instead, maybe, but

855
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,960
I don't really think that's the case.

856
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,580
I think people that are going to run Linux on the desktop need a more powerful operating

857
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,200
system to begin with, but who this really is going to screw over is Microsoft because

858
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,000
this is not only eating away at their OEM's hardware sales.

859
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,160
It's eating away at the whole office lock-in thing because this also comes with all these

860
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,080
great Google Cloud services.

861
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,400
They're going for it, dude.

862
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Google's going for it.

863
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
They're really going for it with this.

864
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,200
Good on them, I suppose.

865
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Good on them.

866
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,240
It does seem like a typical Google thing.

867
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,280
You just have this product that sits there and is a sleeper for half a decade or more,

868
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,280
and then all of a sudden, it just clicks into place.

869
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Yeah, I suppose.

870
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,360
That sounds like how Microsoft used to do things.

871
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,280
Google more and more to me feels like the new Microsoft.

872
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,600
That was a Microsoft move for a long time, and this whole ecosystem lock-in strategy

873
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,040
is a Microsoft one.

874
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,600
Google's just doing it with Cloud services.

875
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,200
Microsoft did it with file formats.

876
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,400
It's the 90s all over again, everybody.

877
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,520
Hey, speaking of the 90s, let's make your Bash prompt even cooler.

878
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,440
Your Bash RC is a handy little place you can go to make your prompt look badass and stuff,

879
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,800
like from the movies and whatnot.

880
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,360
I forgot who passed this along to me, so apologies, but this is EasyPrompt.net.

881
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,160
I think it came from our Discord.

882
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Yeah.

883
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,520
Yeah, I think it was in the content channel in our Discord.

884
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,200
Thank you to whoever did this, because this is so fun.

885
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,720
It lets you pick the elements that you want to show up in your prompt.

886
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,400
Say you want maybe your host name to be in your command prompt, your shell version, the

887
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,600
current directory you're in, or the whole path is actually my favorite one, the shell

888
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,500
release, or date and time information.

889
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,440
Isn't that cool?

890
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,120
What you get here is a webpage, and you pick these blocks that you want.

891
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,760
You have your basic elements.

892
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,520
I like to put in username.

893
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,480
I also like to put in the current path of the directory, and why not also have some

894
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,520
status elements in there?

895
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,500
You could have things like get status, or you could have time.

896
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,680
You could have time or extra characters in there.

897
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,760
Maybe you like to have a few extra ASCII characters in there to make it look badass.

898
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,920
I totally understand.

899
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,000
I totally understand.

900
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,080
What's great about this is as you click these different things, you can move them around

901
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,520
in this web interface, and it gives you a real-time preview output of what your prompt

902
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,320
is going to look like, and then in a fourth box, just four boxes, in the fourth box, it

903
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,640
gives you the code that you copy pasta into your Bash RC file to make your command prompt

904
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,480
look like that.

905
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,760
How cool is that?

906
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
I was messing around with this.

907
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,000
I was just deleting stuff and adding new stuff and putting the full DNS name in there, all

908
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,880
that kind of stuff, shell version.

909
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,960
It's really neat, and you can add spaces in there if you want it to look right.

910
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,480
You can mess with all that kind of stuff.

911
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,520
It was CodeChris on Discord.

912
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Thank you, WW.

913
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
CodeChris.

914
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
CodeChris.

915
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
CodeChris.

916
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Thank you, WW.

917
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Thank you to CodeChris, and thank you to WW for pointing it out.

918
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,520
It's easyprompt.net if you want to play around with that and make your RC all cool.

919
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,600
If you want something a bit more advanced, more crazy, there's something called Powerline

920
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Shell.

921
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
Oh, yeah.

922
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Oh, yeah.

923
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
That is really intense.

924
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
We've got to have talked about that.

925
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
Right?

926
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Maybe, but it's really damn awesome.

927
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
Okay.

928
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,760
In fact, I think it's installed by default in Solus.

929
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Really?

930
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Yeah.

931
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I don't know.

932
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Ike knows what's up.

933
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,720
I don't know if it's turned on by default, but I know it's in there.

934
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Yeah.

935
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
So PowerShell gives you...

936
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,760
So if you've ever seen screenshots of people's computers that have the terminal up, and then

937
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,920
they have in the terminal on the command prompt, they have the directory path in these cool,

938
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
almost capsule-looking...

939
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
How would you describe that?

940
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,080
I don't know.

941
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,600
It's kind of like a graphical representation in your command line.

942
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Yeah.

943
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
It's neat.

944
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
It's neat-looking.

945
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,880
There's a lot of cool things that it does.

946
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
You can...

947
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Yeah, that's really cool.

948
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,600
PowerShell is also a cool way to make your trip.

949
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Okay.

950
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,560
Now, just all of a sudden, we turned it into a cool thing to hack the terminal.

951
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah.

952
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:49,120
I actually had it on my mind because somebody I know from IRC just rewrote it in Go, and

953
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,680
it's actually way, way faster.

954
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Oh, man.

955
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
What?

956
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
PowerShell?

957
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Yeah.

958
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Is it available for Linux in Go?

959
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Yeah.

960
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
Where do I...

961
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Yeah.

962
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
So it's navigation trees, what some people in chatroom call it.

963
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Yeah.

964
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,360
You know, if that's available for Linux, that'd be pretty cool.

965
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Yeah.

966
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,680
It's github.com slash justgen slash powerline-go.

967
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
Powerline-go.

968
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Of course.

969
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Of course.

970
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
There's...

971
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,680
You know what?

972
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
No way.

973
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
Okay.

974
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Now, wake me...

975
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
You know what?

976
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
I'm gonna wait.

977
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,680
You know why?

978
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Because just wake me up when the Rust port comes.

979
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,680
That's when I'll...

980
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,680
DigitalOcean.com.

981
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,840
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, create an account, and use our promo code of absolute power and

982
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
performance.

983
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
That's D-O Unplugged.

984
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,520
You create your account, then you apply D-O Unplugged, one word, and you get a $10 credit.

985
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,640
Now, keep that in mind, because DigitalOcean's pricing is amazing.

986
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,040
I love their three cents an hour machine.

987
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,520
It's very fast.

988
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,300
It's a great way to try out a project, mess around with something, and then totally economical

989
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,300
to leave in production.

990
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,320
You can get started in less than 55 seconds, you'll be logged in and ready to go.

991
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,440
They got SSDs for all the different types of systems you might want, from the really

992
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,880
high-end CPU systems and the rigs with lots of memory, all the way down to the $5 a month

993
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
systems.

994
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
They got SSD.

995
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,160
And the hypervisors have super fast 40-gigabit connections coming in.

996
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,760
Of course, they run Linux and KVM for the virtualizer.

997
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,480
And then DigitalOcean has built an API that is really nice, super smooth and simple.

998
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
We work with it all the time.

999
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,300
In fact, I think all of their tools use it as well.

1000
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,700
And because of that, there's lots of open source projects available using it.

1001
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,840
You can just install them on your phone or your Linux desktop.

1002
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,520
There's some that work right in your tray that you can manage your droplets.

1003
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,020
They have a block storage to make it quick and easy to attach, lots of more storage up

1004
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,640
to 16 terabytes to a droplet.

1005
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,980
Pre-build open source apps that you can monitor or you can deploy really quick.

1006
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,980
And monitoring.

1007
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,520
I do like that monitoring too.

1008
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,200
We use it mostly on and off.

1009
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,080
See, the thing about the monitoring that's really nice is, how do you know how powerful

1010
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,600
of a droplet do you need?

1011
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
How do you know?

1012
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
So it's...

1013
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
You monitor it.

1014
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Yeah, you monitor it.

1015
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
And it's easy to expand.

1016
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,120
So go with the $5 a month and see if it works for your workload.

1017
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,120
A lot of people like to just use it for something like a WordPress site or an email server.

1018
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,800
I don't recommend running your own email server, but you definitely can.

1019
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,760
And you don't need more than the $5 a month droplet to do that.

1020
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,520
I've expanded a couple of droplets.

1021
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,200
All you have to do is basically just go into where it asks you how you want to expand it.

1022
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,560
You change the things and then you just reload it and it's got the new stuff.

1023
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,560
So just try it that way.

1024
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,760
So, you know, whatever you're doing, like a Nextcloud system, this is a great example

1025
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
of that.

1026
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,080
I've done this very...with my Nextcloud instance because we uploaded a bunch of pictures.

1027
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,080
It grew.

1028
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,120
I'm like, I think I want to keep that stuff on there.

1029
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,500
So I'll just add more storage.

1030
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
And it's so economical.

1031
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
It's seamless, too.

1032
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,360
Like you don't have to go and like edit config files.

1033
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
No, I know.

1034
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
It's DigitalOcean, dude.

1035
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
DigitalOcean.

1036
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
DigitalOcean.com.

1037
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,160
Just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1038
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
DOUNPLUGGED.

1039
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
It's one word.

1040
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,920
You apply it to your account after you sign up, DigitalOcean.com.

1041
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,800
So this week I got some things to say about Ubuntu.

1042
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,840
And we have sort of like a low summer turnout.

1043
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,880
I think as the summer wraps up, I'm going to be glad in some ways because I think we'll

1044
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
have more people show up in the mumble room.

1045
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,040
Either that or everybody wants us to switch to Discord.

1046
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,140
That could be the subliminal message they're giving us.

1047
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,160
By not showing up in mumble, maybe they're saying, switch over to Discord, guys.

1048
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,880
Because if they wanted us to stay on mumble, they'd surely be here.

1049
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,980
So something to think about.

1050
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:17,360
But in the meantime, this is actually to my advantage because neither Popey nor Wimpy

1051
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,540
have joined us for today's episode.

1052
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:25,920
And I have some things to say about Ubuntu.

1053
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,660
I don't run Ubuntu.

1054
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,960
I'm running Solus on this machine.

1055
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,320
I mean, I do run Ubuntu on some of our systems here at JB, but none of my personal daily

1056
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
use systems.

1057
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,320
The mumble room.

1058
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Yep.

1059
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,320
I know that one does.

1060
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
But none of my personal daily use systems run Ubuntu.

1061
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,440
So I don't have really much of a horse in this race.

1062
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,320
So just full disclosure, this doesn't really impact me.

1063
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,320
But I was going to save this.

1064
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,480
I was going to save this to talk about it with Noah on user error so that way he could

1065
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,580
back me up.

1066
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,000
So it wouldn't just be me saying this because it's just going to sound like Crazy Chris.

1067
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,880
But I think what we are seeing with Ubuntu 17.10 is what happens when an adult makes

1068
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,760
a Linux distribution.

1069
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,600
And I don't mean to be demeaning to all the other projects out there, but Canonical is

1070
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:17,040
doing things with 17.10 that I simply can't understand why it's taken, frankly, it's taken

1071
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,640
until they've come along and made a gnome version for any of this shit to happen.

1072
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:30,560
It's sort of opening my eyes to how this could be done better by all the other Linux distributions.

1073
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,440
So there's several different avenues I could take.

1074
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,520
I could talk about the thousands of fixes they've now submitted to fix Bluetooth upstream.

1075
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,440
I could talk about that for a moment.

1076
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,220
I could talk about the fact that they're finally the only distribution that's actually taking

1077
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,440
on hardware accelerated video playback and testing it and applying patches and getting

1078
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,440
it to work from the web browser down to the video on your screen.

1079
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,640
Everybody has claimed they have it, but no one actually got it working until Canonical

1080
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
came along.

1081
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,960
I could talk about that all day.

1082
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,320
But today we're going to talk about the new doc.

1083
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:14,720
Because this simple, simple thing that they are doing perfectly illustrates what I'm talking

1084
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,720
about.

1085
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,360
And I guess maybe for context, I'll give you one more example of something they've done

1086
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:26,480
recently that needs a lot more discussion and no one's talking about it.

1087
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,400
Canonical is doing something very unique with the way that they are implementing their GNOME

1088
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,120
desktop in Ubuntu 17.10.

1089
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,480
They are shipping it as a session option, just like the way that upstream GNOME ships

1090
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,660
GNOME Classic.

1091
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,200
You choose GNOME Classic and it's like you're in a different version of GNOME Shell, but

1092
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,160
you're not in a fork of GNOME Shell.

1093
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,440
You're not in something that conflicts with your totally tricked out version of GNOME

1094
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Shell.

1095
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,120
You're just in a different GNOME Shell environment.

1096
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,800
GNOME Shell has been specifically architected to support this.

1097
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,480
This was a design intention of GNOME Shell.

1098
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:11,140
But every distribution out there from Fedora to Anagros just cocks up your main GNOME installation

1099
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:16,320
with their extensions that conflict with extensions from the actual publisher.

1100
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:22,120
They'll just install the favorite stock and just say, ah, screw it.

1101
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,980
Doesn't matter if it has the same extension ID as the one upstream.

1102
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,440
And then you consistently run into issues when you update your system.

1103
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,320
They couldn't have just implemented it in its own session.

1104
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,480
No, they didn't do any of that stuff.

1105
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,640
With 17.10, if you don't like the way Canonical ships GNOME, you log out, you choose the default

1106
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,680
option and you've got stock GNOME.

1107
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,720
None of their extensions are installed.

1108
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,360
Their new custom doc we're about to talk about doesn't pop up.

1109
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,880
It's just GNOME.

1110
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,480
And it's been built to support this.

1111
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,600
And yet it took this company to do it.

1112
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,000
The GNOME developers tried to show the way with the classic session is to show you how

1113
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,200
it could be done, but nobody did it.

1114
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,640
Everybody just had, for some reason, had to just modify the default GNOME session.

1115
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,240
But when we see them now doing something as simple as modifying a doc, you really see

1116
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,760
the care that's being taken in their approach with 17.10 and the sustainability that they're

1117
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,400
building into this distribution now.

1118
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,720
And anybody who said that Canonical isn't focused on the desktop, you've got to reevaluate

1119
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,840
the facts because this is a great example.

1120
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:37,240
So they're going to launch a doc that's their own doc by default in Ubuntu 17.10.

1121
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,540
It is a light fork of sort of the most famous and well-known doc for GNOME, Dash to Dock.

1122
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,000
And they've basically made a few tweaks to it.

1123
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,720
But it's how they've gone about all of this that really matters.

1124
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,200
I'm looking at you, Mint Project, with all of your different fricking forks.

1125
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Xapps.

1126
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Yeah.

1127
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,320
So how did Canonical do this?

1128
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,560
And why didn't they just ship Dash to Dock?

1129
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,620
This is, I guess you could call it a light fork.

1130
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,960
It's a fork done right.

1131
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,540
And I think it's really a sustainable approach.

1132
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,040
So first of all, let's cover some of the basics here.

1133
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
Why would they want it?

1134
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,320
Why would they want to have their own doc?

1135
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,720
Why not just use, if it's so popular, why not just use Dash to Dock?

1136
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,720
Why even bother?

1137
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,120
Why waste the time?

1138
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,000
Why have to invent their own thing?

1139
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,200
Well, first of all, this extension is installed by default on Ubuntu, just like I was talking

1140
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,200
about how Antigros does it.

1141
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,920
It means it comes from a package.

1142
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,080
It comes from a deb from the main Ubuntu archive.

1143
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,440
So they've got to package it because that's how it's getting installed.

1144
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,040
So now they're immediately, instantly, without ever even shipping an ISO, they're in this

1145
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,720
problem where Upstream is shipping their own version and publishing on the GNOME extension

1146
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,620
site and their version is different.

1147
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,880
It's immediately an issue because that is a very popular extension that's under active

1148
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,700
development.

1149
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:00,200
If Canonical's extension kept the same GNOME shell extension ID that Dash to Dock had,

1150
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,720
it would mean that users couldn't swap them out.

1151
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,800
You would either have to use the Ubuntu one or uninstall your doc, which would probably

1152
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,360
uninstall a whole bunch of other dependencies and then try to get Dash to Dock installed.

1153
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,920
So they've done this, for one reason they've done this, is so they have their own extension

1154
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,120
ID so you don't have this conflict.

1155
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:24,680
But what's so badass about their implementation is the settings you tweak, they're schema

1156
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:31,380
overrides so you can actually share settings between the Upstream doc and the Ubuntu doc.

1157
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,200
If you install the Upstream doc, the Ubuntu doc automatically gets disabled.

1158
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,920
If you uninstall Dash to Dock, the Ubuntu doc automatically comes back on.

1159
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,320
Exactly the kind of behavior you would expect.

1160
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,680
They tweaked a few other small things about Dash to Dock, like they automatically made

1161
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,880
it top to bottom vertical, just like the Unity launcher is, so it looks like Unity.

1162
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,120
They tweaked a few things to make it look a little more like Unity, so that way it's

1163
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,280
sort of an easier, smoother transition for existing users.

1164
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,160
But here's the great thing, too, is they worked with the developers, they're all on board,

1165
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,160
they agreed this is a great way to do it, and they've been submitting patches Upstream,

1166
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,920
which they are already applying to their code base.

1167
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:16,240
In fact, if I recall, you can actually find canonical, yeah, so they've done an Upstream

1168
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,200
branch that has all of their own modifications, and they're gonna regularly rebase on top

1169
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,720
of the Upstream Dash to Dock to keep everything basically cozy.

1170
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Yeah, so it's a fork that's different but compatible.

1171
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,640
It's an Upstream fork, they're working with the developer, and what I love about it, which

1172
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:40,920
I think is so awesome, is the settings are, like you can invest in one Dock and then switch

1173
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,640
out and you don't lose all of your special settings.

1174
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,960
And they say also the probably most important, unvisible, the thing that you can't really

1175
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,880
see is the fact they use a different extension ID, because that makes it possible to swap

1176
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,600
between them, you can stay up to date on each of them without having to worry about it.

1177
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,620
You don't have to uninstall one to get the other one like you have to do on Anagros.

1178
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:04,200
It's like Ubuntu went to them and said, well, we like what you're doing here, but our vision

1179
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,200
is slightly different, but we want to maintain compatibility, so how can we do this so that

1180
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,960
our stuff will work with yours, even if we're doing something a bit different?

1181
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,740
And then the last piece that I really think is classy, that I think all the other forkers

1182
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:24,040
out there should try to integrate, is it's using two things that make it really respectful

1183
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,760
to switching back to Upstream.

1184
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,040
If you install and enable Dash to Dock, you don't have to have it enabled, but if you

1185
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,040
turn it, when you do turn it on, even if Ubuntu Dock is still turned on, it politely just

1186
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,040
vanishes and goes away, and just lets Dash to Dock take over, and then if you change

1187
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,880
any settings in Dash to Dock, like anything that would modify DCOM for G settings, those

1188
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,240
modifications will be reflected in both, that's super smooth, and then you turn off Dash to

1189
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,600
Dock and the Ubuntu Dock comes right back.

1190
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,900
And that sort of classy sharing of settings, using schema overrides, and then gracefully

1191
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,840
bowing out when the Upstream version comes online, I think is nailing it, it's nailing

1192
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
it.

1193
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,520
I think my only question would be, is there an option to actually disable that sharing?

1194
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,840
Because I can see a use case where some people might not want to share between the two.

1195
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,720
Probably, I'm looking at it right now, it looks like you can turn off the override mechanism,

1196
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,400
so there is a way to turn that off, but I haven't tried it yet, obviously, so I don't

1197
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,240
know.

1198
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,120
And they talk in this blog post, this is Ubuntu Dome Shell in Artful Day 5, I've been following

1199
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,960
these series, and it makes so much sense when you're thinking about moving users over and

1200
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,600
how to do this right, and you look at it in the totality, you look at the Upstream fixes

1201
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,540
to Bluetooth, why is a thousand things they found in this development cycle for this one

1202
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,640
version of their distro?

1203
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,640
What's going on?

1204
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,640
Why has nobody else done that?

1205
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,920
This video acceleration stuff, the Gnome session stuff, and now the way they're handling

1206
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:58,000
this Upstream fork, I mean, this isn't even the LTS release yet.

1207
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,240
Well, I mean, they're doing all the heavy lifting now, so the LTS will be nice and stable,

1208
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,240
I guess.

1209
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,720
It seems like a very sustainable approach, because by encapsulating everything in their

1210
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,840
own Gnome session, they don't have to worry about breaking or conflicting stuff that people

1211
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,840
want to install different extensions or don't like their configuration but still want an

1212
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,760
Ubuntu base, by modifying this dock to sort of bridge the move over from Unity 7, which

1213
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,700
is the most visible aspect of Unity 7, and it's legitimately the thing that when I sit

1214
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,360
people down in front of Unity 7, they click with immediately, is that sidebar, and to

1215
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:36,800
do it like this, I don't know, I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to trying out 1710.

1216
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,800
I am very excited about this release.

1217
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:45,160
I got to say, it's maybe the most excited I've been in eight years of releases.

1218
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,920
I mean, I got to go back quite a way to get this excited about an Ubuntu release again,

1219
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,840
and it's all going Upstream.

1220
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:58,000
I think it's always been something that I respect about Ubuntu, is that rather than

1221
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,920
look at what is the quickest way to do this, they say what is the best way to do this,

1222
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,200
except now it's being applied to other Upstream projects instead of them rolling their own

1223
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
stuff.

1224
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,480
What I was surprised by was how popular the survey was for docks, because I was just saying

1225
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,240
last week, I'm kind of over docks.

1226
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,880
I'm just sort of done with them, but you look at all of the results, and they're right.

1227
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,400
They link to it.

1228
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
People want docks.

1229
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,280
People want to use a dock.

1230
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,280
I don't know.

1231
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,440
For me, you put a bar down at the bottom of the screen, put the clock in there, put the

1232
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,280
tray icons in there, and call it good.

1233
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,280
I mean, aren't the bars just really docks without animations?

1234
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
I suppose.

1235
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,760
One of the things I like about the Budgie desktop is I can now put this bar on my side

1236
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:51,560
screen, and I suppose if you've got extra sides room on these 16 by 9 screens than you

1237
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:58,360
do on the bottom, so there's that reason for it, but anyways, good post.

1238
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,640
Lots of other stuff in there.

1239
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,760
Link in the show notes, but want to talk about one more thing before we get to something

1240
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,160
that is going to ruin the life of any Star Trek fan.

1241
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,520
There is a proposal by your good friends over at Mozilla about turning on data collection

1242
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,800
in the Fox.

1243
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,120
Now I want to be clear about this.

1244
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:26,440
This isn't like creepy data collection, and they are starting very gracefully.

1245
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,200
They fully admit that they really don't have enough data on their users right now.

1246
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,160
They need more data about the types of sites they go to, the type of browsing they do.

1247
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,880
Are they using Flash?

1248
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,080
Are they seeing a lot of junk?

1249
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,960
How are the load times?

1250
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,920
And so what Firefox wants to do, what Mozilla wants to do, is they want to use a privacy

1251
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:58,780
project that allows them to collect data, but does it in a way that anonymizes essentially

1252
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,240
the data using something called differential privacy.

1253
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:09,400
So I believe the project is Rappor, Rapper, R-A-P-P-O-R, I think it's spelled.

1254
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:16,000
And it's a project that Google works on, and it uses differential privacy, which sends

1255
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,120
bogus data and real data, and then it's just sort of supposed to all work out in the wash

1256
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,000
if you have enough users.

1257
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,120
And they would install this, and they would anonymize the reporting, and then you would,

1258
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,100
along with good reports, you would also be sending them completely crap stuff, which

1259
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,320
is a weird approach.

1260
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,000
But the idea is that the average is more good, and then if you look at that data, you get

1261
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
something.

1262
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,920
But so the theory behind it is they can't even use your habits to try to narrow down

1263
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
who you are.

1264
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:51,820
Now, initially, they're thinking about rolling this out as a opt-in to try it, but if they

1265
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:57,960
decide to implement it, it's going to be turned on by default, and that's the part that's

1266
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,720
really getting people pissed off.

1267
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:07,320
Yeah, it's interesting that they're bringing this up so soon after the whole, the privacy

1268
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,760
concerns with the plugin stuff.

1269
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,840
Yeah, I thought the timing on this was kind of weird for, like that was just a couple

1270
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
weeks ago, wasn't it?

1271
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,540
From like a, so when you're down and out, and you know, you're getting your ass kicked

1272
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:24,600
in the, you know, you just get kicked all over, I mean it's bad man, you get your ass

1273
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,840
kicked on the ratings, I mean on the usage numbers, is that the time to launch a hey

1274
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,400
we want to spy on you campaign?

1275
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,000
I mean, I guess it depends on whether you consider it spying or not.

1276
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,360
I don't, WW, what do you think?

1277
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,120
Differential privacy is kind of the new hotness, Apple says they're going to use it in future

1278
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:49,520
IOSs to anonymize data reporting, Mozilla says they need the data, what do you think

1279
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,520
about this?

1280
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,480
I think this should be an optional thing, it should be popping up when you first set

1281
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:01,080
up Firefox, it should be hey, we want to do this, and we want your consent, and the thing

1282
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,160
that I don't see with a lot of tools is that they don't give you an option to control the

1283
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,040
data, so like, what's the, like.

1284
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,960
You could, you can turn it off, you can turn it off, see.

1285
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:17,160
Yeah, it should be upfront, they should be going, oh we're turning this off by default,

1286
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,680
you know, just kind of like when there's telemetry, you know, it's on by default, oh, this patch,

1287
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,360
it's like at what cost, you know.

1288
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:31,200
I'm kind of on the opposite side of the fence with that though, because for usage analytics

1289
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,480
to be useful, you need a large amount, and most people are just probably going to click

1290
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,720
no.

1291
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,960
I think they're going to, I think if they do this, they're going to bury the setting

1292
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,760
probably in like a privacy tab inside settings, I don't think they would give you a pop-up

1293
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,080
because of that reason, and I think that's why they, because they say currently we can

1294
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,560
collect this data when the user opts in, but we don't have a way to collect unbiased data

1295
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,100
without explicit consent, and so the problem that they're seeing is they're getting biased

1296
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:04,400
data by people who are willing to opt in, and so they've got to solve that particular

1297
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,760
problem and they're trying to use differential privacy to justify monitoring everyone.

1298
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,160
And apparently the project they're using, the Google or whatever, apparently it's the

1299
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:18,040
most widely distributed usage of differential privacy.

1300
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Yeah.

1301
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Yeah.

1302
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:27,960
It probably would vary about config probably if they were to do or have that option though.

1303
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:35,680
I mean, I don't really get the objection to truly anonymized usage statistics.

1304
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,840
Like I can understand if you can be tied to it, but this seems like a pretty full-fledged

1305
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,920
implementation of we're trying to anonymize this as much as humanly possible.

1306
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,400
And you know it's data that Google and Apple are getting.

1307
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Yeah.

1308
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,120
So, and their competitors are getting it.

1309
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,120
Yeah.

1310
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,760
What about, you know, years ago I used to think about this, I don't think about it anymore,

1311
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:03,160
but doesn't collecting all of these metrics and having data collection points at every

1312
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,600
little end of the application slow down the application?

1313
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,480
Doesn't collecting this stuff in the background and uploading it constantly slow down the

1314
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,480
network?

1315
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,480
I mean, what the hell?

1316
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,520
I mean, it can't be a lot, but damn, I mean, I want this shit to be as fast as possible.

1317
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,740
It's just so frustrating.

1318
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,880
But I know that's neither here nor there.

1319
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
They say they-

1320
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:25,120
Do you remember when Ubuntu had the Amazon scopes and people got obsessed?

1321
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,880
It's kind of like that because with that you had the option of totally turning it off and

1322
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,880
that's fine.

1323
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,720
Or maybe on one system I had it on to if I was looking at Amazon or buying some things,

1324
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,720
you know.

1325
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:44,040
I can understand the objection to the Amazon scopes way more though, because it was directly

1326
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,160
tying to individual users.

1327
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,040
And the initial implementation wasn't all that secure either.

1328
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,040
Yeah, that too.

1329
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
So that definitely led to it.

1330
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,160
But Minimac, you say it's sort of like equivalent to submitting a crash report.

1331
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Yeah.

1332
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,880
I think if I remember well, if you first start Firefox with a new profile, you get a little

1333
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,160
note at the bottom of the page which says, decide what you share.

1334
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,920
And if you click on it, you see that the health and crash report is enabled by default and

1335
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,560
you can disable it.

1336
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:17,560
So I guess they just add another option for your personal data collection.

1337
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,160
Or it might just be another line in that paragraph even.

1338
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Yeah.

1339
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:27,040
That to me has way more potential to tell what you're doing with your browser than this

1340
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,560
other stuff because you can get URLs and stuff in crash reports.

1341
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,340
So they're validating this right now or they're about to.

1342
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,340
They're about to.

1343
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:38,600
They're doing an opt-out shield study, they say, to validate the implementation of this

1344
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,440
differential privacy project.

1345
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,760
The study will collect the value of users' homepage, which is that tile page that they

1346
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,280
think is so important it's worth selling advertising on, the one that I spend exactly half a second

1347
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
looking at once a day.

1348
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,160
So they're gonna collect how much you guys click on those tiles and they're gonna select

1349
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,700
a random group of their release population.

1350
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,520
And they hope to launch mid-September, which isn't that around the time?

1351
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,960
And then in November, you have 57.

1352
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,000
You gotta wonder if this isn't gonna ship in 57 because they expect that one to get

1353
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,600
a lot of downloads, I'm sure.

1354
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,600
Yeah, maybe.

1355
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:17,040
57's the, not only is it gonna, like the accumulation of a lot of their different projects, but

1356
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
it's also the new UI.

1357
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Yeah.

1358
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,040
It's gonna get all the attention.

1359
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,320
If it's not in 57, it'll almost definitely be in 58.

1360
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,320
Yeah.

1361
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,760
So they're gonna launch their test pilot soon.

1362
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,700
Speaking of privacy, Plex really stepped in it over the weekend and they've backpedaled

1363
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,320
a bit already since we've recorded this, but they announced that they were going to launch

1364
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:43,040
a data collection process that wouldn't really report on the files in your library, but would

1365
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,140
give them all kinds of metrics and you couldn't turn it off.

1366
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:53,500
So they're upping their privacy policy and they're retracting on some of that.

1367
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,020
But I gotta tell you, I saw a lot of angry comments from the audience who said they're

1368
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,880
trying out MB after this, so check out some of our past episodes on MB if you're looking

1369
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,880
for an alternative.

1370
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,520
Honestly, to me it seems kind of like the same situation, because it wasn't about them

1371
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,040
collecting data on your files, it was collecting usage statistics again.

1372
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,040
Yeah.

1373
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,400
Well, a lot of people are watching pirated content on Plex.

1374
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,840
And I feel like a lot of people will probably go in there and turn that off specifically,

1375
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,400
so they're not getting the usage statistics that they want.

1376
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,880
So they've been pretty clear now after this release that they have no way of tracking

1377
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:35,160
which files you're playing unless you use a client that talks to a cloud service to

1378
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,740
initiate playback.

1379
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:42,660
So if you're using an Echo or a third-party app that uses the Plex Cloud API to start

1380
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:47,160
a file on your Plex server, in that case they do have logs of which file you're starting.

1381
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,880
I like that they actually made that clear.

1382
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,640
They said if you're just using the Plex app on your phone or on the TV or on your web

1383
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,920
browser and you're watching the latest episode of Game of Thrones, they didn't say that,

1384
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,560
I'm putting that part in.

1385
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,560
They don't know.

1386
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,160
They don't know what file you're watching, they just know you're watching content, basically.

1387
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,720
Don't know, man.

1388
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,240
I'm getting really...

1389
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
I feel like I'm getting privacy bankrupt.

1390
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,840
That's what it is.

1391
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,360
In one or two instances, I'm okay with this.

1392
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,680
I made this compromise when I put Echo dots in the studio.

1393
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,360
Well, see, the problem is all of-

1394
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,000
But in the totality, I'm getting sick of it.

1395
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,320
All of these different developers, they need statistics on how their stuff is used to make

1396
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,320
their products better.

1397
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,320
Yeah.

1398
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
I know.

1399
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,600
I guess the first 30 years of making software where they didn't have always-on internet-connected

1400
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,320
machines constantly sending back metrics, somehow they still managed to make good software.

1401
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,800
Do you think software was good?

1402
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,040
Yeah, actually, in some ways, I think it was better than it is today because it didn't

1403
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,200
have so many damn interdependent connections.

1404
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,120
I guess I agree.

1405
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,960
I understand this is a hard problem.

1406
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:56,400
We need to know what episodes are downloaded, although we don't track beyond the number.

1407
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,240
I really hate to see Plex going down this path, and I hate them doing it ham-fisted,

1408
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,960
and the fact that they've had to make this big, huge public retraction is embarrassing

1409
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,960
for Plex.

1410
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,320
And honestly, I think in some ways, because we don't collect more information, we're

1411
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,000
disadvantaging ourselves, but we do that consciously.

1412
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah.

1413
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,080
Wouldn't it be interesting if we had...

1414
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,080
If there was some way...

1415
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,120
And I don't know how you would have this.

1416
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,240
If there was some way we could know exactly how many new users use Linux versus how many

1417
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,000
computer experts use Linux?

1418
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,320
Or even stuff like being able to track what part of the show people watch.

1419
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,880
Yeah, YouTube gives you that.

1420
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,580
Yeah, but that's a limited subset of our audience.

1421
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,760
It's a very small subset, so it's kind of...

1422
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,600
I mean, you can draw some conclusions from it, but it'd be...

1423
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,760
There's so much more data out there if you could get all of it.

1424
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
Yeah.

1425
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
Yeah, that's what...

1426
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,120
You could tell our content to what people want without having to poll them for what

1427
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
they want.

1428
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,760
That's what big advertisers have been trying to get different podcast apps to start collecting

1429
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,660
data, which is a creepy, slippery slope in my world, because to me, there's other ways

1430
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,380
of sussing that out besides getting playback locations.

1431
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,220
You can tell by feedback from the audience, what they respond to.

1432
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,880
You can tell by all that.

1433
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,880
There's all kinds of ways to get that.

1434
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,560
But the problem with that is you're gonna get that biased feedback.

1435
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,560
I guess.

1436
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,680
But really, I mean, built-in metrics to everything we use, it feels like I'm getting nickel and

1437
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,600
dime to death with my privacy.

1438
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,760
I mean, you really don't care that every app you almost use today...

1439
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,760
Think about it.

1440
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,520
Every app we pretty much use today is sending back usage data.

1441
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,040
Doesn't really bother me, to be honest.

1442
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:33,920
I mean, as long as they're not using something to try to track me down specifically, I don't

1443
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
care.

1444
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,920
Hmm.

1445
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,840
I draw the line at health information or stuff around my house.

1446
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,960
I don't really like them collecting when certain things turn on or off.

1447
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,560
That kind of stuff feels like it's too far.

1448
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,240
That definitely is too far.

1449
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,240
That's where things are going, though.

1450
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,640
Well, I mean, it depends on what you choose to support.

1451
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,640
Yeah.

1452
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,160
Anyway, Mumbo, any thoughts on the Plex data collection, Firefox data collection, or the

1453
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,600
topic of data collection in general?

1454
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,000
I know it's gotta be on some of your minds, because just everything...

1455
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,400
Are you guys feeling this, like nickel and dimed privacy death here?

1456
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:11,480
The thing is, for me, is I understand that projects have to have some way to monetize

1457
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,760
and some way to get this information.

1458
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:23,460
Going about it like a jealous boyfriend or someone that's gonna key log you to see what

1459
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,520
you're doing is not the way to go about it.

1460
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:32,880
You can talk to people, have a discussion with people that use your software, and make

1461
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,840
it so they can actually use the software.

1462
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:44,440
I really want companies, or if I had my own company, I would make it so users had an option

1463
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,840
to see what data we're using, and when they want, delete it.

1464
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,160
You have to have some kind of level of respect for people that are giving up this privacy

1465
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,600
for these services.

1466
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,800
Okay.

1467
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,000
That's a great point, WW.

1468
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,360
Let's take that the next step, say, okay, they need this somehow, plus some of them

1469
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,400
can monetize it, so it's a way to fund future development.

1470
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,800
If we hold those things true, and for sake of argument, we accept that differential privacy

1471
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,560
is legitimate, and that this project that Mozilla's using from Google is also legitimate,

1472
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,160
is that the right compromise then?

1473
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,160
Is the beard right?

1474
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:24,960
Like, okay, you can collect your data, but use differential privacy to fuzz it, and still

1475
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,120
give me the option at the end of the day to turn it off.

1476
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,600
It's gonna be on by default, but it's fuzzed, and you can turn it off, and is that sort

1477
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,640
of a good enough compromise for you, because it gives Firefox the data they need, it lets

1478
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,720
them make a better product, it lets them know where to focus development, but it is at least

1479
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,480
using differential privacy.

1480
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,840
It depends, like, how is this going...

1481
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,400
Like, the thing is, once you're on the slope, how slippery does it get?

1482
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,480
Yeah, that's how I'm feeling.

1483
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:02,280
Because you have to, like, okay, we know, like, you, me, Rekai, anybody that's mobile

1484
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:09,680
right now and watching, like, we're in techno, like, you're either technologically advocate,

1485
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,360
you're technologically inclined, you work in tech, we know that there's DEF CON, there's

1486
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,080
someone out there, like, looking for weakness.

1487
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,760
You just know that by default.

1488
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:27,400
So to us, we know the covets of such things, but to the average user, they don't know,

1489
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,060
they're not gonna know, they don't care.

1490
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:35,600
That's a lot of what I run into with people I know, or other people, so...

1491
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,600
Default reigns supreme.

1492
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:44,480
See, I feel like, especially in the case of Firefox and this differential privacy project,

1493
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:50,440
both of these are open source, so people can go and see exactly what they're collecting.

1494
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:56,280
This is actually rare, not probably super common, but thank God.

1495
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,040
I mean, really, if you're really super worried about it, there is an escape hatch here for

1496
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,040
you.

1497
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,040
You're right.

1498
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,200
And it does look like it's a legitimate project, it does seem to be very popular, it does have

1499
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,920
a lot of contributors, and Google is a main sponsor of it.

1500
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:14,360
Google obviously has skin in the game to create ways to monitor people that doesn't get them

1501
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,360
in trouble.

1502
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,520
It's probably how they watch students.

1503
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,480
Especially with recent EU lawsuits.

1504
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,080
How much you want to bet this is what they use for Google apps, to say that they're not

1505
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,800
specifically tracking you, but they're still collecting metrics.

1506
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,520
That's probably why they...

1507
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,520
They are so creepy.

1508
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,080
All right, well, let's take a moment, because I'm so excited.

1509
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,680
In fact, there's something that happened to me this week, besides the solar...

1510
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,680
This might be more...

1511
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,680
Boy, that's...

1512
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,860
Let's see.

1513
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:43,560
Seeing celestial objects line up in the sky in front of me and be in the path of the shadow

1514
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,060
of heavenly bodies is a big event to happen to a person.

1515
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,960
But stage nine also happened to me this week, and I'm going to tell you about stage nine,

1516
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,000
which may have a more long-lasting impact on me, and more importantly, you.

1517
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,960
But first, let's talk about making yourself better before we kill all of your time.

1518
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1519
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,200
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

1520
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,200
It's a platform to learn all about Linux.

1521
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,880
They've just expanded on some of their AWS stuff just recently.

1522
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:18,080
And I think for me, I would have killed for something like this, because I really suffered

1523
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:22,320
from anxiety of, I got to go to this client, and I have got to go do this thing that we

1524
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,320
just...

1525
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,160
Our sales guy just told them I knew how to do, and I've done it maybe once, two years

1526
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,160
ago.

1527
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,640
And that's where these hands-on labs for me were just...

1528
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,720
Boy, that'd be a game changer.

1529
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,480
And now, just giving me just the ability to experience it, such a great feature.

1530
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,240
If they only did this, Linux Academy would be worth it.

1531
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1532
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,320
Of course, they have so many more features.

1533
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,400
You know, Chris, I'm going to take a different tack with this.

1534
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
Go for it.

1535
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,840
I mean, you took the whole nice business angle.

1536
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,320
Me, I'm going to say that you can become a Linux genius in your underwear.

1537
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,800
Well, that's definitely true.

1538
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,440
I mean, you think about it, what better way to become a genius on something than in your

1539
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
underwear?

1540
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Exactly.

1541
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Because you're not distracted by all those scratchy clothes.

1542
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,960
The best way to learn is no pants.

1543
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,480
I completely agree.

1544
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:10,320
No pants and just the right temperature, the music you like going, I think it's maybe

1545
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,320
light a candle.

1546
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,320
I mean, I'm not going to judge you.

1547
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,880
They also have self-paced in-depth video courses in every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

1548
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,800
They have instructor mentoring, you know, humans that are available to help you.

1549
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,160
In fact, one of those humans is in Seattle right now.

1550
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,520
They have a course schedule that works with your busy schedule.

1551
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,000
They have flashcards that get forked by the community.

1552
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,400
They have cert training that goes right into courses for like a path to get a certification.

1553
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,600
And I really think that if you want something that is sort of scratching that podcast itch

1554
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:46,240
and that sort of audio book itch, their content you can download and listen to offline is

1555
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,280
perfect for that.

1556
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,280
So let me be clear.

1557
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,680
You're telling me that I can, there's the humans doing this and not Elon Musk style

1558
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,680
AI?

1559
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,680
This is what they do.

1560
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
This is what they do.

1561
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
They're all about it.

1562
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
They're all about it.

1563
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,680
In fact, if you check out their Twitter feed, you'll see some of that.

1564
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,680
Linux Academy com.

1565
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,540
Also, they were just honored to be one of the companies included on the 5,000 list of

1566
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,440
fastest growing companies.

1567
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,120
Have you seen this at Inc 5,000?

1568
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,400
I just saw this on their Twitter feed and I pulled it up right here on the show.

1569
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,580
Inc.com, Linux Academy.

1570
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,680
Look at that number 78 on the-

1571
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,240
Wow, top 100.

1572
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Yeah.

1573
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,580
That's amazing.

1574
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,580
Holy crap.

1575
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,580
Holy crap.

1576
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:25,580
Look at those.

1577
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,580
Boy, you should go there.

1578
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,580
You should go to-

1579
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:28,580
That must be some pretty big roads to be on top 100.

1580
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:32,060
Here's what I'm going to tell you to do.

1581
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:36,360
We'll leave it as an exercise to the listener to go to Linux Academy's feed, to a Twitter

1582
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,000
feed, Linux Academy com and then look at this link.

1583
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,920
But give me one guess on what you think their three-year growth percentage was.

1584
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,920
1,045%.

1585
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,920
More.

1586
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,920
2,800%.

1587
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,920
More.

1588
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,920
10,000%.

1589
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,920
Hold on.

1590
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,920
I'm not going to give it away.

1591
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,800
I'm not going to give it away, but the link is in their Twitter feed if you'd like to

1592
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,800
know.

1593
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,800
LinuxAcademy.com.

1594
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,000
There's a reason why they've grown like crazy in the last three years.

1595
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,600
It's probably because they've been sponsoring us.

1596
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,620
The Jupyter Broadcasting Effect, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, a free seven-day trial and

1597
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,600
keep us on the air.

1598
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,920
Now this is a self-indulgent moment for me, but it is newsworthy.

1599
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,540
A version for Linux will be shipping today, a brand new version of Stage 9.

1600
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:23,260
Now what is Stage 9?

1601
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,920
That sounds like a Microsoft video blog.

1602
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,360
Yeah, no, it doesn't, does it?

1603
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:37,560
It is a project to recreate the entire set of the NCC-1701D Enterprise from the Star

1604
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,000
Trek The Next Generation.

1605
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,680
And it is using the Unreal Engine 4, which means it works on a lot of graphics systems.

1606
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,520
And if you have a good graphics system, it's unbelievably gorgeous.

1607
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,320
If you're on Windows, it also has VR support.

1608
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,560
The Linux version, ironically right now, is just being held up by packaging issues.

1609
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,120
So remember how we were saying that packaging isn't a big problem on Linux?

1610
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Yeah, it's, yeah.

1611
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,440
I thought they should ship it as an app image.

1612
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,400
Well, I actually suggested a snap, but yeah, an app image would also be really great.

1613
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,760
But they do have the last release for Linux available right now, which is still great,

1614
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,960
still a lot of fun.

1615
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,240
And if you're on the Mac platform, they also have a Metal version, if you want to see what

1616
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
Metal's like, I guess.

1617
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:24,040
Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but you could do that too, if you wanted to do that.

1618
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,640
I think I might have an app to slip in Wimpy's pocket.

1619
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1620
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,360
Well, that may or may not have already happened.

1621
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,360
Oh, yeah.

1622
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,720
That may have already been a thing.

1623
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,440
So Stage 9 is available for Linux.

1624
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,200
You can download version 7 very soon, version 0.7.

1625
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,480
Right here, I've got version.06.

1626
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,800
And it's as cool as you would think, even on my NVIDIA GTX 960 here.

1627
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,800
This is running on Solus with the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

1628
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,800
We'll start here.

1629
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,300
I'll show you the bridge a little bit, if you're watching the video version.

1630
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,300
It looks great.

1631
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,880
And I actually have this on medium camera settings, I can actually turn it up a little

1632
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,880
bit to high.

1633
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,880
Hey, Chris.

1634
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,880
There we go.

1635
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,880
You know what?

1636
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,880
We are under attack.

1637
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,880
Oh, really?

1638
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,880
Do you need me to trigger red alert?

1639
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,880
Yes.

1640
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,880
Okay, standby.

1641
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,880
There we go.

1642
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,880
All right.

1643
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
There we go.

1644
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,880
Battle stations.

1645
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,880
We are now at battle stations.

1646
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,880
So this is pretty great.

1647
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,200
And like I was talking about, if you've got a good graphics card, it's a great way to

1648
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,880
really push your Linux right, because one of the things that is a little disappointing

1649
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,240
sometimes is some of the games can't really push the high-end video cards.

1650
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,520
This thing definitely can, and if I had VR set up on Windows, I would definitely be giving

1651
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,520
this a go.

1652
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,080
Anyways, stage nine.

1653
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,840
A nice way that they hid the loading screens, Chris, was...

1654
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,840
Through the turbo lift.

1655
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah, the turbo lifts are the loading screens.

1656
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,840
I would call out a few things.

1657
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,040
So this shot, it's just a really simple hallway shot here, but the lighting, and this is on

1658
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,640
a GTX 960 on medium graphics.

1659
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,440
It's the last generation.

1660
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,440
Yeah.

1661
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,640
And there's reflections on the metal wall panels that are gorgeous.

1662
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,560
When you come into the main engineering here, there is a little bit of a JJ Abrams lens

1663
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,120
flare effect from the warp drive.

1664
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,400
I don't know if this will come through in the download version, but it supports positional

1665
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,960
audio.

1666
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,240
So when I move around the engine room, the sound of the warp drive changes depending

1667
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,960
on where I'm standing, which is just the coolest thing.

1668
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,080
All of the panels that you saw used, everything's accurate.

1669
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,680
In fact, I've been walking around this ship by memory from the show.

1670
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,760
It is remarkably accurate.

1671
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,240
It is an incredible recreation.

1672
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,960
It's one of the coolest Star Trek things I've ever used, and it's on Linux.

1673
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,960
You know what, Chris?

1674
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,400
You say that, I got to say I'm really disappointed.

1675
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,400
Oh yeah?

1676
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,400
What's wrong?

1677
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,400
It's called stage nine.

1678
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,400
Yeah.

1679
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,480
Where's Deep Space Nine?

1680
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Out right outside the window.

1681
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
Yeah.

1682
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,480
Check this out.

1683
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Let's go here.

1684
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,480
So let's see.

1685
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,480
We'll go to 10 forward.

1686
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
I'll take you to 10 forward.

1687
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,480
So here's the funny thing.

1688
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:52,400
I don't know about this version, but in the version seven I watched in their YouTube video,

1689
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
they have a shuttle bay.

1690
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Hello there.

1691
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Hi.

1692
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,400
How are you?

1693
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Are you having a good day?

1694
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,120
So are you saying that there might be a possibility someday?

1695
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,120
You can take the shuttle out.

1696
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,160
You can take the shuttle out, and you could probably one someday go to Deep Space Nine.

1697
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,160
Okay.

1698
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,160
I'm in.

1699
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,080
So if I go out the window here, I think, oh no, I guess not.

1700
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,800
You can see Bajor, but just right there is Deep Space Nine, but you can only see the

1701
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,280
bottom of the docking because it's above the ship.

1702
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,280
It's all spatially correct.

1703
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,280
This is really cool.

1704
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,280
It's cool.

1705
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,360
But really, we want to go and visit Quark's.

1706
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,640
Yeah, that would be great.

1707
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:26,000
So they have all the different levels on here too, which is just, again, if you're a geek,

1708
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,760
it's a lot of fun if you're a Star Trek geek.

1709
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,320
But even if you just want to push your Linux rig or play around with an Unreal-based engine

1710
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,480
game on Linux, there's a few of them now, obviously, but this one's a pretty special

1711
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,480
one.

1712
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,480
Lots of hidden stuff.

1713
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:43,400
All the cool sets, including the Arboretum, data in the worst quarters, the data center

1714
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:47,280
of the Enterprise, which is a particularly great map on this.

1715
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,760
It's almost, I wish we could show it.

1716
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,960
If you want to see it, check out the full live stream if you're a patron.

1717
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,520
I walked through the data center of the Enterprise in the pre-show, so I'll be posting that for

1718
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,520
our patrons.

1719
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,120
Here's a critical feature question.

1720
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,640
Can you sit down like a Riker?

1721
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,640
Yeah.

1722
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,640
You mean step over the chair?

1723
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,640
I don't think so.

1724
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:09,040
Yeah, I don't think they've added that yet.

1725
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,040
They should.

1726
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,040
There's a few things.

1727
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,680
There's definitely a few nods and stuff like that that are in there, but yeah, so it's

1728
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,160
stage nine.

1729
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:21,600
I had a chance to chat with one of the developers on Discord this morning before the show, and

1730
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,280
I was asking him, what's going on with the Linux packaging stuff?

1731
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,280
What's a hard time?

1732
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:29,240
Oh, well, look at that.

1733
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:37,240
He just legitimately, right now as we're recording, wow, four minutes ago, just posted the log.

1734
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:42,100
If you might be able to help him get this off the ground, they have a Discord server

1735
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:46,700
where the devs prefer to be reached, and that is linked on the stage nine page, and then

1736
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:53,840
he just posted, and I'll link to this in the show notes, their build log issues, and this

1737
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,480
is what's holding them up from getting the latest version on Linux.

1738
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,480
It looks like he keeps getting a lib curl issue.

1739
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,480
Yeah.

1740
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:05,840
Yeah, I'll put a link to that in the show notes, and maybe I'll send that along to some

1741
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,960
of our friends that work in packaging, because it'd be really cool to get this available

1742
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,440
easily for Linux users, because it's a pretty cutting edge thing, and when VR support comes,

1743
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,360
it's going to be one of the few really nice Unreal 4 things that we can try out.

1744
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,680
I know that's not on everybody's priority list, but something about me, the old Linux

1745
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,840
advocate in me, I just don't want to see a slip behind on this kind of stuff, and it's

1746
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,320
so great to see just some fan project like this that doesn't have a ton of time trying

1747
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,400
to make it work on Linux.

1748
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,200
I really appreciate that, and in big parts because of the Unreal Engine, but sure makes

1749
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,200
it look pretty.

1750
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,800
Stage 9, if you want to check it out directly, the website is stage-9.co.uk, and I'll have

1751
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,880
a link in the show notes, and that's where you, at their Stage 9 websites, where you

1752
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,760
can find their Discord channel.

1753
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,120
They also have a subreddit, which, as you would think, which figures Stage 9 on Reddit.

1754
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,320
Anyway, I thought that was kind of a neat thing.

1755
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:00,600
I know you're not a big Star Trek guy, but if I did manage to get the VR set up here,

1756
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,400
would you give it a go?

1757
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,360
Does it have to have the walking component, because I guess that's part of it, right?

1758
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,000
Well, I mean, you can use the controllers.

1759
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
But I don't know.

1760
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I really want it.

1761
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I want DS9.

1762
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah.

1763
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,480
Boy, the amount of work that it goes to creating this, these are every detail down to the materials

1764
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,480
and just like everything, like the stitching to the carpet is accurate, so I can't imagine

1765
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,480
the time.

1766
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:30,040
Just imagine all the time that they had to go through and re-watch all those episodes

1767
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,860
and rebuild these scenes and probably look at concept art and all kinds of crazy stuff.

1768
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:38,000
So I asked one of the developers, I said, so is this a license?

1769
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Is this a license?

1770
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I'm kind of getting at it.

1771
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,520
If this is open source, this is something that people could really kind of get around

1772
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,520
here.

1773
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,760
And the official answer is they're just distributing it as a binary, and there's no implicit license

1774
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,360
they're attaching with that at this time.

1775
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,640
So I would imagine that's all rights reserved.

1776
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,640
Keeping their options open.

1777
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:55,380
Yeah, all rights reserved for the time being.

1778
01:27:55,380 --> 01:28:02,080
But not only is it just an impressive technology demo, because you download this thing on Linux,

1779
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,960
you run it, and now you're in this incredibly gorgeous 3D rendering, which is a lot of fun

1780
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,240
to try out on your graphics, different graphics cards, and seeing how they perform, which

1781
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,940
for me is just a fun benchmark, and seeing how hot they get and all that kind of stuff.

1782
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:17,560
But then to see such an accurate recreation of something that I'm such a big fan of, it

1783
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,900
was pretty impressive.

1784
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,720
And it's been, you know, there's been times, there has been times where as a Linux user

1785
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,720
I was left out, so it was really great that they...

1786
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,200
And these, by the way, screenshots that I'm showing, if you're watching the video version,

1787
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,200
are in-game renderings.

1788
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,200
They even have the battle bridge.

1789
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,240
Speaking of Star Trek and times you were left out, how's Sto going?

1790
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:47,380
So they've moved to DirectX 11 only, and Wine is at a good clip, but Wine is still fully

1791
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:50,400
implementing DirectX 11 support, so yeah, I've had to take a break.

1792
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,800
That might explain my passion for this.

1793
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,800
For jonesing.

1794
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,220
Yeah, because I've been lacking any Star Trek gameplay on Linux for a while.

1795
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,120
If anybody else out there has Star Trek games that they've played under Wine, let me know

1796
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,800
at ChrisLAS, because I'll definitely kill time while the Wine project gets...

1797
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
I know they'll get there eventually.

1798
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Yeah.

1799
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
They'll get there eventually.

1800
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,400
Hey, so want a little more Beardsley?

1801
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,600
Want a little more of the Rekai here?

1802
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,840
Check out User Air.

1803
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,280
He's on User Air every damn week, and we've got a new episode coming out in a few days.

1804
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:20,720
And my old buddy John, who hasn't been on for a while, joins us and shares some pretty

1805
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,720
funny stories.

1806
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,880
It was a great episode.

1807
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,000
We also talked about Linux extremism.

1808
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yeah.

1809
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,480
Also, just a warning, this episode is probably a little bit more not safe for work than most.

1810
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,360
Which is really saying something, actually.

1811
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,360
Yeah.

1812
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,840
Okay, maybe a lot more.

1813
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:36,840
Well, it depends.

1814
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,840
It depends.

1815
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,840
It depends.

1816
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:39,840
I guess it depends on what you're into.

1817
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,840
Yeah.

1818
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,400
So did you have anything you wanted to plug before we ran out of here?

1819
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:49,720
You can just find me on Twitter at RekaiLP or over at Rek.net.

1820
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,720
Rek.net.

1821
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,720
Yeah.

1822
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,720
Or my Twitch.

1823
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,120
I've got to come up with a good name for the vlog, because I'm going to be posting our

1824
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,120
clip story.

1825
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,000
There were some interesting challenges on our way down to the eclipse, so I'm going

1826
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,840
to post all that on my vlog, which is YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

1827
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,840
You know what, Chris?

1828
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,840
It needs a good name.

1829
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:10,000
Chris, I can offer you a free subdomain, hair.rek.net, you can forward to YouTube.

1830
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
There you go.

1831
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
There you go.

1832
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,560
I guess one more thing I'll plug, just because it's been pretty popular the last few days

1833
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:21,720
and it just seems to be growing more and more, is our Discord, Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

1834
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,560
There's a lot of people on there and it's a pretty nice place.

1835
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,320
And if Telegram is more of your flavor, well guess what?

1836
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,320
We got one of those too.

1837
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:35,720
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram and join in the group conversation over there.

1838
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,440
I try to pop in all over the place, in and out, but the conversation's always going on

1839
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,000
even when I'm not in there.

1840
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,720
You can also find Beardsley in there from time to time.

1841
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,400
There's just all kinds of ways to get you.

1842
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,640
It's pretty good.

1843
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,800
Alright everybody, well thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode.

1844
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,720
Hopefully Mr. West's car troubles are all fixed.

1845
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,760
We've got to get him a Linux running car, so the Linux powers, it doesn't break down

1846
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,760
on him.

1847
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,760
Because I'm sure that would solve all of his problems.

1848
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,480
And for people looking for a tech snap after they finish watching LUP.

1849
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,480
Oh, that's coming.

1850
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,480
Yeah.

1851
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
It's just going to be a little bit.

1852
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,480
Yeah, a little bit.

1853
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:27,560
Alright, we'll see you next week.

1854
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:48,280
Alright, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

1855
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,920
Mumble Room, we were small in number, but you guys did great.

1856
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,280
Mr. Fax, I never got it.

1857
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,360
Or Robo, we have Robo the Arms back too.

1858
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:00,640
RoboArm, RobotArm, whatever, I never get it right, but it's good to see you guys.

1859
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,680
Thank you for making it two this week.

1860
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,680
Impersonates it.

1861
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,360
And now let's go pick our title.

1862
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,360
What do you think?

1863
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,680
One more job before we get out of here, gentlemen, before we ride off into the sunset, should

1864
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:10,680
we go pick our title?

1865
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,680
JBtitles.com.

1866
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,600
Well, Beardsley, I was glad you were able to make it.

1867
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,720
Kind of a lower key show, it felt like overall.

1868
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,360
It's a lot easier for me to make it.

1869
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,360
Yeah, that's true.

1870
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,320
Well, you have less car troubles.

1871
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,040
But yeah, it felt like a lower key show, but still good, right?

1872
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,040
It still felt good, didn't you think?

1873
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,040
Was I right?

1874
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,600
If you have any notes, as they say, chat room on today's episode, or mumble room, feel free

1875
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,960
to submit them to us before we get out of here.

1876
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,040
But I thought it was a good episode, just a little low key.

1877
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,680
I think, as with every week, many people are going to hate me.

1878
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,680
Oh, you think?

1879
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
And some people are going to love me.

1880
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,020
Geez, I mostly hear all good things.

1881
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:46,940
People like hearing, people call you, you know, the, what do they say?

1882
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,240
The man of the people.

1883
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,240
The pragmatist?

1884
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,840
Yeah, the man of the people.

1885
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:57,240
I just think it's like people, like I grew up with a net, like when it was really starting

1886
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,720
to penetrate into the public.

1887
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,240
And so my opinions are different than Rekai's, but I love hearing Rekai's and talking to

1888
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,240
him about it.

1889
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:11,160
That's what I love is that I can respect him and talk about him and get more information

1890
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,200
or get links and just process him more.

1891
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,280
Sometimes you have to just disagree and move on.

1892
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,280
Yeah, I agree.

1893
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,280
Yeah, exactly.

1894
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,280
We need a lot more of that.

1895
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,280
We need a lot more of that.

1896
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,240
How young do you think I am that he doesn't think I was around when the internet was new

1897
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,240
too?

1898
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,240
I mean, thank you.

1899
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,520
I'm like five years older than Chris, so.

1900
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,280
Fair enough.

1901
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:36,200
So what about, so Privacy Bankruptcy by Token Ring is good.

1902
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,080
It's in competition with Windcloud's Cry, which is also good.

1903
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,560
We could also jazz it up and we could say Mozilla's Privacy Bankruptcy.

1904
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,560
No?

1905
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,560
Okay.

1906
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,560
Too jazzed?

1907
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,560
Firefox?

1908
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:52,560
I don't like Privacy Bankruptcy myself.

1909
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,560
Wow.

1910
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,520
Of course, I was also taking the opposite opinion.

1911
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,800
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com.

1912
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,000
Windcloud's Cry?

1913
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
It rains.

1914
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,880
What's that in reference to?

1915
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,600
Specifically?

1916
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,240
I would imagine Mozilla not have enough data.

1917
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,440
Or maybe the backups.

1918
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,160
I think more of the backups.

1919
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:24,120
So I guess it multi.

1920
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,800
It sort of covers both, which is kind of good.

1921
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,120
That always kind of, you know, I'm going to toss a boat in for Windcloud's Cry.

1922
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,120
I'm going to give it a boat.

1923
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,120
I'm going to give it a, now we're.

1924
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,480
I also kind of like Forks Done Right.

1925
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,640
Forks Done Right is good too.

1926
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,480
WW coming with it.

1927
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
Oh man.

1928
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,480
All right.

1929
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,400
So we got to do some consolidated voting because we got a bunch of really good contenders

1930
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,400
here at the top.

1931
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,400
So everybody head over.

1932
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,400
Do me a solids.

1933
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:54,200
Oh, how about how to measure off Fox?

1934
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,520
Windcloud's Cry currently leading.

1935
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,520
JBtitles.

1936
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,520
JBtitles.

1937
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:03,120
So now that I'm back on Solus, I have the actual Spotify desktop client installed again

1938
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:06,840
for like the first time in a while because that shit definitely broke at Anagros months

1939
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,840
ago.

1940
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:18,280
So yeah, someone earlier was having trouble with tap to click or something in me.

1941
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,280
The problem.

1942
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,280
What's that?

1943
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,000
The tap to click is always a problem.

1944
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,360
So Forks Done Right and When Clouds Cry are tied now.

1945
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,440
Forks Done Right was probably the most energetic time of the show.

1946
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,520
Tell you what, Chris, how to measure a Fox is climbing up there.

1947
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,520
Jeez.

1948
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,360
That's I like the way it looks on the screen.

1949
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,360
Yeah.

1950
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,360
JBtitles.com.

1951
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,360
So we got to break out.

1952
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,360
We got to break out.

1953
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,360
Oh, God, you guys.

1954
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,600
Are you guys are you guys screwing with me because that was happening right now because

1955
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,520
we have we have a tie.

1956
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,280
Ah, I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1957
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,800
Forks Done Right pulling ahead with one boat right now.

1958
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,560
We need like a timer.

1959
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,680
Alexa.

1960
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:09,520
Set a thirty second timer.

1961
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,520
Thirty seconds.

1962
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,520
No, just she's too stupid.

1963
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,520
She's too stupid.

1964
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:17,360
We need the 24 sound effect for the time counting down.

1965
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,480
What did she set the timer for?

1966
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,480
What?

1967
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,120
This is too stupid timer.

1968
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:28,880
I presume for 30 seconds.

1969
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,120
So she wanted a name for the timer?

1970
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,120
Is that what she meant?

1971
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:37,480
She wanted the time, but then afterwards we named it too stupid.

1972
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:42,080
The thing with the echo is if you don't nail that syntax, it just don't work.

1973
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,080
That's so dumb.

1974
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,920
Anyways, Forks Done Right is pulling way ahead now with 12.

1975
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,640
I kind of like it, too.

1976
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,640
Oh, it's done.

1977
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:54,680
Just do stupid timer.

1978
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,880
That's good, dude.

1979
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,880
Stupid timer is done.

1980
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:57,880
All right.

1981
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:58,880
Good job, everybody.

1982
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,880
We're gonna go with Forks Done Right.

1983
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,640
Why is she still talking?

1984
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:11,320
Apparently she was letting you know again.

1985
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,280
Okay, Alexa, I feel like she's harassing us.

1986
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,280
Alexa, remove timer.

1987
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:21,480
God damn, it's broken.

1988
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,480
Alexa.

1989
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,480
Alexa.

1990
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,480
Stop.

1991
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:38,720
He's not answering me.
