00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I think you should see this.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
It's just a kid.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
This is a G chord.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
He's learning. Absorbent. He's getting smarter every day.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Homo Habilis was the first to use tools.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Losing yourself in the group for the good of the group. That's teamwork.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
It's happening fast.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
We've always watched the stars. If you look at the sky, you can see the beginning of time.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Collecting data is only the first step toward wisdom.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
But sharing data is the first step toward community.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Poetry. There's not much glory in poetry. Only achievement.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Knowledge amplification. What he learns, we all learn.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
What he knows, we all benefit from.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
One little thing can solve an incredibly complex problem.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Everything's about timing, kid.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
This is business. Faster, better, cheaper.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Constant improvement.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
So, you want to fly, huh?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Wingspeed, thrust.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It's physics.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Republica non dominitur.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Plummet. It's all about the tools.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Speaking of that, go back down.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Go back down.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Does he have a name?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
His name is Lennox.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Welcome to Lennox Unplugged, episode 309.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's a big day today, Wes. Huge!

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, we'll get into some of that in the news.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Plus, Mozilla has been labeled a villain.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Villainy!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
For supporting DNS over HTTPS.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
We're going to talk about DNS today in a way that I hope is approachable to everyone.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
And talk about some ways you can implement some of these own solutions that can be very advantageous, have a lot of benefits.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And we'll tell you also what the possible downsides are and what has everybody so upset.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Plus, we have some feedback, some great pics.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But before we get to any of that, we've got to say hello to everybody who's joining us today.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Hello to Cheese, Alex, Andrew. Guys, good to have you here.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Hey, how's it going?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Hello. We have a panel of experts today, really.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
But as always, we're like staffed by what I would consider to be a council of internet experts.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Hello.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
You know, on the pre-show, we were talking about how great it is that we have like a multi-year lug going now here.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And we meet every single week. It's so cool.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And then when you join our lug, you get to be part of the conversation in a show that is...

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
All you have to do is show up and you're a co-host with us right here on air.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
There's a few people that listen to the show and you can be part of that.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
And there's also our chat room that goes along while we do the show at irc.geekshed.net pound jupiter broadcasting.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
And all of our live times over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I bring all of that up to point out that we won't be here live next week.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
We will have an episode.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm super excited though, Wes, because last night I made the plunge to switch to Evolution.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Well, this is, you know...

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Did you see this one coming?

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
No, because it's been months and I thought you would kind of quietly forsaken desktop email on Linux.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, for sure.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
You just moved to mobile devices and that's fine. I'm a web email guy myself.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Evolution? Tell me about it.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I've been quietly struggling with MailSpring.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
It's a decent, it's an electron-based mail application that ties in pretty good with Google Apps, which is...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Now I've got like a couple of Google Apps accounts.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh, so many, yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And that's been nice, but the other day I opened it up and it lost its entire config.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
The JSON files just totally messed up.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
You do not have a high tolerance for events like that, I would say.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And you have a few emails.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, so I messaged Wimpy and I'm like, okay, you and I...

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
He understands my email plight, like he knows my struggle.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I'm like, Wimpy, I know you're using MailSpring, this just happened to me, this line no farther.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
The line must be drawn here.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
What are your email secrets?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
And he says, you know what I'm doing?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
He says, a bit ago, I switched to Evolution.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
And I like it so much that we're moving Ubuntu Mate that direction off of Thunderbird to Evolution.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
And I'm like, Evolution?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I used that like...

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Ages ago.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Maybe seven, eight, nine years ago.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I mean, it's been a really long time.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
It was during the era of Exchange 5.5, maybe the next revision up.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
And I just hadn't gone back.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
And I'll tell you, Wes, I installed it via Flatpak.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Of course.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
And the setup to connect to Google Apps accounts felt very old school.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I had to put smtp.gmail.com and stuff.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Full details, no fancy little graphical icon.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh, you've got a Google account? Let me fill everything out for you like everything else does now.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
None of that. But it does, once you set all that up, it's like, oh, this is a Google account.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, let me import your calendars for you.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And it actually does that really, really well.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Once you just Google search, hey, what are your mail search, you know, IMAP and SMTP stuff,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
underneath all of it, Evolution knows it's talking to Google.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
See, that's smart. And calendar is probably the next most important thing, right?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yes. I am very happy with the results.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I plugged three of my large...

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Just as an example, today, my Jupiter Broadcasting email account has 14,000 unread emails in it.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I was going to say, yeah, you should explain.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
You're working at a little bit of scale here.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
And I re-email every single day. I try to keep on top of it.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And it's just like, and Evolution just handled it like I had to download and stuff, like I had to give it time.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
It's handling it like a champ.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
How do you feel about the interface these days?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Not bad. You know, I had to fix it. I had to fix it.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
What I discovered is Flatpaks won't use your system theme unless you install...

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
On FlatHub, there's like all the fairly well-known GNOME themes.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So do you have to go install it so you can kind of connect to that ecosystem?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Exactly. So I installed a Flatpak for ArcDark.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, well, there you go.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
And now all my GTK Flatpak apps, once I launched them again, all got ArcDark.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
So it worked out.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Now I love the interface because it's flat, it's modern, it's working, it's fast.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It feels fast compared...

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
So Evolution used to feel slow to me.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Evolution used to be what I considered to be a slow application.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
But my...

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That baseline has changed with Electron, my friend.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
When you have a mail application that has 70,000 emails in it or something like that, it really chugs.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And you need, in my opinion, you just need a native application.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Wow. Yeah, you're excited about a native desktop Linux application.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I love it. No, it's great. Honestly, I'm installing it from FlatHub right now.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Because why not? Especially, I mean, it's Flatpak, that's fantastic.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's easy to try and it's classic open source software.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah, you do end up...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
You do end up having to install a theme twice.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
One is the actual system and one is a Flatpak.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That is a little weird, I suppose.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
But today is the big day.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
We've all been kind of holding our breath.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I think some of us kind of were thinking maybe it wouldn't happen.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And there was a crack in the armor in Brazil when the regulators did not approve the IBM and Reddit acquisition.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Nervous little moment.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Oh, didn't... Nervous little moment.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
But today, at least everywhere else, including the United States,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Red Hat's acquisition by IBM has closed.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
They have tweeted out this morning that Red Hat will remain independent and neutral to give customers freedom.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
And they've released a video of IBM and Red Hatters talking together to show their commonality.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So you just kind of just keep looking at me the whole time.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And then we just kind of chit chat back and forth about it.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
But I think that there is a lot of really great affinity between IBMers and Red Hatters.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Each one of our stories is different.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I think I was probably always destined to be an engineer.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And actually, initially, I was very much into math.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So I was really curious, like, how do you go about building systems?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
People like us that when we see something, we want to take it apart and see how we're from the inside.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Some of us got our start at an early age.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I mean, I don't really remember a time where I wasn't interested in technology.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And I actually learned how to read playing text parser adventure games.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
My father rescued a Commodore pet from the garbage.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Shortly thereafter, he purchased this book for me, which was Beginning Basics.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And I was like, this is it!

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And the video continues on for a bit.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to watch the entire thing.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It's a cut of some fairly well-known Red Hatters.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
And some not-so-well-known IBMers talking about their common interests, I suppose.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah, you've got some distinct cultures working just a little bit closer together now.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
The one message that has been so, so super clear, it was crystal clear at Red Hat Summit.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It has been really clear since the communication.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
They have doubled down in every possible meaning of the word on the fact that IBM is going to remain independent.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
So much so now that everyone in the world will be watching to see if that actually is the case.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, IBM's kind of just saying, alright, keep doing what you're doing Red Hat.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Make a whole bunch of money and we have easy ways to work with you when we want to resell your stuff.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh, and by the way, OpenShift all the things.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.000
Of course.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.000
OpenShift all the things.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Do you have any thoughts on that, Alex?

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
I know you have to trade carefully here, but do you have any thoughts on OpenShift seems to be a key part of both IBM and Red Hat's future strategy?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
It absolutely is.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
The acquisition is all about the hybrid cloud and making OpenShift into the next rail.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
So I'm cautiously optimistic.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I really hope that they maintain the culture that Red Hat currently has.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.000
I love it.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.000
I think it's great.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.000
It's very open.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
There are a lot of opinionated people working at Red Hat and that's what makes the company what it is.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
So leave it alone, leave it as it is, and I think they have a good chance of succeeding.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.000
I hope so.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So OpenShift does seem to be a pretty good strategy.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
How do we encapsulate what OpenShift is in a way for the audience that doesn't follow it in a really quick elevator pitch?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Pretend I don't want to buy anything.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's an enterprise distro of Kubernetes.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, with surprise, surprise rel sort of at the core of it.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
When you think about it, Red Hat has this history of taking open source components, contributing to them, building on them, and then packaging it up for real world applications.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, and it's Red Hat recognizing the significant role that Kubernetes is playing in the industry now, which is a trend we've been watching, but more on that later.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
So here it is.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
It's done.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It is complete.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And now we just wait and see.

10:56.000 --> 11:08.000
I kind of take them at their word from an overall global market strategy, where I'm watching very cautiously is at the projects that make the Linux desktop so much better.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Things like Network Manager and Bolt and a lot of the Gnome stack itself.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
The things that feel a little far away from rel server boxes.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
One point on Gnome, though, is that rel ships with Gnome as the default desktop these days.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And then that includes Pulse and a bunch of other low level system things.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
So I don't think it's all that bad, necessarily.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
That's my hope is that because those things do play a part in rel that they're safe.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And I suppose that'll be part of the test too, right?

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
If they really do treat it as an independent agent and Red Hat, I mean, obviously they've been comfortable with that expense on their books.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
They're happy with that contribution.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Kind of a test of, you know, that seems like something a legacy company might like to look at the line item and be like, well, what's the value here?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
It's not how Red Hat operates.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
That's why we like Red Hat.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
See if it keeps going.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
That'll be the area that I think we watch the most.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
The industry will watch like a lot of their sales tactics and for layoffs and things like that.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm going to watch for contributions to projects that don't seem like they necessarily immediately benefit the bottom line.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And Red Hat's at the center of a lot of that.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
In fact, it's one of the stories I wish we told a little more here on the network.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
But it is what it is.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
And so we'll be watching.

12:22.000 --> 12:35.000
Do you think that this maybe frees up Red Hat to some degree to so that they don't have to worry about the money and they can kind of rely on IBM to guide them through the market while they just continue to be Red Hat and do what they do?

12:35.000 --> 12:50.000
I mean, if you look at some of the other reviews and some of the TV pundits and these finance people, you know, they're saying that within two years, Red Hat plans to be on the positive side of growth again after the acquisition and all this sort of stuff.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
You know, I think maybe IBM is just kind of playing that part of it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Maybe.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Maybe.

12:58.000 --> 13:10.000
So there's some acquisitions where the acquisition is all cash and there's some acquisitions where the purchasing company borrows like almost 30 to 40 percent of the capital.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
That's the situation we find ourselves in with the IBM and Red Hat acquisition.

13:15.000 --> 13:36.000
And so for that to pay off, when you consider the interest rate on the money that they had to loan to buy Red Hat, the back of the napkin comments math like on Hacker News and whatnot suggests that that interest rate alone, again, this is just what people say on the Internet, could be 700 million dollars.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
So there is a there is a bit of a pressure to produce, to grow and continue to grow.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Red Hat's on that trajectory already.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
So that's it's a it's a safe bet that that's going to be what happens.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
But even if kind of unspoken, it's definitely sitting there.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
But in the next two years, Fuchsia could launch and disrupt the entire Linux market.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Stay tuned for the next episode of Fuchsia Unplugged.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
We'll have Fuchsia today here where we cover daily Fuchsia developments.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
But, you know, something could come along and disrupt the market.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
But it's very unlikely.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
I think it's a safe bet that IBM is making here, but they do need it to pay off.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It doesn't I don't think to answer your question specifically.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't think it means they can coast and just afford to spend money on things now.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I think it means they need to actually produce to pay off.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Right. This is not like some large company getting some buying some small startup as a bet to see if it really does well.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
This is a serious strategic move for IBM.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Quite literally one of the perhaps the largest software acquisition ever.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Does this mean that open source has won then?

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, I think it means that open source technologies on cloud infrastructure and server infrastructure and on the back end for developers has won.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
And that's where the money is.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, Microsoft made a ton of money for a long time that way, too.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
What a what a what a wild, wild, wild, wild 2019.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
We're going to do a special next week that is a reflection on what all has happened in 2019 so far.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
See if it was in line with where we thought things are going.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Because honestly, I mean, so much we kind of just need to take a little break and assess.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Otherwise, I'm going to not be able to keep track of it for the end of the year.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It's remarkable.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
So we've had our quote research team on it doing the research.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
But also the team here on the show has just been like, well, let's let's think about this ourselves here.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And we look back at 2019 already.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Holy crap. Holy crap.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
Well, this this might not be unlike anyone's list for major events, but it's still something people are talking about.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Canonical's GitHub account was hacked this week.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, it appears a hacker was essentially just creating empty repos.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It looks like like just screwing around.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Nothing actually really got messed with.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
And of course, I think all of the actual jewels are on launch.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, that was the first statement I really was.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Don't worry. This isn't where we keep things.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's mostly just a mirror.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
Didn't prevent certain pundits from claiming that Canonical needs to throw everything out and start all over again.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I can't believe the crap I see.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It is a good time for a security review.

16:06.000 --> 16:16.000
And before he found out about it, Coder Radio host Michael Dominic was just pointing out to me like how important it is to have your two factor off set up for things like this.

16:16.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, what happens is some, you know, contributor somewhere in the chain might accidentally commit their credentials to something and then somebody sees it because there's lots of scrapers to find that kind of stuff.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
And it doesn't take it doesn't take like a nation state.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It doesn't take an expert.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
It just it just takes somebody who can run a script that finds and scrapes and then they can log in.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That's all that happened here.

16:41.000 --> 16:55.000
But Canonical did release a statement saying that they can confirm that on 2019 on seven six of 2019 there was a canonical owned account on GitHub GitHub whose credentials were compromised and used to create repositories and issues among other activities.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Canonical has removed the compromised account from the organization in GitHub and is still investigating the extent of the breach.

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
But there's no indication that anything for the Ubuntu distribution at all has been affected by this because again, infrastructure for that's on Launchpad.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
They plan to post a public update after the investigation that was launched July 6.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Have you heard anything more?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
No, not yet.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
But I haven't heard anything either.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
We'll have to stay tuned for that.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah, it's just a couple of days ago.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
A lot of people talking about it, though.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, I mean, it is it is big news and it's not an event you like to see even if this time, you know, the outcomes were pretty good comparatively.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah, I guess in this case, yay Launchpad.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, I suppose so.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
But right. I mean, like, if it did happen on GitHub, maybe that's a consequence of them not really using it.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
You know, it's not their source of truth.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
So they're less concerned about it.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
But it's just a breach of good practice.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah, my understanding of the nature of the breach was it was a contributor who made an accident, a mistake.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
And when you have a big organization, that's just it's a thing that can happen.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
And perhaps a two factor here played a role, you know.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I'm sure they know that, though.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
We don't need to tell them how to do it.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
So let's talk about the Raspberry Pi, because that also made big news recently.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
And there has been some wonkiness with the Raspberry Pi power source.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
I got to say, Joe Rez right here.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know if you heard of this guy.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
He's a fantastic podcaster.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, he's new.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Upstart.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, I just tuned into his late night Linux podcast.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
First time I ever listened to it in my life.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And he seems to be really on top of this Raspberry Pi stuff.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
He also has this podcast called Linux Action News.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
What do they like cover sort of relevant news stories in a quick and timely format?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't know.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I can't watch their faces talking to a large microphone on YouTube, so it's not for me.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
But my understanding is they recently reviewed the Raspberry Pi 4.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That's my understanding.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Got their hands on it and everything.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
I came across it because he was one of these guys who was bellyaching early on on Twitter about the heat issues of the Raspberry Pi.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
And then later on was bellyaching about the weird charger and how you can't just use any old USB-C.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
And I don't know who this guy is.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
He seemed like a real grouch.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
So I started following him.

19:05.000 --> 19:13.000
And lo and behold, it appears that the Raspberry Pi folks have admitted to a faulty USB-C design on the Raspberry Pi 4.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And this Joe guy must have called it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I just can't even with this.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Maybe a fix will be inbound, but it may have to be a hardware fix.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This is being detailed by Tyler Ward.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
The Raspberry Pi 4 has a non-compliant USB-C charging port and doesn't work with many chargers as it should.

19:31.000 --> 19:40.000
Thanks to the open nature of the Raspberry Pi, Ward was able to discover that the Raspberry Pi didn't design its USB-C port correctly.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
And as you know, Chris, USB-C, well, just a little bit complicated.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Apparently.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
In this case, two CC pins on the USB-C port itself are supposed to each get their own 5.1 kilo ohm resistor.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
The design this latest Pi used, well, they use their own custom design that, I mean, one upside was it allowed them to share a single resistor.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh, good.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
But this is not a compliant design and therefore breaks compatibility with some of the more powerful USB-C chargers out there.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
So there you are sitting with your Pi and you've got this great, you know, really nice, like say laptop charger that I have for my laptop.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I'd like to be able to use.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, you can't because whether your USB-C charger works with the Pi 4 has to do with whether it uses what's known as an e-marked cable.

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
E-marked cables are fully featured USB-C cables with chips inside that negotiate power management, accessory modes, data rates and other communication specs.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
So like this chip must detect something's not right and not supply the correct amount of power.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah, right. So since the Pi 4 USB-C port is wired incorrectly, these smart cables basically just say this is an audio adapter accessory.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
That's what it gets classified as.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Oh, interesting.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And then it just refuses to charge them because it says this is not standard.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's just not going to work.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
So those are more expensive and they come with stuff like laptops.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
That's where you're mostly going to see them.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Dang it.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
I mean, like USB-C was already complicated enough.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
I really liked the words from Benson Leung, an engineer at Google.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
The USB-C guy.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah, the USB-C guy.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah, exactly.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
And he titled this snarky post over at Medium, how to design a proper USB-C power sink.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Hint, not the way Raspberry Pi 4 did it.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, ouch.

21:20.000 --> 21:30.000
Instead of trying to come up with some clever circuit, hardware designers should simply copy the figure from the USB-C spec exactly.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Strong words.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah, you know, this reminds me of the Nintendo Switch.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
It also doesn't have a standard USB-C charging implementation and is a little wonky.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
You've got to be careful when you plug USB-C into the Switch.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, as these reports started to pop around on the Internet, Eben has admitted that, yep, it does appear that this is an issue.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
And I like this quote.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
How about this?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I expect this will be fixed in a future board revision.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
I've already bought mine.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Lucky me.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Uh-huh.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
But for now, users will need to apply one of the suggested workarounds.

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
It's, quote, surprising this didn't show up in our quite extensive field testing program.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Thanks, beta testers.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
You screwed me.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
They just used probably the cable that it came with, I guess, huh?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
That must be it.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
You know, I wonder.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
So we were surprised about this, right?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
We're all like, whoa, a new Pi just dropped?

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Is this a sign it was rushed or was this just slow and they missed it?

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Felt like they could customize, save some money, be clever, and it backfired.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I think that's part of it.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Let's use USB-C because we can do our own implementation and be clever.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
By the way, that suggested workaround?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Just use their charger.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Suggested workaround.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
So beware, if you buy a Pi 4, make sure you get the right kind of charger for it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And that's not that big of a deal.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Or wait for the next board revision, maybe.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
And maybe you'll get eight gigs, too.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Although they say that was now a typo in the manual.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
A typo.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
A typo.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I accidentally typed in eight gigabytes.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
That was also not caught in their extensive copy editing.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
I accidentally typed in eight gigabytes and the board accidentally supports up to 16 gigabytes.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Accidentally.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
And I think eight gigabytes was on its own line underneath everything else, too.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Well, all right.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
There you have it.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
So I'll let you know.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
When I get my Raspberry Pi 4, I think I'm going to put a buntremonte on there.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I don't know.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I should ask Wimpy first.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
But I'm going to give it a go as a desktop.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
It seems actually like, I mean, this is going to be the best one yet for it, right?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
As long as you can stand the heat.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Oh, yeah.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Well, I think in a month or two, there's going to be more than one or two third-party CPU coolers.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
You know they're coming.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Oh, yeah.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
With fans.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
There'll be Air Ones.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
And somebody ought to take a bet right now in the audience.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Somebody should get like a website set up with a pool.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
You know there's going to be a water-cooling YouTube video for the Raspberry Pi 4.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's just in a matter of days.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
So is it 30 days?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Is it 15 days?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Is it five days?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
There's a bet to be had there.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Somebody could win some Dogecoin.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
In the meantime, let's talk about a brand new version of Firefox, which I'm all about.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
I wouldn't normally mention an individual release other than this one has such a killer feature.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
It's such a small thing, but I just wanted to let you all know about it.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
It's now possible to get dark mode in the reader view.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I was hoping this is what you were going to say.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
I actually installed Firefox 68 right before we went live doing this show.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Try it out, this new dark mode, and it's fantastic.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Also, just props to Firefox for continuing to develop their fantastic reader mode,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
which I think is the best of the lot.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
One of the best things about using it on the desktop.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Also, you and I are both in agreement now that it renders pages faster than Chrome.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
It is snappy.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I feel like the UI might be a little laggier than Chrome,

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
but I feel like the page rendering is significantly faster.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
I like that they added a feature where you actually have to interact with a page

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
before they can prompt you for notifications,

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
so it's not just like right there already prompting you for notifications,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
and you can disable having that at all.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
You tell me, wait a minute, that's in 68?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I believe so.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Shut up.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
That is great, Wes.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Oh, man, those notification things.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I don't see it on this page.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I don't see it on this page either, the one we have in the show notes,

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
but I'm going to look for that because between the cookie notification

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
and the I want to send you notifications and oh, by the way,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
can I have your location stuff,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
and then they have some pop-up about their newsletter,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I'm about done with the web.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
I'd like your microphone so you can chat with a Jupiter Broadcasting

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
representative to find the right podcast for you.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Hey, we should probably implement that.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Let's do that real quick.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Also, just a side note,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
we've talked about this more extensively on Linux Action News,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
including where this is going,

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
the Firefox 69, the next release,

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
will be the final version on Android that has extensions and add-on support.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh, that's a big change.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Heads up on that and more details on where Mozilla is taking that,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
which actually long-term is a good direction in Linux Action News,

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
but I don't want to make the whole show about Firefox.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I am getting very excited about it though.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm happy to say I've switched back.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm very happy with it.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Now using Firefox as my primary and Chrome as my secondary,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
which was the opposite.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah, kind of Chrome is, if I can get away with it,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
just sort of the media one.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
I use it for the Chromecast stuff and some of the DRM stuff maybe,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
if you have to.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Chromecast and just a couple of other things that work better in Chrome

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and that's pretty much it.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
But all my day-to-day stuff is in Firefox and I'm very happy with it.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Very happy with the Sync, very happy with all of it,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
and happy in the direction Mozilla is going in general these days.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm cautiously optimistic they're going to take this services stuff

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and turn it into a way to fund a good web browser

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
that has a positive impact on the web.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
We'll see if that's the case.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I know.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
I almost just want to just sort of buy it for a while for that reason alone

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and also get the benefit of trying it out.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I want them off the search sauce.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I don't want them hooked to that search sauce.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
They're valuable and it would be nice to have them be able to stick around

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
and know that they have secure funding.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Just a couple of things in the old housekeeping this week.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
First of all, we have a link in the show notes.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
You'll have to dig it a little bit because it will be a little bit down.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
But we have a Google form to ask for you to submit.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I think it's what, four questions?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I'll pull it up right here because I didn't actually pull it up ahead of time.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, four questions.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
One question.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah, four answers.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Oh, right.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
All right.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
So let me back up.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, jeez, did you make these graphics too?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
This is amazing.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I just saw this.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's beautiful.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
So on the Friday stream, we play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
and give away some games to people that are in the chat room.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That's one great reason to show up live.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And generally, we've just been doing typical trivia.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
But we've decided to step it up and do Linux trivia

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
and open source and free software trivia.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Doing it right.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
And in this game, you need a kind of like easy question,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
medium question, and a hard question.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
It's actually got a scale of like zero to four-ish.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
That's the largest I've seen in the set.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm not sure what the maximum really is.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah, so you said a difficulty.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
But we have a form right now where you can ask a question

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
that the contestant would then be asked

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
and then provide us with the correct answer

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and then a few wrong answers that sound right enough

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
that they could be it to make it challenging.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Am I making sense?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Absolutely.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, so we have the Linux Millionaire form.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
We'll have linked in the show notes.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
And essentially, our ask here is we'd like to crowd source

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
some of these questions that we can ask.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And we could use these on live streams and all kinds of things

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
to kind of quiz people like Linux trivia, history stuff.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I like that we'll have this set up ready to go.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
That's fantastic.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I feel like I'm doing a horrible job explaining it.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But I'm very excited about the potential.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
It's Linux Who Wants to be a Millionaire live on Fridays.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
And we need your help.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Help us out.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You've got great Linux knowledge.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
You've got great questions in there.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Because we want questions that would make even people

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
who have been using Linux a while think.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Do be aware of what difficulty you put.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because we want the easy ones to be easy enough.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
You've got to have some hundred dollar questions.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
What happened to poor cheese on this Friday episode?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
We won't talk about it.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Don't even.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Cheesy.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Don't even give me story.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Cheesy.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
I did include a dime question, though.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
We need like some thousand dollar questions

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
and a hundred dollar questions.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
But we also need like $32,000, $64,000.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
You've been reading LWN for the past 10 years.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Awesome.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
All right.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Would you say that cheese had a hard dime of it on Friday?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
No.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
No.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Wouldn't say that, actually.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
It was funny.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Even if it was wrong.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
It was still funny.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
All right.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
All right.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Moving on.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Moving on.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Link in the show notes for that.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
We have a bunch of updates to cover now.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Linux Academy is doing new positions.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
They have new content launching.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So I encourage you to check out links in our show notes

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
for that as well.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
A new DevOps professional certification exam has just been updated

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
with a new emphasis on the developer tool suite.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
If you don't know what that is either,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
probably worth checking out the links in the show notes.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
They have 28 job openings currently.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
What?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
At least the last time I checked.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
That is crazy.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
A lot of those positions are remote, full-time, full benefits.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Check that out.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Some of them are local too in town.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And then a couple more things.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
Our study group, Understanding Burnout, went live on YouTube a few days ago

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and it's really good.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
If this is something you're struggling with,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
you guys know this is something I've struggled with.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Do you work hard?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I mean, are you a person who has a job?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Well, then you probably have struggled with this.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I can tell you this too.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It sneaks up on you.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And there's some really good stuff.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Hayden?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Is it Hayden?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I hate it when I get it wrong.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Major Hayden.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Major Hayden from Red Hat.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Major Hayden.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I got it wrong once and now I'm like,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
it's like a dog that gets scared by fireworks.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I got it wrong once.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
So Major Hayden joins L and it's Major Hayden from Red Hat.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And it's really, really, really good.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
And then last but not least,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
if you need to learn up on AWS on July 31st,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
we're kicking off another round of totally free study groups.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
It's something we do kind of off air with the community

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
to help people learn up and pass the AWS cloud practitioner exam.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
That's coming up soon.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Speaking of the job market,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
our friends over at System76 are also hiring.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Emma is looking for customer service tech

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
to join her happiness team,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
and she has details on her Twitter page.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'm imagining they have a link too

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
that you could probably check out.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I assume you have to be able to tolerate pink

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
at least a little bit.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
But other than that,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
it seems like a fantastic place to work.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
So check out Emma's tweet.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
We have a link in the show notes.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
If you're in their area, go work.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Emma would make an awesome boss.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
She really would.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That would be awesome.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
And let me tell you, that's a fun group to work with too.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
So that would be a great gig.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
If you want to get out there

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and do a little customer service support

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
in the greater Denver area,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
check out a link in the show notes for that.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
We're trying to get people hired.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
That's the thing we've been doing.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I wonder if you get like an employee discount,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
one of those sweet Thaleos.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah, you do.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Of course you do.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah, get some sweet Linux rigs too.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You'd probably have to build it yourself though, I bet.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Oh, yeah.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
That'd be fun.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
That would be killer.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Something I hope we can do

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is get more and more people hired.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
That's something I hope we can do.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
It's something I feel like if we could meet a few people

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
and we hear a few stories every now and then

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
where people have got jobs through the network

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
and stuff like that.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I love hearing that.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So we'll have links to that as much as we can

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
in the show notes.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And that is over where, Wes?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I'm a little Linux unplugged at that ground.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Slash 309?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Well, I mean, they're all right there on the front page.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
That's true.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
But yeah, we have easy URLs.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
You just put the show number.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
This is 309.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yep.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Links to all that stuff.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
All right.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.000
So this week, there has been a lot of news around Mozilla.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
The ISPA labeled them as one of the 2019 internet villains

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
along with Article 13 and Wes's good friend, Donald Trump.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
So sorry, Wes.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
This has caused an uproar of conversation.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
We're going to skip the drama this week

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and talk about the technology specifically

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
at the root of this conversation is DNS over HTTPS.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
But we're going to broaden that up

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
and talk about some other secure DNS solutions,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
what the current issue is with DNS in general

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and why people are all upset

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
and time providing some solutions you can implement yourself

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
to just control all of this

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
and not worry about different cloud-hosted solutions.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Is that a good summary of it?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah, I think so.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Wow.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
I think it's got some attention

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
because in the last segment of the show,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
we were talking about how we see Mozilla

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
as generally good actors for the internet at large.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
So when you see someone calling them a villain,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
it's a little bit shocking.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
But it does make sense because once you start digging into,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
this is a change to the way DNS works

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
and change always makes people mad.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And right now, ISPs in particular

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
and enterprise admins the world over,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
they're usually the ones who are in charge

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
of where your DNS goes.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
This is essentially it.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
So the core issue that the association has, the ISPA,

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
is that DNS over HTTPS will bypass ISP DNS servers,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
which will then bypass filtering,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
which will put children at risk, hence the villain label,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
because filtering equals children's child safety.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
And I think there's been an added degree of concern,

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
let's say, over this because it's not enabled by default anywhere

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
or really it's kind of just being tested out.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
And Cloudflare was one of the first organizations

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
to really adopt it and have publicly available servers to use.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
And so Mozilla has been working with them

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
in the initial rollout of this technology.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
So yes, by default, Cloudflare gets all your DNS

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
if you use the DOE technology.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Yeah, so Mozilla has been working on this.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Google has as well.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We'll get to that in a moment.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And with Mozilla's implementation,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I can't speak to Chrome's,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
but Mozilla's implementation uses Cloudflare.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
So you turn this on and it uses Cloudflare DNS.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
So the most technically literate counterargument

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
against DNS over HTTPS has been that it enables centralization of DNS

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
and it gives Cloudflare, which people, I would presume, think is evil,

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
more control and more information about what people are doing online.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
So you go from dispersed DNS where it's a bunch of different ISPs,

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
aka Comcast, to it's Cloudflare.

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
And that is technically a valid argument and concern, I should say.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
It's not technically valid, but it is a valid concern.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
We have to, and this is how the conversation I feel I should proceed

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
from here on, is we have to separate the implementation from the technology.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
All things can be implemented poorly and be compromised.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Encryption can be implemented poorly and be compromised.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
DNS over HTTPS can be implemented poorly and lead to monitoring.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
So while that is a valid argument,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Mozilla's implementation, and others will vary,

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
but Mozilla's implementation allows you to specify your own DNS servers

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
if you choose to, it's just using Cloudflare by default.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
And devil's advocate, just for a second, who else could they use?

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Because if you turn this feature on, how many millions of DNS requests an hour

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
all of a sudden does that provider receive?

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Who else could handle that level of traffic and support this service?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Because it's not traditional DNS.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
You're now taking these DNS requests over port 443 HTTPS.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, the flip side is, yeah, Cloudflare's doing a lot of work,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
spending real money to provide this service,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
even if you don't trust why they might be doing it.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
I do think it's kind of interesting, and I think we should make sure

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
we bring our friend Drew in on this,

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
because I know he has a lot of experience in this area.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
You do as well.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I can appreciate the admin side of this, too.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
It is a big change to the way DNS works,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
and there's a lot of techniques that people have learned

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
and are legitimate from just running an internal only DNS server

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
or trying to do perhaps what you consider essential filtering,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
and those techniques may have to change in this implementation.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
But the flip side is when we think of maybe countries

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
with governments we don't like or censorship we don't agree with,

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
we want that power to be in the individual.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
The other part, too, is this could happen all the time, right?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Browsers can already make web requests,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
so this is really just a culture change.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It's not really a technology change.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Yes, it's a new standard, yes, interruptibility,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
but it's not really giving the browser any more power in a strict sense.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
I tend to like to think about this, too, beyond the browser.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
This might be the first implementation,

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
but you could see a future where almost every application

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
has its own DNS servers baked in that it's doing over HTTPS.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Telegram or WhatsApp would be fantastic candidates

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
because a government isn't likely going to shut down Cloudflare,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
because if they block Cloudflare,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
they're breaking the Internet for their users.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Right.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
So what are they going to do?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
If I were Telegram, I'd have a version in development right now

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
that's already using this.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Drew, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this part.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
The thing that drives me crazy as an old sys admin

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
is there's value in having every application on your network

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
using a common DNS.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Yes.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
So DNS is absolutely one of the most important functions of the Internet.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
It's the domain name service,

38:47.000 --> 38:54.000
which will provide an IP address when you give it a host name.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
And that host name could be something local

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
or it could be something on the Internet.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Google.com isn't really Google.com.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
It's a string of octets that you're going to string together

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
to create a web address.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
So you need DNS to do that.

39:08.000 --> 39:15.000
Now, the flip side of that is most people are using their ISPs DNS by default.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
You get a dynamic address when you connect via DHCP,

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
and they tell you, okay, use this DNS address via DHCP.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
So if you want to use a different DNS service,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
you do have to go in and manually make that change.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Or if you're using static IP,

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
you're going to have to manually enter that DNS server anyways.

39:40.000 --> 39:47.000
So realistically, you can do a full network DNS service

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
and not have to worry about doing it in a specific app or specific apps

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
just by changing the DNS service that your router is handing out

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
to all of your devices.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That is certainly a thing.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And I did want to point out,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Cloudflare isn't the only game in town for this.

40:05.000 --> 40:12.000
Google does support it, as does Clean Browsing, CZ.nic, and Quad9.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
They all have DNS over HTTPS support already.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Now, I haven't actually used those.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
I've only tested the Cloudflare implementation,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
but presumably you could get those working

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
if you trust them more than Cloudflare or Google.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Sure.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And we'll talk about here in a moment some ways you could do it yourself

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
on your LAN and maybe even set yourself up

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
so that way you could use one of these technologies to say,

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
if you're on an airplane, get access to the internet without actually paying.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
But that's a different technology.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
We'll get there in a moment.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
Byte, you had a tech question at the top before we dig into all this.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Go ahead.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Yes.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
So I went to a talk about someone who is very skilled with DNS,

40:54.000 --> 41:02.000
and he told that using DNS over HTTPS causes that we need to be identified

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
to get our content.

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
And with the HTTPS, there are a lot of flags that can identify us

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
to get us anonymous.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
So what I'm very curious about is what kind of information is being sent

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
that is identifiable and what keeps us anonymous.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
I actually think this is one of the technical arguments for DNS over HTTPS.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
There is a consideration here of it is more identifiable in some ways

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
because you have more information being negotiated at that layer.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
That's true.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I mean, I would say just go take a look right now.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
There are kind of two competing,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
at least there are two common sort of standards for how this is going,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and that's being resolved.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
You can go take a look at their open specs,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
so go see what kind of data is there.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
And then one of the upsides at least is the rest of it is just standard HTTPS.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So if you're not willing to connect to the site,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
a lot of the big implementations are going to be connecting to services

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
you're probably already connecting to.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
If you trust them for regular web traffic,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
probably trust them for this.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
So when you're dealing with identity,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
you have the advantages and disadvantages of that.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
The advantage for the user is that the identity of the DNS server

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
is also confirmed because it is HTTPS.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
So there is some security you're also gaining

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
when you consider the fact that today DNS is just plain text,

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
and there's no verification of the server that's responding to you.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah, right.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Now, I suppose you could do some things,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
like if you really wanted to try to do some, you know,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
plain text with the dead simple UDP DNS,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
maybe there's some argument there, but you're right.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
The DNS most of us are using right now is just totally plain text.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
It can be man in the middle, it can be messed with,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
and it can certainly easily be logged.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Can you explain to me now, before we go any further,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
where DNSSEC fits in with all of this?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Because I thought that's where everything was going,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
but that was years ago, and it hasn't gone anywhere.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
I mean, I remember Windows 2000 shipped with DNSSEC support.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Well, DNSSEC added ways to be able to assure

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
that you weren't being man in the middle,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
but it didn't necessarily add all these privacy features.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
And then there's also DNSCrypt, which came out of OpenDNS.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
That is also supported by some of these not universal.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And then there's the simpler, arguably,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
some people consider it technically better,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
just using, you know, DNS with TLS

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
and not adding all the HTTP stuff to it.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
And that works, too.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
That's on Android 9, for instance.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
And a lot of these services support that as well.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
I'd like to comment, I saw, you know, DNS over HTTPS,

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
it might not be technically the best or even optimal thing,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
but it seems to have legs, and it's good enough, right?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
It's going to be easy for people to implement,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
because HTTP is, like, the most used protocol ever, right?

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
We have libraries for it in every single language, everywhere.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
kernel already supports it.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
It's simple to interact with.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
That's the crux.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
And it's not really worse.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Yep.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
At the sort of base of it, it's easier for developers.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And that is what will make all of the difference.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I mean, they're the ones doing the things, right?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And it can be done at the application level,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
so Google can have their own verified,

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
secure DNS servers that they use by default.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
And this is years down the road.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
You know, every application, if they choose to,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
can have their known good DNS servers

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
and use those by default.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
It'll all be different.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It'll be radically different, depending on the implementation.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Like, Mozilla has one of the best right now.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Their early implementation in Firefox

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
actually has considerations for, like,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
falling back to, like, your systems DNS

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
to resolve certain names.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
Like, imagine the ramifications of this on an intranet.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Well, Firefox has been thinking about that.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
So they've tried to build in some sort of considerations

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
for, like, when you're trying to resolve local servers

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
on your LAN.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
It's like, okay, don't use DNS over HTTPS for this.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But, again, that's software logic,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
and it's not going to be perfect,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
and we're going to have to work these kinds of things out

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
for a while.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
And it is a funny, interesting case.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
It just reminds us the complexity.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
You know, change was going to come,

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
because DNS did kind of need a polishing.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Yeah.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
It is maybe problematic for some admins.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
But then again, you're right.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
They're going to build in solutions.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
So if you're out on the admin for your employees' boxes,

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
you can also just pre-configure it

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
so that Firefox is installed with your DNS servers.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
So there is some advantages for just end users today.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
Like, if there are reasons you might want to use DNS over HTTPS,

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
a lot of networks may block using your own DNS server,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but they're not blocking HTTPS traffic.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Yeah, right.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Or you're traveling abroad, for instance.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
I've run into that.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And instead of having to go full-on VPN

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
if you're using Firefox, right,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
you would just tick this on, and suddenly all your sites work.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
So we thought, since this is a pretty fun technology

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
that has a lot of possibilities...

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
And it's open source.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
...let's divorce it from all of the drama and potential,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
you know, oh, it could be implemented horribly,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and let's do our own implementations.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
So the crew went off and did different setups,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
from running on a Raspberry Pi

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
to running it up on servers and whatnot.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And, Drew, I know you had some success

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
getting it running on a Raspberry Pi.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
I think you ended up even using Pi-hole to do it?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
I did.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
So I took an old Raspberry Pi 2 B+,

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
so, you know, not exactly a spring chicken here,

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
and I set it up in about an hour.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
It was easy and works really, really well, and it's fast.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
So, you know, first stand up the Pi,

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
and then what I needed to do was set up Pi-hole itself.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
And there are nice, easy instructions on the Pi-hole website.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
We'll have those linked in the show notes.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Now, after Pi-hole is stood up,

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
then to really get this going with DNS over HTTPS,

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
you've got to set up a little daemon on your system

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
that the Pi-hole can pull DNS information from

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
and use that as its upstream DNS

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
before serving it to your devices.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
And doing this with Cloudflare D is astoundingly simple.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
You really just have to pull it down from the Internet,

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
put it in your slash user slash local slash bin,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
and then create a system D service to launch it.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
That's it.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Are you essentially seeding your database

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
with their information, but then future requests

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
from that point forward are responded locally on your box,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
and Cloudflare is just completely unaware of it?

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Or is it more like a proxy situation?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Right.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
So, what you're alluding to is when you have a DNS query,

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
your query will go to whatever your DNS server is defined as.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
And if the local or ISP DNS server

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
does not have that information,

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
it will forward that request to another DNS server to provide it.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
That's how all of these domain names get distributed.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Somebody's got it somewhere,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
we'll keep reaching until we find it,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
is essentially how it works.

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
So, you set up Pi-hole as your locally cached DNS,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and if it doesn't have an address,

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
like say I've not gone to slash dot before,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and I try to go to slash dot,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
okay, Pi-hole doesn't have it cached,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
so it reaches out to whatever you set its upstream DNS as

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
to pull that address down before giving it to you.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
And that's what that Cloudflare D is doing,

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
is it is acting as the upstream DNS provider.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
It essentially opens up a port on the Raspberry Pi

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
for the Pi-hole service to query,

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
which then runs all of these requests through that HTTPS tunnel

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
to pull down results.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I see.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
So, once the result has been cached,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
from then on, your Pi-hole is serving the results.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Yes, exactly.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And that's what's neat, like whether you use the HTTPS version

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
or just TLS or DNS crypt,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
if you think about it, a lot of people are running DNS mask

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
or something similar, maybe just for the caching

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
or you're using it to do DHCP or whatever else.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
When you're doing plain DNS, right?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
You're still leaking that, your ISP can still see all of that.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
If you just make this change, suddenly it's encrypted.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Now, to stay on theme, Drew,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you don't actually have to run it on a Raspberry Pi either.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
You could actually run Pi-hole in a container.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
You could.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Now, I haven't tested out getting Cloudflare D

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
running inside a container yet,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
but there's no reason that you couldn't do that,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
or you could even run Cloudflare D on the bare metal

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
and have the dockerized Pi-hole query that.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Sure.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
We'll have links in the show notes, too.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
So, there's other... Facebook's got an implementation.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
There's a couple of different open source ones up on GitHub,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
so there are a ton of proxies available

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
if you want to start playing with DNS over HTTPS.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
I mean, I could almost see us setting one up as, like,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
let's do one for us just because...

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I want it on my home network now, too.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah, and we have no agenda. We don't care.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
That's really fascinating.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Now, you gave it a go.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
How did you experiment with it?

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah, I just set up one on a droplet

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
and then tried to connect my Firefox to it.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
How did that work?

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
That worked pretty darn well.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
The configs in Firefox is a little bit weird,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
so you might have to futz with that a little bit.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
I know I did, but once it was working, it seemed just fine.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Is there any...

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
It's a little clunky.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
You do have to go to, like, bout config and stuff.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
I didn't notice a ton of change,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
but I was on a nice home connection, so...

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
So, no real perceptible performance difference?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Yeah, it was just fine.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Hmm.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
What kind of investment would you say it is time-wise

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
and steps to get it working on the droplet?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Is it packages? Is it a PPA?

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
I tried DNS script proxy, and I just kind of got...

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Is it a container or...?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
You know, I don't know.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Normally, I try things in the container right away.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
I didn't see one.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I just kind of ran it because...

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Well, it's written in Go, so they just had to...

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Yeah, you just run it.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Exactly.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
That's probably what I would do.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I was curious about configuring Firefox, all right?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
So...

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah. Hmm.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
And I've already thrown the droplet away.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Hmm.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
So, it looks like...

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
I mean, to my count, we've got, right now,

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
one, two, three, or four different solutions now

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
to try to secure DNS, and nothing's really sticking.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I think this is... I mean, honestly, DOE seems like

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
it's going to have the most legs, at least in the short term.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
You know, if Mozilla really does it,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
when we see it actually shipping in Chrome...

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Well, so DOE, again, DNS over HTTPS,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
isn't just a Mozilla thing.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
It is also a Google thing,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
and I think that's something worth considering.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
On the mobile versions of Chrome right now,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
they already support it.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Google is standing up servers,

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
and there is patches landing in Chromium to support this as well.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
You can turn it on now.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
So, it seems like they're kind of behind it as well.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
And if you think about it,

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
it's a good business move for them to help people bypass censorship.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Well, and you were talking about, you know, using it in the app, too.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So, they have a JSON API.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
It's dns.google, and you can just shoot JSON requests at it,

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
and it gives you DNS records, right?

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Like...

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
DNS over JSON?

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Yeah, that's right.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
2019's just lost it.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
It's just totally gone off the rails.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
It's just... I can't believe that's just happened.

51:54.000 --> 52:00.000
Also, I know it does look like a systemd resolve, the systemd DNS implementation.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
It doesn't do HTTPS, but it does do DNS with TLS,

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
so you can get stuff there, too.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
All right.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Well, we have a whole bunch of resources to point people to,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
including client resources, stuff you can run on the server,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
explanations of the different DNS securing solutions,

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
and what's wrong,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
and, of course, the guides to implementing your own.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
We need to set something here at the studio.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
We don't necessarily need HTTPS over DNS,

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
but we do need a good DNS solution here at the studio.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
So, thinking about doing PyHole in a container just for fun.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
And PyHole's great.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
It's got a lovely little UI.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
It's easy to set up.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I like that it also has just a script you can run.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
So, you can run a container, you can run it on a Pi,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
or just install it on your distro.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Geez, you love you some little PyHole, don't you?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Yeah, yeah, I set it up.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I played around with it for a little bit.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
I did notice that there are some issues if you are standing it up on a Pi.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
Most routers nowadays will let you set a custom DNS.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
However, if you do that and still have your router set up to do DHCP,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
you could run into some problems like I did,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
where it's just extremely slow.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
And I think that's essentially because it's trying to find

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
all the devices on the network and it can't.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I could be wrong there, though.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
I probably am.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
Also, whenever you get going, ideally what you want to do

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
is just go ahead and tick the box on your router, turn off the DHCP server.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
PyHole has the DHCP servers built into it.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
Just fire that up, and then Bob's your uncle, and boom, it's off and running.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
And after that, I lit it up and I had no problems.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
Also, if you don't want to affect your entire network when you're testing this,

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
you can just stand up the Pi and then just point your network adapter

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
at that DNS server.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
So, if you actually want to work with PyHole that way,

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
you can do that and maybe you won't get your wife so angry

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
that you brought down the internet.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Just don't even use DHCP at all.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, just bypass that.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Now, one thing that I will bring up is I was talking to Cheese

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
about the issues he was having, and you've got a, it's a Nighthawk, right?

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah, it's a Netgear Nighthawk 7800, I believe is what it is.

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
What I was reading about that is it does not let you define

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
what the DHCP server in the Nighthawk will provide down to clients.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
So, you are having to set it as the router system-wide DNS server,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
which is typically not recommended.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
You want that to be something upstream, but then your DHCP clients

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
get something else from them.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
So, I think that's where you're running into issues.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
If you do have a router where you can define the DNS server

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
that DHCP hands out, then that's going to be a much better way,

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
and then you don't have to move your DHCP to the Pi-hole itself.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
But you do now owe Drew some money.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
He'll have your invoice arrive shortly.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I'll get you some brews.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Sounds good.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Now, Alex, you've been rather quiet on the subject.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
Is this anything you've messed around with using Pi-hole

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
or any of these kinds of shenanigans?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
A little while ago, the guys over at Linux Server

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
did an ad blocker kind of challenge,

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
and we ended up running AdGuard Home, a few of us out of a container,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
and that worked pretty well.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Some of them experienced slowness with encrypted DNS.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
I'm wondering, geez, whether that is the same symptoms that you had or not.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I don't know.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
Generally speaking, though, it's really easy to set up one of these ad blockers.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah, it's really easy, and it works across all of your devices.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
That's one of the really cool things for me.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
Trying to install an ad blocker on Android, for example, without routing is a tricky task,

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
but if you are doing it at the router layer or something like that,

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
then the network level, you're able to stop ads before they even reach your device,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
which is super-duper cool.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Sweet.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Yeah, that's compelling to me.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
All right.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Well, that's fun.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
We have a whole bunch of resources in there,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
but one thing I'd kind of like to ask from the audience on this particular topic,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
if you go over to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
or you could just tweet me at chrisles.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Are you concerned about Cloudflare?

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
I get the concerned sort of vibe from the community, and I feel it myself,

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
but I don't have an articulate reason.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
I couldn't just sit here and Mike can tell you why.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I would love to hear some, yeah, right?

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
And I hate to condemn them just because they're successful.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I don't want to do that.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
So I'd love to hear some thoughts on it, linuxonplug.com slash contact.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
You know, maybe compare some contrasts,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
because as you say, there are limited solutions for general providers,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
so who's a better org to trust?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Yeah, who's another?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Who could handle that scale?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
That's great.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Include that, please.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
But also remember, the implementation is not the technology.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
There are other providers, and you can roll your own.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
That's the beauty of open source.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
It doesn't have to be Cloudflare.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
You can stand it up on a Raspberry Pi, a DigitalOcean droplet,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
anywhere you can possibly get access.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
So it's a cool tech, and you can be in control of it.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
It just depends on the implementation.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
All right, well, as we come in for a landing here,

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
so we're going to turn off the bathroom and turn on the seat buckle signs.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Wes, you got to sit down now.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Always going for that mile high club.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
We got some really good feedback that we need to incorporate right here

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
in the studio, Wes.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
I'm telling you what.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I think this is the way to go.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
It's about wandering windows in XFCE, and it comes in from Peter.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
He says, hi, Chris.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
He says, try installing DevilsPi.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
You use the terminal with X win info to obtain the window stats,

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
like the size, its PID, and then you can use DevilsPi to write a profile

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
about each important window, save each one,

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
and then make sure the DevilsPi daemon runs on startup.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
To fine tune the adjustments positions,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
you can tweak each attributes of each window.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
You could disable the daemon altogether if you don't want it, et cetera.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
But the idea is it solves your window sizing problems,

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
positioning, and attribute problems.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Easy for me to say.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Ah, so you've solved the problem that you created

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
when we switched away from Plasma.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Yeah, yeah, the very thing that Kwin had built in that I love,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
the Kwin rules.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
That's what DevilsPi solves.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Actually, this does look pretty neat.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And it's broken out as a little standalone application.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
We could totally use it.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
And also, by the way, there's a newer version called DevilsPi 2,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
which we'll have a link in the show notes.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It could be worth checking out.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
Because he says here, he's got it really laid out.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
He calls it his perfect tool, and the project describes it even as crack.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
They say it's crack once you get it just right.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
You get all your windows just the way you want them on your desktop,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
even their transparencies and everything, and you set it once,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
and then you hit a button, and it scripts it, and it lays them all out.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Maybe you're finally ready for a tiling window manager.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
You stop it.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
You stop it right now.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
You stop it right now.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Actually, I'll tell you what.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.000
The guys and gal over at Choose Linux, our very own Drew here on the show

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
and Elle are now joining Joe Rez on the unit.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Have you heard of Joe Rez?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Oh, that guy.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
Yeah, right.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
He's sure popping up a lot.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
I'm a fan of the Joe Rez podcast, but that's all I know about.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
I've heard he's got a few other shows, and one of them is called Choose Linux.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
New to me.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
But I do know of Drew and Elle, and they are joining this new upstart

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
in podcasting to discuss an i3-based desktop this week.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Is there anything we could tease, Drew?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
Is there anything you could tease about that that wouldn't be given away?

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Because that, I've got to say, has got me kind of thinking about it.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Yeah, absolutely.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
So with the Devil's Pie thing, that's exactly what I was thinking is,

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
well, you could just do this in i3.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
And if you wanted i3 with like desktop environment niceties,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
well, that's where Regolith comes in.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
And we did a pretty deep dive, and I even contributed some issues

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
to their GitHub after doing that challenge.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So it's a really cool project, and tune in to find out more.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Also a look at Rosa, as well as this really cool game that Wimpy wrote in Bash.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Oh, it's so amazing.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's so neat.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So that's all in the latest episode of Choose Linux.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Well, it might not be the latest as you're listening,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but it'll be sort of in the recent.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Go check that out as well.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I'd say just subscribe, and then you'll get all the episodes.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Yeah, that is sound advice, Wes Payne.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Brilliant.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Chooselinux.show for that, and chooselinux.show slash 12,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
specifically for that one about Regolith, which it does sound pretty cool.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I've got to admit.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
If you'd like to give us your feedback, again, that's linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And give a big shout out to Linux Academy.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Go over to twitter.com slash linuxacademycom and say,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
hey, thanks for your support of Linux Unplugged and at Jupyter Signal.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
We sure appreciate it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Share them some love over there, because it's their backing that makes these shows possible

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
every single week to not only staff an entire team,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
to make these shows ad-free as well.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
That's a huge deal.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So give them some love.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Twitter.com slash linuxacademycom.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Thank them, because I'm very thankful.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Sure am.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Also, go check out all the great shows over on the network,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Tons of great shows.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
User Air is one of my favorite shows of all time.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
If you're not listening, you're missing something really special.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Check it out.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Now, I'll be off next Tuesday, but we'll have a new show at linuxunplugged.com.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Jeez, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an outro.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Barely made it.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Barely made it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Yeah, so now tomorrow, we all got to show up in our wizard robes.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
We're going to have to burn some incense, and we're going to have to really get zen

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
to talk about what-

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You don't sleep tonight.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
You're going to need to just-

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
No, you're going to need to-

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Meditate.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
We're going to need to talk about what has been a crazy 2019.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
We are, this little behind the scenes info, we're pre-recording next week's episode,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
taking the family on a little trip.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Man, am I excited about this episode.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I've been really enjoying doing these specials.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
We just started doing these one-off specials from time to time.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Keep it fresh.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I don't know.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I really like it.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's nice to deep dive.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Absolutely.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Well, I think that that's kind of what you would get from a lug, right?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Once you go sit down, and there might be that topic one day, and it's just DNS over HTTPS

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
or TLS or-

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yeah, it's true.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Sometimes there's a special guest or an interview, and sometimes we focus on an in-depth topic.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Barbecued me some brats last night.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
How were they?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Good.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Man, the JB title thing still isn't working.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
How come that's not working?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Wes?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Geez.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So it's probably just that your browser has it cached, because it was a 301.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Guys, what do I do?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's probably that you're using DNS over HTTPS.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Oh my God, how amazing is it I'm having a DNS issue after this?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That's perfect.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I can tell you the IP address.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That is so great.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I got it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I got it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I opened up a private session, and you're right.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It's working just fine.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
All right, so we got to go over to JBtitles.com and vote.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Yeah, we did, funny enough, have a little laugh.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You know, if I was using our own DNS server, this wouldn't have happened.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That's right.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
This wouldn't have happened.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Or it would have been cached, and actually it would have been a problem for all of us.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
One of the two.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It is weird when you were talking about Cloudflare, because I do kind of feel the same way.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It's very apprehensive about them.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah, bro, but lava lamps.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Anything that's a centralization of power makes me nervous.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Well, so cheesy, who do you have your upstream set as?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Is it Google?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Can you play a little millionaire music as he answers this?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's dime dot dime dot dime dot dime.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
We should confess.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Let's do a little confession.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Wes, do you know at home, is your upstream provider just your ISP?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
No, no, it's almost never my ISP.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Yeah.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You know, I kind of do like Google's resolver.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I find that they, when I make DNS changes, theirs is the quickest.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I've tried Cloudflare's a little bit when they made that announcement.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I was curious to just play with it.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I don't know what mine is right now off the top of my head, but probably one of them is the 8844 Google one.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And then I've used, you know, I've looked at other lists and used a couple other providers in the past.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And I don't mind my local ISP.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm lucky to not have something like Comcast at home.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So that would probably realistically be fine.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I use a mix of OpenDNS and Comcast DNS.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And at home, I use my ISP's DNS because it's a little rural local ISP.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I know the business folk.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
What about you, Alex?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Who are you using for your DNS?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Cloudflare?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Oh, my gosh.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
What about you, Drew?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Who are you using for your upstream DNS?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, definitely not Comcast because that's my ISP.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And I'll be damned if I give them my request.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That's right.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I'm using Cloudflare over HTTPS right now.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You're keeping that setup, huh?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Yeah.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Why not?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I love Drew.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Absolutely.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That's awesome.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
But I have used Google in the past as well.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
There is an app you can download that kind of benchmarks all the different name servers and all that from your system.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And I seem to recall that Cloudflare was the fastest.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So why wouldn't I go with that?
