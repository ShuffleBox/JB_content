1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
We're introducing Chromecast Ultra, our most premium TV

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,800
streaming device today.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,240
Chromecast Ultra brings everything

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,640
you already love about Chromecast,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,680
plus even crisper picture and better performance.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,240
You will now be able to cast your favorite content in up

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,920
to 4K Ultra HD resolution with HDR and Dolby Vision support.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm just going to say, this might be the coolest runs

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,800
Linux of the day, right there.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Right, don't you think?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,440
That's pretty neat.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,800
That is pretty neat.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 165 for October 4, 2016.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
that's full of possibilities.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,080
My name is Chris.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,840
My name is Wes.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,200
I don't know what that means, but I'm going with the Wes.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,120
We're going to find out today.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,580
We do have a lot of possibilities.

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,360
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program,

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,360
major updates from our favorite open source projects,

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,280
at least some of them.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,440
We'll give you a rundown of the news and updates

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,060
that I think you're going to care about,

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,620
including some really cool tools and something

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,320
that I've been geeking out about since Wes linked it to me.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,720
You know it.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,760
Then we'll tell you a little bit more about our trip

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,040
to the Open Daylight Summit.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm going to try to also pick Wimpy's brain

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,920
about his usage of Open Media Vault.

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,600
This is kind of a follow up to an episode

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,840
we did a little bit ago.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,160
And then we have a couple of interviews

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,440
from the Open Daylight Summit.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,640
And this time, since we talked about this in the past,

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,960
we tried to wrap our head around how a major company like Ericsson

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,500
is using it to roll out 5G networking.

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,720
How many Gs is that?

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Five.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,240
And we'll tell you what 5G networking is

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,120
and why software-defined networking and open source

44
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
standards are important.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeah, don't run away.

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,500
Don't run away.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,200
I hope it may be applicable to your life.

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
And then we'll have an interview with Heather and Chris.

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
Heather's from the Linux Foundation,

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,560
and Chris is from Ericsson.

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,800
I think he's also sits on the Open Daylight project board.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,040
And they talk about why the Linux Foundation cares

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,080
about this and a really cool continuous testing environment

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,600
they set up.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Remember that?

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,640
That was cool.

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,360
Yeah.

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah, and that is it's geeky, it's nerdy, and it's so neat.

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,760
So we'll be talking about that on today's episode

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
of the Unplugged program.

62
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,080
But before we go any further, we must bring in that mumble room.

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,520
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

64
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,020
Hello.

65
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,760
Time appropriate greetings.

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,260
Hello.

67
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,760
I secretly use Arch Linux.

68
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,640
Hello, guys.

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,000
It's good to have you here.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,380
Now, I don't know how many of you

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,760
were able to make it last week because I couldn't hear you.

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,520
Oh, I love you, Noah.

73
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,680
But I did want to give a shout out to Noah for episode

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
164 of the Unplugged program.

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Dial up Linux.

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,980
Thanks, Brown Bear.

77
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,360
Yeah, that was great because we were down at Open Daylight.

78
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,080
And just as we were sort of wrapping up,

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,480
I tuned in to the very end of the show.

80
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, me too.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
And I think he was in full swing by then.

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,600
Now, a lot of you have written in and said you loved it.

83
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Some of you have written in and said that, oh, my god,

84
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,640
my head hurts.

85
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't ever change my Unplugged show again,

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
which I thought was kind of funny because it's

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
sort of a no-format show to begin with.

88
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,600
I mean, we kind of have a formula we follow a bit,

89
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
but that's just out of habit.

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
It's about the closest to the actual, I mean.

91
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,360
Yeah, but I thought that was pretty neat.

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,160
Anybody in the mumble room, anybody have any directors

93
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,320
hats that where they were wearing their hat?

94
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
They're like, gosh, from a director's perspective,

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,520
from a production perspective, or even

96
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,760
from a listener's perspective?

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Do you have any feedback from the dial-in episode,

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,280
the call-in edition of the Unplugged show?

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,480
And keeping in mind that I think NOAA would very much

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,180
like to spin this off into its own show one day.

101
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,240
So this could eventually become its own separate additional

102
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,340
Linux program.

103
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,240
So if you have any thoughts on that, too, I'd like to hear it.

104
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
I open it up to you, mumble room.

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
There was only a few issues.

106
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,200
The main thing is that the mumble group

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,080
couldn't say anything.

108
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,200
Right, yeah, there was.

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
And I think he already has that figured out.

110
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,800
So that tech problem is solved.

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
I think he's got like a whole new audio rig to do it.

112
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,720
He went all in.

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,920
Other than that, it was great.

114
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah, I thought what was really exciting about it

115
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,080
is it really could potentially become, well, first of all,

116
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,640
we have a pretty big base to pull from just by people

117
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,920
that email into our shows asking us questions all the time.

118
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,800
And if we just write back, yeah, that's a great question.

119
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Why don't you call in on Tuesday?

120
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
Because a lot of the questions, there's

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
one or two follow-up questions we have.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
You need a little dialogue, and you can really

123
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,840
get to the heart of it.

124
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,360
So there's already a good base there

125
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,200
to pull from for calls.

126
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,880
And then on top of that, the word

127
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,440
could start spreading around that, hey,

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,400
if you switch to Linux and you end up having a problem,

129
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
there's this guy you can call, and he

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
is all about getting people to use Linux,

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
and he will totally help you.

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,640
And that could be a really good thing for Linux.

133
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Probably got other people to do some time

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
on there answering questions.

135
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,640
Let's put it another way.

136
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,520
The business side of Linux was interesting to me.

137
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
Yeah, that's true.

138
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Now let's put that, here's another way to think of that.

139
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,320
Imagine when you switch somebody to Linux.

140
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,040
There could now be a support number

141
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
that you could give them for them to call

142
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,520
when they have problems.

143
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
That would be pretty nice.

144
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Isn't that great?

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,760
I really think the show has some potential

146
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,600
to offer some benefit.

147
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,000
So I thought, there's a lot I liked, a couple of things.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
I've already given Noah my feedback.

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
So thank you to Noah for doing that.

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
It's a 164 if you haven't heard it yet.

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Noah hosted while Wes and I were down to the Open Daylight

152
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
Summit.

153
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
And he took calls, answered questions.

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
He had a call screener with a queue.

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
I mean, he really went all out.

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
And the other thing that's really cool about it

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,200
is he's using free Linux software to do it all.

158
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Exactly.

159
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Now unless anybody else, I don't want to cut anybody out.

160
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,840
Any other thoughts in the Mumble Room before we go?

161
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Yeah.

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
OK.

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,040
Like, I just want to reiterate what Michael said.

164
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,880
Without the Mumble Room participating,

165
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,960
it kind of felt boring to me.

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,000
And I'm not saying the show is bad.

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,680
I think if the Mumble Room was participating and helping Noah

168
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,200
out, or they had some insight on it,

169
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,800
it would have been a lot better of a show.

170
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,480
If it was its own show, I could see people tuning into it

171
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,920
for sure.

172
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,840
Yeah, I mean, just for having the backup support,

173
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,280
I think it's a good idea to have the Mumble Room there.

174
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,000
And extra color.

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,720
Yeah.

176
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah, and just to break up the voices a little bit,

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
Rekai points out, and I think this is something I think

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
I mentioned to Noah myself, is voicemail during the week.

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,920
So if calls run low or something like that,

180
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,440
maybe we could just have voicemails

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
that people can play.

182
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,920
Noah definitely wants for live calls,

183
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,080
so that way he can ask them back and forth questions.

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
So that's a key thing.

185
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,400
Maybe adding like a SIP endpoint so people

186
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
can call directly over SIP.

187
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,160
He could totally do that.

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,320
That would be really nice and save some money.

189
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,800
Because he was paying for, it was a 1-800 number,

190
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,160
but that means he pays for the time.

191
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Which we'd have to figure that out too.

192
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
So this looks really exciting.

193
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
I think I've already got it downloaded on my machine,

194
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,640
just not quite installed yet.

195
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,440
KDE at 20 years old has released Plasma 5.8,

196
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,520
and it is a long-term support edition.

197
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,240
LTS.

198
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,920
An LTS.

199
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,680
Today, KDE releases its first long-term support edition

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
of its flagship desktop software, Plasma.

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,880
This marks the point where the developers and designers

202
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
are happy to recommend Plasma for the widest

203
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,840
possible audience, be they enterprise or non-techy home

204
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,560
users.

205
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,600
If you've tried a KDE desktop previously

206
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,800
and have been moved away, now is the time

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,480
to reassess Plasma is simple by default and powerful

208
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,200
when needed.

209
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,520
That feels like it's almost written specifically to me.

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,040
Yeah, right?

211
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,680
I think so.

212
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,360
Yeah.

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
I think that's that.

214
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,920
You're one of those people that could be easily corded right

215
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,440
back.

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Yeah, and I have tried it before and sort of walked away

217
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
like a little, oh, well, I have this issue.

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,040
I have that issue.

219
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm a little disappointed.

220
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,240
And so they are kind of like, if you've been moved away,

221
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,280
which is a good way to put it, too.

222
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,320
Yeah, that is a good way to put it.

223
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Yeah.

224
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,360
Anybody in the moment room have the 5.8 release yet?

225
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,880
Yep.

226
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,400
Really?

227
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,880
You do.

228
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,840
Welcome, Mr. Tonello.

229
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Tell me, what distro do you have it on,

230
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,600
and what are your thoughts so far?

231
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,520
Neon.

232
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,440
Oh, yeah, of course.

233
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
Yeah, that's what I've downloaded, too.

234
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,120
Yeah.

235
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,040
And what do you think so far?

236
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
I think it's awesome.

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,520
Like, Arch hasn't had it yet, so I couldn't test it on that.

238
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,760
But Neon, it was like the day of immediately.

239
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,880
It was actually available this morning

240
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,000
before the announcement even happened.

241
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,720
So I tested it on that.

242
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,840
And it's really good.

243
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,760
Like, it's very similar to 5.7.5, which I had on that Neon's

244
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,720
install as well.

245
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,120
But the upgrade from 5.7 to 5.8 was awesome,

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
because it was super easy.

247
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,080
It was just basically just an app upgrade, and that's it.

248
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
But the coolest thing about it is just

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
that there's nice polish now.

250
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,360
Like, it's not like they added a ton of new features.

251
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
It was mostly just polish.

252
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah, I think that shows in the release notes.

253
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah, they addressed a lot of things

254
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,160
that are complaints from most people,

255
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,760
like the whole MetaKey-only thing,

256
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,160
or fixing some widgets controls for the audio controllers

257
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,360
and stuff like that.

258
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,280
And they added a lot of cool, interesting things,

259
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,920
like the effort.

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,680
Why would you want it, other than just being awesome,

261
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
a video playing in the background when

262
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,480
you log into your computer?

263
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,360
But that is kind of one of those cool polish,

264
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
you know, show off the Linux desktop, which we need sometimes.

265
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,200
It's totally cool, and I did use it, and it is fun.

266
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,520
It's not necessary, but it is really cool

267
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,280
that you could change it in that extreme.

268
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Yeah, that's fair.

269
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Yeah, I agree.

270
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,960
I had some idea of what the headline features would be,

271
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,420
because I recorded the voiceover for the video weeks

272
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,120
ago, and so I had an idea of what they were focusing on.

273
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,840
And it was a good list of stuff, and I

274
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,280
think it kind of does echo something

275
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
they've been saying for a while.

276
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,040
We will tell you definitively, because they've been saying this

277
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
now for a little while, we will tell you definitively

278
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,440
when it's ready for the average folk.

279
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,480
Should I play the video?

280
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,760
Sure.

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
Even though it's myself, which is kind of weird?

282
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,000
I'd say do it.

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
Yeah, the EQing they've done is a little differently,

284
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,040
so it doesn't quite sound.

285
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't know if it even quite sounds like me.

286
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
You can be the judge.

287
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,080
But I thought it was a great video that

288
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,640
highlighted a lot of their features, which I kind of ribbed

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
them about in the past when Five 7 or whatever came out.

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
I said, you know, you really kind of need it.

291
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,680
It's 2016, it's time to have a video.

292
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,440
Up to production.

293
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,280
Yeah, so they made me put my foot in my mouth,

294
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
or what's that saying?

295
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,000
What's it called when somebody calls you on your bus?

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,760
Money where your mouth is.

297
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,080
Huh?

298
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
Money where my mouth is, yeah, except there

299
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
was no money transaction here.

300
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,080
But your video production skills where your mouth is.

301
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Metaphorical money.

302
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
This was just done for the project.

303
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,080
There was no money.

304
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,120
So it's more like, yeah, internet cookie in my mouth

305
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
or something like that.

306
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,640
In my mouth.

307
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,240
After a few hard months of work, the KDE community

308
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,400
is pleased to announce Plasma 5.8 Long Term Support Edition.

309
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,880
This version will be supported for at least 18 months.

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,760
So if you haven't tried Plasma Desktop yet,

311
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,460
take a look at some of its unique features.

312
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,760
With desktop widgets, you can easily organize your files,

313
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,240
monitor the system, and quickly launch favorite apps and more.

314
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Plasma lets you easily search your desktop

315
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,880
for applications, folders, music, video files,

316
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,520
everything you have.

317
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,000
Plasma's default theme breeze has a unified look

318
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,120
across all common application toolkits.

319
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Download wallpapers, window styles, widgets, desktop effects,

320
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,720
and many other resources straight to your desktop

321
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,760
from the KDE store.

322
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,320
Using KDE Connect, you'll be notified on your desktop

323
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,140
about text messages, can easily transfer files, and even

324
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,720
use your phone as a remote control.

325
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,680
Plasma is simple by default, but you

326
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,240
can customize it however you like with new widgets, panels,

327
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
screens, and styles.

328
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
But this isn't all.

329
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,000
Plasma 5.8 brings even more features and improvements

330
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
to your desktop.

331
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
This release brings an all-new artwork design,

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
giving you a complete breeze startup

333
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
to shut down experience.

334
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Support for Semitic right-to-left written

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic,

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,640
have been greatly improved.

337
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,760
Plasma wallpaper plugins, such as slide shows

338
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,560
and animated wallpapers, can now be used on the lock screen.

339
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Yeah, they did a rickroll.

340
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,560
You can watch the whole video in the show notes

341
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,280
if you want, it's a couple minutes long.

342
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,600
So a pretty nice release.

343
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,440
So I think I got it downloaded, and I

344
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,480
think Noah's got it downloaded, and he's an LTS guy

345
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,160
to begin with.

346
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,360
This seems perfect for him.

347
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,120
So I think we're going to give it a review on Sunday's

348
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
Linux action show.

349
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,040
Something to look forward to.

350
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,000
Now we have kind of an interesting news item.

351
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,720
It's a little name collision today.

352
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
We're introducing Pixel, but not the Google Pixel,

353
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
not the Google kind.

354
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,960
No, this is the Raspberry Pi kind,

355
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,480
and it's their new fancy-schmancy desktop

356
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
environment.

357
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,380
Where does it?

358
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,720
I have a little definition somewhere here.

359
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
What did Pixel stand for?

360
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,640
Because I have the.

361
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,320
Oh, here we go.

362
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Pi improved xWindows environment, comma, lightweight.

363
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, Pi improved xWindows environment, lightweight.

364
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
And my main takeaway from it is it's not

365
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,520
like it's some new X server or something like that.

366
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,840
It's essentially a set of changes

367
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,080
that entirely are around the appearance of the desktop.

368
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,040
The first thing you'll notice when you reboot

369
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,200
is they now have a nice, pretty splash screen

370
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,880
that they say they've done a lot of work

371
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,200
to not slow down the Pi.

372
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Once the desktop appears, you'll notice

373
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
a nice, stunning background taken by one of their very own,

374
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
and there's several of them preloaded.

375
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,240
You'll also notice that the icons on the task bar menu

376
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,600
and file manager have gotten a big makeover.

377
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,760
Big improvement there.

378
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,640
Sort of spiffing it up a little bit.

379
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,880
If you open up a window, you'll see the window frame design

380
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,240
has changed significantly.

381
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,860
The old window design always looked a bit dated

382
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,440
compared to what Apple and Microsoft are now shipping.

383
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
So they were keen to update it.

384
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,860
Windows now have subtle curves on the corners,

385
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,400
clear title bars, new icons for the open, minimize,

386
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,360
and close.

387
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,520
Fonts have gotten improved, even with a mention to Steve Jobs.

388
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
And this is an interesting one.

389
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,780
On, I guess, request by a lot of Raspberry Pi users,

390
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,440
they want to be able to shut off the wireless from within the UI.

391
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,900
So now there are options in the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth menus

392
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,920
to turn off relevant devices.

393
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
Works with Pi 3's onboard wireless hardware.

394
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,960
And should work on most external Wi-Fi and Bluetooth dongles.

395
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
I like this.

396
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,480
They're packaging in Chromium for the Pi

397
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,600
with hardware acceleration.

398
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,880
Yeah, so they're switching out from Epiphany to Chromium.

399
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,520
Chromium for the Pi, which is the Pi's hardware

400
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,380
accelerated playback for streaming content.

401
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,080
That's pretty slick.

402
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,200
Yeah, they're also including uBlock origin,

403
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,440
adblock by default, H.265 extensions,

404
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,320
which force YouTube to serve videos

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
in a format which can be accelerated by the Pi's

406
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,000
hardware.

407
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,680
And it's available for download right now.

408
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,280
That's awesome.

409
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,160
Yeah, it is.

410
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,660
It seems to be trying to make it a more user-friendly,

411
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,880
out-of-the-box OS.

412
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,760
But doesn't that sort of suggest?

413
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,800
I guess one of the things I liked about Raspberry Pi

414
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,640
was that it truly was divorced from any.

415
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,020
I know that there's always been Raspbian and they've been close,

416
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,680
but it always feels like there's been

417
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
a divorce there between a distance,

418
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
a separation of church and state, if you will,

419
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,280
between the OS you run on and the Raspberry Pi hardware.

420
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,120
I understand that they ship it sometimes

421
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,720
with an SD card preloaded, but that didn't necessarily

422
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,280
mean that there was an OS all of a sudden that they were

423
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,400
going to start throwing in behind to try to promote

424
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,120
as the primary OS you run all the time on a Raspberry Pi.

425
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,160
Maybe I misunderstood?

426
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I mean, I guess that's true, but I

427
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,440
don't know if that is really changed with this.

428
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,680
I mean, maybe it feels more that way,

429
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
but I feel like a lot of people who use it who aren't more

430
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,280
experienced, aren't the power users,

431
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,040
aren't using it in a project that they know right away,

432
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
or maybe using it more just to play with, or there's a desktop,

433
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,240
they're going to follow one of the guides that

434
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,400
has them install one of the easier operating systems.

435
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,640
So in that effect, there kind of is already a default.

436
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,040
But I mean, there's not really because of the,

437
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,920
this doesn't change anything as far as how stuff is installed,

438
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,400
because most people are still going to use Noobs,

439
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,680
the Noobs installer, because it's such an easy process

440
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
to get installed.

441
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,320
And this is not going to be like only this,

442
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,600
and just they're still having OpenELEC, and PyDora,

443
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,400
and all this other stuff, and Noobs.

444
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
And it is nice that this will be better.

445
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,160
I mean, just making it look better

446
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,400
for having LXDE, because LXDE is about to fall.

447
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,880
Sure, yeah.

448
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,520
I mean, I agree.

449
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,720
And that is a good thing, absolutely.

450
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm not by any way saying that's not a good thing.

451
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,200
But Wimby, I'm kind of curious what your thoughts are,

452
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,040
because I know that Ubuntu Mate is extremely popular

453
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,000
on the Raspberry Pi.

454
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
So it's a device you probably have some experience with.

455
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
Does this seem like a good move, something

456
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,960
that's worth their time?

457
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,480
Yeah, well, how do I answer this without coming

458
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,840
across overly negative?

459
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,080
The first thing is I think that the browser work with Chromium

460
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
and the video acceleration is probably

461
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,320
the most relevant and interesting stuff

462
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,160
come out of this initiative.

463
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,280
I think that's brilliant.

464
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,640
And I'm looking forward to finding the time

465
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,560
to have a little look around and see

466
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,880
how that's been implemented to see what I can borrow

467
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,720
from what they've done there.

468
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,440
The name collision is unfortunate.

469
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,320
And how that happened, I just can't imagine that seems.

470
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah, we've known the name Pixel now for.

471
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,040
I know.

472
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,400
We had the Google Pixel as a re-envision

473
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,040
of the already existing Google Pixel,

474
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,800
so they didn't really need to do that.

475
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
And they chose the, it was a backer in it,

476
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,200
they picked Pixel in the first place

477
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,480
and tried to make it work.

478
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

479
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,800
Yeah.

480
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,240
So that's.

481
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
Still, though, that doesn't necessarily

482
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,520
mean you have to go with the name.

483
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,880
But yeah, the naming collision is confusing.

484
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, and the thing I'm a little bit perplexed about,

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
if you read the blog post, there's a couple of things

486
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,120
that stand out from this.

487
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,760
And that's that the guy that's done this,

488
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
and he's clearly put a lot of work into it,

489
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,280
he acknowledges that when he started on this,

490
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,080
he had little to no experience with Linux and X and X

491
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,280
desktops and all the rest of it.

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
And it looks like two years of effort

493
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,640
have gone into this based on LXDE

494
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,880
that people in the Linux community

495
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,720
know is yesterday's news is the thing that's being replaced.

496
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,400
So they've poured effort into this,

497
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
and it's immediately laden with technical debt.

498
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,160
And I think that that's really unfortunate that they've

499
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,680
built this around something that is effectively obsolete now.

500
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,440
And I think the art and the fonts and the icons

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,480
all look really good.

502
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,760
But there are also open source licensed theme packs

503
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,640
and icons out there that are also very, very good.

504
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,800
They're free to use.

505
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
It felt like, to me, it was a lot of work

506
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,080
on a system that doesn't have a lot of legs.

507
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,680
And it sounds to me also like it is the beginning of something

508
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,520
much larger.

509
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,800
Because the way they phrase it in the blog post is,

510
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,440
currently we focused on appearance.

511
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,880
But it sounds like the overall goal

512
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,760
is to make a faster, more dynamic desktop.

513
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,960
And part of the name, part of the backronym

514
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,640
includes the X to the.

515
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,000
It felt to me as if they were going

516
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,760
to do everything they could to make it faster on X with LXDE.

517
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,960
And I thought to myself, well, why LXDE and why X11?

518
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,920
Why are you going to invest in these things?

519
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Why is that where you standardize, where you focus?

520
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,440
And that new boot screen they worked on,

521
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
it probably took a hell of a lot of work.

522
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,660
Because like Wimpy said, they spent a lot of time working

523
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,760
on that particular thing.

524
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,320
It's a very X-focused project.

525
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,640
So it does feel like investing on the past of Linux

526
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,720
when the Raspberry Pi is such a future-looking device, when

527
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,180
it comes to resources, availability, the ARM

528
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,800
platform, the price.

529
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,160
Right, yeah, exactly.

530
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,880
It seems to be sort of a mismatch.

531
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,920
It does seem like a mismatch.

532
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,840
Or perhaps just like things that could have been efforts

533
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,200
that perhaps would have been better in projects more

534
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,780
tightly knit with the community or that

535
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,120
have existing communities.

536
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,780
It kind of feels like they chose LXDE because just

537
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,920
for the sake of lightness, not for like,

538
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,480
basically ignoring everything else.

539
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Yeah, you could be right.

540
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,320
Yeah, or just momentum.

541
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,440
They have momentum there.

542
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
That could be that.

543
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,720
It's weird because LXDE is only like 10% lighter than MATE.

544
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,920
Yeah, we've had that debate.

545
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,520
And I agree.

546
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,880
I think it also, you could make a lot of different desktops

547
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,720
lighter or heavier depending on how you configure them.

548
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,040
And also, we've been looking at LXQt

549
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
and looking at where its resources are.

550
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,200
And yeah, there's a little more there.

551
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,680
You're looking at a Raspberry Pi 3.

552
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,900
That's the desktop to watch right now.

553
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,400
I agree.

554
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,440
Really, really interesting.

555
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,400
Besides MATE, MATE.

556
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, all Unity.

557
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,040
Yeah, apparently, maybe there's hope for Unity after all.

558
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,220
All right, well, I want to move into something

559
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,640
that I know Wimpy is going to be fired up about, real fired up

560
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,280
about.

561
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,440
So before we get there, before we go too much further,

562
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,860
we've got a big show coming up.

563
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
And I want to thank DigitalOcean for making it possible.

564
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,400
I want to thank all of you who use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

565
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,360
It's one word.

566
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
Lowercase, you apply it to your account,

567
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
you get a $10 credit.

568
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,840
That's a vote to keep us on the air.

569
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

570
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,340
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

571
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,840
to spin up a server on their crazy great infrastructure.

572
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,920
Their pricing is nuts.

573
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,760
It's super valuable for the kind of rigs you get

574
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
and the performance you can get.

575
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,680
They've got data centers in New York, San Francisco,

576
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, India.

577
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,840
I think I'm even missing one in there now.

578
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,600
Any more data centers?

579
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,920
You're going to run out of breath there, Chris.

580
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,480
No.

581
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,520
No, bring it.

582
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,280
Bring it!

583
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Bring it!

584
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,000
Also, their interface, it's the best.

585
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,920
They have a really great intuitive control panel.

586
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,080
It gets me fired up about DigitalOcean.

587
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
Go over there and try it.

588
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,040
And then one of the nice things is

589
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,240
they have a really beautiful, well-documented, elegant,

590
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,000
listen to me, let me throw, what else can I throw in there?

591
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
Come on, give me another word, Wes.

592
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,320
Elegant.

593
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,160
Simple.

594
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Well-designed.

595
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,800
Oh yeah, there you go.

596
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,280
Kind of need another, I need another buzz term.

597
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,120
Blue.

598
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,360
Blue, sure.

599
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,840
No, that's not, no, that's not good.

600
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,920
Cloudy, oh, cloudy.

601
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,360
Yeah, cloudy, manageable, scalable.

602
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,080
Oh, I'm on fire, Wes, I've got it.

603
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm back in the flow.

604
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,920
Enterprise-friendly.

605
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, ready, secure, implementable, auditable.

606
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,440
Oh, measurable!

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
I got it all, Wes.

608
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,160
But really, the DigitalOcean API, what's great about it

609
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,720
is it's well-documented and there's a ton of code

610
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,520
already written you can take advantage of.

611
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,080
In fact, when you look over there

612
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,680
at their community projects page,

613
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,640
one that might jump out at you if you are a Unity user

614
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
is the DigitalOcean indicator.

615
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,480
This indicator allows you to manage and manage

616
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
your droplets directly from your panel, fool.

617
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
You can quickly see which droplets are active.

618
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,040
You can reboot, power on, power down your droplets.

619
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,960
You can copy your droplet's IP like a boost for easy access.

620
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,040
And of course, there's all kinds

621
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,920
of other great code already written.

622
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,840
You can just take advantage of it.

623
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,760
Use our promo code DOUNPLUG, get a $10 credit.

624
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,920
Go spend up a $5 rig, guys.

625
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,160
$5 dollar dollar rig over at digitalocean.com.

626
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,720
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you

627
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

628
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,520
the Linux Unplugged program.

629
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
Woo-woo.

630
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
All right, Wimpy, don't lie.

631
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,120
You're totally stoked about Jah-kasha?

632
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,640
Jahshaka.

633
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,480
Jahshaka!

634
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
Who now?

635
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,480
Now, this is a VR world creator that allows.

636
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh, move on.

637
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,400
All right, and it's GPL, moving on.

638
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,320
So, this is actually a story that's worth talking about.

639
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,960
Unsafe at any clock speed, the Linux security,

640
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,160
the Linux kernel security needs a rethinking.

641
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,400
This is ours reporting

642
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,320
for the Linux kernel security summit.

643
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,560
And here is how they start it up.

644
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
This is how they spin it up.

645
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,040
The Linux kernel today faces an unprecedented safety crisis.

646
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Much like when Ralph Nader famously told

647
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,840
the American public that their cars were unsafe

648
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,880
at any speed back in 1965,

649
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,320
numerous security developers told the 2016 Linux

650
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,080
security summit in Toronto that the operating system

651
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,080
needs a total rethink to keep it fit for its purpose.

652
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,320
AKA, not fit for the gerb.

653
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Strong words.

654
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,040
Cars were designed to run, but not to fail.

655
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
This is Kees Cook.

656
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,640
He's the head of the Linux kernel self-protection project

657
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
at Googs, and he's an employee that's working at Googs

658
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
on the future of internet things security,

659
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,200
whatever that means.

660
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,520
And he said at the summit that while it's very comfortable

661
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
while you're driving to go down the road,

662
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,120
as soon as you crashed, everybody died in these old cars.

663
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,680
That's not acceptable anymore, he added.

664
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,000
And in a similar fashion, Linux kernel needs to deal

665
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
with attacks in a manner where it actually is expecting them

666
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,680
and actually handles them gracefully in some fashion

667
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,360
when it's being attacked.

668
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,740
Like don't just do your, he goes to point out

669
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,920
we approach security today as though we are just still

670
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,000
living in the world of the 1990s and 2000s.

671
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Computers in a data center managed by knowledgeable people.

672
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,680
But most computers today, laptops, smartphones,

673
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,580
and internet of things devices are not managed

674
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,880
and secured by internet.

675
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,560
Boy, that last category. By IT professionals.

676
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Especially, right?

677
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah.

678
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,280
And he points out that so the kernel has to be designed

679
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
in a way that it assumes it's going to be attacked.

680
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
And then he kind of rubs it in with some stats and details

681
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,220
and ours sort of does a beautiful job of summarizing this

682
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,140
if you guys want to check out the link in the show notes.

683
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,160
The clear consensus at the Linux Security Summit

684
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,120
was that the squashing of bugs is a losing strategy.

685
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
Many deployed devices running Linux will never receive

686
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,940
security updates and patching a security hole

687
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,200
in the upstream kernel code does nothing to ensure

688
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,080
the safety of an internet of things device

689
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
that could be used for a decade

690
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,240
and may forever be ignored by the manufacturer.

691
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,260
Exactly, right.

692
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
We've seen this with routers,

693
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,240
we see this with Android devices.

694
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
There's only going to be more.

695
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm sure Chromecast will be like,

696
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,200
we started the show talking about Chromecast,

697
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm sure Chromecast will be in this category one day.

698
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Worse, the average lifetime of a critical security bug

699
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,920
in the Linux kernel from introduction during a code commit

700
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,960
to public discovery and having a patch issued

701
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,800
averages three years or more.

702
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,180
This is why everybody should be rolling.

703
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,940
According to Cook's analysis,

704
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,760
critical and high severity security bugs

705
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
in the upstream kernel have lifespans of 3 to 3.3 years

706
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,380
to 6.4 years between commit and discovery.

707
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
That's kind of a long time to be out there circulating.

708
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,520
That's a new graph we've got here too though.

709
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Yeah, including they have some pie charts here

710
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,500
where they're looking at Android security bugs

711
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,640
and they're looking at where most Android

712
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
vulnerabilities come from

713
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,140
and this is an interesting statistic.

714
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,020
Only 15% of vulnerabilities in Android's kernel

715
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,920
came from upstream, only 15%.

716
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,240
85% of the bugs in the Android kernel

717
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
came from device driver manufacturers.

718
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,360
Sounds just like Windows.

719
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,560
It does sound the other way.

720
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,740
So he says the kernel maintainers

721
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,360
have to get ready for this kind of thing.

722
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,720
They have to build Linux to be expected for attacks.

723
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,200
To get it ready, you're gonna get attacked,

724
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,280
so just design in a way

725
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,600
where it can sort of manage that situation.

726
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,000
It's funny how much this is a symptom of Linux success.

727
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Now that it's everywhere, you have to start designing

728
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,480
for that and it will be used in situations

729
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,440
where people don't understand it

730
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,560
or really know what's happening

731
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,720
and you have to plan for all of that.

732
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,220
And especially when you're gonna be in these,

733
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,540
they're gonna be built in so many embedded devices

734
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,880
that just sit on the shelf.

735
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,920
I think the line in there that sort of hit me the best

736
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,720
is that bug fixing is just not enough.

737
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,600
And because of enterprises where they have slow patch cycles

738
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,680
and device manufacturers who don't properly update,

739
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,160
we have Linux out there in these devices

740
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,000
where there's this really long tail of production

741
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,760
because they just work.

742
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
They just frickin' work forever.

743
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,280
Yeah, you don't need a super RAM upgrade

744
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,360
or whatever in your tiny...

745
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
And so that just means it's hanging out there

746
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,260
with its fly down for years.

747
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,880
It's got its D swinging in the wing.

748
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,560
I think it's nice to see more talks about this

749
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,200
because obviously a couple years ago,

750
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,660
there's lots of complaints in the community

751
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,680
and from outside people just about, you know.

752
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,360
It did feel like it was like the 90s or 2000s,

753
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,720
like it was a bunch of people just making this kernel,

754
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,560
they were just making it work

755
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,160
without really considering the full market effect.

756
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
And obviously that's hard when it's built

757
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
in this open source way,

758
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,120
but it's nice to see that people

759
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,160
are really paying it full attention.

760
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Yeah, and what kind of changes will Linux have to make

761
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
in order to stay competitive?

762
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,360
If it doesn't make those changes,

763
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,620
will another kernel come along

764
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,080
for these types of devices that does?

765
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,280
And I hope they can do a good job

766
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
of looking at other kernels,

767
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,520
other projects that are more security focused.

768
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,400
OpenBSD comes to mind or GR Security people

769
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,320
and try to incorporate some of those approaches.

770
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, and what are they doing that is more proactive

771
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,240
and not just squashing bugs?

772
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,620
Exactly. Yeah.

773
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,200
Inigo says, this seems like bad journalism

774
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
and thinking that developers are robots.

775
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,080
Well, it's coming from the developer community

776
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,980
and they're just saying, we need to rethink,

777
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,800
we can't just treat fixing bugs as...

778
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
So Linus was quoted as saying,

779
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,500
he doesn't look at security bugs

780
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,880
and regular bugs separately

781
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,680
because they're all just bugs that need fixed.

782
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,040
And there is absolutely some nice sound logic behind that.

783
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,560
But at the same time, there is also a conversation,

784
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,060
I think a conversation worth having around,

785
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,240
how do we design this thing to be planned to get attacked?

786
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,160
How does this thing operate

787
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,400
when it knows it's gonna get attacked?

788
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,360
It's not just, it's gonna assume

789
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
that once you're inside, everything's trusted.

790
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,600
How do we design this thing a little bit differently?

791
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,560
What can we tweak?

792
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,520
I think that might be worth discussing.

793
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,180
We'll see.

794
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,560
Yeah, I agree. A lot coming out of Google,

795
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,700
security wise.

796
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,920
Project Zero, they have their own fork of OpenSSL.

797
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
They have this guy who's working

798
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,040
on the Internet of Things future security.

799
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,300
And they're attending Linux events.

800
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,280
I mean, there's a lot, Google's really focused

801
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,240
on this right now.

802
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,440
They're putting some money in this.

803
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Well, I feel like they're trying to be

804
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,360
in the consumer space and the vendor space

805
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,400
and people say, security is a huge thing

806
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
that you can be audited for,

807
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,600
you need to have to do this yourself.

808
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
All right, I wanted to ask the mummer room

809
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,640
because there was a thread on RLinux

810
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,440
submitted a few days ago by Dark Delta or something like that.

811
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
I can't remember the guy's name.

812
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,720
Darko Delta or something.

813
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,040
And he asks, what are things that you would do

814
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
to change Linux?

815
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,280
Like if you could just snap your fingers

816
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,320
and change something about Linux.

817
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,640
So we were just talking about the security thing

818
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
and that's what made me think about this.

819
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,080
If you could change anything,

820
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,040
and I want to really throw it to the mumble room,

821
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,600
but I'll give you an example.

822
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,660
Like it was pointed out,

823
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,320
this security thing could be something that you have.

824
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,680
If you could just snap your fingers

825
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,360
and change how a security is done, would you change it?

826
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,200
What about you, Wes?

827
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,480
If you could snap your fingers,

828
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,760
is there something you would change about Linux?

829
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,660
Hmm.

830
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,500
You like it.

831
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,640
I mean, I do like most things.

832
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,060
I think there could be something to said about a better,

833
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,600
not closeness, but there's something about right now,

834
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,040
I feel like, especially just like the,

835
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,360
even though there is like the core funding initiatives

836
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,160
and that kind of stuff, there's this disconnect.

837
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
Like I feel like we talk about the kernel a lot,

838
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,000
but are we excited as about like core utilities development

839
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,440
or a lot of the other parts of the user land?

840
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,640
And then the BSDs kind of have that a little more rolled in.

841
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
It's just cohesive.

842
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
And I wouldn't say that change that

843
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
because I think in some ways it's really cool, right?

844
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,080
We have different C libraries.

845
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,440
Over the long haul could be good, but yeah.

846
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,280
Okay, I follow.

847
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
I wonder if there could be a better ecosystem in there.

848
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,720
All right, let's pull the crank and ask the mumble room.

849
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,400
Mr. Tanel, I believe I heard you.

850
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,640
Did you have something you wanted to mention

851
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,480
you would change?

852
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah, the most important first thing

853
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,760
that came to mind is universal apps.

854
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,680
Snap packages for all.

855
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,800
Ooh, yeah.

856
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,240
App pack and flat pack.

857
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,080
Haven't you heard of Docker?

858
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,920
You don't even care.

859
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,740
He actually doesn't even care.

860
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,120
He just wants everybody to use it, right?

861
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
I don't care which one is successful.

862
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
I just want one to be successful

863
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
so that game developers, software developers,

864
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,680
doesn't matter.

865
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
They all have one thing to work on.

866
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,120
And no matter what distro you choose,

867
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,000
you can use the software that's made for the ecosystem.

868
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,040
Let's see, I wanna ask William if he's near his mic,

869
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,280
but I'll give him a chance to think about it.

870
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,520
I'd like to hear from WW too, but Wimpy,

871
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,260
I gotta go to you since you're a distro maker.

872
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,720
You know I was gonna ask you this.

873
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,400
If there was something you could snap your fingers

874
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,920
and change, would it be something about Linux itself?

875
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,680
Would it be something about the community,

876
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,400
the way we collaborate?

877
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,200
What would you change?

878
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,840
This is a really tough question.

879
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
I agree.

880
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,640
To think of one thing.

881
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,440
I'll be honest, I've got nothing solid in my mind

882
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,680
that I'm just gonna say this is the one thing.

883
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,000
I can think of lots of little things,

884
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,920
but no one big thing.

885
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,720
So ask around and if I come up with something,

886
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,560
I'll let you know.

887
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,800
That's how I actually feel myself,

888
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,360
is I don't have one thing.

889
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,320
I could think of the way the community interacts

890
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
from time to time, the way we process information.

891
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,900
I suppose, okay, I have one.

892
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,740
I have one.

893
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,560
All right, I have one.

894
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,400
I'll save it.

895
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,440
William, do you happen to have one by any chance?

896
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,320
I don't think so.

897
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
Go on once, go on twice.

898
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,480
What about you, Mr. WW?

899
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,360
Do you have one by any chance?

900
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,200
I do have one and it's kind of been a pet peeve of mine

901
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,520
since like the 90, well, since I first started

902
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,680
in getting into Linux with my friends back in the 90s.

903
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,360
And that is, I would remove the mindset of people

904
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,680
that they think that they should be running Linux

905
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,720
on old hardware all the time,

906
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,720
or this is the best way to do things because it's not.

907
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,560
This old hardware is holding us back and supporting it

908
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,520
and just keeping it around and it's just,

909
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,480
it's an old kind of way of thinking about the kernel

910
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,620
and development of Linux and not really letting us focus

911
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
on newer things.

912
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,280
So it's a mindset.

913
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
Yeah, a mindset.

914
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,920
All right, okay, I can follow that.

915
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,680
Mohs and Rath, you had one around collaboration.

916
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,680
Yeah, I was thinking that it'd be nice if,

917
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,160
because if you take a look at, say, DistroWatch,

918
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,960
all those different distros that you could say

919
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
didn't make it.

920
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
If you could somehow, I guess you would need

921
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,640
the most powerful in the universe, right,

922
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,640
American greenbacks, go and hunt down,

923
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,720
say like 50, 100 of those people worked on these things

924
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,920
and it just never really took off.

925
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,360
You get all of those people,

926
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
because they all had ideas.

927
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,000
Maybe they didn't have quite the chops individually,

928
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,040
but you get a legion of them, right?

929
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,480
And you just put them on to, say, different distros

930
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,440
which have made it, say like one of the top 20.

931
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,720
Not necessarily one of the top 10,

932
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,680
because those ones are usually backed by companies,

933
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,160
but you say one of the top 20 that doesn't have

934
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,960
a huge company behind it,

935
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,360
and you just have that legion of, literally,

936
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,720
of wisdom, of experience, of knowledge,

937
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,320
all focusing together in terms of,

938
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,120
hey, my project didn't work,

939
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,960
all of our projects individually didn't work,

940
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,520
but we get together as a team.

941
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,360
It's sort of like when you're lifting a log,

942
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,720
one person by themselves, that's gonna be real difficult.

943
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,200
You get 10, 20 of them, all of them,

944
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,280
also a couple of them say, dig a hole here,

945
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,000
couple of them say, get some rope here,

946
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and all of a sudden, you can lift a whole bunch of logs

947
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,680
and make a nice little anything that you want with them,

948
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,080
because now you have a team of people all in one,

949
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,520
as the song says, one pimped-struck groove

950
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,000
to actually make it work.

951
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,120
Oh, I'm getting a little inspired.

952
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,840
Mozenrath, that open-sauce runs deep.

953
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,920
That's a good one, I like that.

954
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,480
I'll give you mine.

955
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,840
I got two, I was thinking about it.

956
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,800
Number one is not a huge one,

957
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,720
but I think it would better serve the Linux community

958
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,520
how they inform themselves, how they come to opinions,

959
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,720
and about what technologies they'd back

960
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,960
if we could get our heads out of our ass

961
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,600
and drop the whole cult of personality.

962
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,060
It's something that Aaron Seigo wrote about years ago.

963
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,600
I continue to think about it.

964
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,180
There are personalities out there

965
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,960
that people believe the things they say

966
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,440
simply because they have a name they've heard of

967
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,480
or somebody they've, that thing drives me nuts

968
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,280
because it allows people to get led around like sheeps.

969
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,720
And all of it, even people who are technically proficient,

970
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,080
like somebody I respect, like Lenart,

971
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,800
who I thought made a lot of great cognitive arguments

972
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,820
for System D, there were still people

973
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,840
who would just pick up pitchforks

974
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,200
because Lenart was for something or because,

975
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,720
on either side.

976
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,480
So that would be one thing I would change.

977
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,440
The other thing I would like to change, I think,

978
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,120
is how involved the community is with funding.

979
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,160
They're very involved with code, documentation,

980
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,200
and especially evangelism.

981
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,520
I would really love to see more money where our mouths are

982
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,760
in terms of funding open source projects,

983
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,360
contributing to them, and allowing the public

984
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,980
to fund things that deserve better focus,

985
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,880
better surfacing, so that way the projects

986
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,200
and the outlets that are funded

987
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,680
by maybe certain media backers

988
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,140
or certain corporate sponsors

989
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,420
that currently have a louder voice

990
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,920
or currently have a larger presence

991
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,200
could be more properly competed with

992
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,760
by smaller independent news outlets

993
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,540
and open source projects

994
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,280
in a way that's on a more competitive advantage

995
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,640
and it's up to the audience to kind of step up for that.

996
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,160
And if I could change one damn thing,

997
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,000
it would be to have more Linux users

998
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,720
and more open source users contributing money financially

999
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,760
back upstream to the projects

1000
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,540
and the things that they use,

1001
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,340
and maybe the content they consume.

1002
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,800
You kind of get a nice perspective for it all

1003
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,920
when you look at this website

1004
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,240
that I've sort of been obsessed with

1005
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,520
that Wes linked to me.

1006
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,720
It's github.audio, and you're hearing it

1007
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,160
in the background right now.

1008
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,640
It's a sonification of what goes on at github.

1009
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,080
Yeah, and there's representations with different tones

1010
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,320
and blips on the radar.

1011
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,640
Well-chosen, artfully chosen.

1012
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,360
There's a big one.

1013
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,280
That's a big one right there.

1014
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Something just dropped.

1015
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,640
So you visualize commits to github, right?

1016
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,680
That's what this is, is a perspective

1017
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,800
with their size and whatnot.

1018
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,040
It reminds me of something,

1019
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,200
I don't know if you ever saw it for Bitcoin.

1020
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Did you ever see this for Bitcoin?

1021
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh yeah.

1022
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,400
Yeah.

1023
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,880
Visualize it or find blockchain.

1024
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,960
And I left it up in a tab

1025
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
while I worked on the show today

1026
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,280
because it's just nice and peaceful.

1027
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
It has like an organic kind of, you know, sounds natural.

1028
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,160
Plus there's something sort of inspiring to know

1029
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,800
that every one of those dings is a commitment of code.

1030
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,360
Look at the community go.

1031
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,200
That's kind of inspiring.

1032
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,680
When you're working and you keep hearing people

1033
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,560
that are committing something to projects

1034
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
all over the world.

1035
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,320
Open source projects.

1036
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah, just run it in your tab.

1037
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,000
github.audio.

1038
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
You might even be able to find some projects this way,

1039
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040
right?

1040
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,880
You're like, oh, these guys are just doing

1041
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,720
a lot of cool stuff.

1042
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,360
Maybe I'll check out that repo.

1043
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,960
Yeah, I agree.

1044
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,040
And also, like xMetals says in the chat room,

1045
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,640
I could totally fall asleep to that.

1046
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,480
You know what?

1047
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,840
I might try that tonight.

1048
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,040
I've been looking for things to leave on as background

1049
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
for my dogs.

1050
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,080
There goes a big one.

1051
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,920
Look at that.

1052
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Big one.

1053
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,200
Come on now.

1054
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,120
Even if you just have the sound muted,

1055
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
it's still kind of neat from a visual standpoint.

1056
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,560
For those of you in the audio audience,

1057
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,200
there are blips.

1058
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
So how would you describe that, Wes?

1059
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
Sort of like pings on a map that sort of expand

1060
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,520
in proportion and their color and their size.

1061
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,400
Like a 2D ripple.

1062
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,520
Yeah, a 2D ripple and it's proportionally

1063
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,640
to the size of the commit and all of that.

1064
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,480
It's very fancy.

1065
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,400
So look at you.

1066
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Look at you sending me a link that I love.

1067
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I know you so well.

1068
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
github.audio.

1069
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,040
And I have bookmarks for some old Bitcoin ones,

1070
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,400
but they got bought out and now they serve malware.

1071
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
So that's no good.

1072
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,720
Hey, malware as a service is an important part of the book.

1073
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,000
Malware as a service.

1074
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah.

1075
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,660
You know what?

1076
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,500
Speaking of important services,

1077
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,320
I want to tell you about my mobile service provider

1078
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,160
and that's Ting.

1079
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,800
Once you go to linux.ting.com,

1080
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,000
linux.ting.com to learn more,

1081
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,520
get a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

1082
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,480
Or if you're like Ninja level and you bring a Ting device,

1083
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,600
then you'll get $25 in service credit

1084
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,960
and an average monthly Ting line is about 23 bucks.

1085
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,040
So your service credit is going to pay for more

1086
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,880
than your first month.

1087
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,720
It did for mine too.

1088
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
And that's kind of nice because Ting has CDMA

1089
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
and GSM networks.

1090
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,640
I'll say it again.

1091
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,680
Ting has CDMA and GSM networks.

1092
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,500
That's right.

1093
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,340
CDMA and GSM.

1094
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,080
So you get to pick which one works better for you

1095
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,240
and bring a device.

1096
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,940
They have radically good customer service.

1097
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,840
Super good.

1098
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,200
You get to speak to a real human being.

1099
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
They can help you out,

1100
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,660
but they back it up with an incredible dashboard

1101
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,640
and an app for your mobile device.

1102
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,640
You know, I laugh because Mr. Tonell

1103
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,360
in the Mamba Room, Producer Tonell,

1104
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,640
he had a really funny comment today.

1105
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,560
He's like, hey, you ought to mention this in the Ting spot.

1106
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,920
People could go pick up the LG Tribute 5,

1107
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,640
which just landed on Ting for $121,

1108
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,960
no contract, no termination fee,

1109
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,160
and then go over to Amazon

1110
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,160
and pick up a Rebel T5 digital SLR

1111
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,360
and still spend less money

1112
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,980
than you would spend for the new Pixel.

1113
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,320
See, I think he was just trying to make fun of me

1114
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,240
because I might buy a Pixel

1115
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,680
and I'm buying a new camera this week.

1116
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,720
Really?

1117
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,560
Yep.

1118
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,400
It's going to be an expensive week, Chris.

1119
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,040
That is going to be a very expensive week.

1120
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,120
So yeah, the Tribute 2 was kind of a famous phone

1121
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
and the Tribute 5 is back and bigger

1122
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,080
with a bigger display, bigger battery,

1123
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,040
front-facing cameras, all this business.

1124
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
It's actually a pretty decent phone for 121 bucks

1125
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,640
and you'd have enough money left over

1126
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,160
to get yourself a SLR.

1127
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,760
Kids' phone, grandma's phone,

1128
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
you know, they want Instagram and they want email.

1129
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,520
Or if you just don't find yourself

1130
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,840
all that enthused about phones anymore.

1131
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,260
If smartphones are just not what floats your boat

1132
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,120
and you just need something

1133
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,280
that can do the basic things you want,

1134
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,460
run a recent version of Android,

1135
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,840
and no contract nor the termination fee.

1136
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,720
Just having a recent version of Android,

1137
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,080
that's pretty much everything you need.

1138
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,520
And 121 bucks, no contract nor the termination fee.

1139
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,640
That's a really great deal.

1140
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,600
I want you to go over to linux.ting.com.

1141
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,640
You get to put Linux in your URL bar,

1142
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,760
which is good because you want Linux in your history,

1143
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,600
let's be honest.

1144
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,440
You want that in there.

1145
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,080
You got to stuff that URL history bar.

1146
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,280
I know what you've been up to, linux.ting.com.

1147
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,700
They give you a discount off a device

1148
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,300
or they'll give you a discount off service

1149
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,680
if you decide to switch and they got a savings calculator.

1150
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,200
I recommend you check it out.

1151
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,680
linux.ting.com.

1152
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,400
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring

1153
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,640
the Unplugged program.

1154
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,620
Wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub, wubba-dub-bub.

1155
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,200
So I thought before we got into talking about

1156
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,480
the Open Daylight Summit and our interviews,

1157
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,700
rolling our interviews that we had

1158
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,740
with some of the folks at Open Daylight Summit,

1159
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,600
we should give one more crack at explaining

1160
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,480
what the F, software-defined networking is.

1161
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,000
JB does SDN.

1162
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,520
Yeah, and why it matters.

1163
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,800
And it is hard to describe

1164
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,960
because it is literally a nascent industry

1165
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,640
that is in flux and a lot of people

1166
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,880
that are involved with it barely understand it.

1167
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,720
Yep.

1168
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,540
Well said, Chris, well said.

1169
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,380
So it's really hard.

1170
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,200
They won't say that, but it's true.

1171
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,360
Yeah, so for us coming here

1172
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,480
and then relaying the information to you,

1173
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,900
we kind of look like we're jackasses,

1174
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,520
but software-defined networking itself isn't,

1175
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,760
Open Daylight isn't the only

1176
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,540
software-defined networking controller game in town.

1177
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,860
It is one of the more open and community-based ones

1178
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,000
with multi-industry support,

1179
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,720
and it's one that the Linux Foundation

1180
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,060
has thrown their weight behind.

1181
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,800
And as we've shown, has a active community.

1182
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
So there's others, though, like OpenFlow, right?

1183
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,840
That would be, would that be considered?

1184
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,160
OpenFlow is the,

1185
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,680
that's what is controlled by Open Daylight.

1186
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,940
Okay, so this is like the controller-level stuff.

1187
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,520
Yes, but there are several other,

1188
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,880
like Big Switch has one,

1189
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,520
there's a few other proprietary implementations

1190
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,540
of OpenFlow controllers

1191
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,560
or things that interact with OpenFlow hardware.

1192
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,640
And so OpenFlow is able to be a controller

1193
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,440
that plugs in with Open Daylight

1194
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,760
because it follows a series of standards set forth

1195
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,280
by Open Daylight and software-defined networking.

1196
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,480
Like it follows these, it speaks these languages, correct?

1197
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,120
Yeah, so OpenFlow is, as a protocol then,

1198
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,080
it separates the control plane from the data plane

1199
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,960
so that you can have this centralized,

1200
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,520
standardized Open Daylight provides this

1201
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,080
as the OpenFlow controller,

1202
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,560
which then sends configuration

1203
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,660
to all the OpenFlow devices

1204
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,280
that actually end up switching your packets.

1205
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,120
And then that gets,

1206
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,160
that programs the ASICs and other forwarding paths

1207
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,080
on the hardware to then implement your VPNs,

1208
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,160
implement your layer two switches,

1209
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,000
implement your routers.

1210
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,800
Yep, yep, yep, your routes, your VLANs, all that stuff.

1211
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,640
So we, to try to better understand what the F

1212
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,600
all of this means,

1213
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,040
we decided we would take a very precious Tuesday,

1214
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,760
which is, you know, Wes has this time carved out

1215
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,680
from his day job, we have this time set aside

1216
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,240
with the mumble room to do this show.

1217
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,120
It's not just like, it's not just a thing

1218
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,760
we're flipping about, like we're gonna go somewhere

1219
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,920
during Linux Unplugged,

1220
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,000
it really kinda needs to be worth it.

1221
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,640
And so we decided to go down to Bellevue and check it out.

1222
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,560
And it was, the whole event itself was,

1223
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,200
it felt like it was really something set up

1224
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,460
for professionals that are in this industry

1225
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,680
that wanna get information,

1226
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,800
hey, this is what I'm working on,

1227
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,000
this is what we're working on.

1228
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,320
It was also, people were giving talks

1229
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,160
that were sort of highlighting the fact

1230
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,060
that we were two separate open source projects

1231
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,200
kind of working on the same thing

1232
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
and now we've come together as one open source project.

1233
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,040
That was kinda neat to see.

1234
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,680
I think that was a pretty neat theme

1235
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,240
and it was interesting to see just how it kinda,

1236
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,080
you know, it took the Linux community kind of a while

1237
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,840
to get to this like different corporations

1238
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,360
working together setup,

1239
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,400
and that's where Open Daylight is right now,

1240
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,960
where they're, you know, I think it's like different,

1241
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
different interest groups all seeing like,

1242
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,700
we have this shared interest

1243
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,240
that we can all work on together.

1244
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,800
Now, just from like our experience standpoint,

1245
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,720
I have not stopped thinking about that burger I ate.

1246
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,640
I'm like still thinking about that burger I got.

1247
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,560
Oh man, right?

1248
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,360
So I got, it was an homage to Dick's,

1249
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,120
which Dick's is a burger restaurant here in Seattle

1250
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,840
that is sort of famous.

1251
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,680
Yeah, I think so.

1252
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,400
And I think most people, when they come to Seattle,

1253
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,320
they like to get, they like to go to Dick's

1254
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,640
and get themselves a ridiculous Dick's burger.

1255
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,840
They're super greasy burgers

1256
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,560
and so this place made an homage to Dick's

1257
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,140
and I decided I gotta give it a try.

1258
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,960
It was really, really good.

1259
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,960
But the bacon salt was impressive,

1260
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,200
but damn, if Wes's burger,

1261
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,960
and I have a picture of this in the show notes

1262
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,840
if you're listening, you've gotta see this thing.

1263
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,100
This thing is nearly as tall as,

1264
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,040
this thing stands taller than your cell phone.

1265
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,160
So imagine a burger that is literally taller

1266
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
than your cell phone.

1267
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
It's probably taller than a can of Coke, right?

1268
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,000
It's taller than a can of Coke,

1269
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,840
it's taller than your cell phone.

1270
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,660
I think so.

1271
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,320
It is a legit, do you remember what was on this thing?

1272
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,640
Like there's egg and ham.

1273
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,840
There was ham, egg, a burger, hash browns,

1274
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,560
I think a hollandaise sauce was involved.

1275
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,400
Is that coleslaw?

1276
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,720
What's over here on the side?

1277
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,000
That's a good question, I'm not sure.

1278
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,840
Is it pulled pork?

1279
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,280
I can't tell because it's, and then there's a sauce,

1280
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,680
it's literally sitting in a pool of its own sauce.

1281
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,640
Yeah, sauce, egg, there's a big bowl of tater tots

1282
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,440
in the background there, slightly out of focus.

1283
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,280
Yeah, yeah.

1284
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,200
It was really a wonderful meal.

1285
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,660
Perfectly out of focus, you might note.

1286
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh yes.

1287
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,320
You might note.

1288
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Depth of field, lovely.

1289
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,680
Depth of field without two cameras,

1290
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,520
somehow I managed to pull it off.

1291
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,700
How did you do that?

1292
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,560
Yeah, so we had, I think it was neat to go down there,

1293
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,440
it was neat to talk to people,

1294
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,840
and we had a great chance to do some interviews.

1295
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,160
It was fun to kind of just be outsiders

1296
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,880
trying to understand this whole community.

1297
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,300
There was definitely moments where it's like,

1298
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,640
boy, some of this is going way over our head,

1299
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,680
and it was kind of hard to follow,

1300
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,200
but there were other moments where like,

1301
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,880
these are just struggles that all open source projects have,

1302
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,800
or these are common problems with organizing people.

1303
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,920
How do you build this kind of community, this movement?

1304
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,400
Yeah, so that kind of stuff was clear

1305
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,680
and it was easy to sort of identify with and see.

1306
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,840
So I had a good time going down there.

1307
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,640
I really enjoyed the trip,

1308
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,060
I enjoyed the opportunity to learn more,

1309
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,360
and so I wanted to kind of relay to some of you

1310
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,740
our experience, and I tried to do that

1311
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,460
in the Linux Action Show last week,

1312
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,720
and then I wanted to follow up on this episode

1313
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,640
with a couple of more interviews

1314
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,960
to kind of help you better understand

1315
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
of how large enterprises are using this

1316
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,320
and how open source projects are using this.

1317
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,560
So, let's start on the business side of things.

1318
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,160
Let's start with the enterprise side of things,

1319
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,840
because this will be the most high level interview

1320
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,440
that we have, the real big picture perspective.

1321
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,440
And what's great about it is, this is Balaji,

1322
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,420
and he starts out by explaining what 5G is,

1323
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,720
what's 5G networking, and why software defined networking

1324
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,520
is important in a 5G network.

1325
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,640
So not only do you get to learn about 5G networking,

1326
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
but you get to learn how this all comes together

1327
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,960
to support 5G networks.

1328
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,200
So that'll be Balaji,

1329
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,040
and then we'll have one more after this,

1330
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,440
and that'll be more of a, the next interview

1331
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,280
will be more of like a community, real life testing project,

1332
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,200
stuff like that.

1333
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,240
All right, so here we go with the high level.

1334
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,240
Yes, thanks for asking, that's a great question.

1335
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,440
So 5G is, some people think 5G is,

1336
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,920
okay, we upgrade from 4G to 5G.

1337
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,460
But actually, it's partially true.

1338
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,320
But 5G encompasses much bigger than that.

1339
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,240
5G includes our access, as well as the transport,

1340
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,800
and the data center, the cloud.

1341
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,400
So pulling all together, more of a holistic view.

1342
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,320
And then on top of that, also, in 5G,

1343
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,360
you know, the logical slicing of the network,

1344
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,120
it was already there in IP world,

1345
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,200
what we call virtual private network.

1346
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,480
In 5G, what we call network slicing,

1347
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,440
it's on a whole new level.

1348
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,000
So you slice the entire slice, network slice,

1349
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,460
on an existing network, logically separated,

1350
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,360
secured, isolated, to deliver, for example,

1351
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,040
to automobile industry, or to a healthcare industry.

1352
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,600
But it's all connected over the 5G network.

1353
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,120
Exactly, it's all part of the 5G network.

1354
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,720
And also, we also on the top,

1355
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,420
how do you do the life cycle management

1356
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,880
of the whole network slice?

1357
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,960
So you have the management layer, which is key,

1358
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,560
should be agile as well.

1359
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,480
That management layer consists of management,

1360
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,760
and orchestration, and analytics.

1361
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
So analytics will use it to close the loop.

1362
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,200
If there is a problem in the network,

1363
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
you can dynamically close the loop.

1364
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,480
Now you may ask me, what's the role of SDN?

1365
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,320
Yeah, I'm curious.

1366
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,920
Well, software-defined network goes across the board.

1367
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,200
So you can have an SDN for transport.

1368
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,800
So basically, the 5G requires to deliver services

1369
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,660
faster, time to market.

1370
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,640
And also, from design of your service,

1371
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
if a customer asks, if a vertical industry,

1372
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,960
like automobile industry, come to an operator,

1373
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,400
hey, I need a service, network slicing,

1374
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,860
sorry, I need a service.

1375
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,420
So we could actually create, design the service,

1376
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,760
create the service from the entire, you know,

1377
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,200
the process, business process, service fulfillment,

1378
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,120
all the way to delivering services.

1379
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,200
All these things should happen in a few days.

1380
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,880
I can't wait for a few months, right?

1381
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,480
That's what the agility we're looking at.

1382
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,160
So with, like, SDN, you kind of have the ability

1383
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,920
to reprogram on the fly.

1384
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,760
Yes.

1385
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,720
SDN is a cornerstone.

1386
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,120
It really is a catalyst, I call it,

1387
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,120
catalyst to enable that 5G transformation,

1388
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,200
and, you know, for network slicing.

1389
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,480
For example, SDN applies in many areas.

1390
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,120
For example, to set up end-to-end service,

1391
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,340
connectivity service, for in-transport network,

1392
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,800
you need to have a SDN-enabled transport network,

1393
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,360
so I can dynamically set up the connectivity.

1394
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,800
Also, you need to, you know, in 5G slicing,

1395
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,740
you need to have this mobile core, which is virtualized.

1396
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,840
So you need to connect all the VNFs.

1397
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,960
The VNF could be virtual machines, or it could be containers.

1398
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,460
So you need to make intra-data center connectivity.

1399
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,280
SDN plays a role on that.

1400
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,400
So orchestration, what the orchestration will do

1401
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,960
is it will connect all the dots.

1402
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,800
Sure.

1403
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,620
So it's all-

1404
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,460
And actually make it manageable.

1405
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,300
Exactly manageable.

1406
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,000
The full life cycle management.

1407
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,560
So since you did a great point talking about manageable,

1408
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,120
because any service is cradle to grave, right, the service.

1409
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,500
So the dynamic nature of service is very critical.

1410
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,780
So for example, if you create a mobile broadband service,

1411
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,980
and the consumer are consuming that service,

1412
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,720
and we are monitoring that, you apply the analytics,

1413
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
something happens to the mobile broadband slide.

1414
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,620
Remember, it's all virtual, right?

1415
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,680
So what we can do is, using the orchestration

1416
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,840
and analytics, and also leverage SDN,

1417
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,360
you can actually create another network slice,

1418
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,080
move your traffic, move the users, so you can-

1419
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,920
Exactly.

1420
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,440
This could be a stadium event.

1421
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,120
Imagine if there's a stadium and they want a new,

1422
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,840
you know, the network and services, right?

1423
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,680
Even events like this.

1424
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,120
Events like this, you want to build the whole thing

1425
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,080
that'll cost time and money, right?

1426
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,920
Absolutely.

1427
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,740
This one is pretty easy.

1428
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,880
Maybe in 30 minutes, you can create a mobile core

1429
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,920
using orchestration and SDN, so.

1430
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,080
Yeah, that is, what's really neat about that

1431
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,000
is what we're talking about here is,

1432
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,960
you could see how vendors could slice out

1433
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,960
their whole network that would span across multiple systems,

1434
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,840
multiple networks.

1435
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,920
And I think he kind of highlights

1436
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,600
how you can dynamically change it, right?

1437
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,160
So you don't have to go back and change your switches,

1438
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,360
or update the configs, or be like,

1439
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,640
oh no, now I need a router here,

1440
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,200
and we need switches all this way,

1441
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,400
and we need all these access points.

1442
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,040
You can fill places with generic hardware,

1443
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,080
and then on the fly, you can be like,

1444
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,400
nope, I need two network partitions of VPN connection

1445
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,840
bridging these two networks,

1446
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,840
and it just all gets programmed out there.

1447
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,020
Right after that, I asked him, I said,

1448
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,640
be honest with me, how hard was it for Ericsson?

1449
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,920
They're a big telco vendor, for sure.

1450
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,400
How hard was it for you to switch over

1451
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,320
to something like this?

1452
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,360
Like, was this one of those things

1453
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,800
where your company fought this tooth and nail?

1454
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,200
And he says, no, it actually,

1455
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,800
it just makes a ton of sense for them.

1456
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,120
It turned out it was obvious for them

1457
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,240
because there's been enough left by open daylight,

1458
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,600
and there's enough ambiguity

1459
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,200
around software-defined networking

1460
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,680
that there's a real need for people

1461
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,820
that understand huge networks and expertise

1462
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,400
to bring all this stuff together.

1463
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,440
And so for Ericsson, they don't feel like

1464
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,840
they're competitively disadvantaged

1465
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,560
working with the open daylight platform.

1466
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,560
They feel like, well, we've learned this thing,

1467
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,840
and we know how to make all of them connect.

1468
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,640
Like, I got a sense from them,

1469
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,280
they're truly, they had a lot of people there.

1470
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,120
They were really investing in something like this.

1471
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,200
It seemed very legitimate.

1472
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,160
And I was surprised because it seemed like

1473
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,760
there's companies that would traditionally

1474
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,880
be competing with each other,

1475
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,520
like Ericsson and like Cisco,

1476
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,140
and other switch manufacturers,

1477
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,720
they traditionally are competing with each other,

1478
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,560
and here they all are.

1479
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,760
With vertically integrated platforms trying to lock,

1480
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,600
you know?

1481
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,360
Yeah, yes, with these massive vertical platforms

1482
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,280
that have these huge support contracts,

1483
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,040
and here they are all giving each other

1484
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,320
these back-and-forth tips on how to make everything

1485
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,000
work better with these different summits.

1486
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,520
It's just unbelievable.

1487
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,440
It's kind of a great compromise where it's like,

1488
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,000
yes, there's still money in you

1489
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,200
and providing solutions that can manage this stuff,

1490
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,680
and at the same time building communities

1491
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,560
to have a common foundation that anyone can use.

1492
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,400
Yeah, if this stuff gets your interest going

1493
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,040
or just building networks, building systems,

1494
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,000
solving problems, solutions,

1495
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,400
I encourage you to check out our sponsor, Linux Academy.

1496
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1497
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,880
They have labs and hands-on exercises

1498
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,020
that give you scenario-based labs with real experience.

1499
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,480
They have instructor mentoring from humans when you need it.

1500
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,400
It's not some sort of digital bot.

1501
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,480
It's not some sort of AI assistant.

1502
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,900
It's real human beings.

1503
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,760
Note cards that you can fork and make your own

1504
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
or look at community versions of them.

1505
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,240
Nuggets for when you don't have a lot of time.

1506
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,120
You can deep dive into a tiny bit of wisdom

1507
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,480
about a singular topic.

1508
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,040
Video courses with self-paced, in-depth video courses

1509
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,880
for every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

1510
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,640
Of course, they've got Courseware on OpenStack,

1511
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,400
which plays well with Open Daylight,

1512
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,200
and obviously Azure as well.

1513
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,640
Check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

1514
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,900

1517
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,800
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

1518
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1519
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,040
This is a great time to tie that in

1520
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,400
because if any of this kind of stuff

1521
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,600
is over your head a little bit,

1522
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,680
there's great Courseware on all of this stuff.

1523
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,080
So, I want to talk about Heather and Chris's experience.

1524
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,040
They were great to talk to.

1525
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,400
Heather's from the Linux Foundation,

1526
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,480
Chris is from Ericsson,

1527
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,320
and also works with the Open Daylight project.

1528
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,120
And they talk about real world,

1529
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,360
how they use it, why the foundation cares,

1530
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,880
and all of that kind of stuff.

1531
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,320
I'm here with Chris and Heather,

1532
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,080
and Chris is from Ericsson,

1533
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,240
and Heather is from the Linux Foundation.

1534
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,080
And I'm hoping they're gonna fill in a few dots for us

1535
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,900
from both cases.

1536
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,160
So, Heather, let's start with you.

1537
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,560
I'm really kind of looking forward to picking your brain

1538
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,160
because I know a lot of folks listening

1539
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,580
have heard of the Linux Foundation,

1540
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,480
they've heard of Open Daylight,

1541
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,120
maybe they don't know how the two are connected

1542
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,940
and where you fit in.

1543
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,960
So, fill them in.

1544
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,240
Yeah, so the Linux Foundation has started doing

1545
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,460
what they call collaborative projects,

1546
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,560
where they are providing sort of the framework

1547
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,960
for other open source communities

1548
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,840
to sort of come together and form their project

1549
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,760
and be affiliated with the Linux Foundation,

1550
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,800
take advantage of the expertise that the LF has built up

1551
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,160
over the years around open source governance,

1552
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,160
communities, IPR, licensing, events,

1553
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,800
all that kind of stuff.

1554
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,680
And so, the Open Daylight was one of their very early

1555
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,200
projects that they did in the networking space.

1556
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,760
And that has been an area that has been growing a lot

1557
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,440
for the LF in the past several years.

1558
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,320
So, as sort of the networking industry is looking to both,

1559
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,780
I think, take advantage of advances in software,

1560
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,660
as well as sort of open source

1561
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,400
as a sort of development strategy,

1562
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,120
a lot of projects have been flocking to the LF.

1563
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,980
So, it seems like the Linux Foundation

1564
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,600
really made this connection at the right time

1565
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,440
because this is an area that's growing like crazy.

1566
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,160
So, do you have a project that's connected

1567
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,440
with Open Daylight, where's your role in there?

1568
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah, so I head up a project called OPNFV,

1569
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,880
which is focused on network function virtualization,

1570
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,040
which you may have seen in sort of Nila's keynote

1571
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,140
this morning, but it's a big use case for SDN.

1572
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,360
And it's the way the sort of the global operators

1573
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,960
are modernizing and transforming their networks

1574
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,760
to be more virtualized, more agile,

1575
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,560
and more software based.

1576
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,320
And so, we are a sister project to Open Daylight,

1577
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,560
work with them quite closely, as well as other LF

1578
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,720
and other open source organizations like OpenStack

1579
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
and things like that that aren't affiliated with LF.

1580
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,600
So, are you building on top of Open Daylight

1581
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,720
to, for your project, is that my understanding?

1582
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,480
So, our project is actually very interesting.

1583
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,620
It's a systems integration project, really.

1584
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,640
So, as an open source project.

1585
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,560
And Chris is our technical steering committee chair,

1586
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,440
so he can probably get into more details about that.

1587
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,400
But what we do is we actually compose

1588
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,920
sort of an end to end NFV platform based on components

1589
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,320
that sort of fulfill different parts of the stack.

1590
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,100
So, that could be Open Daylight

1591
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,760
or other open source SDN controllers.

1592
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,020
It could be OpenStack.

1593
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,600
There's a new LF project called FD.io

1594
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,720
that we also sort of integrated in this time.

1595
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,480
We work with OVS, which is now newly a Linux Foundation CP.

1596
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,600
And so, we sort of do that work of building

1597
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,240
sort of a composed platform, doing system level tests,

1598
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,720
and then taking feedback back to those upstream

1599
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,880
organizations to make all of their components

1600
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,000
more NFV ready.

1601
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,360
Wow, that's super important.

1602
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,760
So, Chris, how does this sort of translate

1603
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,000
to real world things that matter to Ericsson?

1604
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,660
So, the NFV journey affects everyone,

1605
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,280
from the vendors to the operators.

1606
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,680
It's obviously an operator journey

1607
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,800
that the vendors need to be participating in.

1608
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,000
When it comes to the NFV platform and how it's built,

1609
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,600
for us being able to work collaboratively on,

1610
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,120
for instance, bringing Open Daylight into an OpenStack

1611
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,880
enabled end to end solution,

1612
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,560
providing a framework for applications to run on,

1613
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,560
for network orchestration, to overlay.

1614
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
It's extremely important for us to be part of that,

1615
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,760
to help facilitate how that's gonna work,

1616
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,960
how it best serves the operators needs.

1617
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,760
And of course, as a vendor, it provides us

1618
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,240
with that foundation on which we can provide our product.

1619
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,680
So, Ericsson has a booth here, right?

1620
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,500
Yes, we do.

1621
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,440
And there's several staff members here.

1622
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,880
It seems to be something that's getting

1623
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,560
an area of a lot of focus.

1624
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,280
What's Ericsson's history with Open Daylight?

1625
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,600
So, we are a founding member.

1626
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,120
I have been serving on the Technical Steering Committee

1627
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,800
myself for Open Daylight for the period that it's existed.

1628
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,440
So, that's, well, yeah.

1629
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,160
And he has been serving as RTSC Chair at OPNFV

1630
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,560
since it has existed.

1631
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,900
Exactly.

1632
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,920
So, from an Ericsson perspective,

1633
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,840
we see Open Daylight as extremely important.

1634
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,260
When it comes to transforming the network,

1635
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,320
when it comes to enabling new use cases

1636
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,600
and new capabilities in a carrier environment,

1637
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,120
it is our platform of choice.

1638
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,680
It's what we believe is the best long-term

1639
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,200
and short-term bet to really bring that out

1640
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,200
and leverage a cohesive and diverse ecosystem.

1641
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,280
It fits into OPNFV projects.

1642
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,320
It fits into the whole ecosystem

1643
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,120
and provides not just a vertical piece.

1644
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,280
A lot of components and a lot of CPS

1645
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,760
will solve a specific problem and do it very well.

1646
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,720
Open Daylight's a platform that provides you

1647
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,520
with the freedom to iterate and to sort of throw something

1648
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,160
on the side that can then interwork

1649
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,040
with what's sort of there.

1650
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,800
Provides a place to innovate

1651
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,320
within the context of a broader network.

1652
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,800
So, for us, it's extremely important

1653
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,640
that Open Daylight is healthy,

1654
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,680
that it feeds the whole ecosystem,

1655
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,040
and that it enables us, our competitors,

1656
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,040
and our customers to really just innovate

1657
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,160
and create that new network.

1658
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,200
So, what drew you to get involved personally

1659
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,600
with the project so long ago?

1660
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,200
So, I was actually doing network management

1661
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,480
back in the day when Open Daylight started.

1662
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,640
And what we were finding in network management

1663
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,960
is that we were trying to propose new capabilities

1664
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,680
that we saw were really needed.

1665
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,400
And something like Open Daylight comes along

1666
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,160
and it's like, we're gonna build these capabilities.

1667
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,400
And it's like, aha, okay, this is where we need to be.

1668
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,320
And it was really clear.

1669
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,760
And Open Daylight brings the ability

1670
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,680
to modernize existing networks

1671
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,120
and adopt new technologies at the same time.

1672
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,800
So, it's not just the, here's the new technology

1673
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
or here's an old NMS or something.

1674
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,760
It finds that difficult place in between

1675
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,880
that allows you to move forwards.

1676
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,120
So, what's next in your eye for Open Daylight?

1677
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,000
More of the same.

1678
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,800
Well, no, not more, more.

1679
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,640
Just more.

1680
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,120
More adoption, more involvement.

1681
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,960
More.

1682
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,800
More is more.

1683
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,000
More is more in this case.

1684
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,920
More momentum, all that stuff is in there.

1685
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,880
So, Open Daylight grows.

1686
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,320
Release over release over release.

1687
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,200
Every release I've been participating in,

1688
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,880
the things are more stable,

1689
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,000
the community's bigger,

1690
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,040
there's more commercial engagement.

1691
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,240
So, from that perspective,

1692
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,280
this is what I think is next for Open Daylight as well.

1693
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,840
What we see coming in the industry

1694
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,000
that can take advantage of that momentum

1695
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,280
is the ability for Open Daylight to work

1696
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,720
very smoothly with OpenStack,

1697
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,360
to extend OpenStack capabilities,

1698
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,800
bring in carrier and access technologies

1699
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,000
into that environment,

1700
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,800
and also work with how containers

1701
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,920
are gonna integrate into that environment as well.

1702
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,000
Can you elaborate on that a bit?

1703
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,840
No.

1704
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,680
No.

1705
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,000
I don't want to be here.

1706
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,520
Just Docker, I don't know.

1707
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,360
Nobody uses that.

1708
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,200
So, here's a plug.

1709
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,280
So, in the Colorado release,

1710
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,080
which we released yesterday.

1711
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,920
Yesterday.

1712
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,760
It's still yesterday.

1713
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,600
Wow.

1714
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,560
Our third release, exactly.

1715
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,320
On schedule, no, I missed that.

1716
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,720
On schedule to the day that we had agreed to,

1717
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,640
like eight months ago, or seven months ago.

1718
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,600
Seven months ago.

1719
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,000
So, in that release, the Colorado release of OPNV,

1720
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,440
we have an NFV environment

1721
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,520
which contains LXD containers and VMs,

1722
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,920
and you can plug Open Daylight into that,

1723
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,240
and you can use Open Daylight

1724
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,800
in order to be able to network

1725
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,000
between the containers and the VMs.

1726
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,720
So, you can then orchestrate your whole network.

1727
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,800
Exactly.

1728
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,800
End-to-end, front-to-back, you know,

1729
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,680
and that's why we're in OPNV,

1730
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,640
because we're able to bring these technologies

1731
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,760
on board, new concepts,

1732
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,520
provide a platform upon which Open Daylight

1733
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,600
and others can integrate, build out,

1734
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,480
and test new capabilities, and prove them.

1735
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,240
So, not just write a bit of code

1736
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,440
and put it through their compiler

1737
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,360
and have a thing at the end,

1738
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,880
but actually prove and test end-to-end use cases.

1739
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,720
That's the real value.

1740
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
Seems like you're modeling that way,

1741
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,600
like kind of how it's necessarily going to end up

1742
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,800
being deployed in the real world.

1743
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,320
That's what we're trying to do, exactly.

1744
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,800
I mean, we have, in OPNV,

1745
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,280
we have things like the Pharos tests.

1746
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,120
I'm gonna let Heather talk.

1747
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:45,960
I talk too much.

1748
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,800
But, Pharos.

1749
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,800
I talk too much, too. Tell us about Pharos.

1750
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,640
Yeah.

1751
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,080
So, Pharos is our federated community test lab project

1752
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:57,080
where both end users and vendors are bringing test labs

1753
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,240
in different environments.

1754
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,880
So, different hardware from different vendors

1755
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,800
and hardware across different architectures.

1756
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,000
And it's tied into our CICD pipeline

1757
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,280
so that we actually are deploying

1758
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,760
sort of various flavors of an NFV platform

1759
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,960
into multiple environments on multiple hardware.

1760
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,640
And we do that many, many, many times

1761
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,040
heading into a release.

1762
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,440
So, not only do we feel fairly comfortable,

1763
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,280
we've gotten, say, OpenStack and ODL

1764
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,440
working with each other.

1765
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,880
We know that OpenStack and ODL

1766
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,080
are working with each other on, you know,

1767
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,760
sort of the OEMs that folks like Ericsson

1768
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,800
or Huawei or Cisco are using or Intel Whitebox

1769
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,120
or this time we added in ARM architectures

1770
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,160
or Dell or HPE.

1771
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,120
So, you know, we're really sort of, yeah.

1772
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,920
And it's, you know, and tied in and automated.

1773
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,960
So, we actually are sort of both scaling

1774
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,720
our ability to do testing,

1775
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,360
but then also sort of doing

1776
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,840
a lot of the vendor interoperability testing

1777
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,600
sort of just as part of our development process.

1778
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,440
Wow.

1779
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,520
So, if I wanted, if I'm listening,

1780
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,200
I want to learn more about OPNFV,

1781
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,040
where would I go?

1782
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,160
Wiki.opnfv.org.

1783
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,400
Easy peasy.

1784
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,400
So, they were both great to talk to

1785
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,400
and we chatted some more.

1786
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,400
And we wrapped up,

1787
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
there'll be some other stuff

1788
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,400
you might hear from them in the future,

1789
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,400
but a little bit after that,

1790
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,400
you had a chance to go to a conference

1791
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
and talk a little bit more about

1792
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
what's going on with OPNFV

1793
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
and what's going on with OPNFV.

1794
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,400
So, if you're interested,

1795
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,400
you can go to OPNFV.org

1796
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,400
and find out more about OPNFV

1797
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
and you had a chance to go to another session.

1798
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Yes, I did.

1799
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
And which was that?

1800
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,400
I went to a talk about bringing some Scala

1801
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,400
into the Open Daylight code base.

1802
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Right now, it's mostly a Java code base

1803
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,400
and then I guess it's mostly configured in XML,

1804
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
which are not everyone's favorite things.

1805
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,400
I'm sure Linus would not love that.

1806
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Not everyone's favorite,

1807
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,400
but they're obviously very much used

1808
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,400
in enterprise environments.

1809
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,400
And the talk was kind of interesting.

1810
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
There's not a large deployment of Scala right now,

1811
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,400
but I know some companies involved in Open Daylight

1812
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,400
are kind of playing with it.

1813
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,400
It brings a more elegant approach.

1814
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
It's kind of a merged language

1815
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
that has both object-oriented

1816
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
and functional design patterns included in it.

1817
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
So, it can be scaled a little bit nicer.

1818
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
They showed some really interesting examples

1819
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,400
showing like, here's all this Java boilerplate.

1820
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,400
The Scala language also includes a lot of type inference,

1821
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,400
that sort of thing.

1822
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,400
So, you can save on boilerplate code.

1823
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Nice.

1824
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
As well as, at least for the current version of Scala,

1825
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
the XML parsing,

1826
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,400
XML is pretty much integrated into the language.

1827
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,400
So, it kind of makes it very elegant

1828
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
to work with the configurations

1829
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,400
when it's already valid Scala code.

1830
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Yeah, not to mention if you've already got

1831
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,400
a lot of time spent with Scala.

1832
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,400
It's really nice that then you can move that time,

1833
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,400
that investment, and that knowledge over.

1834
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
And then, at the same time,

1835
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
the Scala code base can very,

1836
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
or at least somewhat easily,

1837
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
reference Java code bases, Java libraries.

1838
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Oh, yeah, okay.

1839
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Saves a lot of time.

1840
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
Yeah.

1841
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Now, that is our experience.

1842
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
That's our Open Daylight Summit experience.

1843
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,400
We might have some future clips coming up

1844
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
that aren't exactly Open Daylight Summit related.

1845
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
They were recorded there,

1846
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,400
including creating a new distribution around this

1847
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,400
and also managing community and infrastructure around this.

1848
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
But those felt more like those could be applicable

1849
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
to a lot of different open source projects.

1850
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
So, I think we'll probably play those

1851
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,400
in future episodes of The Unplugged Show.

1852
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Now, Wes, flash check there.

1853
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Mr. Wimpy, are you still on the line over there?

1854
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,400
Over.

1855
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
I see that name that I love.

1856
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Yeah.

1857
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,400
Wimpy, hello, Wimpy.

1858
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,400
This is even cooler.

1859
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Wimpy, I wanted to ask,

1860
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
what are you learning now about Open Media Vault

1861
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
and sort of your reactions and follow-up

1862
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,400
to the review we did recently on the Linux Action Show?

1863
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,400
I know starting with perhaps your thoughts

1864
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,400
on how to actually get UPS monitoring working,

1865
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,400
which was a complaint I had in my review of Open Media Vault.

1866
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay.

1867
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,400
So, I have decommissioned my Open Media Vault 2 servers

1868
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,400
and now have Open Media Vault 3 servers in place.

1869
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,400
All in.

1870
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Nice.

1871
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
Not even stable yet and you're all in.

1872
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,400
Yeah.

1873
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,400
Yeah.

1874
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,400
And I did that with 2 as well, actually.

1875
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
I was running 2 whilst it was in beta for some time.

1876
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,400
Nice.

1877
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
And that's really because I have faith in the project

1878
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
and the plug-ins that I need are available,

1879
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,400
so I'm making the switch.

1880
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,400
Yeah.

1881
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,400
I've got a simple UPS.

1882
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,400
It's connected via USB.

1883
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,400
And the plug-in in Open Media Vault is the NUT plug-in,

1884
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
which is the...

1885
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
Oh, okay.

1886
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
It's the network UPS tool or something like that.

1887
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
Right.

1888
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,400
I did see that, but that seemed like that was only applicable

1889
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,400
to UPSs connected by IP that manage multiple machines.

1890
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,400
Yeah.

1891
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,400
It's, I think, a misnomer from the heritage of the project.

1892
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,400
It's been called NUT forever, but in actual fact,

1893
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,400
it can monitor UPSs that are plugged in over RS232 and UPS.

1894
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Oh, that's great.

1895
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Okay.

1896
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
I have one of those.

1897
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,400
So, yeah, if you've got a UPS that is compatible with NUT,

1898
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,400
it will work with Open Media Vault.

1899
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,400
And, yeah, the configuration changes that you might stick in

1900
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Etsy default, there's a little text dialog within Open Media Vault

1901
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,400
to send your UPS any additional config should it need it

1902
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
for listening to the data.

1903
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,400
So there's some specifics allowed there.

1904
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
That's nice.

1905
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Yeah.

1906
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
And then you can hook that up.

1907
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,400
So the network piece is that you can have one box monitor the UPS,

1908
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,400
and then you can have other boxes monitor that machine,

1909
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
or that machine tell the other boxes.

1910
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,400
So in my case, when that main server detects the UPS has gone active,

1911
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
it then tells everything else to shut down.

1912
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Yeah.

1913
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,400
Right.

1914
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,400
So if I had multiple servers, I could use that.

1915
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,400
That is nice.

1916
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,400
Yeah.

1917
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,400
That is really nice.

1918
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,400
Okay.

1919
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,400
That's worth spending some time setting up then.

1920
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
Yeah.

1921
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,400
And then generally speaking, I've got the Plex plug-in up and running.

1922
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,400
That's doing all of that.

1923
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,400
I use NFS because I've got all of my local stuff sitting there running.

1924
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,400
I access that way.

1925
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,400
I've got one Samba share for when family visit,

1926
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,400
and they might want to deposit some photos somewhere.

1927
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,400
So I just have a general purpose Samba share up and running for them too.

1928
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,400
It's actually very useful.

1929
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Data into.

1930
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Yeah.

1931
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:05,400
And then without using Open Media Vault itself, I have a Dropbox,

1932
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,400
headless Dropbox running.

1933
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,400
And I do that so that I have an always LAN sync copy of my Dropbox on the network.

1934
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,400
I've done that too.

1935
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,400
That makes sense, yeah.

1936
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,400
But then what I also do is I do an R snapshot backup of that Dropbox.

1937
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:27,400
So if Dropbox ever go away for whatever reason,

1938
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,400
I actually have a full offline copy of my Dropbox.

1939
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
I should relook at how I do that.

1940
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
I kind of do something similar, but I'm not using R snapshot,

1941
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
and that would be a good tool for that.

1942
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
Yeah.

1943
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,400
And then I also have Act Cacher NG, which again is just installed

1944
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
because it's Debian at the back end.

1945
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,400
It's not through Open Media Vault itself,

1946
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,400
and that's so all of the machines I have on my network here,

1947
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,400
when they do their apt updates, they go through this caching proxy

1948
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,400
rather than all sucking stuff down over the network each time.

1949
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,400
Now, boy, that is something we should – let's talk about that more next week.

1950
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
Let's talk about how you do that next week,

1951
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,400
because I think that's like digital ocean level local speeds there.

1952
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
I've got to talk about that.

1953
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah, and when you're connected to the internet with a radio connection,

1954
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,400
you want that kind of stuff.

1955
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
Suddenly these optimizations become important.

1956
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,400
You know, I wasn't sure if the review was fair or not.

1957
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,400
I had a really hard time afterwards.

1958
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
I wasn't clear because I think it's a really good project,

1959
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,400
and I think it is much more competitive than people give it credit for,

1960
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,400
or really like the name recognition.

1961
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,400
It doesn't get the name recognition it deserves.

1962
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Yeah, it's bulletproof.

1963
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,400
I mean, your criticism was you had a specific use case,

1964
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,400
which was connecting a server to another server over NFS.

1965
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
Or potentially a couple of back end.

1966
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Yeah, and I'd suggest that maybe iSCSI is the better tool.

1967
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,400
I think you're right.

1968
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,400
If iSCSI is supported by these storage appliances,

1969
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,400
that would probably be a better tool, and that would work.

1970
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,400
And it would show up in all of the applications as volume.

1971
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah.

1972
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
That would be nice.

1973
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:12,400
I think what I walked away with was a sort of relief.

1974
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,400
I know that sounds weird, but I have been feeling anxious

1975
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
that Linux didn't have a FreeNAS competitor.

1976
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Yeah, no, that's very well said.

1977
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,400
We don't have a great solid PF sense, at least in my estimation so far.

1978
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,400
We don't have a great solid PF sense competitor,

1979
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
and I thought the same was true with FreeNAS.

1980
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
And then I looked at Open Media Vault,

1981
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,400
and I realized it's a pretty damn good product.

1982
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,400
In some ways, the way it is right now kind of echoes

1983
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:44,400
how it is the Linux version of the way FreeNAS is more compared to FreeBSD.

1984
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
Yeah, yeah.

1985
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,400
And those things I like.

1986
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I like those things about it.

1987
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
I like that it's based on Debian.

1988
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,400
I like GrayHole.

1989
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,400
I like the idea of managing my storage with GrayHole.

1990
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,400
That really solved a problem for me that I had

1991
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,400
that I couldn't quite figure out how I was going to solve.

1992
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,400
And so it's a pretty competitive product, and it has a great heritage,

1993
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,400
and it's based on a solid Debian base.

1994
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,400
And I wasn't sure how the review came off, but then we got the emails.

1995
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,400
The emails started coming in, and I got a few emails where people said,

1996
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,400
Hey, after your review, I decided to give it a try.

1997
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
I'm switching over.

1998
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
I decided to give it a shot.

1999
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,400
And that feels good because I didn't want to discourage people from trying it.

2000
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,400
Yeah.

2001
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,400
Because I'm actually going to put it into deployment at Angela's house,

2002
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,400
and if you think about it, that's sort of the most trusting scenario because I –

2003
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,400
You do not want to have to go deal with that.

2004
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,400
Exactly.

2005
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,400
I want to set it up.

2006
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,400
I want to give her a UI for it to work, and I want it to be bulletproof,

2007
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,400
and I want to learn from that over time, and I'm going to manage it,

2008
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,400
but I want it to be really self-reliant.

2009
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Yeah, exactly.

2010
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,400
And so that's where we're going to go next.

2011
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,400
I was surprised to see that one of my coworkers had an open media vault with ZFS set up.

2012
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Oh, yeah?

2013
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,400
And he's fairly technical but doesn't have a huge Linux history,

2014
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,400
so I was like, well, that obviously works pretty well for you if you can get that going.

2015
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,400
He's had it for a number of years.

2016
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,400
Well, if you don't know what we're talking about because – who was – Mosinrath.

2017
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,400
Mosinrath, if you don't know what we're talking about, open media vault,

2018
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,400
go check out the recent episodes of the Linux action show.

2019
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,400
If you go to jupitabroadcaching.com and you go to the Linux action show page,

2020
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:26,400
we did an open media revolt just like two weeks ago, episode 436 of the Linux action show.

2021
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,400
We did open media vault versus FreeNAS because bump, bump, bump.

2022
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,400
Versus sells those clicks, man.

2023
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,400
It does, and both Noah and I have a lot of experience with FreeNAS,

2024
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,400
so it just made sense that we would be comparing it constantly to FreeNAS.

2025
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,400
It's what the market, you know.

2026
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,400
And it's what people are curious about.

2027
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,400
So that was episode 4, Hyundai, and 36 of the Linux action show,

2028
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
which is ridiculous that that number starts with a 4.

2029
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,400
That's awesome.

2030
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
That's crazy.

2031
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Linux action show is ridiculous.

2032
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,400
And also, if you want more open daylight summit or software-defined networking

2033
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,400
or just want to get a better feel for what it's like to go to a summit like that,

2034
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,400
if you've never been, definitely check out the most recent episode,

2035
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,400
437 of the Linux action show, or go to our YouTube channel,

2036
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,400
youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

2037
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,400
There's a mini rover log posted of our trip to the open daylight summit.

2038
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,400
Pretty fun.

2039
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Yeah, it was fun.

2040
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,400
And we did a little video at that place that had the best burgers out.

2041
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,400
Okay.

2042
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,400
Now, you can stop me at any point if a lie is coming out of my mouth.

2043
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,400
Okay, I will.

2044
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,400
I absolutely will.

2045
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:34,400
At the lunchbox, while we were sitting there, an intelligent, well-spoken,

2046
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:41,400
attractive, well-dressed young lady came up and started a conversation with us.

2047
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
And why did she do that, Wes?

2048
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,400
That would be my Linux action show T-shirt.

2049
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Is it?

2050
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
It was legit.

2051
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,400
For the first time ever.

2052
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,400
I couldn't believe it.

2053
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,400
That was great.

2054
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,400
And we didn't have it on camera.

2055
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,400
But we actually got approached because we were wearing a Linux shirt by a girl.

2056
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
And she was there, a lady, a woman.

2057
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,400
I believe it was Intel.

2058
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,400
Yeah, I think she was there as, you know, she was there.

2059
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
But she was just, she loved Linux.

2060
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,400
And she came up and said, hey, I saw you had a Linux shirt on.

2061
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,400
I just want to talk.

2062
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Where can I find out more information?

2063
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,400
So if she happens to be watching this episode of the Linux action show, I don't remember

2064
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,400
your name.

2065
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
So be sure to tweet me at Chris LAS.

2066
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,400
Yeah, please.

2067
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,400
We'd love to have you as part of the community, part of the Mumble Room here.

2068
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,400
You should join our Mumble Room.

2069
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,400
We're over at jblive.tv.

2070
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,400
And here's the nice thing.

2071
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,400
The Mumble Room is open to anybody.

2072
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
So you could join us.

2073
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,400
And I have been hoping to get a female voice on this show for a long time.

2074
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
We get them from time to time when we invite them directly.

2075
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,400
But I know our community has, yeah, it would be wonderful to have more.

2076
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,400
I have a feeling that you just, you know, don't worry.

2077
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,400
Don't worry.

2078
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,400
It is a totally low pressure environment.

2079
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,400
You come hang out with us.

2080
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
We just check your microphone.

2081
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,400
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com.

2082
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,400
We make sure your microphone works and you can join us in our Mumble Room and take part

2083
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,400
of our virtual lug.

2084
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,400
You can all convert to the calendar page.

2085
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:54,400
You can also leave us your feedback at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar or linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

2086
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Check out this Sunday's Linux Action Show.

2087
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Do it.

2088
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,400
We're going to have our review of Plasma 5.8, the long term support edition.

2089
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,400
We'll tell you how that goes.

2090
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,400
I'm excited already.

2091
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,400
Also, I'm sure in future episodes of the Unplugged program, we'll have a little more interviews

2092
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,400
from the floor of Open Daylight Summit.

2093
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,400
So look forward to that, too.

2094
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,400
More community stuff, technical stuff, good stuff.

2095
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,400
Thanks for being here.

2096
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,400
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

2097
01:16:45,400 --> 01:17:06,400
All right, guys, head over to JBtitles.com right now and get your submissions in and

2098
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,400
vote, vote, vote.

2099
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,400
You heard it right.

2100
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,400
That's banksuggest.com.

2101
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,400
That is just how I say it.

2102
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,400
That was good.

2103
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,400
JBtitles.com.

2104
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,400
Go there now.

2105
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,400
For a second, I thought it was Chris.

2106
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,400
Hey, is that Chris?

2107
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,400
That's not Chris.

2108
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,400
For a second there, they thought it was.

2109
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
JBtitles.

2110
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,400
I mean, you already fooled them with that Plasma video that only kind of sounded like

2111
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,400
you.

2112
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Who knows?

2113
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
We keep you guessing on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

2114
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,400
So, Mr. Wimpy, are you employed, unemployed, employed again?

2115
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,400
What's your status right now?

2116
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,400
I am employed.

2117
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,400
I'm in my second week in the new job.

2118
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
And how is it going?

2119
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Yeah, going very well.

2120
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Thank you.

2121
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
Congratulations.

2122
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,400
Glad to hear that.

2123
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,400
And already hard at work?

2124
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
Yes.

2125
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Yes.

2126
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:05,400
So I've been getting to know the team and I've been assigned some stuff to get on with

2127
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:12,400
and 1610's around the corner, so everyone's working on fixing the last bits and bobs for

2128
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
that.

2129
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Huh.

2130
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
That sounds delightful.

2131
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,400
And do you get to share what bits and bobs you get to work on?

2132
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:25,400
Well, I'm on the desktop team, so I'm working on desktop stuff.

2133
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:35,400
So at the moment, for 1610, I'm mostly working on some fixes for Unity 7.

2134
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:42,400
But then in a couple of weeks, all of the Ubuntu engineering staff are getting together

2135
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:51,400
for a sprint to plan out the next six months and snaps, Snappy and Unity 8 feature in all

2136
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400
of that work.

2137
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,400
I just saw a news item go by that the software center got support for screenshots of Snap

2138
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,400
packages.

2139
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,400
So Snap packages can have screenshots in the software center, which is really nice.

2140
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,400
Yeah, they're just nice.

2141
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Yeah.

2142
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,400
So the sprint that's coming up is an internal company one, but I was looking through.

2143
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:16,400
There are some guests and some of the same community contributors that were at the Snappy

2144
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,400
sprint are being invited back again, so that's good to see.

2145
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,400
And are you able to work from home, Wimpy?

2146
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
Are you going into an office?

2147
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,400
I work from home all the time.

2148
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,400
So one of the things I've been busy with is actually building my home office.

2149
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Oh, I would love to hear about that.

2150
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
Yeah, so that's finished now.

2151
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,400
What do you mean when you say build?

2152
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,400
What's the extent of that?

2153
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,400
Did you build a new room or did you redo a room or did you set up a desk?

2154
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,400
What's that?

2155
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
When you say build an office.

2156
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,400
Yeah, I redid a room.

2157
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,400
So I used to have an office in the house years ago, and then after my daughter was born,

2158
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,400
that room sort of became the room of crap and boxes and everything that sort of gets

2159
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,400
displaced when children enter a house.

2160
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,400
And there are things that come in so many boxes, really.

2161
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,400
Oh my goodness.

2162
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:08,400
So it was just like six years worth of clutter and mess.

2163
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,400
So yeah, it took about five weekends to clear it all up, redecorate.

2164
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:19,400
So I've got three desks in here and two racks and several servers.

2165
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
Oh, that's great.

2166
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,400
Lots of laptops and computers all set up, all easy access.

2167
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,400
So I've got lots of space to do my work.

2168
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,400
Were you able to make any accommodations for that podcasting thing that you find yourself

2169
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,400
doing so much now?

2170
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Yeah, so the desk I'm sat on here has got a Rode arm on it with the mic on it so that

2171
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,400
can swivel away out of the way when I'm not using it.

2172
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
And the mixer's on the desk here.

2173
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,400
So yeah, it's all nicely arranged.

2174
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
It's very comfortable.

2175
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,400
It's nice when you get a chance to redo all that, when things have transitioned and you

2176
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,400
do new things and you kind of have new things that you need to accommodate.

2177
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,400
It's a great time to be able to redo the home office.

2178
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,400
Yeah, it really is.

2179
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,400
And I was reading about working from home, and one of the bits of advice was make sure

2180
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:07,400
your work environment is comfortable and a nice place to be.

2181
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
So I've worked hard on that.

2182
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,400
My wife's helped as well.

2183
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,400
So my wife has made this contraption where I've actually got a pull-down green screen

2184
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,400
from the ceiling as well now.

2185
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,400
Now look at this.

2186
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,400
Now what's the green screen for?

2187
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Well, occasionally I do video stuff and green screen's handy for that.

2188
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,400
Yeah, I've noticed.

2189
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,400
Also, my wife is a little bit privacy conscious, so putting the green screen up means that

2190
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
you can't see anything on her side of the office.

2191
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,400
Oh, that's nice.

2192
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,400
That is nice.

2193
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Yeah, so she's put this green screen so I can pull the green screen down from the ceiling

2194
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,400
and tuck it away again when I don't need it.

2195
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,400
That's nice.

2196
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,400
I was thinking about doing something kind of like that in a workspace that I'm thinking

2197
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,400
about using.

2198
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:57,400
So was that actually like a kitsch you bought or how did you get a tuck away green screen?

2199
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,400
My wife made it.

2200
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,400
That's awesome.

2201
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,400
So she bought the fabric a while ago and then she's bought all sorts of bits and pieces

2202
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,400
and actually constructed it herself.

2203
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,400
So I went away.

2204
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,400
So one of the things I was doing a couple of weeks ago is I went to give some presentations

2205
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:18,400
to some charities in this country about Linux and open source and the role it might play

2206
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,400
in their organizations.

2207
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,400
And whilst I was away doing that for a few days, I came back and found this green screen

2208
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,400
hanging from the ceiling when I came back.

2209
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,400
So yeah, that was her little job whilst I was away, which is pretty cool.

2210
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,400
I didn't know she was going to do it.

2211
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,400
That's awesome.

2212
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,400
So you got the new computers.

2213
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,400
You got a new workspace.

2214
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,400
That's a good setup.

2215
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,400
Yeah.

2216
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Yeah.

2217
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,400
I'm all.

2218
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,400
Yeah.

2219
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,400
Yeah.

2220
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Yeah.

2221
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,400
Yeah.

2222
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Well, that sounds really cool.

2223
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,400
I would love to.

2224
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,400
Do they take.

2225
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,400
Do they have guests over there?

2226
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,400
Of course, you don't.

2227
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,400
Have you ever.

2228
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,400
Have you gone to their officials?

2229
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,400
So how did that work?

2230
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Like when your first couple of days and orientation, did you travel?

2231
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,400
You traveled to an office.

2232
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,400
You spent time there.

2233
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,400
And then once your actual day to day work started, you went back to your home and started

2234
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,400
working.

2235
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,400
Nope.

2236
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Nope.

2237
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,400
It was all done remote.

2238
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,400
So I have been to the.

2239
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Yeah.

2240
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,400
Yeah.

2241
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,400
It was.

2242
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,400
Yeah.

2243
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,400
So I have been to the office once before, but that was, you know, as a community contributor,

2244
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,400
right?

2245
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:20,880
You might remember I took part in the user testing studies for Unity eight a while back.

2246
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,040
So that's the only time I've been to the, to the main office.

2247
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:33,160
But no, they the various departments liaise with you remotely and leading up to it, you,

2248
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:37,480
you do things like sorting out your payroll and all of that with the HR departments.

2249
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,480
Right.

2250
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:46,600
And then on day one, you get all of your accounts allocated and you through launch pad you log

2251
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,080
in and then you're able to access an area where you can access all of your credentials.

2252
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:57,240
And then the first day is basically setting up all of your, you know, access to everything.

2253
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,240
Yeah.

2254
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,240
Yeah.

2255
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,320
And and then as you access things, you then find out it's like, it's a bit like a, um,

2256
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:07,560
an adventure game, you know, as, as you set up an account and access something, you then

2257
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,280
find all those, all of these extra things you need to do first few days is sort of,

2258
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:17,760
you know, chasing around and getting yourself set up on all the systems and everything is.

2259
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,480
But yeah, that all happens, all happens remotely.

2260
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,480
It's like.

2261
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,480
Wow.

2262
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,480
Impressive.

2263
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,480
Yeah, it is.

2264
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,480
Actually, it's, it's fairly impressive.

2265
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,200
I guess, I guess that is probably, they've probably worked in a mode where so many of

2266
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,880
their workers are remote for so long that they, that's exactly what you do.

2267
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,080
And you think, you know, it's kind of, it's kind of funny because that's kind of becoming

2268
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,000
more and more common because they've been kind of common for us.

2269
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,280
We work with probably more people remotely than we do.

2270
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,200
So yeah, I guess it's just kind of becoming the way more modern businesses is happening.

2271
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:51,600
So you should get like a 4k video wall and it's like everyone's in the same room.

2272
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,440
I just settle for mumble.

2273
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,440
I'll settle for mumble.

2274
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:03,520
Yeah, I have, I have put a TV up on one of the back walls in the office with a Roku attached

2275
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,280
to it to have bits and bobs playing in the background whilst I'm working, you know, stay

2276
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,960
up to speed on the news and things and listen to podcasts.

2277
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:22,000
I have gotten a lot of distance out of a Roku and now the Android TV to the point where

2278
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:32,320
it sort of changed the way I do my own content because it is, the YouTube algorithm is once

2279
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:39,360
you start feeding it properly is actually pretty good in a weird like, it manages every

2280
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,560
day now to expose something that I find interesting to watch on YouTube and now it's all just

2281
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,640
sort of integrated into my television.

2282
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:52,520
So I listen to a lot more YouTube shows than I used to and then I have ways from pocket

2283
01:25:52,520 --> 01:26:00,240
cast directly on my TV to Chrome casting it or whatever, you know, whatever method you

2284
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:03,760
want to get the audio to move around so I can listen to podcasts on my TV too and then

2285
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,920
continue to play them on my phone later.

2286
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:12,360
It is getting to the point now where when I first started doing podcasts, the only people

2287
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,880
that were listening were people that were downloading the files and then syncing them

2288
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,880
to a device of some type that was capable of doing a playback of some kind and maybe

2289
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,760
through like a tape adapter in the car or something like it's legitimately like it was

2290
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,480
there wasn't really there wasn't Bluetooth in the cars, there weren't smartphone apps,

2291
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:35,000
there weren't internet connected TV set top boxes and it was and now like you can get

2292
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,740
the JB Roku app or the or the JB Cody add on which Rob Loach is working on right now.

2293
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:43,800
You can get and then you can just like you can just watch all our stuff like it's just

2294
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,100
it's just it's on this there's a there's a here's an icon for Jupiter broadcasting here's

2295
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,480
an icon for CBS News it's like it's we're all like the same playing field you just have

2296
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:55,200
to know about it we're not on the same just like discovery is still a challenge but the

2297
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,320
availability from where it was eight nine ten years ago oh my god yeah so I love the

2298
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:09,320
Roku I love the Android TV not huge on the fire but yeah yeah I've kicked my Amazon fire

2299
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:16,840
TV into touch now it lasted about a year before the Roku the the new Roku just yeah surpassed

2300
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,680
it in terms of media playback yeah the the gaming aspect of the fire TV was fun but it

2301
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:30,240
wasn't enough to keep it keep it in the room that is that is a surprising that is coming

2302
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:37,840
so I you know I have the shield TV at the RV and the kids are driving more gaming oh

2303
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,160
really and I wasn't really something so that when you buy an Android shield TV thing whatever

2304
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:48,080
it's called a video Android shield TV whatever it comes if you get the cheap one the one

2305
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,080
that I actually I paid full price for it comes with a game controller and not a remote and

2306
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,240
I thought and it's a it's a decent like Xbox 360 knockoff game controller I thought that's

2307
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:05,520
weird and then if you get like the pro version it comes with a remote and a controller and

2308
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,320
so they really put an emphasis on the controller and I I now have started to realize that what

2309
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,600
Nvidia is doing is they're combining like a curation of really good Android games like

2310
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,880
the really good ones the ones that like don't I don't even I don't even really know I didn't

2311
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,760
know some of these games are even available for Android plus they're combining with like

2312
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,900
some sort of remote GPU streaming service that they offer that was like online see that's

2313
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:33,240
really nice I haven't tried that yet but so you can get all kinds of regular desktop games

2314
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:39,160
for a $7 a month subscription and the kids that sounds great is for them it's it's it's

2315
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,560
fantastic and so we're getting price there's probably a lot of games for them to try and

2316
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,200
so like right now on the from the shield TV we have like a Mickey Mouse game and a Ducktales

2317
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:53,080
game and Raymond runs games you know just really basic games but for for young kids

2318
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:58,160
that can they can now get to play their their experience of gaming so far has been on an

2319
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:06,760
iPad or an Android tablet like it's very it's very like it's a very vertical you know personal

2320
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,480
gaming experience it's not a collaborative gaming experience it's not a whole the whole

2321
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,800
family sitting on the couch all yeah all trying to figure it out and that's what's been really

2322
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,120
interesting is now all of a sudden we've we've just sort of stumbled into this because the

2323
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,440
shield TV has all this gaming capability just and we started you know a while ago on the

2324
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,160
Roku with some of the simple games like Angry Birds and stuff like that and that's kind

2325
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,240
of where I had a sense that they would be into it but I don't have the funds to buy

2326
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,480
a gaming console but the shield TV has some legitimate graphics multi-purpose trying to

2327
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,360
which I realize is not the newest game but oh my god just trying to look at 1080p on

2328
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,160
your television I've had older laptops that struggle with that we just sit there with

2329
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:49,560
our get with our mouth gaping it's so gorgeous it's just it's just really really really beautiful

2330
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:56,200
and it's 60 frames a second smooth you know really nice and that has been a surprise is

2331
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:01,400
because now it's dad can we dad can we not what do we want to watch but what we can what

2332
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:06,620
can we play and what's been interesting is how adorable they all are working together

2333
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:11,240
trying to solve the problem you know which is yeah that's that's that's the nice thing

2334
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:16,720
about having on a TV that a console kind of brings into a family that having a computer

2335
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:37,240
or a tablet doesn't really and just sort of fumbled into it a little bit yeah well
