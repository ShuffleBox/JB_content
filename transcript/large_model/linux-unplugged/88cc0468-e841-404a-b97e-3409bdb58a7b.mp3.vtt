00:00.000 --> 00:01.780
Hey Wes, did you hear the good news?

00:01.780 --> 00:02.900
No, I don't think so.

00:02.900 --> 00:05.700
Wait, unless you mean Nano 5.5,

00:05.700 --> 00:07.140
but that can't be it, right?

00:07.140 --> 00:09.920
Nano 5.5 Rebecca is out.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.720
Clearly one of the most accomplished pieces of software

00:13.720 --> 00:15.680
with one of the most monumental releases

00:15.680 --> 00:17.400
in free software history.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.120
GNU Nano 5.5 has a new mini bar which will blow you away.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.860
It has a new prompt color which will change your life.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.040
And it has a new set mark match option

00:27.040 --> 00:29.360
that highlights the result of a successful search

00:29.360 --> 00:32.080
that's gonna change the way you search a Nano document.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.240
And they've also brought a no-wrap toggle.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.260
It's Nano, but not like you know it.

00:37.260 --> 00:40.660
It's all new, it's brand new, and it's here to dominate Vi.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.880
Vim?

00:41.880 --> 00:42.720
Emacs?

00:42.720 --> 00:44.640
You know what stood out to me with this release, Chris?

00:44.640 --> 00:45.480
What?

00:45.480 --> 00:46.820
Absolutely nothing.

00:46.820 --> 00:51.820
Well, hello friends, and welcome

00:55.880 --> 00:57.640
into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.720
My name is Chris.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.680
My name is Wes.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.520
Hello, Wes.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.160
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru,

01:02.160 --> 01:04.560
the leader in hands-on cloud learning.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.000
The only way to lock in a new skill is by doing.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.400
That's what it says right here.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.380
And you can get your hands cloudy at cloudguru.com.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.560
You know it's true, because it's written down.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.760
This is episode 389, which if I recall,

01:16.760 --> 01:18.920
is also the LDAP port number.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.960
So this is episode LDAP, Wes.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.800
Perfect.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.920
It really is.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.480
And also you're absolutely wrong about that Nano thing.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.800
It cuts deep, and I will never forgive.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.020
I mean, it's nice to have stable stuff too, right?

01:30.020 --> 01:31.660
I don't need breaking features

01:31.660 --> 01:33.560
and all kinds of changes each time.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.360
Nano just works, and that's probably

01:35.360 --> 01:37.040
what you want in a text editor.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.580
Probably, probably.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.960
But we actually have a really, really fun tool

01:41.960 --> 01:43.000
that we're gonna talk about today

01:43.000 --> 01:45.400
that's gonna change your Linux game

01:45.400 --> 01:47.480
from this episode forever.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.540
It's a way to enable your distro hopping habit

01:50.540 --> 01:52.720
in a way that may be frankly irresponsible

01:52.720 --> 01:55.300
for us to tell you about, but we're gonna do it anyways.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.720
But before we get there,

01:56.720 --> 01:58.820
we're gonna get to the community news.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.280
And to do that, we gotta say time appropriate greetings

02:01.280 --> 02:02.120
to our Mumble Room.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.040
Hello, Virtual Lug.

02:03.040 --> 02:03.880
Hello.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.280
Howdy.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.720
Hello, everybody.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.920
It's really nice to see all of you.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.600
We got a good crew in there.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.160
They've joined us by going to linuxunplug.com,

02:12.160 --> 02:13.040
clicking our Mumble link,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.000
and getting the deets to connect in.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.760
And Mumble's free software is high quality,

02:16.760 --> 02:18.280
and it's also the lowest latency way

02:18.280 --> 02:20.520
to listen to some of our live streams.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.520
So welcome to episode LDAP.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.320
Guys, are you ready to get started?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.580
Excited.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.920
All right, well, let's talk about something

02:27.920 --> 02:31.000
that I didn't really know, and I feel kind of embarrassed,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.760
but it's changing, so I'll just pretend

02:32.760 --> 02:35.160
like I knew all along that Ubuntu

02:35.160 --> 02:37.360
had world-readable home directories.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.680
And that's changing in Ubuntu 21.04.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.760
They're doing away with this existing practice,

02:42.760 --> 02:45.880
and they're making new user home directories,

02:45.880 --> 02:47.780
I guess, no longer world-readable.

02:47.780 --> 02:50.440
What, Wes, how could this possibly be a thing?

02:50.440 --> 02:52.600
Yeah, okay, well, up to now,

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
when you made a new home directory,

02:53.800 --> 02:57.080
they were created with 7.5.5 as the permissions.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.840
With this proposed change, it would be 7.5.0.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.500
And if you don't speak octal, well, currently 7.5.5,

03:03.500 --> 03:05.640
that's read, write, execute for the owner,

03:05.640 --> 03:07.340
read and execute for the group,

03:07.340 --> 03:09.080
but also for everybody else.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.840
So with 7.5.0, now it's read, write, execute for the owner,

03:12.840 --> 03:14.260
read and execute for the group,

03:14.260 --> 03:16.680
and nada for everybody else.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.880
Yeah, so I guess at least going back to 2006,

03:18.880 --> 03:20.680
there'd been people that have been asking about this,

03:20.680 --> 03:23.560
and I just somehow even missed that this was a thing.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.280
The original logic seems to be that multi-user systems

03:26.280 --> 03:29.040
had some level of cooperation amongst the users anyways,

03:29.040 --> 03:32.960
and this made it easier, yeah, yes, it does,

03:32.960 --> 03:35.960
to share and access files between users on the same system.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.160
But of course, with Ubuntu on the server,

03:38.160 --> 03:39.420
probably not a good idea, is it?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.240
No, probably not, right?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.600
I mean, sure, there are some of these

03:42.600 --> 03:44.340
like local multi-user systems,

03:44.340 --> 03:46.440
but these days it's more like you're gonna have accounts

03:46.440 --> 03:47.640
running various services,

03:47.640 --> 03:48.840
or you might have untrusted folks

03:48.840 --> 03:51.220
that you just don't want easy access to files

03:51.220 --> 03:54.080
if one particular user gets compromised.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.440
I've always paid close attention

03:55.440 --> 03:58.880
to my.ssh directory and those particular folders,

03:58.880 --> 04:01.280
but I've never really given much concern about it

04:01.280 --> 04:03.080
because for the most part,

04:03.080 --> 04:05.560
I'm just the sole user of a system,

04:05.560 --> 04:06.760
and when we set up a server,

04:06.760 --> 04:08.260
it's pretty much like you and I

04:08.260 --> 04:10.100
and maybe one other person, maybe Alex,

04:10.100 --> 04:12.840
and we are actually cooperating in that regard.

04:12.840 --> 04:13.680
Yeah, that is true.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.640
There are some of those systems,

04:14.640 --> 04:16.960
but at the same time, I think it's often,

04:16.960 --> 04:18.240
at least for our local systems,

04:18.240 --> 04:20.720
often that we all end up with pseudo anyway.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.560
So if I need to access things, I can.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.560
I think it just makes it a little simpler as a default.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.340
You could still go and change your permissions

04:26.340 --> 04:27.180
on your home folders,

04:27.180 --> 04:29.660
as long as you had the right access to do so, of course,

04:29.660 --> 04:30.940
and give folks access,

04:30.940 --> 04:33.640
but I think maybe the argument before from SunSense

04:33.640 --> 04:35.140
was admins knew what they were doing,

04:35.140 --> 04:36.900
and obviously, of course, if you wanna make a folder

04:36.900 --> 04:38.480
that everyone else can't read,

04:38.480 --> 04:41.840
easy to do so as a private folder within your home directory,

04:41.840 --> 04:43.720
but as it becomes easier and easier

04:43.720 --> 04:46.680
to just boot up a random VM in the cloud somewhere

04:46.680 --> 04:48.760
on a hosting provider,

04:48.760 --> 04:49.700
there's probably a lot of users

04:49.700 --> 04:51.480
who have no idea about that, don't think to check,

04:51.480 --> 04:53.160
and are surprised when they find out

04:53.160 --> 04:55.840
that everyone can read their private journal entries.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.720
Very true.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.760
This sort of feels like it's a legacy of old Unix systems.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.920
Yeah, I mean, basically, if you think back

05:03.920 --> 05:06.840
to how Unix first started off with the whole wheel group,

05:06.840 --> 05:10.600
the users group, this was basically a leftover from it.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.920
I mean, the idea that users would be able to share

05:12.920 --> 05:15.560
the same space and share the same home folders

05:15.560 --> 05:16.800
was kind of natural.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.720
Yeah, and I guess it's fair to,

05:17.720 --> 05:20.480
we should point out that Ubuntu's not the only distribution

05:20.480 --> 05:21.320
that does this.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.720
I just didn't really think about it very much.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.920
I don't really think it's gonna affect

05:24.920 --> 05:26.520
any existing installs, right, Wes?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.360
This isn't something they're retroactively doing.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.320
Yeah, it should be pretty safe.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.640
It'd basically be going forward.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.480
If you've upgraded your existing user,

05:33.480 --> 05:35.320
they won't go and change existing permissions.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.840
It'd just be new users you create,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.000
and if you do it right now,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.360
that gives three development releases

05:40.360 --> 05:43.520
and two interim releases before the next LTS,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.240
and so if there do happen to be any kinks,

05:46.240 --> 05:47.520
get those out early.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.000
Yep, that was the point I was just gonna make,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.720
is you do, you wanna figure these things out now.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.200
This is the time to do it,

05:52.200 --> 05:55.040
and I think it makes a lot of sense.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.800
So there was a story that we've been waiting to talk about.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.240
People have been drive-by linking me this

06:01.240 --> 06:03.800
with a little bit of a twist of a knife in the side, too,

06:03.800 --> 06:04.640
as they laugh at me,

06:04.640 --> 06:09.240
because there was recently a pretty significant

06:09.240 --> 06:13.600
performance regression in Kernel 5.10 and ButterFS,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.840
and today, well, actually, I think it was two days ago.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.680
Sunday.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.560
Yeah, Sunday, as we were recording Linux Action News,

06:20.560 --> 06:22.560
Linux 5.10.8 came out.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.720
Yes, it did, and making that very important

06:25.720 --> 06:29.880
is it finally addresses the ButterFS performance regression

06:29.880 --> 06:32.680
that was found in the 5.10 series.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.720
Yeah, I guess it took eight point releases

06:34.720 --> 06:35.960
to get that fixed.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.360
So is this fair?

06:38.360 --> 06:40.920
Because we talk about, oh, finally,

06:40.920 --> 06:44.520
so it was discovered in Christmas, around Christmas,

06:44.520 --> 06:47.480
and now it is the middle of January.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.280
It didn't even go one major Kernel release, right?

06:50.280 --> 06:53.240
And it was during Christmas and New Year's.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.800
So is it really like that big of a deal

06:55.800 --> 06:58.560
that it took eight minor releases

06:58.560 --> 07:01.120
of the 5.10 Kernel release to get this fixed?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.000
And they're like, how many distributions

07:03.000 --> 07:05.800
even shipped this Kernel, really?

07:05.800 --> 07:09.280
Let alone how many users that were at any kind of scale

07:09.280 --> 07:11.180
actually deployed this Kernel.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.320
Probably very few.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.440
And so it really was sort of, in the grand sense, I think,

07:15.440 --> 07:17.000
actually tidied up pretty quickly.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.800
Yeah, no, I think that's a very good point.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.340
It probably didn't affect that many users.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.920
And of course, you could always use a previous Kernel version

07:22.920 --> 07:24.120
if you really needed to.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.400
Of course, this thing is likely to happen sometimes

07:26.400 --> 07:29.640
when your file system support is built into your Kernel.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.600
I guess it's just a problem ZFS users don't have.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.520
But the good news is that it appears

07:36.520 --> 07:40.160
things will get a lot better for ButterFS in 5.11.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.720
But were you clear on what the regression was, Wes?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.800
Because I know that one of the ways they tested it

07:44.800 --> 07:48.240
was by extracting some files on, say, an SSD,

07:48.240 --> 07:49.640
like a high-speed SSD.

07:49.640 --> 07:54.360
And they would see somewhere between a 5 to 20 times

07:54.360 --> 07:56.040
slower performance than expected.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.720
Yeah, it sounds like a while ago they

07:57.720 --> 07:59.400
made a change that would sort of clean up

07:59.400 --> 08:02.360
how they were deallocating stuff that was no longer in use

08:02.360 --> 08:05.400
and reuse some existing infrastructure that they

08:05.400 --> 08:08.160
had in place for flushing inodes or during device

08:08.160 --> 08:10.520
replace and snapshot and sort of leveraging

08:10.520 --> 08:13.200
existing structures within the code base to clean things up.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.680
But unfortunately, that had a downside

08:16.680 --> 08:20.440
of stuff taking 5 to 20 times as long to extract,

08:20.440 --> 08:23.840
because they ended up flushing a lot more than they really

08:23.840 --> 08:24.720
needed to.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.360
And to make it more complicated, a different bug fix

08:27.360 --> 08:28.480
built on this behavior.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.520
And so they couldn't just revert the whole change,

08:30.520 --> 08:33.360
because that had the risk of introducing some other dead

08:33.360 --> 08:34.920
locks in other places.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.840
So the only strategy was to just roll forward,

08:37.840 --> 08:39.840
which is also maybe why this took a little bit longer

08:39.840 --> 08:41.600
than it might otherwise have.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.240
This also was one of those situations

08:44.240 --> 08:46.800
where a lot of people piled onto this story

08:46.800 --> 08:49.480
and were like, look, it's still not good enough.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.520
It's still, look at this.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.600
They just had a performance regression,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.160
as if regressions and little issues here aren't things,

08:55.160 --> 08:57.720
and as if that's not where distributions step in and kind

08:57.720 --> 08:59.960
of provide a bit of guidance before they deploy it.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.880
Like, just sort of forgetting the entire way software

09:01.880 --> 09:03.840
actually gets deployed in the Linux ecosystem,

09:03.840 --> 09:07.000
it was sort of leveraged as an opportunity

09:07.000 --> 09:08.520
to make fun of ButterFS again.

09:08.520 --> 09:13.080
And I struggle to really understand the logic in this.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.240
Like, we're all in this together.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.520
We all want a file system that's capable of things

09:18.520 --> 09:22.520
like compression, encryption, snapshotting, send and receive.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.840
These are just basic volume management.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.280
These are things that we want in a file system

09:27.280 --> 09:29.440
to be a competitive operating system,

09:29.440 --> 09:31.120
and we want them built in.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.120
And ButterFS is the window to that world.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.640
A friend of the show recently had a conversation

09:37.640 --> 09:41.400
with an Oracle executive about the possibility of ever

09:41.400 --> 09:45.080
sending a ZFS upstream and relicensing it to a GPL,

09:45.080 --> 09:47.720
and he was told flat out, never going to happen.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.720
And this was within a week.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.000
That sounds about right to me.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.440
You could take my word for it or not, but it happened.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.280
And it's just ZFS is in a position

09:55.280 --> 09:57.000
where they like it right now, and they're not

09:57.000 --> 09:59.900
going to relicense it, at least according to this one person.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.320
Now, ButterFS is here.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
It's functional.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.040
And it also solves use cases that ZFS doesn't.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.760
And I think this is the only other area

10:07.760 --> 10:10.160
I just wanted to touch on, not to get on a whole ButterFS

10:10.160 --> 10:14.560
thing here, but ButterFS is really great on devices

10:14.560 --> 10:17.120
that ZFS isn't a particularly good option for.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.760
ButterFS is fantastic on the SD card in my Raspberry Pi 4

10:22.760 --> 10:24.320
or on the USB disk that I use.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.200
It's fantastic on a laptop with a single SSD.

10:28.200 --> 10:34.000
It works so great as the root file system for our arch server.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.620
It saved our arse several times.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.160
Because it's ButterFS, it always mounts.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.400
So our system boots, even if something

10:41.400 --> 10:45.360
went wrong with the kernel module for ZFS, which happens.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.200
And it also means we get snapshots

10:47.200 --> 10:50.280
after every major upgrade or install in our arch box

10:50.280 --> 10:53.600
automatically, because we've tied in the right tools.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.400
That's all just built in with ButterFS

10:55.400 --> 10:57.160
and just connecting the right dots.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.380
And then we can restore the module.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.720
We can get things working again.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.480
And we can get our ZFS pool back online.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.800
But it means our server comes up.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.320
And we can SSH into it.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.920
And we can resolve the issue.

11:06.920 --> 11:12.160
ButterFS is just undeniably better at that particular use

11:12.160 --> 11:13.520
case for us.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.760
If the root file system were ZFS,

11:15.760 --> 11:18.000
our system wouldn't boot sometimes.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.760
And we solve that and still get compression,

11:20.760 --> 11:24.680
still get encryption, and still get snapshots with ButterFS.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.340
Because it's built right into our kernel.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.240
And it does a great job.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.440
And we're not the only ones that are saying this.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.280
Yeah, true.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.120
I mean, I think just to your earlier point,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.080
the fact that this bug was A, found

11:35.080 --> 11:37.480
is a sign that folks out there are really using it.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.760
And B, that it was fixed relatively quickly

11:39.760 --> 11:42.180
is a sign of good, active maintainership,

11:42.180 --> 11:44.560
that people are using it and that there's resources here

11:44.560 --> 11:47.560
that people want to continue improving the file system.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.400
And at the end of the day, after this patch set in 5.10,

11:51.400 --> 11:54.800
ButterFS is significantly faster than it was in plain 5.9.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.640
So OK, there's dips and valleys, and it goes up and down.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.140
But at the end of the day, we just

12:00.140 --> 12:02.480
keep getting a better and better net file system.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.760
Right, I completely agree.

12:03.760 --> 12:07.920
And it means that in future iterations,

12:07.920 --> 12:10.800
we're just going to be able to build on what's coming in 5.11.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.600
And yeah, I mean, you could poke a little fun

12:13.600 --> 12:15.480
that it took eight minor releases.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.520
But I don't know, Neil, when you consider the fact

12:17.520 --> 12:20.160
that there's holidays in there, it's a pretty quick turnaround.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.120
When it comes to stuff like this, it's really hard.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.720
And Joseph Bastic and I talked once about this.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.400
And he says, what I wouldn't give

12:29.400 --> 12:34.500
for having a standardized, comprehensive storage workload

12:34.500 --> 12:38.040
test, because then we could catch all the things.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.560
And it came up, I think, what, five, six days

12:42.560 --> 12:43.460
before Christmas?

12:43.460 --> 12:48.400
Everybody was already jumping out because holidays.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.200
And even with that, the turnaround time to the initial fix

12:53.200 --> 12:57.720
was still less than 20 days, which is freaking impressive.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.640
That is way faster than any third party

12:59.640 --> 13:02.280
or commercial software vendor has ever

13:02.280 --> 13:04.240
done for me in my entire life.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.120
And another point here about dips and valleys

13:08.120 --> 13:11.060
and whatever with ButterFS, ButterFS

13:11.060 --> 13:12.880
is not the only file system that has ever

13:12.880 --> 13:14.760
suffered these kinds of things.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.000
XFS, for example, in the 5.9 cycle,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.040
got a major data corruption bug that

13:19.040 --> 13:21.240
was introduced midway through and then

13:21.240 --> 13:23.440
had to be fixed after the fact.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.220
It happened again with 5.10 and had to be fixed again.

13:28.220 --> 13:32.080
These are things that happen, major or minor issues.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.520
Data corruption stuff, thankfully,

13:33.520 --> 13:35.360
doesn't happen very often with ButterFS

13:35.360 --> 13:38.560
anymore in terms of new developments and code churn.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.320
But because the kernel's highly integrated

13:41.320 --> 13:43.560
and has a lot of subsystems, and there's a lot of people,

13:43.560 --> 13:46.440
and the development workflow for the Linux kernel

13:46.440 --> 13:49.880
is, in my opinion, pretty awful, it's

13:49.880 --> 13:53.000
impressive how well the Linux kernel continues

13:53.000 --> 13:56.800
to be developed given all of these factors.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.720
So most people weren't even going

13:59.720 --> 14:02.200
to experience this problem because the workload was

14:02.200 --> 14:03.480
very, very specific.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.400
You had to be unpacking a large tarball

14:06.400 --> 14:10.160
with a lot of little files in one basically IO

14:10.160 --> 14:13.760
transaction, which is what led to this particular problem.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.400
And I have been bitten by ButterFS bugs way in the past.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.800
But as a pretty extensive ButterFS user now,

14:19.800 --> 14:20.680
I have it in several.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.640
I have it on laptops.

14:21.640 --> 14:22.800
I have it on pies.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.840
And I have it on server metal.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.320
I wasn't bit in any of those scenarios by this, thankfully.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.960
So again, I don't think it was a wide deployment.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.440
But speaking about the kernel development process

14:34.440 --> 14:37.760
and what that's like, next week on the show,

14:37.760 --> 14:41.120
the executive editor of lwn.net, Jonathan Corbett,

14:41.120 --> 14:44.560
is joining me to talk a little bit about the kernel

14:44.560 --> 14:46.880
development, the state of maintainers,

14:46.880 --> 14:50.200
and also LWN because they have an anniversary coming up.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.920
So that should be a good conversation in episode 390.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.640
So stay tuned for that.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.140
But yeah, I'm glad to see it fixed.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.240
I'm glad to see the performance stuff coming.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.280
And I just kind of feel like we're all on the same team

15:03.280 --> 15:05.400
when it comes to some of these file systems.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.420
And taking a shot at it when it has a bug is, I don't know,

15:09.420 --> 15:10.800
something about it, just something about it.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.760
It didn't sit right with me.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.080
And I think it's where I think the issue is,

15:15.080 --> 15:16.400
and this is my last thought on it.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.760
I'm sorry, but this is just something

15:17.760 --> 15:18.640
I've been reflecting on.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.520
You've got a ButterFS bug in your ear.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.680
Better than somewhere else, I suppose.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.720
I think what you have is you have people

15:25.720 --> 15:28.720
that have different use cases that are looking at a tool,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.240
thinking, well, this isn't the right tool for me.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.520
There's a reason why our large pool runs ZFS.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.480
Because in our estimation, that was the better tool

15:37.480 --> 15:38.560
for that job.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.080
And it has remained that way, despite all the different

15:41.080 --> 15:42.800
operating systems we've tried.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.640
We've always kept ZFS on that pool, and it has served us well.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.560
Yep, it's been great.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.000
We wouldn't reload.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.720
If we got a new brand new disk array,

15:49.720 --> 15:52.400
we would do ZFS again on that.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.280
That's the use case for it.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
And I think what you have is you have people

15:56.280 --> 15:58.040
who are not in the right use cases that

15:58.040 --> 15:59.320
are comparing file systems.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.240
And it's an apple to oranges kind of comparison

16:01.240 --> 16:02.480
in that regard.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.200
And it's totally fine if it doesn't work for you, right?

16:05.200 --> 16:07.960
Plenty of file systems I never touch, by and large,

16:07.960 --> 16:10.760
but they are really helpful for other folks, like ex-fats,

16:10.760 --> 16:11.600
say, right?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.000
And that's perfectly all right.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.680
With Linux, we have options and a huge array of options.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.960
I love that.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.160
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.600
Go there to get a $100, 60-day credit towards a new account,

16:25.600 --> 16:27.120
and you support the show.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
Linode is our cloud hosting provider,

16:29.080 --> 16:31.720
and Wes and I were having a lot of fun last night.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.320
And thank you, Linode, for the snapshot system,

16:35.320 --> 16:36.200
the way it works.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.120
It really just gives us peace of mind

16:38.120 --> 16:41.280
because we wanted to increase the amount of RAM

16:41.280 --> 16:43.720
and upgrade our Synapse server at the same time.

16:43.720 --> 16:47.520
The software, the RAM, and we wanted to also do the OS.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.560
And so it just was so nice because, first of all,

16:49.560 --> 16:51.760
one button to make a snapshot right before you start.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.280
But what they do that other cloud providers don't

16:54.280 --> 16:56.640
is they give you an opportunity to label it.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.840
So you label that snapshot.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.120
You hit Go.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.800
And then the great thing is there's a notification area

17:01.800 --> 17:02.440
in the dashboard.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.840
It just kind of tucks it up in the corner.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.260
You don't have to see it if you don't want.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.560
But if you click it, it actually gives you

17:07.560 --> 17:09.840
a live progress bar of how the snapshot's going

17:09.840 --> 17:11.360
with time estimation.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.440
So Wes is at home.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.360
I'm at the studio.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.760
I can tell him, all right, we've got four minutes

17:14.760 --> 17:17.720
until the snapshot's done, and then we'll do the upgrade.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.000
And it just works so smooth.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.600
And when we rebooted the system and realized

17:22.600 --> 17:24.600
that we didn't know the root password anymore,

17:24.600 --> 17:26.520
I was able to get on the console and get that resolved

17:26.520 --> 17:28.900
and reset the root password in seconds from their dashboard

17:28.900 --> 17:30.640
and get us back in and get us going.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.280
And I just really appreciated the tools

17:32.280 --> 17:35.240
that Linode made available to us on top of other things

17:35.240 --> 17:37.680
like we have moved Linodes between data centers now,

17:37.680 --> 17:39.000
and that's really cool.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.840
Adding additional memory to our Linode was easy.

17:42.840 --> 17:47.080
We went from 4 gigs to 16 gigs in seconds.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.080
They make all of this really straightforward.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.580
So you don't have to be an expert.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.840
But if you are, you start to see a few things

17:52.840 --> 17:55.160
that when you drill down in the UI, they're there for you

17:55.160 --> 17:56.880
that you can really appreciate.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.280
But what I get out of that is you

17:58.280 --> 18:00.900
can tell they have a love and a passion for this technology.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.480
But really, that's what got them going.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.420
That's why they started in 2003 as the first company

18:05.420 --> 18:06.640
in cloud computing.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.400
They started three years before AWS

18:08.400 --> 18:11.100
because they are Linux users, and they get it.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.320
They get how to build on the technology.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.440
That's what I love about a lot of the vendors

18:15.440 --> 18:16.440
in our community.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.640
And through the years, they've supported events like Linux

18:18.640 --> 18:21.940
Fest Northwest, All Things Open, the Kubuntu Project,

18:21.940 --> 18:22.960
a bunch of others.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.080
Those are the ones that I have seen personally.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.760
And of course, now they're making

18:26.760 --> 18:28.760
it possible for Jupyter Broadcasting

18:28.760 --> 18:32.560
to go independent and give our content away for free.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.840
That is a massive value.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.440
And I just think it's such a great combination

18:36.440 --> 18:40.400
because it's a great service built by Linux users supporting

18:40.400 --> 18:41.640
a Linux business.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.200
And you can get a $100 60-day credit when you

18:44.200 --> 18:46.320
go to linode.com slash unplug.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.840
Go there, support the show, get that $100,

18:48.840 --> 18:51.000
and play around with their object storage.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.380
Just a quick mention, we are going

18:52.380 --> 18:53.880
to be talking a little bit about how

18:53.880 --> 18:57.080
you can use object storage for backups with our pick later.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.800
And it works with any S3 compatible object storage,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.240
which Linode has.

19:01.240 --> 19:05.620
And it's so great because you get fast, reliable storage up

19:05.620 --> 19:08.520
in the cloud without having to manage a server in front of it.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.480
There's a lot of uses for that, including

19:10.480 --> 19:12.960
backups, static websites, and many other things.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.320
So get started at linode.com slash unplugged.

19:16.320 --> 19:21.040
Before we get into the show much further,

19:21.040 --> 19:22.640
I think this is a good moment for us

19:22.640 --> 19:26.400
to take stock and do a little housekeeping.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.840
And I want to start with Minimac,

19:27.840 --> 19:32.200
because he has some updates for us on an upcoming Luplug

19:32.200 --> 19:32.920
session.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.080
Yeah, thanks, Chris.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.080
So now that probably the whole world

19:36.080 --> 19:38.640
knows that we will have a talk about accessibility

19:38.640 --> 19:41.040
tools in Linux next Sunday on Luplug,

19:41.040 --> 19:43.400
the only thing left to me is to reveal

19:43.400 --> 19:46.600
the name of our special guest we have during the talk.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.480
So I have the pleasure to announce

19:48.480 --> 19:51.880
that Daniel Ferre, the founder of the elementary project,

19:51.880 --> 19:54.040
will join us for a Luplug session.

19:54.040 --> 19:58.800
So what can you expect during that talk?

19:58.800 --> 20:03.320
So we will have Justin, a user of our JPMobile community,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.440
and he will share his experience and workflow with assistive

20:06.440 --> 20:07.760
tools in Linux.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.680
And Daniel Ferre will give us an inside view

20:10.680 --> 20:13.600
on how the elementary team tries to make life easier

20:13.600 --> 20:16.320
for people with disabilities.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.640
And maybe Daniel might also give us

20:18.640 --> 20:22.200
an overview on features we can expect in the future elementary

20:22.200 --> 20:24.040
6 release.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.200
Oh, yeah, get some info.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:26.040 --> 20:30.600
There are some really cool things to mention there.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.040
And I hope we will have a really good talk.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.600
Yeah, so that'll be January 24th on Sunday

20:35.600 --> 20:38.000
at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.280
And all they need is Mumble, right?

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
Just join the lobby.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.520
Just join the lobby.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.400
I hope you'll find the time next Sunday.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
Just join the lobby.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.160
And if you want, we can do some sound checks

20:47.160 --> 20:50.160
if you want to participate actively during the talk.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.200
So thanks, Chris.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.320
Yeah, looking forward to that.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
And we do put the plugs up on the calendar, too.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.960
So if you want to get in your time zone,

20:56.960 --> 20:59.120
just go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.360
Slash calendar.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.640
Also, you never know what we might have next.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.240
If you hear the pre-shows, we're always

21:04.240 --> 21:06.320
kind of kicking around new show ideas and whatnot.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.000
So get subscribed to the All Jupiter Broadcasting shows.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.120
One feed, you get Coda Radio, self-hosted, Linux Action News,

21:13.120 --> 21:14.160
and Linux Unplugged.

21:14.160 --> 21:14.760
It's nice.

21:14.760 --> 21:15.240
It's tight.

21:15.240 --> 21:15.920
It's tidy.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.720
And it's a bunch of great content.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.760
That's the All Shows feed.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.520
You can find that at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.600
And Mr. Bain, I think that's all the housekeeping

21:23.600 --> 21:24.520
we have for this week.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.000
It looks like everything around here is tidy.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.840
It sure does.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.400
Nice job.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.280
So I'm going to say Ventoy.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.440
You think I got it?

21:33.440 --> 21:33.800
Oh, gosh.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.000
I didn't even think to question it.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.880
That's just what I've been calling it all along.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.440
Oh, I question everything I pronounce on the air.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.280
You probably should.

21:40.280 --> 21:40.880
All the time.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.920
I have a complex about it at this point.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.800
So Ventoy is a new bootable USB solution.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.200
It's 100% open source.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.040
It's simple to use.

21:51.040 --> 21:55.120
And you write it to a USB thumb drive.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.640
It creates the Ventoy bootable partition.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.400
And it creates a storage partition,

22:00.400 --> 22:04.240
which you can kind of format as you like.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.040
And then you drop ISOs, just mount it on your desktop,

22:07.040 --> 22:12.360
drop ISOs in this directory on this Ventoy USB stick.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.440
And they show up as bootable options

22:14.440 --> 22:16.640
when you plug it into a PC and boot off of it.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.840
So if you have, say, several ISOs up there,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.480
a grub-looking menu comes up, and each ISO

22:21.480 --> 22:24.600
is listed right there for you to choose.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.960
And it just begins to boot that ISO.

22:26.960 --> 22:31.600
So it's like, you no longer, you write this to your USB stick

22:31.600 --> 22:33.520
once, and then from that point forward,

22:33.520 --> 22:34.760
you just drop ISOs on it.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.320
Yeah, aren't you tired of constantly having to reflash

22:37.320 --> 22:40.320
that same USB drive when you already had Fedora on there,

22:40.320 --> 22:42.400
but now you're putting Ubuntu, and suddenly you

22:42.400 --> 22:44.000
want Fedora again?

22:44.000 --> 22:44.920
It's annoying.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.720
I actually can't tell you how useful this is for a guy like me

22:47.720 --> 22:52.280
who often takes laptops home for a weekend project for the show.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.360
And if I'm not careful, I get in a situation

22:55.360 --> 22:59.160
where I need an ISO, and it takes forever to download

22:59.160 --> 23:00.720
an ISO on my connection.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.680
And I will write, right now, Wes,

23:02.680 --> 23:05.480
I have two different USB thumb drives in my bag.

23:05.480 --> 23:10.000
One is an Arch ISO, and one is an Ubuntu ISO, or maybe Fedora.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.880
I can't remember.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.400
I overwrite them from time to time.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.000
So then I get home, and it's like, oh, I got the wrong one.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.800
And now I'm just going to wait for two hours

23:17.800 --> 23:19.360
while I download an ISO.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.760
This is so much simpler, because I can just put all of them

23:22.760 --> 23:24.840
here at the studio on one thumb drive

23:24.840 --> 23:26.600
and just take that thumb drive with me.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.560
What's also really neat is it's not just ISOs.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.520
Maybe you boot into Windows sometimes,

23:31.520 --> 23:33.320
or you want to have something to help around

23:33.320 --> 23:34.240
with family or friends.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.640
We need to install Windows, perhaps, to re-kick things.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.360
If they've got plugins to boot from VHD files or even.wim

23:41.360 --> 23:43.320
images, that's awesome.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.640
Yeah, and we've kind of toyed around with other things

23:46.640 --> 23:47.920
like this before.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.640
But this is just straight up the simplest.

23:50.640 --> 23:54.600
If you're on Windows, they've got an EXE process

23:54.600 --> 23:57.080
to go through to write the stick.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.240
But on Linux, you download a Bash script.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.740
I mean, there's several ways to do it.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.540
But the simple way is you download their Bash script,

24:02.540 --> 24:05.720
give it a little quick look, and then you run it and just point

24:05.720 --> 24:07.880
it at the thumb drive device.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.360
Make sure you get that right.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.040
Yes.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.400
Yes, don't do dev SDA.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.560
For me, it was dev SDF, because I just have a few drives.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.520
And you just kick it off.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.960
You just execute the shell script,

24:18.960 --> 24:20.600
point, and give it the device path.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.480
And in a few seconds, after it asks you,

24:23.480 --> 24:26.400
are you really sure you want to wipe this thing, it's done.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.320
And it's good to go.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.720
You can tell that this has been a pretty battle tested tool,

24:29.720 --> 24:30.880
because they have a lot of nice options.

24:30.880 --> 24:34.240
So by default, it'll set things up with an MBR still, MBR style,

24:34.240 --> 24:37.280
so that it supports both legacy BIOS and UEFI

24:37.280 --> 24:38.280
right on the same thing.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.840
But if you want to just go full future forward,

24:40.840 --> 24:43.360
you can use GPT and UEFI only if you want.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.040
That's what I did, because I don't have any more legacy BIOS

24:46.040 --> 24:48.400
systems these days, thankfully.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.560
It's nice and consistent.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.640
And in the same way, they set up one sort of grub system

24:53.640 --> 24:57.080
partition where all the stuff that Ventoy uses internally is.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.040
And then you've also got a partition just for all

24:59.040 --> 25:00.560
of your image files.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.280
And by default, that's exFAT, which

25:03.280 --> 25:05.920
I think is designed to be pretty universally accessible.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.960
So if you're trying to boot it on some random Mac

25:07.960 --> 25:09.920
or Windows PC, it'll just work.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.240
And you have access to actually update and add new images

25:12.240 --> 25:14.400
without having to worry about some weird Linux file

25:14.400 --> 25:15.720
system on there.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.360
But on the system I was using, I had an older kernel.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.440
I hadn't set up the exFAT support.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.040
So I just reflashed that to ext4.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.320
And you can do that no problem.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.760
They've got that in the docs.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.400
So if you're just like me and using it on Linux systems,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.480
that might be the route you try.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.640
Yeah, because then you get larger ISO support.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.000
And this thing supports big ISO files.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.240
In fact, I think they said they tested up to 600, more than 600

25:36.240 --> 25:38.120
ISOs on this thing at once.

25:38.120 --> 25:38.620
Wow.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.040
It must be quite the menu to scroll through.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.200
Because it's all really kind of a grub menu.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.680
I wonder, though, if you saw, so when you boot it up,

25:46.680 --> 25:49.400
like a typical boot screen, you got your options

25:49.400 --> 25:50.080
along the bottom.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.560
And some of them are kind of nice.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.280
You can kind of preset some video mode stuff.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.000
And actually, there's some really nice things

25:56.000 --> 25:57.560
that it lets you do.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.240
But did you see what F1 does?

25:59.240 --> 26:01.200
No, I don't think I tried F1.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.960
OK, so this is right up your alley.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.160
Because what F1 does is it copies the contents of ISO

26:07.160 --> 26:08.280
into RAM.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.000
So then you're running the live environment out of RAM.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.960
Instead of using the USB ISO image,

26:12.960 --> 26:15.040
it just copies all of the contents into a RAM disk

26:15.040 --> 26:17.400
and then executes it from scratch.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.580
Like, you get the full boot menu.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.960
You get grub where you can select,

26:20.960 --> 26:22.700
do you want the open source only boot?

26:22.700 --> 26:24.320
Or do you want the one with proprietary drivers?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.640
Like, if your distro asks you that,

26:25.640 --> 26:26.840
you get all of that still.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.360
But just all of the contents of that ISO image

26:29.360 --> 26:30.680
are coming from a RAM disk.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.000
Wow, yeah, it's so cool.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.440
And there's all kinds of other plug-ins

26:33.440 --> 26:35.760
if you want to customize things like add your own theme,

26:35.760 --> 26:38.240
customize how the menu system works.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.680
It's just really well-developed.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.720
Yeah, I'll have to just keep this now as one of my tools.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.680
I used to have, forever ago, a Zantec.

26:48.680 --> 26:53.520
I actually still have it, a Zantec USB 3.0 hard disk

26:53.520 --> 26:55.040
with USB-A plug.

26:55.040 --> 27:00.680
And inside, I put it in a 128 gigabyte, 2 and 1 half inch SSD.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.960
And what it does is it uses a CD-ROM emulation, the USB CD-ROM

27:04.960 --> 27:05.480
emulation.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.200
So when I plug it into a device, it actually shows up as a CD-ROM

27:09.200 --> 27:13.920
and it uses the ISOs that are on that 128 gigabyte SSD

27:13.920 --> 27:15.160
as the CD-ROM contents.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.400
And that's pretty neat, but it's got this tiny little janky

27:18.400 --> 27:21.140
80s style LCD screen that I have to scroll

27:21.140 --> 27:22.520
through all the ISOs and select.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.880
And it's this weird process where you plug it in

27:24.880 --> 27:27.840
and you need power from the bus to select the ISO,

27:27.840 --> 27:31.000
but you want to select the ISO before the system fully posts.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.800
So you either race into it really fast

27:32.800 --> 27:36.040
or you power it up, select the ISO, and then do a soft reboot.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.920
You have to do this whole weird dance with it.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.200
Where this is just you tell the system

27:40.200 --> 27:42.280
to boot off the USB stick, choose your ISO,

27:42.280 --> 27:47.000
and then it's like you had a USB stick that only had

27:47.000 --> 27:48.760
that distribution's image on it.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.080
It's just great.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.440
It's a lot of fun and makes it so much easier to distro hop.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.920
Or just have the different distros

27:54.920 --> 27:56.560
I might need easily available so I

27:56.560 --> 27:58.400
don't have to re-download them like an animal.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.640
It is interesting that some folks in IRC

28:00.640 --> 28:02.880
are commenting they've had problems on older hardware

28:02.880 --> 28:06.400
or even some reports here from Rolf on Skylake laptops.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.720
So far in my testing, and I tried it on pretty much every

28:08.720 --> 28:10.920
system I've got in my house, no problems,

28:10.920 --> 28:14.100
but you do be aware that maybe it won't work everywhere.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.520
But I like the idea of just having this as default.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.120
And OK, I've got extra USB drives if for some reason

28:19.120 --> 28:21.040
it just doesn't work on some machine.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.640
Yep, and like Wes said, it does have UEFI support,

28:24.640 --> 28:26.960
but it also has ARM64 UEFI support.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.360
So if you've got an ARM64.

28:28.360 --> 28:29.320
Fancy.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.360
I know.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.320
I know, Wes.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.160
I know that.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.560
And it has a plug-in framework, which

28:33.560 --> 28:36.040
it did not play around with.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.320
So I guess in theory, you could really

28:38.320 --> 28:40.800
kind of customize this thing quite a bit.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.080
Maybe you're an IT shop.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.440
Yeah, you could imagine having a sort of standard Vento setup

28:44.440 --> 28:46.080
you just give to all of your techs.

28:46.080 --> 28:46.880
They've got it in their bag.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.160
They can boot up to whatever, you know, emergency CDs.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.000
There's even a Vento Live ISO they've

28:51.000 --> 28:53.160
got if you don't have it already set up and just need

28:53.160 --> 28:54.720
an environment to get it installed.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.220
And the thing that's nice too is they

28:56.220 --> 28:58.560
do make it kind of straightforward for Windows

28:58.560 --> 29:00.080
users to get going with this.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.040
That's not something we talk a lot about, but it does matter.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.700
So much easier, right?

29:04.700 --> 29:06.400
Especially if you're just flirting around playing

29:06.400 --> 29:06.880
with Linux.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.080
I mean, here I am using ddrescue in the shell like an animal,

29:10.080 --> 29:12.000
but that's just not very accessible.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.080
Whereas dragging and dropping an ISO file and then rebooting,

29:15.080 --> 29:15.840
that is.

29:15.840 --> 29:19.440
Yeah, and I wonder, like, what are the must-have ISOs you'd

29:19.440 --> 29:20.560
put on something like this?

29:20.560 --> 29:24.360
System rescue CD seems like a pretty solid ISO

29:24.360 --> 29:25.860
to always have on there, regardless,

29:25.860 --> 29:27.360
just in case all of a sudden you need it.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.080
Yeah, definitely.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.520
Or Clonezilla, similar things.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.500
Yeah, yeah, Veritunis is Clonezilla.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.340
That's a good one.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.280
Yeah, that is good.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.320
Good point.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.360
I think too, like, this might actually push me over the edge

29:37.360 --> 29:39.840
to finally get a USB-C thumb drive,

29:39.840 --> 29:42.320
because I'm kind of getting sick and tired of using

29:42.320 --> 29:43.960
adapters and whatnot.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.440
Mm-hmm, yes.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.720
And maybe I'll get like a kind of a higher speed one

29:47.720 --> 29:48.240
if I can.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.120
And 128 gigs would probably be plenty.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.960
I never even, when I had my Zalman, whatever it was,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.960
thing, I never exceeded the 128 gigs.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.320
Because by the time you're using that much space,

30:00.320 --> 30:02.280
the Linux ISOs on there are so old,

30:02.280 --> 30:03.500
they're not really relevant anymore.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.840
You just kind of cycle them out.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.680
So you don't need a ton of space unless you're a maniac.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.400
Tails, PyCrash points out, Tails.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.280
Cassidy in the chat room says, dban.

30:13.280 --> 30:17.160
Yeah, yeah, that, yes, yes, yes, yes.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.880
I once had a situation where I couldn't

30:18.880 --> 30:20.600
get to dban quick enough.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.280
So it was kind of like a, I was working

30:24.280 --> 30:26.880
at this place that was called Dream Dinners.

30:26.880 --> 30:32.280
And they specialized in this online ordering process, which

30:32.280 --> 30:33.780
was brand new back then.

30:33.780 --> 30:36.080
And they specialized in this online ordering process

30:36.080 --> 30:38.560
where you would put together your dinners,

30:38.560 --> 30:43.020
and then you'd go into one of their affiliate kitchens, which

30:43.020 --> 30:47.120
were kind of just all over the place, all over the country.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.520
And you would go in, and you would actually

30:48.520 --> 30:50.360
assemble everything into bags and stuff,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.200
and then take it home and freeze it.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.960
It was kind of nice because they did all the thinking for you,

30:54.960 --> 30:56.620
and they did all the ingredient selection.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.240
But then you could add, if you like a little bit extra garlic,

30:59.240 --> 31:00.480
you'd add a little bit extra garlic.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.560
But they've got it all chopped up, prepared, or precooked,

31:02.560 --> 31:04.480
or whatever needed to happen for those ingredients.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.120
Yeah.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.440
And the instructions you put in there.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.480
And of course, they've got a professional chef or two

31:08.480 --> 31:09.940
in there that answer your questions.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.600
And everything's chilled and clean and all that.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.720
But of course, what people really wanted was they

31:14.720 --> 31:16.160
wanted meals delivered all the way to them.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.080
And they were just one step removed from that.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.000
You had to go to their franchises.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.160
But to power all of this, it's kind of funny.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.320
This is our LDAP episode.

31:24.320 --> 31:28.280
Because to power all of this was a Red Hat Enterprise Linux

31:28.280 --> 31:33.080
setup with LDAP that powered the user logins,

31:33.080 --> 31:35.520
that powered the desktop logins through Samba,

31:35.520 --> 31:39.320
that powered the website back end to manage it all.

31:39.320 --> 31:44.160
It was all done with a single sign-on system that used LDAP.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.440
And we would kind of monitor this system.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.920
And I would kind of run it.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.080
And I was a server guy.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.400
And I had an IT help desk guy.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.320
And it was basically me and him and a developer,

31:53.320 --> 31:54.720
and then eventually two developers.

31:54.720 --> 31:55.680
And that was the entire team.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.440
And this infrastructure ran really great.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.640
I was very proud of it.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.720
Because it was, I guess, what we would now call hybrid.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.200
But we didn't call hybrid back then.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.480
But it was a good chunk of on-premises infrastructure,

32:06.480 --> 32:09.080
but then supplemented with cloud infrastructure

32:09.080 --> 32:11.920
for our front-end web server and database and stuff.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.960
And that was just how I ran it.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.120
And this efficiency group was hired

32:16.120 --> 32:18.680
to come in and make recommendations.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.400
And they came in and they analyzed everything.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.640
And they said, first thing you've got to do

32:24.640 --> 32:26.160
is you've got to switch to ASP.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.640
You've got to drop this PHP stuff.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.920
This is some open source garbage that isn't going anywhere.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.120
You've got to get rid of this.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.520
You need ASP, Active Server Pages.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.280
And you need to run it on IIS.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.920
This back then was probably Server 2003.

32:38.920 --> 32:42.440
And you need to switch to Exchange and Active Directory.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.400
And you need to fire your IT director, which wasn't me.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.900
But they were a friend of the owner.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.440
So instead of firing her, they just transitioned her.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.400
And they brought in this new guy who

32:52.400 --> 32:55.560
was recommended by the company and had worked for Boeing.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.320
And he had just kind of started decimating

32:57.320 --> 32:58.400
the entire infrastructure.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.720
And he and I never really quite got along.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.480
It was one of those things where I'd get in at 637 AM

33:04.480 --> 33:06.440
to make sure everything was working when

33:06.440 --> 33:07.600
the business started.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.400
And then I'd maybe head out at 4 o'clock.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.640
And I was passing him in the stairs.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.800
And he looks over to me and goes,

33:14.800 --> 33:17.320
I can tell who's dedicated by the cars that

33:17.320 --> 33:19.440
are in the parking lot at the end of the day.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.920
Your car usually isn't there.

33:21.920 --> 33:22.920
I'll remember that.

33:22.920 --> 33:26.600
And that's one of the first ways I met him.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.640
And screw him, right?

33:27.640 --> 33:30.360
Because I was actually getting up, commuting down there.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.920
And from Smokey Point, it was a good drive.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.340
Getting down there, and I was making

33:34.340 --> 33:35.820
sure all the systems worked.

33:35.820 --> 33:38.760
And my IT guy, Josh, he and I worked together.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.120
He was there to make sure everybody

33:40.120 --> 33:41.400
got a smooth start in the office.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.520
So the office was there to support

33:42.520 --> 33:44.160
the rest of the infrastructure.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.080
We really went the extra step.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.280
And so when he wanted to remove all of the Linux,

33:48.280 --> 33:49.480
I was just kind of done at that point.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.760
That's when I actually decided I was no longer working

33:51.760 --> 33:52.740
in corporate America, and I was just

33:52.740 --> 33:54.440
going to do independent IT contracting.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.680
That's actually what kicked off my IT contracting career.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.640
So this is about a dozen years ago.

33:59.640 --> 34:03.060
As one of the hiring conditions, when I started that job,

34:03.060 --> 34:06.040
I wanted a System76 laptop.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.160
And so I used the hell out of that laptop.

34:08.160 --> 34:11.220
I ran that entire infrastructure from that System76 laptop,

34:11.220 --> 34:14.080
which made me one of their very early customers, too.

34:14.080 --> 34:18.520
And when I was kind of coming to the realization I was leaving,

34:18.520 --> 34:21.120
I went in, talked to the boss about it.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.240
Said, I think I'm going to move on,

34:23.240 --> 34:25.480
but I want to give you guys a good transition.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.080
He's like, oh, OK, well, all right.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.740
Well, why don't you go to lunch, think about it,

34:28.740 --> 34:30.520
and come back, and we'll talk.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.160
All right, well, there's fish and chips place next door,

34:32.160 --> 34:33.800
so I was happy to go get lunch.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.480
So I'm eating my fish and chips like an idiot

34:36.480 --> 34:38.720
when I should have been downloading DBAN.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.720
But instead, I get back from my lunch,

34:40.720 --> 34:44.440
I sit down on my laptop, and I literally think to myself,

34:44.440 --> 34:46.940
you know, I wonder if he's just going to can my ass.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.120
I better get ready just in case.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.320
And I'm not joking, I launch my web browser

34:51.320 --> 34:52.820
when he comes up to my desk and says,

34:52.820 --> 34:54.800
I'd like you to come into my office.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.440
He fires me on the spot and then doesn't let

34:57.440 --> 34:58.560
me ever go back to my desk.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.220
He goes and boxes my stuff up and takes my laptop,

35:02.220 --> 35:04.320
which was logged in, had my web browser up.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.480
I don't know if the screen had locked or not,

35:05.480 --> 35:06.960
because I didn't see it.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.160
And that was the moment where I was like,

35:09.160 --> 35:14.760
I regret not having DBAN in my bag ready to go,

35:14.760 --> 35:16.960
because I could have popped DBAN in and walked away,

35:16.960 --> 35:18.560
and gone into his office and just let it wipe.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.680
Because if you're not familiar, DBAN audience

35:20.680 --> 35:24.600
is the tool to do like an intelligence agency

35:24.600 --> 35:26.040
grade wipe of your disk.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.220
And I did have, I was talking, I was not happy with him.

35:29.220 --> 35:31.040
So I had emails on there and stuff like that

35:31.040 --> 35:32.600
that were critical of him.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.400
And I didn't want him having that and keeping that.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.760
And some of them were private conversations too in Pidgin.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.640
They weren't like stuff I wanted him to see.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.760
Yeah, so it was a real shame that I couldn't wipe it.

35:42.760 --> 35:46.180
And so having a tool like Ventoy is kind of powerful,

35:46.180 --> 35:47.680
because it means that I could always

35:47.680 --> 35:50.480
have a thumb drive on me that has DBAN on it.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.480
Just right in literally your back pocket.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.440
Always ready to go.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.400
And so I mean, these tools like this

35:55.400 --> 35:57.240
are kind of important for that regard.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.080
You can boot and nuke.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.400
Yeah, good old boot and nuke.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
But man, that guy was such a turd.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.520
And then they went out of business, not shortly after that.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.320
Oh, I wonder why.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.120
Yeah, but it was something.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.620
It was one of my better infrastructures.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.280
I wouldn't say it was my best, because I

36:14.280 --> 36:17.040
think I went on to build my best when I was a contractor.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.040
But it was up there.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.040
I was really proud of it.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.800
And that single sign on stuff through LDAP and Samba

36:21.800 --> 36:23.360
worked really good.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.440
Windows desktops, Linux machines, website logins,

36:26.440 --> 36:28.440
all of it was great.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.200
It's so nice when things click like that.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.060
And it just works.

36:31.060 --> 36:31.720
It's reliable.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.280
You feel like the system's actually doing what you need,

36:34.280 --> 36:35.700
and you're serving the business.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.000
And that's the whole goal.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.500
Now I have literally no idea how I would set any of that up.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.960
It's funny, right, that I used to build that and support it.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.520
But today, I'd probably start picking it back up.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.320
But I couldn't tell you right now how I would

36:47.320 --> 36:48.560
set a system up like that.

36:48.560 --> 36:48.960
Oh, it's fine.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.600
It's just a couple of clicks in the cloud.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.440
Ha ha ha.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.880
Oh dear, ohdear.app.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.300
Complete website monitoring from multiple locations

36:58.300 --> 37:00.720
with broken link and mixed content detection

37:00.720 --> 37:04.640
and advanced SSL certificate reporting and a lot more.

37:04.640 --> 37:08.320
Visit ohdear.app and use promo code Linux for a $10 discount

37:08.320 --> 37:09.000
on any plan.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.040
But you can sign up with no credit card required.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.200
So it's when you go to subscribe,

37:13.200 --> 37:15.000
use the promo code Linux.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.760
This is really a tool I could have used a lot back in the day

37:17.760 --> 37:18.920
when I was running infrastructure,

37:18.920 --> 37:21.420
because I want to be the first to know when something isn't

37:21.420 --> 37:24.440
available, not the customer or not even my customer

37:24.440 --> 37:26.920
at the time, which would, of course, be the end users.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.880
Ohdear has global uptime checking

37:28.880 --> 37:31.120
of servers worldwide that report on problems

37:31.120 --> 37:32.720
as soon as they happen.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.320
But the nice thing is you can go deep into the site, too.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.400
They can crawl and index your entire website.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.440
They can detect broken links, which, of course,

37:39.440 --> 37:42.440
can hurt your SEO, but also just don't look good.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.880
And they can probably notify you.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.120
They have a really intelligent scheme around that.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.120
You can also monitor things like your cron jobs

37:48.120 --> 37:49.780
or your window schedule tasks to make sure

37:49.780 --> 37:51.820
that they actually triggered and fired off

37:51.820 --> 37:53.400
like they should have, because that also

37:53.400 --> 37:55.760
can lead to other problems.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.320
And ohdear is always monitoring for performance.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.200
You get the idea of the speed of your website

38:00.200 --> 38:02.520
right now and over time, so you can kind of

38:02.520 --> 38:05.120
see if there's a trend happening.

38:05.120 --> 38:09.960
But what makes ohdear very special is their API.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.040
It lets you configure everything about the application.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.440
Everything you see in your dashboard

38:15.440 --> 38:20.320
can be controlled with their easy-to-use RESTful API.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.000
It's got kick-ass documentation.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.800
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API

38:25.800 --> 38:28.760
will be visible in real time on your dashboard.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.480
ohdear is monitoring, and it's a solution

38:31.480 --> 38:33.160
that embraces automation.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.320
So if you're looking at monitoring solutions right now

38:35.320 --> 38:37.360
and you're thinking, I'd really like something

38:37.360 --> 38:39.720
that we can integrate, that we can automate,

38:39.720 --> 38:43.400
that we can deploy as code, you need to check out ohdear.app.

38:43.400 --> 38:43.960
It's ohdear.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.120
It's a comprehensive API.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.320
It means third-party integrations are simple.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.240
It's really easy to get going with command line

38:49.240 --> 38:53.340
clients, Telegram chatbots, SDKs, Terraform providers,

38:53.340 --> 38:54.320
and a lot more.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.920
So right now, head to ohdear.app and start a 10-day,

38:57.920 --> 39:01.920
no-strings-attached trial, no-credit-card required.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.440
You can get set in less than minutes.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.980
And when you do sign up for any plan,

39:04.980 --> 39:07.320
use the promo code LINUX for a $10 discount.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.440
And if they ask, tell them Linux Unplugged sent you.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.240
ohdear.app.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.040
Check them out and use promo code LINUX when you do sign up.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.640
We got a nice batch of feedback.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.680
How about I take the first one, and then you

39:22.680 --> 39:23.480
take the next one?

39:23.480 --> 39:24.880
We just kind of do it like that.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.200
Sounds good to me.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.920
Martin writes in about OpenSUSE and FOSS Adventures.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.720
He says, dear Chris and Wes, I'd like

39:31.720 --> 39:35.080
to give you some feedback on your OpenSUSE feedback.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.960
I'm a longtime JB fan since 2010.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.280
Wow.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.160
That has been a while.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.600
Oh, gee.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.240
That's great.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.040
And he says, he uses OpenSUSE.

39:48.040 --> 39:52.080
I remember when you and Brian were quite positive of OpenSUSE.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.680
Yeah, but I'm not, was Brian just positive

39:53.680 --> 39:54.800
because it got a job later?

39:54.800 --> 39:56.560
I'm not, I don't know.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.040
But he says, when you guys talked about Tumbleweed,

39:59.040 --> 40:00.360
it was quite negative.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.920
But Chris, those are your experiences.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.240
And I think you should be able to voice that.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.840
But I've run OpenSUSE for 10 years, and I love Yast.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.320
I appreciate how Yast works.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.600
It enables my mom to install her HP printer without my help,

40:12.600 --> 40:14.160
who is a total Linux novice.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.360
It's hard to argue with that, right?

40:15.360 --> 40:17.240
That's one less call for tech support.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.960
But what I don't get from that is,

40:18.960 --> 40:21.960
is Yast great for him anymore?

40:21.960 --> 40:23.640
And is that because he's only used Yast,

40:23.640 --> 40:25.040
so he has to keep using Yast?

40:25.040 --> 40:28.080
So Martin, I wouldn't mind a follow-up on that.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.080
But he says, your comments about OpenSUSE documentation,

40:32.080 --> 40:34.000
about the voice and tone and the community,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.560
and about the NVIDIA proprietary drivers,

40:36.560 --> 40:37.920
they were 100% on the mark.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.760
I experienced those pains too.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.240
He goes on to say, that's why I have my blog, Foss Adventures,

40:43.240 --> 40:45.720
to help improve the communication around OpenSUSE.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.000
I try to show others how to solve common problems

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
in OpenSUSE.

40:50.000 --> 40:50.640
So that's great.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.260
I also love the blog of Cubicle Nate and another open source

40:53.260 --> 40:53.760
user.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.080
Check out cubiclenate.com.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.400
So his website is Foss Adventures,

40:58.400 --> 41:01.080
and then Cubicle Nate has a website at cubiclenate.com.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.520
He says, keep up the great work.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.080
Best regards, Martin.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.640
Super solid feedback, Martin, and that's a great way to,

41:07.640 --> 41:11.200
I mean, that's a great example of how to communicate,

41:11.200 --> 41:13.720
hey, I heard what you said about that distro.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.480
I heard that it doesn't work for you.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.760
Well, that's fine.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.920
Here's why it works for me.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.080
And it's just a real nice, like, I got real value.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.440
I know exactly why he asked works for his mom.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.800
That totally makes sense.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.960
And then he acknowledges that the documentation

41:26.960 --> 41:30.360
and the process around the NVIDIA driver is horrible.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.480
And I think that's such a great way

41:32.480 --> 41:34.320
to engage with somebody who tried a distro,

41:34.320 --> 41:36.440
but maybe had a slightly negative feedback,

41:36.440 --> 41:39.800
some kind of negative experience in that trying process.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.840
And honestly, if this was the experience

41:42.840 --> 41:45.160
that I had primarily received, I don't

41:45.160 --> 41:46.740
think we would have even mentioned

41:46.740 --> 41:47.780
the tone and the feedback.

41:47.780 --> 41:49.400
I don't think that would have even come up.

41:49.400 --> 41:49.900
Right.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.320
But here, we're not arguing.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.680
We're just sharing experiences.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.360
And we can all learn from that.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.960
Now, I like this next one because it's about Neon.

41:56.960 --> 42:03.320
And Plasma 5.21 looks like a barn burner of a good release.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.080
Excited already.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.860
We just kind of did a rundown in Linux Action News,

42:06.860 --> 42:09.320
if you're not familiar with coming in 5.21.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.960
But yeah.

42:10.960 --> 42:11.880
So Nacho writes in.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.640
Wes, take it.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.960
Hey, Chris and team.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.720
I'm just writing to describe my recent experience with KDE

42:16.720 --> 42:19.520
Plasma through KDE Neon.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.880
I heard your predictions episode and all the great things

42:21.880 --> 42:24.960
KDE is bringing and thought I'd give it a try.

42:24.960 --> 42:29.960
I had a 2018 15-inch HP Envy laptop that never fully worked

42:29.960 --> 42:33.280
when I installed Ubuntu proper, Ubuntu Mate, Zubuntu,

42:33.280 --> 42:34.560
and lastly, Deepin.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.840
Well, yeah, really tried those things.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.600
It always had some glitches that I'd

42:38.600 --> 42:40.240
have to put up with when running off

42:40.240 --> 42:42.200
of one of those other distributions.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.720
But KDE Neon worked great.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.960
And I was surprised at how beautiful it all looked stock.

42:47.960 --> 42:50.880
It was a bit rough trying to install the distro in high DPI.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.920
But thankfully, I'm not new to distro hopping.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.600
But once installed, I was pleasantly surprised

42:56.600 --> 42:58.440
and can see why so many people champion

42:58.440 --> 43:01.480
Plasma as their desktop of choice.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.520
Also, shout out to Alan's ThinkPad corner

43:03.520 --> 43:05.640
on Ubuntu podcast.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.920
You can pry it from my cold dead hands.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.480
I'm right there with you.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.160
Thanks again, longtime listener, Nacho.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.600
So Nacho, I'm curious if you had,

43:14.600 --> 43:17.240
you mentioned that you tried a few distros there.

43:17.240 --> 43:21.200
But what you didn't mention was Kubuntu.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.720
And the reason why I ask is because you

43:23.720 --> 43:26.160
say Ubuntu gave you issues.

43:26.160 --> 43:31.600
You mentioned that Mate, Zubuntu, and Deepin all had problems.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.760
But I'm surprised that Neon works for you

43:33.760 --> 43:36.920
because Neon's based on Ubuntu, right?

43:36.920 --> 43:39.800
It's just Ubuntu with the Plasma desktop.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.360
Fancy your newer Plasma.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.300
Yeah, yeah, it's 2004 with newer Plasma.

43:44.300 --> 43:46.760
So I wonder if Kubuntu, now that you've got something working,

43:46.760 --> 43:47.840
it doesn't really matter.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.920
But just for troubleshooting, I'm just

43:49.920 --> 43:51.880
curious to know what was going on there.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.600
But good to know.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.440
And I agree, KD Neon's going to look even more attractive here

43:56.440 --> 44:00.520
in about mid-February when Plasma 5.21 lands.

44:00.520 --> 44:04.040
I'm going to be updating the day it comes out.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.440
So Matthew writes in.

44:05.440 --> 44:08.000
He says, my request is simple.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.160
I really miss Chris's next Tuesday in the outro.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.920
It always makes me smile and look forward

44:15.920 --> 44:16.720
to the next episode.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.600
Can we please bring that back?

44:18.600 --> 44:21.080
Smiles are in short supply this day.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.440
I will try.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.060
I kind of stopped doing it because I just

44:24.060 --> 44:26.280
figure after a while, a gimmick like that

44:26.280 --> 44:28.360
gets annoying if people listen and listen.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.000
But if the people want more Tuesday, Wes.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.280
You have no right to deny these folks.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.000
Yeah, I'll tell them to see you next Tuesday all day long

44:36.000 --> 44:37.040
if that's what they want.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.560
Do you want to take listener Chris's email?

44:39.560 --> 44:41.560
Yeah, I better because otherwise if you read it,

44:41.560 --> 44:43.800
it's just too confusing based on the name.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.560
Hello, Chris, Wes, and the JB family.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.920
Wanted to share an upcoming product release from Lenovo.

44:49.920 --> 44:54.920
And Chris links us over to the ThinkPad X12 Detachable 12-inch

44:54.920 --> 44:57.040
Intel-powered tablet.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.520
Interesting.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.960
Continues on, what do you think of the prospects of Linux

45:00.960 --> 45:02.160
running on Lenovo's?

45:02.160 --> 45:05.360
Answer to the Microsoft Surface Pro.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.080
I've been desirous for years of an all-in-one Linux device

45:08.080 --> 45:11.960
that serves as both my laptop and tablet when needed.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.800
And given that I occasionally run a few VMs and containers

45:14.800 --> 45:18.440
that require x86 hardware, something in the ARM world

45:18.440 --> 45:21.040
just wouldn't work for me.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.120
Thanks for the awesome shows and all that you do.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.400
Life wouldn't be the same without my JB Linux fix.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.640
And I'm curious to hear if you guys would be interested

45:27.640 --> 45:29.240
in something like this.

45:29.240 --> 45:33.360
So this guy is a 12.3-inch detachable tablet-style laptop.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.880
It does come with a little pen that kind of snaps

45:35.880 --> 45:38.200
onto the side of the keyboard.

45:38.200 --> 45:40.520
And it looks pretty lightweight.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.560
It looks like it's probably significantly lighter

45:42.560 --> 45:44.480
than any laptop I've ever had.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.000
And it has also a kick-out stand.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.120
So if you do take the screen mobile,

45:48.120 --> 45:50.640
it does kind of have that Surface-style stand

45:50.640 --> 45:51.840
that snaps out.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.720
Well, it looks like it might even have Intel Xe graphics.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.280
So that's interesting.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.920
Up to 16 gigs of RAM, you can get an i7 in there

45:58.920 --> 46:01.040
or a 1-terabyte NVMe SSD.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.920
So it's not a slouch of a system.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.200
Yeah, that makes sense, right?

46:04.200 --> 46:05.880
It makes sense it would have 11th Gen.

46:05.880 --> 46:06.920
That's nice.

46:06.920 --> 46:10.320
It's a 1920 by 1280 IPS anti-reflective,

46:10.320 --> 46:14.160
anti-smudge, 400 nits Gorilla Glass screen.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.560
Looks like it just has 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte NVMe.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.880
It may not even be customizable in that regard.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.720
You know, it's funny.

46:21.720 --> 46:25.600
If you would ask me six months ago, I'd be like, nah, nah.

46:25.600 --> 46:30.280
But there might be a place for this in my life.

46:30.280 --> 46:34.440
I am starting to realize that, and I apologize

46:34.440 --> 46:36.200
that I'm making somewhat kind of a car analogy,

46:36.200 --> 46:38.320
but there's a lot of different laptops for different people.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.880
And you've got your commuter laptops.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.520
You've got your truck laptops.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.160
You've got your sports car laptops.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.600
Is this just you trying to explain

46:44.600 --> 46:46.040
why you have so many computers?

46:46.040 --> 46:47.880
I'm buried in laptops at the moment.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.280
Thankfully, only a couple of them are actually owned by me.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.920
But I'll tell you what, having a bunch of different laptops

46:53.920 --> 46:56.480
at one time, it's like never something

46:56.480 --> 46:58.280
I would have just done, right?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.840
I wouldn't just all of a sudden have a bunch of laptops,

47:00.840 --> 47:02.000
because what's the point?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.880
You don't need that many laptops at one time.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.600
But because there have been a bunch in and out for review,

47:06.600 --> 47:07.560
I've got ThinkPads.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.420
I've got Lenovo's.

47:08.420 --> 47:09.400
I've got Asus'.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.240
There's a MacBook.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.040
Like, the whole gamut for, because we're

47:12.040 --> 47:13.080
doing them on code or two.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.600
It's like the whole thing, right?

47:14.600 --> 47:16.680
And that's really been an interesting perspective,

47:16.680 --> 47:17.520
because it's like, well, which one

47:17.520 --> 47:18.680
do I want to drive right now?

47:18.680 --> 47:19.920
I think I'm going to take this one, because I'm

47:19.920 --> 47:21.560
doing this kind of job.

47:21.560 --> 47:25.240
And I could see if I was rich, like Jay Leno,

47:25.240 --> 47:27.240
instead of having a garage full of cars,

47:27.240 --> 47:29.400
I'd have garages full of different kinds of computers

47:29.400 --> 47:30.600
and laptops and stuff.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.960
And I could see a place for this,

47:31.960 --> 47:36.200
because I really like having a tablet when

47:36.200 --> 47:39.760
I am sitting on the couch next to a family member

47:39.760 --> 47:41.040
and we're looking something up.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.680
Or I'm entertaining myself while the kids are

47:43.680 --> 47:46.360
watching some video on the TV.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.680
I like having the flexibility of that.

47:48.680 --> 47:51.040
But they're so limited.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
Anytime I want to do anything, like if I want,

47:53.040 --> 47:55.000
I need to go log into my bank account and figure something

47:55.000 --> 47:55.240
out.

47:55.240 --> 47:58.360
Anytime I want to do any serious work, I put the tablet down,

47:58.360 --> 48:00.160
and I go dig out the laptop.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.560
But if this, it'd just be a matter of snapping it

48:02.560 --> 48:04.000
into a base.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.640
Obviously, there'd be UI and desktop environment issues

48:06.640 --> 48:09.360
to work out, which I guess in the real, I guess,

48:09.360 --> 48:13.760
so I guess, Wes, you'd have to look at this in the real world.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.660
That may be a disincentive.

48:15.660 --> 48:16.840
It's getting better.

48:16.840 --> 48:20.240
But it's not like there's a perfect UI for this right now.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.280
That was kind of my main question is,

48:22.280 --> 48:24.120
what would a real Linux experience

48:24.120 --> 48:25.640
be with a modern Linux desktop?

48:25.640 --> 48:27.040
Like, I'm not sure we've optimized

48:27.040 --> 48:27.960
that well for this case.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.400
I don't know.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.440
I don't have any device that's really like this.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.560
So I've not tried it personally.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.120
So at this point, I think picking one up

48:34.120 --> 48:35.920
would probably be on the experimental end.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.260
But that's the first step to figuring something out

48:38.260 --> 48:39.120
that works nicely.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.400
And if Lenovo seems more and more friendly to Linux,

48:42.400 --> 48:44.120
maybe it means the hardware will just work,

48:44.120 --> 48:46.380
and we need to just work on the presentation layer.

48:46.380 --> 48:49.000
If Lenovo was smart, I mean, who am I to say?

48:49.000 --> 48:52.240
But it seems like they would be kind of interested in what

48:52.240 --> 48:54.800
it's like to run Linux on there, because otherwise, they're

48:54.800 --> 48:58.480
competing against Microsoft's own hardware, which, hmm,

48:58.480 --> 49:01.040
you know, the Surface is pretty well known and pretty popular.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.920
And if you're kind of into this form factor,

49:02.920 --> 49:06.520
you're probably pretty inclined to go get the Surface.

49:06.520 --> 49:09.640
And there's been news recently that there

49:09.640 --> 49:11.980
are several performance improvements

49:11.980 --> 49:15.480
and other kinds of improvements for the Surface landing

49:15.480 --> 49:17.800
upstream in the Linux kernel right now.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.040
It seems like it's a popular product.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.120
Yeah, oh, hey, OK.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.680
So we might have more than a few options pretty soon.

49:24.680 --> 49:25.840
Yeah, so we'll see.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.560
All right, so I'll take this last one,

49:27.560 --> 49:28.960
because it's totally on me.

49:28.960 --> 49:32.000
Hang writes, and he says, I noticed.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.520
I noticed that Google Forms were being used for the Tuxes.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.100
Therefore, I did not fill it out.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.560
I was astonished to see that members of an open source

49:41.560 --> 49:45.000
community use proprietary and spyware tools,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.560
such as Google Forms, to conduct surveys.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.260
Have you considered using an open source survey software

49:50.260 --> 49:52.320
rather than closed source proprietary ones

49:52.320 --> 49:54.240
by a data mining company?

49:54.240 --> 49:57.520
What do you think of Cosmo Communicator, Gemini PDA,

49:57.520 --> 49:59.160
and AstroSlide Projects?

49:59.160 --> 50:00.600
There you go.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.800
What, he says, what do you think?

50:02.800 --> 50:05.000
Well, he's right, Hang.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.200
I'm sorry that we used Google Forms.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.680
It was totally a proof of concept.

50:09.680 --> 50:10.400
Here's the idea.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.560
Oh, my gosh, this is a cool idea.

50:11.560 --> 50:12.800
How do we implement it right now,

50:12.800 --> 50:15.120
because we want to talk about it and get it out there?

50:15.120 --> 50:17.040
And how do we implement it in a way where,

50:17.040 --> 50:18.400
once we've all of a sudden decided

50:18.400 --> 50:20.640
to create this extra work for the team,

50:20.640 --> 50:25.240
we can consume the information that the audience in the form

50:25.240 --> 50:28.320
of several hundred submissions will be

50:28.320 --> 50:29.960
palatable and processable by us?

50:29.960 --> 50:34.520
And that's where, when it was like kind of a day

50:34.520 --> 50:38.160
before final go, no go decision, we were like, oh, right.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.080
Well, we know that if we use Google Forms,

50:41.080 --> 50:42.600
we can get it in a spreadsheet that we

50:42.600 --> 50:44.520
can share amongst each other, and then we

50:44.520 --> 50:47.860
can massage the data, which is very much what we did.

50:47.860 --> 50:50.640
And that was really what drove the decision

50:50.640 --> 50:51.500
to use Google Forms.

50:51.500 --> 50:52.480
I don't love it.

50:52.480 --> 50:56.020
And I think what I want to do is just kind of be

50:56.020 --> 50:58.360
a little more intentional, as the end of the year

50:58.360 --> 51:00.920
begins to approach, to just start working on this.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.720
We've got emails from a lot of folks that want to help us.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.260
And I think that's probably when we're

51:05.260 --> 51:06.440
going to rally the troops.

51:06.440 --> 51:08.640
Yes, which we're very grateful for, by the way.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.520
Super grateful.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.880
It's really nice, because I want to do it right.

51:11.880 --> 51:14.440
And now that I know it's worth the time.

51:14.440 --> 51:17.000
Yeah, maybe we called this last year a tuxes beta.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.760
Yeah, because I thought it would be just something we'd do it,

51:20.760 --> 51:21.800
we would enjoy it.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.600
It'd be a way for us to spread a little joy,

51:23.600 --> 51:24.800
and then it'd be done.

51:24.800 --> 51:27.320
But we got contacted by several projects.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.880
We had lots of people write in and say, oh, I

51:29.880 --> 51:31.260
didn't get to vote.

51:31.260 --> 51:35.080
We had people that wanted to kind of have a robust debate

51:35.080 --> 51:37.160
about which winner we had chosen.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.240
There was a lot of people that kind of got engaged.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.280
And so that's great.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.080
That showed us that it was worth the effort.

51:42.080 --> 51:44.880
I actually thought it was going to be a flop.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.380
It was a misread on my part.

51:46.380 --> 51:48.760
And so the Google Forms was a way for us to try it

51:48.760 --> 51:51.080
without standing up something, without really having

51:51.080 --> 51:52.640
to go in deep on something.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.000
But my goals are now to have a dedicated website

51:55.000 --> 51:56.960
in the future, to let you guys know about a week

51:56.960 --> 51:58.920
earlier when the submissions are open,

51:58.920 --> 52:01.480
and to not use Google Forms.

52:01.480 --> 52:04.000
We'll see if we check all those boxes.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.880
All right, well, if you want to get an email in,

52:05.880 --> 52:10.040
go over to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

52:10.040 --> 52:13.000
Wes, why don't we wrap it up with the System76 prediction

52:13.000 --> 52:14.240
before we get out of here.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.400
Kevin writes in with his System76 prediction.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.360
My 2020 prediction.

52:18.360 --> 52:19.520
All right, it's a little late.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.160
But what we're going to allow this one

52:21.160 --> 52:25.960
is that System76 will unveil an in-house designed laptop

52:25.960 --> 52:27.400
in 2021.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.860
Yeah, he's saying that that's what's going to happen in 2021.

52:29.860 --> 52:33.640
I thought this was a fun one since social happiness, AKA Emma,

52:33.640 --> 52:35.120
is in the chat room right now.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.920
I thought it'd be fun.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.120
I'd love to see it.

52:38.120 --> 52:41.600
I think you don't get to laptop without getting to keyboard,

52:41.600 --> 52:42.320
Kevin.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.600
So I think your prediction might be a little ambitious

52:44.600 --> 52:47.240
because I think what we first need to see

52:47.240 --> 52:48.920
is a keyboard that shifts.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.960
And that is such an opportunity to learn

52:50.960 --> 52:53.360
so many lessons about the manufacturing process.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.080
But also, you want a laptop to have a killer keyboard, too.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.320
So you learn about making that component as well.

52:58.320 --> 53:01.400
Plus, you know System76 has a high bar for quality.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.120
So they're not going to push something out

53:03.120 --> 53:04.120
until it's ready.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.000
So that's just why maybe the timeline is going

53:06.000 --> 53:07.520
to be a little longer than we hope.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.280
But I would love to see it just whenever it's possible.

53:10.280 --> 53:13.120
And also, I would buy the hell out of a System76 keyboard.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.000
And I think a lot of people would because you

53:15.000 --> 53:16.040
know they'd do it right.

53:16.040 --> 53:19.440
And then that helps fund the laptop.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.600
I mean, I'm not going on any information.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.540
But it seems like a pretty practical and logical approach

53:24.540 --> 53:25.760
that's likely got a shot.

53:25.760 --> 53:28.960
So I suspect that's it, Kevin.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.360
So maybe 2022.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.040
I don't know.

53:32.040 --> 53:32.960
I mean, you never know.

53:32.960 --> 53:33.640
Maybe.

53:33.640 --> 53:34.140
Maybe.

53:34.140 --> 53:34.980
But I like it.

53:34.980 --> 53:37.480
I like thinking that way because what a moment that

53:37.480 --> 53:40.120
would be when someone in our community

53:40.120 --> 53:44.400
starts building hardware like that that is like a laptop

53:44.400 --> 53:44.880
option.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.420
I mean, who knows what that could be.

53:46.420 --> 53:48.640
And then you'll have one more laptop to buy, Chris.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.520
Just what you needed.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.480
Yeah.

53:51.480 --> 53:51.960
All right.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.280
Just a quick pick.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.760
Really, just a quick pick because we

53:54.760 --> 53:55.360
got to get out of here.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.400
We don't want it to be a long one,

53:56.400 --> 53:57.860
but it's starting to get that way.

53:57.860 --> 54:02.840
Wes found a really handy tool to backup your Postgres databases

54:02.840 --> 54:03.760
into object storage.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.360
Tell us about it, Mr. Payne.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.000
It's called PG Horde.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.160
And yeah, that's basically it.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.520
It's a Postgres backup daemon that's

54:10.520 --> 54:13.920
focused just on Postgres and has a special support

54:13.920 --> 54:16.600
for storing stuff in cloud object stores.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.800
I like this because the database is kind of special for a lot

54:19.800 --> 54:20.720
of web applications.

54:20.720 --> 54:23.580
It's where all of your important data, customer information,

54:23.580 --> 54:24.760
everything that you care.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.920
For us, it's often show notes or other kinds of stuff

54:26.920 --> 54:29.280
that we just don't want to lose.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.360
And it's sure, we run everything in Docker,

54:31.360 --> 54:33.760
and it's pretty easy to back things up that way.

54:33.760 --> 54:36.240
But I like the rich support here.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.320
They've got automatic periodic base backups.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.120
You can integrate with the transaction log.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.880
There's optional standalone hot backup support.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.040
And of course, it just goes and sticks it right in object

54:45.040 --> 54:47.920
storage, which works really nice for us since we're already

54:47.920 --> 54:49.120
leveraging that.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.160
There's encryption support and compression.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.040
And you can restore directly from a compressed and

54:54.040 --> 54:56.040
encrypted file in object storage.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.400
You don't have to download it and do any fancy workflows.

54:58.400 --> 55:01.200
PG Horde just takes care of it.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.560
And I know like half of the things we run in containers,

55:03.560 --> 55:05.240
there's a Postgres running somewhere.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.560
I'm sure that's true for a lot of other folks.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.640
So it seemed negligent that we constantly advertise fun

55:09.640 --> 55:11.640
software to run without also giving you

55:11.640 --> 55:13.240
a tool to help keep it safe.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.800
Absolutely, and this is a good one.

55:14.800 --> 55:18.000
And we've gone on and on about object storage recently,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.520
but we're just finding other useful ways to take advantage

55:20.520 --> 55:22.160
of a system like that.

55:22.160 --> 55:26.120
And it's really simple to just host it even on your own box.

55:26.120 --> 55:28.440
There's open source projects that make your system

55:28.440 --> 55:31.040
essentially look like AWS S3.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.760
And you can just store to a system on your network

55:33.760 --> 55:36.280
using this, or you could store to systems in the cloud.

55:36.280 --> 55:40.280
And because you have things like Linode and Google Cloud,

55:40.280 --> 55:44.120
and obviously AWS, and Azure, and lots of other services

55:44.120 --> 55:46.040
that support object storage, Digital Ocean,

55:46.040 --> 55:47.880
there's a lot you can choose.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.240
So you can kind of shop.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.960
You have a lot of choices there.

55:51.960 --> 55:53.920
So it's PG Horde, and we will have a link

55:53.920 --> 55:56.360
to that in the show notes.

55:56.360 --> 55:59.480
Special thank you to our members, our core contributors

55:59.480 --> 56:00.920
at unplug.core.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.920
You help keep this show independent, let us be choosy.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.080
You give us the leverage to walk away from a deal.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.240
If we have an ad deal that just doesn't seem like it's

56:08.240 --> 56:10.360
the right fit, we don't have to be desperate.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.600
We have our members, and they give us multiple ways

56:13.600 --> 56:14.600
to remain independent.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.200
And we're really, really appreciative of that.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.280
So we give a couple of perks if you become a member

56:18.280 --> 56:19.920
at unpluggedcore.com.

56:19.920 --> 56:24.760
You get a limited ad feed, fully produced, sounds great,

56:24.760 --> 56:27.880
ready to go in the car, just less ads,

56:27.880 --> 56:29.840
a little bit shorter runtime.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.840
There's a second feed that's the exact opposite of all that.

56:32.840 --> 56:34.840
It's the bootleg feed, the full live stream.

56:34.840 --> 56:38.080
Every mess up, every minute we're on air,

56:38.080 --> 56:39.680
it's super long.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.280
It's like double the show.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.600
And there's often a lot of really good conversations

56:44.600 --> 56:46.640
that just don't get captured when you hit record,

56:46.640 --> 56:48.480
because that's human nature.

56:48.480 --> 56:49.720
And that is in that feed.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.720
So you get two choices.

56:51.720 --> 56:56.760
And you can support the show at the same time, unpluggedcore.com.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.220
I would love to have you join us live.

56:58.220 --> 56:59.840
We do this show Tuesdays.

56:59.840 --> 57:03.120
And we do it at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.400
See you next week.

57:04.400 --> 57:07.000
Same bat time, same bat station.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.160
And of course, that's at jblive.tv.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.800
You can get Mumble, then participate in the Luplug

57:11.800 --> 57:16.000
and participate in our LiveLug.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.440
And you get a real-time stream.

57:17.440 --> 57:18.680
And it's free software.

57:18.680 --> 57:20.480
It's a free software stack from top to bottom

57:20.480 --> 57:21.440
when you go that route.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.720
That's a win-win-win.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.600
Yeah.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.480
Links to the stuff we talked about today

57:25.480 --> 57:28.160
at linuxunplug.com slash 389.

57:28.160 --> 57:31.160
Our contact page is there as well as all our RSS feeds

57:31.160 --> 57:32.960
and all of that good stuff, including

57:32.960 --> 57:36.480
Matrix and Mumble server info, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

57:36.480 --> 57:39.800
But I'll let you figure all that out.

57:39.800 --> 57:41.040
I say it enough.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.280
I don't need to tell you again.

57:42.280 --> 57:43.280
Thanks for joining us.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.480
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

57:45.480 --> 58:15.320
Bye-bye.

58:15.480 --> 58:25.700
JBtitles.com, let's go vote.

58:25.700 --> 58:27.520
See what we want to call this thing.

58:27.520 --> 58:29.200
We need your votes.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.080
So it seemed like we stirred up quite a bit of feedback after the post show last week

58:32.080 --> 58:33.920
when I mentioned my fedora woes.

58:33.920 --> 58:38.760
I heard from folks on Manjaro and other distributions that we're having the same issue where flat

58:38.760 --> 58:43.440
packs are just non-existent to their plasma desktop, not in the launcher, you can't add

58:43.440 --> 58:44.720
them to the menu.

58:44.720 --> 58:50.480
It just doesn't seem, and maybe we found a common thing amongst all of us.

58:50.480 --> 58:53.640
We did a little bugathon off air, I guess, in a way.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.560
Async bugathon over in matrix.

58:55.560 --> 58:56.560
Look at that.

58:56.560 --> 59:00.400
And it seemed like, I don't know who, maybe Neil or Carl, I don't know which one of you

59:00.400 --> 59:03.880
would be best to speak to this, but it seemed like the common thread was everybody had swapped

59:03.880 --> 59:09.320
out their default shell in console, which I don't know how you connect those dots.

59:09.320 --> 59:13.400
But I guess whatever you said is your default shell actually is respected by the rest of

59:13.400 --> 59:15.440
the plasma desktop session.

59:15.440 --> 59:18.640
And for whatever reason, that broke things.

59:18.640 --> 59:21.320
And when you just switch it back to the default, I guess it unbreaks.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.320
I haven't done it yet.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.440
I was thinking maybe I'd try it now live on the show.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.600
I think some of that too was, you know, some folks had changed it with like changing it

59:27.600 --> 59:28.600
system wide in the shell.

59:28.600 --> 59:31.600
I'm not sure how what you normally do when you install Phish versus say you can also

59:31.600 --> 59:35.080
configure just console to launch Phish as your shell.

59:35.080 --> 59:38.720
I think that was maybe the workaround of like, don't change it system wide, but just if you

59:38.720 --> 59:42.840
want to have console or whatever terminal emulator you're using, launch it for you.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.680
Oh, I don't think I do set it system wide.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.680
Hmm.

59:45.680 --> 59:46.680
So maybe that's not it.

59:46.680 --> 59:47.680
Let me see.

59:47.680 --> 59:51.600
I got a lot of user accounts on this one user laptop here.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.200
I did set it in password.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.000
I did change it in password.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.120
I did.

59:56.120 --> 59:57.880
So you're telling me that's where I have to change it.

59:57.880 --> 59:58.880
It's worth a shot anyway.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.720
Switch that back to bash and then.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.880
I don't even remember doing that.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.360
I must have just done it right after install and just got it over with.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.640
You were so sick of not having Phish set up that you just did whatever it took.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640
I want my auto complete.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640
Where's?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640
Once you're spoiled.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640
I mean, it's hard to go back.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.600
Let me just go edit Etsy password with nano real quick.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.040
Little pro tip for nano.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.160
Tack W for really wide files, which Etsy password is absolutely not.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.540
But you feel like a pro when you do tack W.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.800
I thought you had switched to using micro.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800
I did.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.560
But with the new release of nano, I'm back on the nano sauce.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.720
Someday we'll get him a decent text editor.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.920
It's when there'll be a terminal only version of VS code.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:44.760
That's what it'll be.
