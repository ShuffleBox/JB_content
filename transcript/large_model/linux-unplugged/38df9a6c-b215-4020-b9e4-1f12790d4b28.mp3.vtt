WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
Before we get the show rolling today,

00:01.400 --> 00:03.140
I'm wondering if any of you in the Mamba Room

00:03.140 --> 00:04.480
are working on any cool projects

00:04.480 --> 00:05.760
we can share with the class.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.680
I've been playing with some new things this week.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.840
Oh yeah, what?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.520
Well, an old thing renewed,

00:10.520 --> 00:14.760
so I've been working on bringing Ubuntu MATE 18.04

00:14.760 --> 00:18.100
to the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, and 3 Plus.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.500
But in doing so, I have reacquainted myself

00:21.500 --> 00:23.240
with SystemD Endspawn,

00:23.240 --> 00:25.080
and I'm having a little love-in

00:25.080 --> 00:27.120
with SystemD Endspawn this week.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.680
Wes talks about this all the time.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.520
This is like a way to kind of do like little mini containers

00:31.520 --> 00:33.680
with using nothing but SystemD, right?

00:33.680 --> 00:36.600
Yeah, it's a part of the SystemD tool set

00:36.600 --> 00:39.040
that is for container management,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.920
and it can do most of the things

00:40.920 --> 00:44.120
most of the container tools can do.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.740
But what I've been doing is pairing it up

00:46.740 --> 00:50.720
with a piece of software called QMU User Static,

00:50.720 --> 00:55.720
which is a fast processor emulator for ARM and MIPS

00:55.800 --> 00:57.480
and a whole bunch, and PowerPC,

00:57.480 --> 01:01.400
a whole bunch of sort of unusual processor architectures,

01:01.400 --> 01:04.560
and I've been able to create containers

01:04.560 --> 01:07.980
of ARM 32-bit and ARM 64-bit,

01:07.980 --> 01:10.880
and actually do my build and testing

01:10.880 --> 01:15.000
on my Intel workstation using foreign architecture

01:15.000 --> 01:18.120
containers, even taking it to the point

01:18.120 --> 01:22.280
where you can bind mount into the container

01:22.280 --> 01:25.320
for things like X authority and pulse audio

01:25.320 --> 01:27.400
and the display environment variables

01:27.400 --> 01:30.920
and the X socket, and you can actually launch

01:30.920 --> 01:34.520
X applications for ARM inside the container

01:34.520 --> 01:37.200
and run them on your host operating system,

01:37.200 --> 01:39.200
so it's really great for sort of debugging

01:39.200 --> 01:40.680
and getting stuff tested.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.040
Holy smokes, what's the speed impact like?

01:45.040 --> 01:48.760
It's negligible overhead, this one certainly is,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.400
but you know, I've done this sort of thing

01:50.400 --> 01:52.200
inside CH routes in the past,

01:52.200 --> 01:55.360
but there's some overhead you have to manage there yourself,

01:55.360 --> 01:58.920
whereas system dnspawn does all of the isolation

01:58.920 --> 02:01.320
for you automatically, and you don't have to do things

02:01.320 --> 02:05.400
like binding to dev PTS and all that kind of monkeying

02:05.400 --> 02:06.920
around it, it caters for that,

02:06.920 --> 02:10.320
but in terms of performance, it's brilliant.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.320
For me, operating these things and running

02:15.320 --> 02:18.320
quite complicated build environments inside them,

02:18.320 --> 02:20.960
it's like native performance.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.960
A lot of fun when you bring up things like system monitors

02:23.960 --> 02:26.520
and it tells you it's ARM 32-bit running

02:26.520 --> 02:30.040
on an i9-9900K with 64 gigabytes of RAM,

02:30.040 --> 02:34.800
but you know, it's, which I posted on Twitter

02:34.800 --> 02:38.080
and had a few people looking sideways at the screenshot,

02:38.080 --> 02:41.400
but yeah, it's a really potent combination

02:41.400 --> 02:44.360
of QMU user static and system dnspawn.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.960
That is pretty great, that's a hell of a way

02:45.960 --> 02:46.800
to start a show.

02:46.800 --> 02:52.680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 291, for March 3rd, 2019.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.760
Oh, hi there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

03:06.760 --> 03:10.600
that this week is packed full of community news.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.720
Looking at the price of the cloud,

03:12.720 --> 03:15.720
has a bit of a rant about our home folders,

03:15.720 --> 03:18.880
a few pics for you, and much, much more.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.840
My name is Chris.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.920
My name is Wes.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.080
Hello, Mr. Payne, and this week,

03:24.080 --> 03:25.840
I'm super excited to say in studio,

03:25.840 --> 03:28.920
joining me is the CEO and founder of Linux Academy,

03:28.920 --> 03:29.760
Anthony James.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.600
Hello, Anthony.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.240
Hey, thanks for having me, it's exciting to be here.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.640
You got a nice little spot set up.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.760
Do you like what I built here?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.040
I do, very relaxing.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.760
I know, the final piece really was that lamp.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.120
That lamp really did it.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.320
Not the giant penguin?

03:41.320 --> 03:44.480
That was the first thing I put in here, actually.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.320
Got to.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.480
Coming up on this week's episode,

03:46.480 --> 03:48.040
we got a really special episode,

03:48.040 --> 03:50.440
because not only is Anthony here,

03:50.440 --> 03:54.160
but we're joined by an outstanding cast of characters

03:54.160 --> 03:55.040
in that Mumble Room.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.200
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.040
Hey, everyone.

03:58.040 --> 03:58.880
Good evening.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.480
Hello, hello, virtual lug.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.320
Yeah, in the room today, we got Bashful, Brent,

04:04.320 --> 04:09.040
Cheese Bacon, Daniel Foray, Popey, and Wimpy,

04:09.040 --> 04:12.680
all joining us to gather around the community news,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.200
to curvuts about our home folders,

04:15.200 --> 04:18.960
and to talk about potentially a realistic,

04:18.960 --> 04:22.520
a real possible video editor for Linux.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.360
We'll see.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.760
We'll give you two different picks that we like right now.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.320
You can walk away with at least one of them that will work.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.440
But before we get to any of that,

04:30.440 --> 04:33.720
let's kick off the community news with a bit of an update

04:33.720 --> 04:36.240
for you Firefox users, which I know is a lot of you

04:36.240 --> 04:37.000
out there.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.280
Firefox 67 is going to take a new step

04:40.280 --> 04:42.440
to help improve memory usage.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.920
This has been something that you could do via an extension

04:44.920 --> 04:46.280
for a long time now.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.800
But Mozilla plans to introduce a new feature in Firefox 67

04:49.800 --> 04:52.800
that will aim to improve the browser's memory usage

04:52.800 --> 04:56.320
by essentially offloading tabs you don't use very often.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.240
It's a pretty good idea.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.600
Yeah, I think so.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.080
Interestingly, the bug's been around for eight years,

05:01.080 --> 05:02.880
and work kind of just started.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.120
But as someone who does use those extensions

05:05.120 --> 05:08.120
on another browser I won't name sometimes,

05:08.120 --> 05:10.720
this seems like a great thing to have by default.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.280
Now, right now, it's basically going to occur in low memory

05:13.280 --> 05:15.720
situations, and they've got a simple priority list

05:15.720 --> 05:17.800
to determine what actually gets unloaded.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.200
So first it's regular tabs, then pin tabs,

05:20.200 --> 05:21.560
then regular tabs that play audio,

05:21.560 --> 05:23.000
and pin tabs that play audio, which

05:23.000 --> 05:25.400
seems reasonable to me that'll probably

05:25.400 --> 05:27.560
unload the things that you're not actually using.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
Yeah, yeah, I could see the ones playing audio

05:29.560 --> 05:31.520
would probably be, if you're letting them play,

05:31.520 --> 05:34.560
you're probably using that tab, something like a YouTube video

05:34.560 --> 05:36.440
or something playing in the background.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.000
It is available right now in Nightly.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.640
Why are we not letting the kernel do the right thing?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.280
Because it already knows which pages of memory

05:43.280 --> 05:44.640
you're using and which you're not,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.560
and throws out the things you're not using.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.880
Why are we re-implementing this at the application layer

05:48.880 --> 05:49.560
as well?

05:49.560 --> 05:51.800
Us platform compatibility.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.080
Well, there's that, I think, in part

05:54.080 --> 05:56.480
because they have to take whatever steps they can

05:56.480 --> 05:59.680
to reduce the criticism they get for the memory usage.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.240
They can't just wait around for the operating system to kill,

06:02.240 --> 06:04.200
because people will look at their process list

06:04.200 --> 06:07.480
and go, three gigabytes, what the heck is going on?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.080
So they're not resolving the issue

06:09.080 --> 06:12.040
by reducing the amount of RAM they're using.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.600
They're throwing stuff out that they

06:13.600 --> 06:16.480
think you might not be using, but you might actually

06:16.480 --> 06:20.160
come back and need to use later on, a bit like swapping.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.800
Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.440
Yeah, I'm not saying it's brilliant,

06:26.440 --> 06:28.360
but it does seem like it would functionally

06:28.360 --> 06:30.200
fix a bit of the problem.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.880
I do kind of like, for the Chrome plug-in I use,

06:32.880 --> 06:34.760
I kind of like, and maybe it's just an illusion

06:34.760 --> 06:36.680
and it would all work better done in a different way,

06:36.680 --> 06:38.720
but it's nice to be able to sort of pick and choose,

06:38.720 --> 06:40.600
because I can suspend stuff if I know I'm just

06:40.600 --> 06:42.040
about to launch a bunch of VMs.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.520
And I want to keep these tabs, but I don't need anything

06:44.520 --> 06:45.760
to do with them right now.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.440
And I can unsuspend the ones I want.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.400
That's a good point.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.060
Well, it'll be landing in Firefox 67

06:50.060 --> 06:52.240
either way, which is currently scheduled

06:52.240 --> 06:56.720
to be released May 14, 2009, if you are subscribed

06:56.720 --> 06:58.120
to the Stable channel.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.100
So that'll be coming soon.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.480
Why don't we talk about Chrome?

07:01.480 --> 07:02.240
Seems like only fair.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.600
We got to do equal representation.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.480
I'm more of a Chrome user.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.120
What about you, Anthony?

07:05.120 --> 07:05.800
I use Chrome.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.040
Are you?

07:06.040 --> 07:06.560
Yeah.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.040
Yeah.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.560
I've tried to switch back to Firefox.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.800
Have you ever tried to do that?

07:09.800 --> 07:12.080
I use that for my cross, my dual browser testing.

07:12.080 --> 07:12.560
Sure.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.440
I got them both installed.

07:13.440 --> 07:13.840
Yeah.

07:13.840 --> 07:14.280
Oh, yeah.

07:14.280 --> 07:14.760
Oh, yeah.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.460
It feels, I don't know why, this is completely arbitrary.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.400
It feels chunky.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.320
Yeah, I feel like Chrome scrolls smoother,

07:22.320 --> 07:24.160
and the pages load in a little smoother.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.200
So the perception is it's smoother.

07:26.200 --> 07:26.800
Yeah.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.000
I know that Firefox has made a lot of improvements.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.320
So I like to follow it.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.200
I do keep it.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.840
It's my second browser.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.840
I usually have three web browsers on a computer,

07:35.840 --> 07:36.840
and it's my second one.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.400
What's your third web browser?

07:38.400 --> 07:40.000
It depends on the system I'm on.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.800
So if I'm on, like, Epiphany or GNOME Web would be a go-to.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.320
Or if I'm on Plasma, a lot of times

07:48.320 --> 07:50.800
I actually use Opera as my third browser.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.880
If I'm on the Mac, I'll use Safari as a third browser.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.000
So it just kind of depends on the desktop I'm on.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.920
What about you?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.400
Are you a three-browser man?

07:58.400 --> 07:58.920
Yeah.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.360
I use Firefox, Brave, and Opera.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.040
OK.

08:03.040 --> 08:03.840
Brave, huh?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.280
Yeah, you know, I should work Brave in.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
Oh, my god, you should.

08:07.280 --> 08:13.560
For about three years now, Brave is my only browser on my phone.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.400
So I disable and uninstall other browsers.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.880
That's the only browser I've used for the longest time on my phone.

08:20.880 --> 08:27.480
And I use Brave on my PCs for anything personal stuff-related.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.760
So I use Firefox for work, and I use Brave for my home stuff.

08:31.760 --> 08:36.200
And Opera is my, I want to test how things are looking and working

08:36.200 --> 08:37.360
in another browser.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.720
So what is it about Brave that draws you into it?

08:40.720 --> 08:46.680
On the phone, it's because you get basically the same user experience

08:46.680 --> 08:51.320
and reliability of the Chrome browser, because Brave is based on that.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.120
But you get all of the ad stripping and privacy guarding

08:55.120 --> 08:56.320
baked into the browser.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.160
So you don't need to mess around with ad blockers.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.960
You know, you don't need to root your device

09:00.960 --> 09:03.560
and put ad blockers on at a system level.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.940
The browser takes care of it for you.

09:05.940 --> 09:10.240
And you can opt into their program of actually choosing

09:10.240 --> 09:12.960
how you monetize in at the sites that you want to monetize based

09:12.960 --> 09:16.320
on their value to you as an individual.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.320
And the same is true for the desktop, too.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.120
You know, it just mops up all of that cruft

09:23.120 --> 09:27.600
that you have that is just pervasive on every website that you visit now.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.160
OK.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.920
That's a compelling reason to try it out.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.160
I could add that as a third.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.000
I could see that.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.160
I was a fully paid up Chrome guy.

09:35.160 --> 09:40.000
And then I think you convinced me to try out Firefox some time ago.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.600
And I switched to Firefox, and that's it.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.320
I stayed on it.

09:42.320 --> 09:46.760
Once they figured out how to do container tabs properly,

09:46.760 --> 09:49.320
that's a game changer for Firefox, container tabs.

09:49.320 --> 09:49.920
Yes.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.680
Yes.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.440
That was the missing feature that I needed

09:52.440 --> 09:54.880
to be able to successfully switch back to Firefox.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.880
And I think I've been on Firefox again for just a touch over a year.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.240
So whenever that feature got introduced.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.920
Yeah, that's one of the great features.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.480
And it's the only way I'm even like halfway

10:05.480 --> 10:08.280
feeling comfortable ever going to Facebook

10:08.280 --> 10:11.160
is because I have a container for it.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.440
So I was actually queuing us up to talk about Chrome OS

10:14.440 --> 10:17.640
because there's interesting things developing over there.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.200
Two things that we picked out this week.

10:20.200 --> 10:25.120
Number one is on Chrome OS 74, they seem

10:25.120 --> 10:28.520
to be putting a lot of effort into improving the experience of running

10:28.520 --> 10:30.420
Linux apps on Chromebook.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.640
So a feature they recently added is the ability

10:32.640 --> 10:35.720
to actually run desktop Linux applications on a Chromebook.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.360
We've talked about this on and off.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.720
And with the new version, they're making it a little more

10:40.720 --> 10:42.820
like a real desktop application.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.080
You're going to get audio playback.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.800
You'll get hardware acceleration to be able to watch videos

10:47.800 --> 10:49.260
because that was a challenge before.

10:49.260 --> 10:50.420
You couldn't listen to music.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.920
You couldn't watch videos.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.680
Now, don't get your hopes up, Wes, because we're not

10:55.680 --> 10:57.240
going to be podcasting from Chromebooks.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.920
There's no support for audio in.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.680
Oh, but I'd already made plans and bought several Chromebooks.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.760
Whoops.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.400
I kind of do feel like it's starting to get time

11:06.400 --> 11:07.680
to get a Chromebook, though.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.320
So what, this is 10 years after they come out with Chromebooks?

11:11.320 --> 11:13.240
Yeah, yeah.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.480
But now they're finally running desktop Linux applications.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.960
They're going to support sound and audio.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.680
I could see that.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.200
I don't know.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.280
I could see trying it out.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.840
I was thinking about for my wife, who's writing a book right now,

11:25.840 --> 11:28.060
and she just needs a system with a keyboard.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.000
And she's actually ended up preferring

11:30.000 --> 11:31.400
writing in Google Docs.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.520
I think she's crazy.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.800
I can't stand Google Docs.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.680
But she loves it.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.280
It's definitely a class of user that

11:36.280 --> 11:39.320
would benefit from using a Chromebook with the added

11:39.320 --> 11:43.160
functionality of having a catalog of Linux software.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.320
But for me, there isn't a Chromebook

11:45.320 --> 11:49.660
that's manufactured that has got the raw processing

11:49.660 --> 11:53.740
power and storage that I need to do what I need to do.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.680
And I imagine that that's true not just for developers,

11:56.680 --> 12:00.640
but for people that are working with video or high end

12:00.640 --> 12:02.160
photography as well.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.040
Oh, for sure.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.360
Sometimes you just need a little more oomph.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.320
Does that mean that creative professionals and developers

12:08.320 --> 12:10.600
are going to become more and more marginalized

12:10.600 --> 12:12.860
by their hardware choices in the future?

12:12.860 --> 12:15.480
I think that's what's already happening on the Mac side.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.280
I think you're already seeing that reality on the Mac side.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.280
That's why MacBooks have four ports at best.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.480
And they offer them in like three sizes.

12:23.480 --> 12:28.280
And it's a total reduction of choice over there.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.560
That's something that my co-host, Michael Dominic,

12:31.560 --> 12:33.480
had to struggle with quite a bit and ended up

12:33.480 --> 12:35.520
switching the majority of his workload over to Linux

12:35.520 --> 12:37.480
because of the limited hardware choices

12:37.480 --> 12:40.360
that he needed just to be able to build software.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.640
I think it is a big problem.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.880
I don't know if you stepped into an Apple store recently,

12:43.880 --> 12:47.440
but they offer workshops in the store, right?

12:47.440 --> 12:50.480
Recently, my girlfriend went in to go do a video editing

12:50.480 --> 12:51.400
workshop.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.560
And all of their stuff is focused on iPad and iOS apps

12:55.560 --> 12:56.640
on iPad.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.360
They don't have glasses for video editing

12:59.360 --> 13:01.920
on their professional hardware in their store anymore.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.880
Wow.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.520
Crazy.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.200
I wouldn't blame them.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.560
I'm struck by how often when I'm traveling,

13:08.560 --> 13:10.800
and I see people at the airport or in an airplane that

13:10.800 --> 13:16.120
are using iPads, and the diversity of types of people

13:16.120 --> 13:18.960
from young children with these big rubber

13:18.960 --> 13:22.680
cases around their iPad to individuals

13:22.680 --> 13:25.880
that have got to be in their late 70s to early 80s

13:25.880 --> 13:29.120
that are all joining the Wi-Fi network.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.600
They're browsing the media that's available on the plane.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.680
They're all able to use this device.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.400
And I've never really experienced anything

13:37.400 --> 13:38.520
like that in my life.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.200
In fact, I remember when the iPad first started selling,

13:41.200 --> 13:42.700
one of the things that was remarkable

13:42.700 --> 13:47.320
was that Angela's parents hate technology.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.880
They have one PC that they have to have to do business stuff.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.760
And they've really taken to the iPad.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.080
They have several iPads now.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.200
And it seemed to cross a barrier for people that don't normally

13:59.200 --> 14:02.000
use technology were able to pick up the iPad.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.600
And so if I was Apple, I'd be looking at that going,

14:04.600 --> 14:05.920
that's a huge market.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.680
That is a way bigger market potential

14:07.680 --> 14:09.120
than the Mac ever was.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.360
Because the Mac fundamentally is a computer with a file system

14:13.360 --> 14:16.560
and computer problems and accessories

14:16.560 --> 14:18.040
that aren't compatible, all this stuff

14:18.040 --> 14:19.240
that you just don't really have.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.120
The accessory is either certified by Apple

14:21.120 --> 14:23.000
or it doesn't work on the iOS land.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.040
Well, I hate to say it, but if you think about it,

14:25.040 --> 14:27.840
the reduction of choice forces simplicity,

14:27.840 --> 14:31.920
which for the mass market and what they need to do,

14:31.920 --> 14:34.360
specifically now what you can do with the video editing

14:34.360 --> 14:38.720
on an iPad, it's very opinionated on how you do it.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.560
You don't have all the extra applications on there,

14:40.560 --> 14:43.600
the extra things that cause issues for the components.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.280
It's more limited, but what works just works, right?

14:46.280 --> 14:48.440
What's the major workflow they're trying to solve?

14:48.440 --> 14:49.800
And then for every other workflow,

14:49.800 --> 14:53.720
that's 10% video editors, high-level video production,

14:53.720 --> 14:56.040
high-level graphic production, so on and so forth.

14:56.040 --> 14:56.680
Right.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.820
And I think the Chromebooks are eating

14:58.820 --> 15:00.680
into another area of this market,

15:00.680 --> 15:04.480
like an area that is more like Hadia's workload right now,

15:04.480 --> 15:06.120
which her primary thing she wants

15:06.120 --> 15:10.280
is she wants a very reliable computer with a decent keyboard

15:10.280 --> 15:12.720
that gives her good access to Google Docs,

15:12.720 --> 15:14.720
that if she goes somewhere to do a presentation,

15:14.720 --> 15:16.920
she can hook up to a projector and it's going to work.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.760
And if she comes back here and picks up,

15:18.760 --> 15:22.280
she has a laptop running Plasma, Kubuntu,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.520
then she can open that up and get access to the same doc.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.780
And she can open up on her phone and read the same doc.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.120
That's what her main use case is.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.800
For her, it's kind of hard not to say, well, that's a Chromebook.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.960
Well, now she has audio in her presentation.

15:33.960 --> 15:34.460
Right.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.560
That'll work.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.120
Yeah.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.840
She could install Open Office Presenter or Libre Office

15:38.840 --> 15:41.360
Presenter or whatever and give a presentation.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.440
You know, what's interesting is, and you probably already

15:44.440 --> 15:46.280
know the answer to this, because honestly, I've

15:46.280 --> 15:48.360
never been that interested in the Chromebooks to look into it.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.960
But for what they're trying to do

15:49.960 --> 15:53.120
to get the Linux apps and components working on there,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.460
and for as bare minimum and as configurable

15:55.460 --> 15:58.500
you can make a similar lightweight desktop for that,

15:58.500 --> 15:59.920
it's interesting they decided just

15:59.920 --> 16:03.000
to go a whole route of a whole operating system.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.840
Because it's now almost like, hey, all you need is a browser.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.100
Except for that's not true.

16:07.100 --> 16:07.960
You need these other things.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.240
So we're just going to add it in there where it already exists.

16:10.240 --> 16:10.720
Isn't that fun?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.220
Yeah.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.280
I think that's about reaching the developer market.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.120
I think it's about trying to reach a more technical audience

16:17.120 --> 16:19.720
and bringing, like they've reached a certain saturation

16:19.720 --> 16:20.560
with the Chromebook.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.720
And now they want to get that market that maybe needs

16:23.720 --> 16:26.560
a text editor, wants their favorite terminal,

16:26.560 --> 16:29.400
maybe needs GIMP, and wants to be able to SSH into their box

16:29.400 --> 16:31.080
that they're working on or something like that.

16:31.080 --> 16:31.580
Right.

16:31.580 --> 16:33.840
Just enough technical tools to keep you placated.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.360
Yeah.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.780
Or maybe Android Studio.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.280
Maybe they're targeting Android developers in the future.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.720
Make an Android development workstation out of Chrome OS.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.520
That's true.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.000
I wonder if the dumbed down devices

16:43.000 --> 16:46.360
are going to maintain that hold as the generations move on.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.280
Looking at the people who've grown up with technology

16:49.280 --> 16:52.760
and whether they're going to want to be able to directly access

16:52.760 --> 16:55.800
the power versus having that dumbed down experience, which

16:55.800 --> 17:00.520
sure, maybe was great for my dad who's 70 and a bald cowboy who

17:00.520 --> 17:01.000
loves it.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.720
But what about the people that grew up with it?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.440
Wait, is your dad really a cowboy?

17:05.440 --> 17:07.160
Yeah, that's a whole other story.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.600
Yeah, I grew up in the prairies.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.920
Canada has cowboys in prairies?

17:10.920 --> 17:11.560
Oh, yeah.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.560
We got lots.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.200
Lots and lots.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.240
Tons.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.000
I thought cowboys.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.240
Whole provinces.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.200
I don't understand this.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.240
I got to learn the history of cowboys.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.020
Even in British Columbia, there is a very large cattle industry.

17:22.020 --> 17:25.240
And then you just start going east, all the way to Manitoba,

17:25.240 --> 17:26.560
all the way into Ontario.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.360
It's full cattle country.

17:28.360 --> 17:29.760
Of course.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.280
It makes total sense.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.400
Can we think seriously about the phrase dumbed down?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.800
You look how powerful the iPhone and Android devices

17:37.800 --> 17:40.000
and the iPad is.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.480
There are people now being empowered to be able to do stuff

17:43.480 --> 17:47.400
like video editing, or even just like simple photo editing,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.560
or full-on design with an Apple Pencil and iPad Pro,

17:50.560 --> 17:54.920
stuff that was absolutely not possible 10 years ago

17:54.920 --> 17:58.320
on a bog-standard PC, or even a high-end PC,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.360
or stuff that would have been very difficult and out

18:00.360 --> 18:02.440
of the price range of mere mortals.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.080
I think dumbing down is the wrong phrase,

18:05.080 --> 18:11.080
because just because we think that we had the capability

18:11.080 --> 18:13.240
to do those things a few years ago,

18:13.240 --> 18:17.480
there's a much wider and diverse range of the population who

18:17.480 --> 18:19.920
are enabled with these devices and are

18:19.920 --> 18:22.320
able to do stuff that they would never have dreamed

18:22.320 --> 18:23.840
doing before with a thing that they

18:23.840 --> 18:25.680
can carry around in their pocket or a thing

18:25.680 --> 18:27.080
they can put in their purse.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.000
That's a good point.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.480
I guess after having said dumbed down and hearing that context,

18:31.480 --> 18:33.440
I actually agree with you.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.560
Yeah, I can agree completely too in the photography space,

18:36.560 --> 18:40.400
because I've seen huge, massive swaths of populations

18:40.400 --> 18:42.600
getting amazing cameras in their pockets.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.200
And my initial reaction many, many years ago

18:45.200 --> 18:47.600
was like, oh, as a photographer, all these people

18:47.600 --> 18:51.880
are taking photos that feel substandard to what

18:51.880 --> 18:52.440
I'm creating.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.140
But now these days, that perspective

18:54.140 --> 18:55.120
has completely changed.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.920
And I think enabling anyone to be creative in any way,

18:58.920 --> 19:02.520
whether it be photography, or design, or even some audio

19:02.520 --> 19:05.720
stuff, it feels like everybody can

19:05.720 --> 19:09.680
get a voice for much less buy-in to this technology.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.120
It's really a huge success for the population.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.160
It feels like a reset.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.280
We've gone along an uphill, a bit like Moore's law.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.160
It's going up, and up, and up, and up, and up.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.680
And then we've kind of gone jump down a tiny bit in power.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.000
These devices are very powerful, but they're not i9.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.120
And we've kind of gone down.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.960
But we've gone up in usability and up

19:33.960 --> 19:38.120
with the creative capability of these devices

19:38.120 --> 19:40.440
and the empowerment that these things give you,

19:40.440 --> 19:43.280
even if we haven't gone full on with power.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.160
But that will come.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.320
I think every year a new Apple chip comes out,

19:48.320 --> 19:50.400
a new Qualcomm chip comes out that's

19:50.400 --> 19:52.760
more powerful than everything that's ever been before it.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.240
I think we've just had a bit of a reset for a short period,

19:55.240 --> 19:56.480
and it will climb again.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.000
Maybe.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.080
I hate to compare computers to cars.

20:00.080 --> 20:03.320
But if you look at cars and you consider

20:03.320 --> 20:05.920
how much has changed in the last 50 years

20:05.920 --> 20:07.520
on what's accessible under the hood,

20:07.520 --> 20:10.800
or how complicated they are, or how productized they are,

20:10.800 --> 20:13.800
you could see technology going that general trend, where

20:13.800 --> 20:17.120
the hood is a little more welded shut, as the old saying goes.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.680
But the consumer isn't disadvantaged to say.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.640
They're disadvantaged in terms of getting access

20:23.640 --> 20:25.480
to those components, but they're enabled

20:25.480 --> 20:28.480
by the plentiful accessibility to the technology,

20:28.480 --> 20:32.440
the reduction in cost, the market options.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.640
Like there's other things that improve when

20:35.640 --> 20:37.520
other things are taken away.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.880
And I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.440
But I, having, and I've made this point on the show before,

20:41.440 --> 20:46.520
but having worked in education, then taking 10 years off,

20:46.520 --> 20:51.960
and then going back, there was a huge, huge gap in the interest

20:51.960 --> 20:53.160
the students had.

20:53.160 --> 20:58.640
We could fill three labs of students, 30 students each

20:58.640 --> 21:03.160
in each lab, the first time I was in the education system.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.840
When I came back, it was a team of five students.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.720
So can I jump on this car analogy real quick?

21:09.720 --> 21:11.140
I don't know if this makes sense.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.140
It makes sense in my head, so follow with me here.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.280
So it's a new baseline.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.240
So I can talk to this, to the videos.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.240
We'll start with the car.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.640
If you think about it, 30 years ago,

21:20.640 --> 21:24.200
even when I was growing up, 18, 19 years ago as a teenager,

21:24.200 --> 21:26.000
it used to be the coolest thing ever

21:26.000 --> 21:28.120
to be able to change an oil or change a headlight, right?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.160
Something you would want to know.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.400
You'd get in there like, hey, I can change my oil.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.560
Nowadays, you've got to take off the first part of the car

21:33.560 --> 21:34.600
to be able to change oil.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.740
But instead of having teenagers or whoever

21:37.740 --> 21:40.280
is interested in cars, like, hey, I can change my oil,

21:40.280 --> 21:43.520
they're now modding their cars from a higher standpoint

21:43.520 --> 21:46.040
with this new technology implementation, right?

21:46.040 --> 21:47.400
And I haven't dove much into it.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.780
I've just seen some stories on it.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.800
Same thing for video.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.560
15 years ago, to see some of the basic iPhone editing stuff,

21:55.560 --> 21:59.760
that was professional level, $10,000 to have made,

21:59.760 --> 22:00.760
needed giant computers.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.480
But the baseline of knowledge, the baseline of capability

22:03.480 --> 22:06.480
for the upcoming generation starts off

22:06.480 --> 22:10.400
with what used to seem impossible for us to achieve.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.860
Now that just means, what's that next impossible step that

22:13.860 --> 22:16.080
seems impossible to them that we can't even imagine?

22:16.080 --> 22:16.840
Yeah, you're right.

22:16.840 --> 22:21.200
To Popi's point, it's more people I have access to.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.920
My daughter has an iPad with a 1080p stabilized camera in it.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.080
She has an HD camera in her tablet.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.880
I would have loved to have something like that

22:30.880 --> 22:32.160
when I was six years old.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.440
I always wanted to have one of those game gears that

22:34.440 --> 22:35.640
plugged in the TV antenna.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.500
Yeah, that would be great.

22:37.500 --> 22:41.360
I remember my first car, I had to do some maintenance on it.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.740
And I stripped the engine down and regrounded the valves.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.200
And I put a new drive shaft on it.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.720
I did loads of work on that car.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.480
These days, there's no way I'm going to do that.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.640
I'll throw it at a man and give him a small bag of money

22:53.640 --> 22:54.960
and hope he fixes it for me.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.260
But there are people out there who still want to do that.

22:57.260 --> 23:00.240
I think that's the key, is there are still

23:00.240 --> 23:02.920
people out there on Linux, for example, who still

23:02.920 --> 23:06.640
like editing their Xorg.conf, whereas the vast majority

23:06.640 --> 23:08.600
of people don't care about that kind of thing

23:08.600 --> 23:09.660
and don't really want to do that.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.080
They just want the thing to work.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.800
And I think the iPad and these generations of devices

23:14.800 --> 23:18.360
service a very large proportion of the population who

23:18.360 --> 23:20.800
don't want to put their hands under the bonnet of a car

23:20.800 --> 23:22.760
and don't want to edit an Xorg.conf.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.400
They want to edit a video.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.920
And this services that need perfectly.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.080
We can have both, right?

23:29.080 --> 23:31.040
Yeah, we live in a world where you can have iPads

23:31.040 --> 23:33.120
and you can go get a Raspberry Pi to play around with.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.440
But do you think that Linux can offer both?

23:35.440 --> 23:39.080
I remember Linux, maybe even 10 years ago,

23:39.080 --> 23:41.460
was a lot more tinkery than it is now.

23:41.460 --> 23:44.280
It seems to be getting far more user friendly.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.880
So do you think that we can get there and offer both for anybody

23:46.880 --> 23:47.880
in the same package?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.880
I feel like that's kind of a fair criticism.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.280
I think that is true to a degree.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.000
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.560
But I actually have a story in here

23:57.560 --> 24:01.340
about the systemd free Debian derivative, dev1.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.800
They're planning a get together this spring.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.720
There's going to be a dev1 conference.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.000
They call it the, I think they call it the init system

24:09.000 --> 24:12.040
independence conference or something like that.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.880
So there are still circles with Slack out there, Brent.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.340
I mean, there's still those circles

24:17.340 --> 24:19.040
that are fully empowered.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.840
When they first started, we laughed at them and said,

24:21.840 --> 24:22.760
they're ridiculous.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.880
But this is what happens.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.440
People laughed at the Marte developers

24:25.440 --> 24:27.340
when Marte was first created.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.840
And they pointed out, oh, they're just doing a global search

24:29.840 --> 24:31.440
or a place on the GNOME 2 code base.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.120
But if you get enough enthusiasts who

24:33.120 --> 24:37.240
are like-minded and feel passionately about the thing

24:37.240 --> 24:38.760
that they're making, then you're going

24:38.760 --> 24:42.200
to get conferences arranged around that project.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.320
It's inevitable.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.240
And it's bad on us for laughing and pointing the finger

24:48.240 --> 24:51.640
at these people who don't want systemd on their distros.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.280
Fair enough, they've got the choice.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.560
And we've given them the tools to make it possible.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.120
They're just making use of it.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.540
I think something to keep in mind

24:58.540 --> 25:01.020
is the nature of operating systems and computers

25:01.020 --> 25:03.520
and technologies are changing so much,

25:03.520 --> 25:06.680
sticking with the car analogy, moving to electric vehicles

25:06.680 --> 25:10.360
where the vehicles do not have oil to change anymore.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.520
But the common thread that we really

25:12.520 --> 25:15.300
need to care about is things like telemetry

25:15.300 --> 25:18.480
and these connected devices and our privacy.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.920
And I think those are things that we

25:19.920 --> 25:22.120
need to focus on more so than what

25:22.120 --> 25:25.040
are the technical underpinnings that make the thing run.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.720
Yes, that's a fair point.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.480
I think that is something that we, as a community,

25:29.480 --> 25:31.240
are particularly good at.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.000
And we are always kind of asking those questions

25:34.000 --> 25:35.780
and kind of watching that kind of stuff.

25:35.780 --> 25:38.440
It is kind of hard, though, because there's so much of it

25:38.440 --> 25:38.920
now.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.280
It's just a full spectrum.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.680
And maybe I'm just feeling that way

25:41.680 --> 25:43.780
because we just got out of Mobile World Congress,

25:43.780 --> 25:45.960
but holy smokes.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.320
So let's shift gears for a moment

25:47.320 --> 25:50.000
and let's talk about some good old traditional desktop stuff.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.440
Gnome 3.32 is just a few weeks away.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.560
And the biggest feature we've been waiting for for quite

25:58.560 --> 26:01.400
a while has landed just recently.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.960
Fractional scaling just squeezed in

26:04.960 --> 26:06.640
before the big freeze.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.560
Oh, that's right.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.080
It's in the Git branches now, nearly three years

26:11.080 --> 26:12.760
after the bug was first opened.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.600
And of course, if you're not paying attention

26:14.600 --> 26:16.160
or you don't have a high DPI screen,

26:16.160 --> 26:18.160
maybe you don't know what fractional scaling is.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.660
But I mean, it's really exactly what

26:19.660 --> 26:22.120
it sounds like, having the scaling that is a fraction,

26:22.120 --> 26:24.240
not just two, three, one, whatever.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.960
So you can get just the right scaling for whatever size

26:26.960 --> 26:28.040
display you might have.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.600
It's nice to see it.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.680
And it was looking like Gnome 3.32, 3.32, as I should say,

26:33.680 --> 26:37.120
would be another cycle without it, which would be

26:37.120 --> 26:38.720
another lap for elementary OS.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.880
But it looks like it snuck in.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.160
Yeah, it's just nice to see constant improvements, right?

26:43.160 --> 26:47.320
This is Gnome 3.32, is that what you said?

26:47.320 --> 26:48.000
Yes.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.720
So there have been as many Gnome 3 releases now

26:52.720 --> 26:55.560
as there were of Gnome 2 releases.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.160
Wow.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.120
Soak that in for a moment.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.880
Wow, it feels like it's been a long haul to get here.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.800
It really does feel like it's been a long haul.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
OK, I just have one more community news story.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.360
So let's cover this one pretty quickly.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.240
Because I think this is, from a big picture,

27:10.240 --> 27:12.200
pretty important for Canonical.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.880
I think Canonical has a good advantage

27:13.880 --> 27:15.740
when it comes to Kubernetes deployments.

27:15.740 --> 27:18.040
And they have an announcement this week.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.760
That they do.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.400
Canonical today announced support for Container D

27:22.400 --> 27:25.520
in the 1.14 release of the charmed Kubernetes

27:25.520 --> 27:28.040
and their MicroK8s distributions,

27:28.040 --> 27:30.360
which we talked about previously on Unplugged.

27:30.360 --> 27:36.000
And Container D seems like it gets more and more momentum.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.080
Wes, remind me again why Container D is the hotness.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.040
I mean, really, it's just some simplification

27:41.040 --> 27:44.560
to the whole craze that is the container runtime stack.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.600
Before, you had stuff like, I mean, really, it all

27:46.600 --> 27:49.260
started off with Docker, at least in the public's mind

27:49.260 --> 27:50.240
recently, right?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.160
And Docker did everything.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.520
Container D spun off to have a nice, simple, separate daemon

27:55.520 --> 27:57.480
that could just do all the container stuff, right?

27:57.480 --> 27:59.680
Handle all the container lifecycle events

27:59.680 --> 28:01.960
that you need, push and pull images.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.280
Now, Docker, you can still use Docker if you know that

28:04.280 --> 28:04.920
workflow.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.920
But under the hood, it can just talk to Container D.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.360
So it's just kind of simplification

28:08.360 --> 28:10.320
and standardization within the industry, really.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.160
Yeah, some much needed simplification, you might say.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.320
That's good to know.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.800
All right, well, then, before we move in to the meat

28:16.800 --> 28:21.340
of the show, let's do a bit of housekeeping, a few items

28:21.340 --> 28:21.880
to cover.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.200
Next weekend is scale.

28:24.200 --> 28:24.960
Come say hi to Wes.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.760
Poppy and I, we're going to be at scale.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.360
Very excited about that.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.000
We have dinner planned.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.040
You can get details for that at meetup.com

28:33.040 --> 28:37.560
slash Jupiter Broadcasting, Saturday, March 9 at PF Chang's.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.160
We'll be there stuffing our faces

28:39.160 --> 28:40.880
and would love to hang out with you.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.240
Looks like we have about 20 people signed up so far.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.600
So if you're thinking about going,

28:44.600 --> 28:46.880
go sign up so that way we can let PF Chang's know

28:46.880 --> 28:47.920
what to expect.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.720
Then when you're over at the meetup page,

28:49.720 --> 28:52.680
check out the study groups we have coming up.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.040
Today after the show, we're doing a study group

28:55.040 --> 28:58.160
with Kenny on the fundamentals of Linux,

28:58.160 --> 28:59.560
some really cool stuff on there.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.640
We recently did a YAML study group.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.840
We have virtual Linux Ansible fundamentals coming up,

29:04.840 --> 29:07.480
as well as Kubernetes fundamentals

29:07.480 --> 29:08.400
just around the corner.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.560
We're doing a second study group in March.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.240
All of those details up at meetup.com slash Jupiter

29:14.240 --> 29:16.320
Broadcasting, including that second one

29:16.320 --> 29:18.200
is going to be before the unplugged program.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.960
So if the timing hasn't been working out for you,

29:20.960 --> 29:21.960
this one might.

29:21.960 --> 29:27.120
And then a plug for the seventh birthday of Linux Academy.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.400
Congratulations.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.360
That's huge.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.400
It's a big day.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.600
Does it feel like it's been 20 years,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.880
or does it feel like it's been three?

29:32.880 --> 29:36.000
Approximately 15 is what it feels like.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.960
Not as bad.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.040
So how do we go from, OK, I'm just curious, short version,

29:40.040 --> 29:41.800
how do we go from, hey, it's our birthday,

29:41.800 --> 29:43.440
to let's burn Chris's mouth off?

29:43.440 --> 29:46.600
How did that, how to go from, hey, we've got a birthday,

29:46.600 --> 29:48.320
to let's make Chris feel all the pain?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.640
I'm happy to say that I had nothing to do with that.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.520
Oh, really?

29:51.520 --> 29:53.040
Outside of, of course, hosting it.

29:53.040 --> 29:53.520
Yeah.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.840
But that was not my idea.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.480
Yeah, OK.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.400
Well, there is a video coming up soon.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.000
We did a chili challenge where Anthony asked us

30:01.000 --> 30:02.480
trivia questions about the company.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.520
And of course, because I'm the new guy,

30:04.520 --> 30:05.840
there was small shot.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.680
I had a small shot.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.680
Well, you did know how many podcasts are offered.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.600
Yeah, I got that one right.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.120
Yeah, that was a good one.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.920
And my mouth burned off.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.500
And that video will be out soon.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.120
Check out the Linux Academy com Twitter account

30:17.120 --> 30:18.640
for when that gets posted.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.960
And we have a whole bunch of live events coming up in April,

30:21.960 --> 30:22.760
too.

30:22.760 --> 30:26.240
So linuxacademy.com slash live, if you're

30:26.240 --> 30:28.600
listening after the factor, you can remember that one.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, though.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.880
That's where all the good stuff's going on for scale.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.200
I'm very, very excited about that.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.240
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.680
Mostly just because Popeye's going to be there.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.200
Since Popeye's going to be there, it's solid now.

30:40.200 --> 30:40.880
Oh, yes.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.000
I've just signed up for the meetup.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.720
I didn't realize.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.080
I thought I'd already done it, but I've actually

30:44.080 --> 30:46.040
signed up for the Linux Fest Northwest one.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.120
So I'm now going to two JBE meetups.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.400
Great.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.040
Super fan.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.000
Yep, that's right.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.480
The Linux Fest Northwest one is on there as well.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.480
All right, so we also have another meetup

30:58.480 --> 31:01.120
we should probably mention, speaking of Popeye.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.280
Popeye and Wimpy are getting together

31:03.280 --> 31:05.520
with their audience for the Ubuntu podcast

31:05.520 --> 31:08.640
on March 16th, gettogether.com.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.280
Or is it gettogether.community?

31:10.280 --> 31:12.720
For that, I'll have a link in the show notes.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.720
The Brew Dog, March 16th, 3 PM.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.320
We've not had one of these before.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.880
We did a tweet out at the end of last year

31:20.880 --> 31:23.960
when we finished our last season and asked everyone, hey,

31:23.960 --> 31:25.440
what kind of meetup would you like?

31:25.440 --> 31:29.040
Would you like to have hacking session on laptops?

31:29.040 --> 31:30.960
Would you like presentations?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.280
Or should we go to a pub?

31:32.280 --> 31:35.000
And overwhelmingly, everyone said, let's go to the pub.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.440
So yes, we're doing that.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
No way.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.240
Surprise, surprise.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.520
Yes, I know.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.880
Yeah, who would have thought it?

31:40.880 --> 31:43.080
English people voted to go to the pub.

31:43.080 --> 31:43.960
Shocker.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.920
My meetup advice is make sure the payment

31:46.920 --> 31:48.400
stuff is clear up front.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.480
Whatever it might be, make sure it is clear up front, right?

31:51.480 --> 31:54.200
I'm editing it right now.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.440
Don't tell anybody this.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.840
Don't release this on the internet.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.520
But I was somewhere once where I think

31:58.520 --> 32:00.440
I watched Anthony get suckered into picking up

32:00.440 --> 32:02.920
like a $2,100 meetup tab.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.040
Yeah, Texas Linux Fest.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.520
Yes.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.320
And it was my bad because I brought the crowd.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.760
It was, we're going to go out to lunch.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.320
And it was like, oh, let's go out and do something.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.700
And there was quite a crowd that followed us.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.960
Plus, we had some of the staff, and it was just.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.080
I just love doing that, though.

32:16.080 --> 32:16.960
You know what I mean?

32:16.960 --> 32:19.880
It's a give back to the community.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.880
And plus, there's nothing better than hanging out

32:21.880 --> 32:23.840
and just talking Linux and stuff with people.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.720
All right, well, let's talk a little Linux.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.080
Wes brought a soapbox into the studio about two weeks ago.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.760
Just trying to keep it clean, you know.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.320
Yeah, I mean, I'm usually the one that brings these.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.600
Usually, it's about online journalism

32:36.600 --> 32:39.060
and how it impacts open source communities.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.360
That's usually my favorite one.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.400
And it's even got a few trademarks on it now.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.260
But Wes really brought this shiner in.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.720
It's one that's been in my soapbox closet

32:46.720 --> 32:48.400
for so long, and I'd never even thought

32:48.400 --> 32:50.200
about talking on the show.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.040
I thought maybe I was a crazy person.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.800
But have you ever noticed how many damn hidden files

32:56.800 --> 32:58.080
are in your home directory?

32:58.080 --> 33:00.520
You do a good old-fashioned ls, it's not so bad.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.760
Maybe you got a few inner case folders, things like that.

33:04.760 --> 33:10.440
But you do an old ls-a, and all the hidden files are revealed.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.800
It's a mess of it.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.140
I encourage the listener, if you are in front of a computer

33:14.140 --> 33:19.080
right now, do an old ls-a on your home directory.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.080
It is extremely overrun with directories

33:22.080 --> 33:24.800
that applications have crapped all over your home folder,

33:24.800 --> 33:27.680
not following any particular standard,

33:27.680 --> 33:29.680
making a mess out of things.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.200
And I've just always thought it was just me

33:32.200 --> 33:35.120
being a little precious, thinking

33:35.120 --> 33:38.080
that it was my special computer, how dare they mess it up.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.800
But I've seen a few articles.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.920
And then when Wes walked in the door with this soapbox,

33:42.920 --> 33:44.080
I knew I wasn't alone.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.440
Let's see, I'm looking right now.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.680
I have 42 directories, starting with a dot in front of them,

33:48.680 --> 33:49.600
just littered around.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.440
And then 27 files, totally separate from that.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.360
You're an amateur.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.720
Oh, really?

33:55.720 --> 33:57.360
Oh, yeah, let's bring it, guys.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.440
I've got 42 directories, like normal directories

33:59.440 --> 34:01.760
in my home directory, and 117 hidden.

34:01.760 --> 34:02.920
So yeah.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.840
117?

34:04.840 --> 34:06.080
What are you doing over there?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.800
You're installing a bunch of software, aren't you?

34:07.800 --> 34:08.560
This is the whole point.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.160
They're hidden.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.160
I don't care.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.200
I don't see them.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.920
Like, why should I care?

34:12.920 --> 34:13.720
But they're there.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.080
Because they're there.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.400
That's like saying you shouldn't wash your hands.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.360
So bed bugs, but I don't care.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.000
They're hidden.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.280
If I can't see them, they're not there.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.780
That's good enough for me.

34:22.780 --> 34:26.040
I'm surprised to hear this from a man of hygiene as yourself.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
I agree.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.360
Like, just get over yourself.

34:29.360 --> 34:33.360
It's unfortunate that there are specifications

34:33.360 --> 34:36.640
that you should be adhering to, to actually take care of where

34:36.640 --> 34:37.960
these dot files get placed.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.000
But the world isn't perfect.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.440
And therefore, there is dot file proliferation.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.680
But just, you can't, outside, out of mind, just get over it.

34:46.680 --> 34:49.000
So you're saying there's no validity to the fact

34:49.000 --> 34:53.840
that there is an XDG desktop standard that says clearly

34:53.840 --> 34:57.120
that developers should put their configurations in the.config

34:57.120 --> 35:00.240
folder and go to town in there to keep the user's home

35:00.240 --> 35:01.000
directory clean.

35:01.000 --> 35:01.500
Right.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.240
And even the XDG specification doesn't say put it in.config.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.920
It says use this environment variable declared

35:07.920 --> 35:10.920
by your operating system that will put your.files

35:10.920 --> 35:13.660
in the right place as prescribed by that OS.

35:13.660 --> 35:17.080
So it's not even like randomly make it in.config.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.280
Because on other platforms, that may not

35:19.280 --> 35:21.080
be the right place to put it.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.920
That aside, does it matter?

35:23.920 --> 35:28.080
I think what it is is it's a result of the Unix and Linux

35:28.080 --> 35:30.000
permissions model, where the developers have

35:30.000 --> 35:33.360
no other guaranteed place to safely write something

35:33.360 --> 35:35.240
that the user will have access to that won't

35:35.240 --> 35:36.860
get destroyed on a reboot.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.680
And so out of a lack of a better design,

35:40.680 --> 35:42.760
they've had to just crap these files everywhere.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.240
I think it's a bit of a shame.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.920
I can think of two more reasons why.

35:45.920 --> 35:50.000
Like one, that the application, let's look at Vim, for example,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.440
predates the Free Desktop spec.

35:51.440 --> 35:51.960
Sure.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.160
So they can say, we're grandfathered in.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.000
Screw you guys.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.480
So Vim is in.vim in my home directory.

35:58.480 --> 36:02.380
But what about developers who put stuff in the home directory

36:02.380 --> 36:06.360
because that just looks like the right place to put it.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.360
And they didn't know about the Free Desktop spec.

36:08.360 --> 36:13.640
Maybe the Free Desktop spec isn't as well-publicized.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.720
Maybe it's because we don't have rock-solid APIs like Apple

36:17.720 --> 36:21.080
do, that people just go free-for-all, oh, that'll do,

36:21.080 --> 36:22.880
and dump it in your home directory.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.560
I'm looking at you, Thunderbird, that's in my home directory.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.280
Yes, it's another one.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.240
Yeah.

36:29.240 --> 36:32.160
Thunderbird doesn't even ship a.desktop file, does it?

36:32.160 --> 36:34.600
Or at least Firefox still doesn't.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.100
Really?

36:35.100 --> 36:35.600
Yeah, they do.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.080
Yeah, they do.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.240
Did they start adding one?

36:38.240 --> 36:40.560
Because I remember it had to be patched in in the Ubuntu

36:40.560 --> 36:41.320
Archive.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.640
Yes, you're right.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.480
Yeah, it was vendor-patched, wasn't it?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.600
Wasn't this because of the branding debacle?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.680
And now that's all gone away.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.080
That does ring a bell.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.040
That does ring a bell.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.640
I'm pretty sure they don't carry a.desktop upstream.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.480
Dan, you must agree with me.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.560
This is a mess, right?

36:56.560 --> 36:57.600
This is a mess.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.480
This should be tidy.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.840
There should be a platform solution to it.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.240
And it should be all in one nice, clean spot

37:04.240 --> 37:06.000
that is easy for the user to back up,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.560
that doesn't make a mess of the root of the home directory.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.480
Please tell me, Dan.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.480
You're on my side.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.480
Yeah, I kind of feel like the reason

37:13.480 --> 37:16.860
that we need developers to care about this stuff

37:16.860 --> 37:19.280
is so that we can provide platform features.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.360
But if you're not actually providing those features,

37:21.360 --> 37:23.720
there's no real incentive for them to follow the spec.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.360
So I don't know.

37:24.360 --> 37:29.340
Maybe containers will save us and will force developers

37:29.340 --> 37:30.640
to do things more cleanly.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.440
I have no idea.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.940
No, the container file system will just be a horrible mess.

37:33.940 --> 37:37.680
It'll just be inside the container.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.400
Dang.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.200
All right.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.720
Wes, I tried.

37:40.720 --> 37:45.160
I tried to represent the soapbox for you as best I could.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.280
I'm sorry I failed you.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.600
No, I mean, I think ultimately, it doesn't really matter.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.560
It's just one of those small inconveniences.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.160
And really, I only notice it when

37:52.160 --> 37:53.760
I'm trying to teach new users.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.300
And it's pretty far down on the list.

37:55.300 --> 37:57.600
You know, I kind of just incidentally manage it.

37:57.600 --> 38:01.080
And really, if you manage your backups or system at all,

38:01.080 --> 38:03.000
you've found the few files that you might actually

38:03.000 --> 38:04.480
need to care about already.

38:04.480 --> 38:09.440
OK, now, I stood definitely on the I don't care bus

38:09.440 --> 38:10.860
as I was traveling down the road.

38:10.860 --> 38:12.720
But ding, ding, I want to get off.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.600
I'm now looking at the things that are in my home directory.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.360
And it is now starting to piss me off.

38:17.360 --> 38:17.860
Amazing.

38:17.860 --> 38:18.360
I love it.

38:18.360 --> 38:18.860
I love it.

38:18.860 --> 38:19.360
I love it.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.360
I love it.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.880
Whatever.

38:21.880 --> 38:26.280
I can see a dot mumble overlay pipe, a dot mumble socket,

38:26.280 --> 38:29.800
dot pulse dash cookie, dot selected underscore editor.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.240
What the hell are these things doing in my home directory?

38:32.240 --> 38:33.400
They're messing it up.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.440
They're messing it up.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.720
Disrespecting your home folder is the one spot

38:37.720 --> 38:39.960
on the system that's truly yours.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.800
And I go to great lengths to organize my home folder.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.520
It's just very disappointing.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.160
Are there any tools to clean this stuff up?

38:48.160 --> 38:49.480
I found a good one.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.840
Dot Lightworks, dot there can be only one.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.440
It's a zero byte file as well.

38:56.440 --> 38:58.280
Wimby, don't you have a dot file manager

38:58.280 --> 38:59.400
that backs these things up?

38:59.400 --> 39:01.180
And does it clean these things up too?

39:01.180 --> 39:04.240
Well, potentially it cleans them up

39:04.240 --> 39:10.120
if you reinstall your system and then you restore your dot file.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.240
So yes, I use a bit of software called Yadim,

39:13.240 --> 39:15.440
which is yet another dot files manager.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.760
You can find that at yadim.io.

39:18.760 --> 39:22.560
And it's basically a wrapper around git

39:22.560 --> 39:26.360
with a means of expressing these are the dot files or dot

39:26.360 --> 39:30.700
directories that I want to put under version control.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.800
And as you move between machines,

39:32.800 --> 39:37.160
you can check out and check in your configuration files

39:37.160 --> 39:41.240
so that your carefully curated configurations

39:41.240 --> 39:42.800
follow you everywhere.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.840
That makes it worse.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.560
Surely you're like spreading the virus far and wide

39:46.560 --> 39:47.840
to every machine.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.880
Well, these dot files are going to exist

39:49.880 --> 39:51.080
whether you like it or not.

39:51.080 --> 39:56.600
Dot git config, dot SSH, dot bash RC, the list goes on.

39:56.600 --> 40:01.840
So I may as well have my versions of those files.

40:01.840 --> 40:04.920
I don't get to choose where they get placed,

40:04.920 --> 40:07.880
but I can choose what gets placed inside them.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.040
So that's why I use a dot file manager.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.440
And I use it for more than just the dot files.

40:12.440 --> 40:15.640
Now I actually have, there are common directories

40:15.640 --> 40:20.080
you see in your home folder, downloads, music, videos.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.240
I have a couple of my own, my favorite

40:22.240 --> 40:24.760
being Cruft and another one called Development,

40:24.760 --> 40:26.160
for example.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.720
And those are in Yadim.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.720
So when I go to a new system I've just installed,

40:30.720 --> 40:33.240
I pull down my Yadim config, and it stands up

40:33.240 --> 40:35.280
all of my common directories.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.120
And even a folder called scripts,

40:37.120 --> 40:40.680
which is my tool belt of common stuff, is in there.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.160
So it makes the folders, too.

40:42.160 --> 40:42.680
Oh, yeah.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.880
Yeah, I've got a whole heap of stuff in there,

40:45.880 --> 40:47.320
all of my useful scripts.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.280
So I never have to worry, oh, where's

40:49.280 --> 40:52.520
that file that magically does this thing?

40:52.520 --> 40:54.680
Every computer, it's all the same.

40:54.680 --> 40:55.280
It's very fast.

40:55.280 --> 41:02.400
In fact, I had a disk fail earlier today about lunchtime.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.200
That is no biggie.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.280
I mean, I've got good backups.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.820
And because I've got these dot file things,

41:05.820 --> 41:06.880
I'm now up and running.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.800
So not going to name names, Popey, looking at you.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.000
But I was able to log into Mumble

41:12.000 --> 41:14.080
and move into the on-air channel because all

41:14.080 --> 41:16.280
of my Mumble certificates and everything

41:16.280 --> 41:17.740
are all in my dot file manager.

41:17.740 --> 41:21.600
And I was just back up and running within 20 minutes.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.440
Yet another dot file manager?

41:23.440 --> 41:24.600
Yeah, that one's pretty good.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.960
Follow Martin, too, except I did mine with Ansible scripts.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.960
And all of my configuration, software installations,

41:30.960 --> 41:34.360
and everything are done by a Git check-in.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.480
And then the script self-installs

41:36.480 --> 41:38.920
a cron job that uses Ansible pull

41:38.920 --> 41:41.440
to suck the configuration down to each machine that's

41:41.440 --> 41:42.280
configured.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.120
Very good.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.360
I don't think we're ever going to pick this stuff

41:45.360 --> 41:49.600
and make it sane until we have a free desktop cloud storage

41:49.600 --> 41:52.240
portal and a cloud settings portal

41:52.240 --> 41:55.200
so that users are complaining like, hey, GIMP

41:55.200 --> 41:58.120
didn't sync my settings to my next cloud.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.840
Use the things portal, and then it'll

41:59.840 --> 42:02.200
stop littering everywhere.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.560
That'd be a nice service that somebody could offer, really.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.360
That'd be good.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.600
That'd be really good.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.480
I like having a junk folder in my home directory.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.080
I like having a build folder in my home directory and a bin

42:14.080 --> 42:15.040
folder.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.720
So if I download something that is just

42:16.720 --> 42:18.520
like something to execute directly,

42:18.520 --> 42:20.060
I always move it to the bin folder.

42:20.060 --> 42:21.560
Or if it's something I have to build,

42:21.560 --> 42:24.320
I usually will do the git checkout in the build folder,

42:24.320 --> 42:27.080
build it there, and then move it to the bin directory.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.000
And then I'll create a.desktop file for it

42:29.000 --> 42:31.200
and actually integrate it into the Plasma launcher

42:31.200 --> 42:32.200
or something like that.

42:32.200 --> 42:35.720
I have a source folder that I use for downloading stuff

42:35.720 --> 42:37.720
that I'm compiling from source.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.840
And then development is my own projects

42:39.840 --> 42:41.780
that I have tucked away.

42:41.780 --> 42:42.280
Nice.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.240
It's a good setup.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.520
And that's why I care.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.120
I know I shouldn't care, but that's why I care so much.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.680
People have been tweeting me and telegramming me

42:49.680 --> 42:50.680
their pictures all week.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.840
It's been really funny to see the different junk

42:52.840 --> 42:53.760
in people's folders.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.440
And you get an idea of what kind of programs they run.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.840
I kind of enjoy looking at it.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.880
You can see those directories, though.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.640
You know, downloads, music, in your case, junk, in my case,

43:03.640 --> 43:04.440
cruft.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.120
But you can't see the.files.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.680
Unless you want to turn it on your file manager,

43:08.680 --> 43:10.920
and why would you do that yourself,

43:10.920 --> 43:13.520
see.files every time you open the file manager?

43:13.520 --> 43:16.160
You know, you don't see them.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.160
What's the big deal?

43:17.160 --> 43:18.760
Yeah, it's not really so much.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.960
It's just sort of the principle of it.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.520
And every now and then, it strikes me.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.120
And I had an opportunity to really think about it

43:25.120 --> 43:26.680
when Wes brought that soapbox into the studio.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.720
And I was just sitting there looking at that shiny box.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.620
And I thought, you know, you're right.

43:29.620 --> 43:31.560
That's my home folder, Wes.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.220
He likes to get me fired up like that.

43:33.220 --> 43:36.000
Wes will go in there and switch out an editor to Vim,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.440
maybe alias nano to Vim.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.160
You're just so fun to troll.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.520
It's not my fault.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.960
I think this is a slippery slope.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.080
And next, you'll be one of these nutters

43:44.080 --> 43:47.720
that is refusing to run a Linux desktop environment

43:47.720 --> 43:49.160
if there's any D-Bus in it.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.080
And you'll be compiling out D-Bus from every application

43:52.080 --> 43:52.960
imaginable.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.240
I happened across one such blog this week.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.820
And I was just looking at it thinking,

43:56.820 --> 43:58.320
why would you do this to yourself?

43:58.320 --> 44:01.900
Why would you go to these links to remove a useful technology

44:01.900 --> 44:03.800
from the Linux desktop?

44:03.800 --> 44:06.280
Were they on dev1 by chance?

44:06.280 --> 44:08.040
No, no, they were not.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.680
But you know, I was just reading it,

44:09.680 --> 44:12.400
thinking, Carlos, there's a lot of effort to go to.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.320
And I'd love to know the rationale as to why

44:15.320 --> 44:16.520
you would want to do that.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.040
Yeah.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.600
Yeah, some people like the challenge.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.880
Is there a desktop environment that doesn't use D-Bus at all?

44:21.880 --> 44:23.040
I don't think there is.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.520
I mean, doesn't XFCE, they use XConf.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.280
But I don't know if that's using D-Bus behind the scenes

44:28.280 --> 44:32.880
or not, or if it's their own X settings sort of overlay.

44:32.880 --> 44:36.100
What kind of system can you run without D-Bus?

44:36.100 --> 44:37.680
Well, I know, right?

44:37.680 --> 44:40.000
This is why sitting there and compiling,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.400
removing it from build options and what have you,

44:42.400 --> 44:43.360
it's just crazy to me.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.920
It's, you know, modern technology requires a means

44:47.920 --> 44:49.920
for inter-process communication.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.920
Yeah, we could have actually used a lot more of that.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.520
I find it curious that throughout this whole blog post,

44:54.520 --> 44:56.840
they didn't actually give the rationale for everything

44:56.840 --> 44:58.320
you were reading.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.680
No, that's just an assumed.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.480
Yeah, no, it was just describing the length

45:02.480 --> 45:03.800
they'd gone to to remove it.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.000
It was astonishing.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.600
Did it work at all afterwards?

45:06.600 --> 45:08.240
I mean, were they happy with the results?

45:08.240 --> 45:10.320
Well, they had to make a number of compromises

45:10.320 --> 45:12.400
in the applications that they were prepared to use.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.480
Because as Dan points out, there's

45:14.480 --> 45:19.040
a whole catalog of software that is a hard requirement now.

45:19.040 --> 45:22.000
Right, including like Network Manager and?

45:22.000 --> 45:24.720
Even like system level stuff like DNS Mask

45:24.720 --> 45:27.840
wants to use D-Bus by default now.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.520
You know, as our buddy Richard says,

45:29.520 --> 45:31.040
I think it's wasted effort.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.360
I think that is some wasted effort there, my friends.

45:33.360 --> 45:35.200
All right, well, I'm glad Anthony's here for this story.

45:35.200 --> 45:38.280
This is our last story of the day before we get to the picks.

45:38.280 --> 45:41.280
And I'd love to get your perspective on this one.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.560
So Lyft is doing an IPO.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.960
And as part of that, it has come out

45:45.960 --> 45:51.080
that they are paying Amazon at a minimum of $8 million

45:51.080 --> 45:54.680
a month until the end of 2021.

45:54.680 --> 45:56.360
It's all buried in there.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.640
They're contractually obligated to pay at least $300 million

45:59.640 --> 46:01.640
to Amazon Web Services.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.960
They're committed to spending between $8.33 million

46:03.960 --> 46:07.520
and $8.57 million a month to AWS.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.120
Really what struck me is that, I mean,

46:09.120 --> 46:10.400
they're committed to this, right?

46:10.400 --> 46:13.080
If they don't hit or exceed that $300 million threshold,

46:13.080 --> 46:15.640
well, they're going to have to pay the difference.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.160
Yeah.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.080
Is it based on a commitment?

46:18.080 --> 46:20.840
Or is it based on something like reserved instances

46:20.840 --> 46:22.200
or something silly like that?

46:22.200 --> 46:23.680
Yeah, it's like a price deal they got.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, so what's happening, and we

46:25.000 --> 46:27.040
got to experience this with one of them as well.

46:27.040 --> 46:31.080
So what they're doing is they're locking in these contracts.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.000
And they're contractually obligated

46:33.000 --> 46:34.680
to hit a certain amount of revenue

46:34.680 --> 46:35.760
as part of the contract.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.280
Now, there's things that they do in return.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.560
Sometimes they're partnerships.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.120
Sometimes it's just access to stuff.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.400
Or they'll come in and help you with their infrastructure.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.980
It just depends on what you negotiate

46:45.980 --> 46:46.980
with the cloud provider.

46:46.980 --> 46:49.120
But it's contractually obligated to hit it.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.200
This is really remarkable, because the information

46:51.200 --> 46:53.080
recently reported that several companies have

46:53.080 --> 46:56.600
found that their AWS bills are getting surprisingly high.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.000
Dropbox notably recently switched off

46:59.000 --> 47:01.240
AWS to their own on-premises infrastructure

47:01.240 --> 47:03.640
due to monthly run costs.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.680
There was another startup that announced

47:05.680 --> 47:07.480
that they were also contractually

47:07.480 --> 47:09.640
obligated to make a certain payment level,

47:09.640 --> 47:12.080
like they would have a certain level of usage.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.160
And it strikes me, well, I guess the first thing that

47:15.160 --> 47:18.000
strikes me about this is what an intense amount of money

47:18.000 --> 47:21.200
to use what is essentially hosted free software

47:21.200 --> 47:22.000
at the core of it.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.080
Like, what a striking amount of money.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.760
That is really, really something.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.640
Per month, $300 million is what they

47:27.640 --> 47:30.800
have to pay total, which works out to be almost $9 million

47:30.800 --> 47:32.080
a month.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.520
It's good to be AWS, huh?

47:33.520 --> 47:34.600
I mean, there's companies that don't even

47:34.600 --> 47:36.520
get close to making that much money in an entire year.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.160
Yeah, but it's not unfeasible, though.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.040
Think of Lyft, at least Uber is.

47:40.040 --> 47:41.960
But Lyft's a global company.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.160
They've got to run at scale.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.000
They've got to run it high available.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.160
You don't want your Lyft application going down.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.560
Right, especially when you're driving somebody.

47:49.560 --> 47:52.200
Yeah, just to manage all the servers and application

47:52.200 --> 47:54.640
and development on that, the salary alone

47:54.640 --> 47:57.480
to run all that in-house and all the infrastructure

47:57.480 --> 47:59.080
and everything starts getting up there

47:59.080 --> 48:01.520
to be expensive versus AWS, where you

48:01.520 --> 48:03.000
can offload a lot of that.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.700
You still have a lot of control, but you

48:04.700 --> 48:06.160
don't have to own the hardware, worry

48:06.160 --> 48:08.320
about the scaling, and you can do it quicker.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.840
So sometimes for that convenience

48:09.840 --> 48:12.880
and that kind of safety net, it's what you're paying for.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.600
It's almost a little security versus.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.400
Right, and it's the core of their business.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.660
It's like what they do is that they're a service.

48:18.660 --> 48:20.040
They have to be online.

48:20.040 --> 48:20.800
Oh, yeah.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.400
Well, and they've got to be able to scale, too.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.360
And I mean, you've got to be able to scale up and scale down.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.040
And I mean, I guess at the end of the day,

48:27.040 --> 48:28.280
that's one of my favorite questions.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.920
Are they a hardware company?

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
Are they an engineering?

48:30.920 --> 48:33.000
What do they specialize in?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.880
And then offload the stuff that you

48:34.880 --> 48:36.800
don't specialize in to somebody who does.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.680
Even if it costs a little bit of a premium,

48:38.680 --> 48:40.720
you need to stay focused on your core business.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.640
So it sounds like they're doing that.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.600
But I'll tell you what, I feel a lot better about our cloud

48:44.600 --> 48:45.560
bills now.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.840
That is good news.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.200
Yeah, well, that gives you an idea

48:48.200 --> 48:50.200
of where they could go, though.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.880
Here's another way to look at it,

48:51.880 --> 48:54.140
even when you're not the size of a Lyft.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.600
So I'm going to speak from experience

48:55.600 --> 48:57.040
here at my last company.

48:57.040 --> 48:59.280
When I started, we had 11 IT people.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.560
We could barely keep up with the engineers.

49:02.560 --> 49:05.320
We shifted everything into Amazon.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.640
Our staffing cut down to four people.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.360
We still kept up, and we were saving about $700,000 a year

49:11.360 --> 49:15.600
based on salaries, benefits, and everything like that.

49:15.600 --> 49:16.360
Sure.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.480
Well, if it wasn't for the cloud,

49:17.480 --> 49:18.640
we wouldn't be here today.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.240
We couldn't offer.

49:20.240 --> 49:23.720
I mean, when Linux Academy started, I had nothing.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.520
Like, I had dollars to my name.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.960
Wouldn't be able to do anything if it wasn't for the ability

49:27.960 --> 49:29.680
that you pay for what you use.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.960
I mean, if you would have had to pre-provision co-location

49:31.960 --> 49:35.120
space, or hardware, dedicated hosting, or something like

49:35.120 --> 49:37.560
that, it's just too expensive.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.080
Were the first systems on a dedicated box?

49:40.080 --> 49:41.080
No.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.720
It was all AWS when we first started.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.160
Now we're across the different stuff.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.640
It was all AWS.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.240
If your bills are getting expensive,

49:47.240 --> 49:49.360
it's because you're not managing your costs,

49:49.360 --> 49:51.400
because there's always going to be that discussion

49:51.400 --> 49:53.840
and evaluation of what your business requirements are.

49:53.840 --> 49:58.280
And if you have to accomplish x, you're going to have a cost.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.140
And if you're outside of your budget,

50:00.140 --> 50:01.480
it's because you're not watching it,

50:01.480 --> 50:03.960
or there's been a variable change in your business.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.680
And it's an evaluation.

50:05.680 --> 50:06.780
It's constantly changing.

50:06.780 --> 50:08.640
You constantly have to evaluate it.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.760
And if you need to stick to that hardcore budget,

50:10.760 --> 50:12.840
well, then you need to make some decisions on what

50:12.840 --> 50:14.160
you're going to cut to stay there.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.280
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

50:15.280 --> 50:19.600
And in a past role, we actually took a decision

50:19.600 --> 50:23.520
that it was cheaper to re-architect the application

50:23.520 --> 50:29.960
that we were deploying to use microservices and stay on AWS

50:29.960 --> 50:33.520
and manage our AWS instances better than it

50:33.520 --> 50:37.280
was to bring everything in-house, so to speak,

50:37.280 --> 50:40.240
and stick it on our own metal and continue

50:40.240 --> 50:42.840
operating our application in the way it was currently

50:42.840 --> 50:43.560
architected.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.480
So you do have to think creatively

50:46.480 --> 50:50.240
when you use Amazon and, or AWS, rather.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.160
And it's not a replacement for, I

50:53.160 --> 50:55.260
have a big server in the corner, and now I

50:55.260 --> 50:56.880
want a big server in the cloud.

50:56.880 --> 50:59.040
That is not what these cloud providers are

50:59.040 --> 51:01.080
designed to offer at all.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.880
That's a whole different scenario.

51:02.880 --> 51:06.160
I even had a VDI deployment where our hardware aged out.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.920
And the cost of replacing that hardware alone,

51:09.920 --> 51:15.040
we would have paid it off using the cloud in about four

51:15.040 --> 51:16.120
and a half years.

51:16.120 --> 51:18.040
By that time, you're almost ready for a hardware refresh

51:18.040 --> 51:18.640
again.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.040
It was a break even, but then you

51:20.040 --> 51:21.800
get all the management capabilities

51:21.800 --> 51:24.200
that you're not even breaking a sweat.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.640
Right, yeah.

51:25.640 --> 51:26.640
I remember this story.

51:26.640 --> 51:28.920
A few years ago, it came out, and I just looked it up again,

51:28.920 --> 51:32.760
and it turns out it's now a case study on AWS website,

51:32.760 --> 51:35.600
but it's from Zynga, or Zynga, or however they pronounce it,

51:35.600 --> 51:37.200
Z-Y-N-G-A, the gaming company.

51:37.200 --> 51:37.840
Zynga, I think?

51:37.840 --> 51:38.800
Zynga, yeah.

51:38.800 --> 51:40.920
And so what they did was when they,

51:40.920 --> 51:44.160
FarmVille or whatever on Facebook was huge,

51:44.160 --> 51:46.340
and they ended up thinking, hey, it's

51:46.340 --> 51:49.640
going to be cheaper for us to just host our own data center.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.720
And so they started on AWS, and they moved it

51:52.720 --> 51:54.160
onto their own data center.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.280
And there was a whole bunch of stuff that happened.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.320
The technology change that they had to do,

51:58.320 --> 52:00.080
the popularity of their games went down,

52:00.080 --> 52:02.880
and they had this complete overall cost commitment.

52:02.880 --> 52:04.920
Now, this kind of goes back to the article, though.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.800
If they would have had a contract like this,

52:06.800 --> 52:08.840
would they still have the cost commitment?

52:08.840 --> 52:11.520
Does Lyft have that cost commitment,

52:11.520 --> 52:13.800
or is there something in the contract that says,

52:13.800 --> 52:16.920
hey, maybe if the business starts going south?

52:16.920 --> 52:19.720
Because if you start removing the benefits of scaling up

52:19.720 --> 52:21.220
and down and paying for what you need

52:21.220 --> 52:23.500
and being tied into obligations, that's

52:23.500 --> 52:26.120
when it's potential that you start losing some

52:26.120 --> 52:28.620
of the advantages of the cloud.

52:28.620 --> 52:32.640
I think what's, to me, very clear

52:32.640 --> 52:35.120
is for a very, very long time now,

52:35.120 --> 52:38.080
and this really bears it out, the actual cost

52:38.080 --> 52:41.680
of the core software itself is a very minor factor

52:41.680 --> 52:43.320
in enterprise deployments.

52:43.320 --> 52:45.760
And so the way we're seeing that bear out here

52:45.760 --> 52:50.600
is the fact that AWS is often implementing

52:50.600 --> 52:54.120
open source software and then providing that as a service,

52:54.120 --> 52:56.760
the fact that the very similar functionality

52:56.760 --> 52:59.060
is available for completely free,

52:59.060 --> 53:03.960
and that's not acting as sort of a backstop to these costs.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.000
The costs seem to be independent of the fact

53:06.000 --> 53:08.500
that they're all based on software that's absolutely free.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.800
Like, that does not seem to be impacting the cost of AWS

53:10.800 --> 53:11.320
at all.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.700
All AWS is doing in these cloud providers

53:13.700 --> 53:15.360
is they're taking something that exists

53:15.360 --> 53:17.120
and they're putting their wrappers around it.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.320
Postgres, MariaDB.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.120
They're just wrapping RDS around it

53:21.120 --> 53:23.440
and writing some code to manage it on their end.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.480
I think it really underscores the cost of software

53:25.480 --> 53:28.040
isn't a huge deciding factor for businesses,

53:28.040 --> 53:30.280
because otherwise they'd be using the free stuff.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.640
It's everything else.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.320
It's the staffing, it's the implementation,

53:33.320 --> 53:35.480
it's the maintenance, it's the future proofing,

53:35.480 --> 53:36.320
it's the scaling.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.120
It's so many other things that go into it.

53:38.120 --> 53:38.400
Right.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.640
Cost might be a factor, right?

53:39.640 --> 53:41.280
It's one of those, but you can't ignore that.

53:41.280 --> 53:43.240
So you might not go with the premium Oracle database

53:43.240 --> 53:44.200
because Postgres is free.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.500
But yes, you still have to pay to keep the thing online

53:46.500 --> 53:47.800
and do your backups.

53:47.800 --> 53:51.720
One of the big sort of commercial avenues for Ubuntu

53:51.720 --> 53:55.200
is Bootstack, which is where we manage and operate

53:55.200 --> 53:57.640
clouds on behalf of organizations.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.120
So it's all the same open source stuff

54:00.120 --> 54:02.400
that everyone's familiar with.

54:02.400 --> 54:06.080
But they want professionals to just look after that.

54:06.080 --> 54:11.040
As Anthony said earlier, if IT is not your core business

54:11.040 --> 54:14.160
mission, then why would you do that?

54:14.160 --> 54:16.360
Pay somebody else to look after that bit for you

54:16.360 --> 54:18.160
so you can get on with the business

54:18.160 --> 54:21.160
of actually running your operation.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.720
Yeah, you've got to focus, right?

54:23.720 --> 54:26.320
You've got to choose only a few things

54:26.320 --> 54:27.520
to focus on as a company.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.480
Because if you've got to focus on and be experts

54:29.480 --> 54:32.720
in a lot of different things, that's a staffing nightmare.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.180
That's an expertise nightmare.

54:34.180 --> 54:36.080
That's an institutional knowledge nightmare.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.000
It's a risk.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Yeah.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.540
Yeah, it's something to see it, though,

54:39.540 --> 54:40.880
just to see it in hard numbers.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.800
You get glimpses because this stuff is usually all private,

54:43.800 --> 54:45.680
like how much people are paying and stuff.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.640
But when you file an IPO, these things come out.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.280
And so now we're seeing it.

54:49.280 --> 54:51.320
Now, when Uber goes for their IPO, we'll get an idea

54:51.320 --> 54:53.720
of what they're spending on this infrastructure cost, too,

54:53.720 --> 54:54.640
I would imagine.

54:54.640 --> 54:57.440
$300 million by 2022, though.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.200
That's significant.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.660
Really curious what that lock-in details.

55:01.660 --> 55:03.240
The Business Insider article says

55:03.240 --> 55:05.920
that Lyft still has to pay it, even if they

55:05.920 --> 55:07.400
don't reach that usage level.

55:07.400 --> 55:08.560
But you never know.

55:08.560 --> 55:10.080
There could be something else in the contract that says,

55:10.080 --> 55:12.880
hey, if we go completely bottoms up, this is over.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.880
Who knows, right?

55:13.880 --> 55:15.260
And what do they get in exchange?

55:15.260 --> 55:17.260
Because when you look at the traditional model,

55:17.260 --> 55:20.520
simply the only way they lock you in on anything,

55:20.520 --> 55:23.200
as far as a duration, is reserved instances.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.800
That's your largest cost savings.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.320
That's your contractual obligation.

55:26.320 --> 55:29.560
Outside of that, it's consume what you use and pay for that.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.480
So speaking from experience, what I can say

55:31.480 --> 55:33.320
is they try to entice you with some stuff,

55:33.320 --> 55:37.320
like you can have access to some of our in-house developers

55:37.320 --> 55:39.600
to help you solve some of your big technical challenges.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.880
And you get priority attention.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.760
And you get access into product managers.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.360
And they help.

55:45.360 --> 55:47.360
Those are the type of deals that actually

55:47.360 --> 55:52.400
help influence the feature roadmap inside of services.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.600
Yeah, where you're a big enough customer that can come in

55:54.600 --> 55:56.400
and say, hey, you've showed up on our radar.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.240
Let's talk.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.700
Or if the customer goes and says, hey, we have this problem.

55:59.700 --> 56:00.280
We need this.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.000
They will prioritize it in terms of development for them

56:03.000 --> 56:03.720
internally.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.440
It's not even size-driven, though.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.480
So I work for an MSP.

56:07.480 --> 56:10.640
We resell a managed Amazon service.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.000
So we manage Amazon for customers,

56:13.000 --> 56:14.760
because they don't even want to do that.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.640
Amazon, for the smallest deals, throws us

56:17.640 --> 56:21.400
a huge amount of credits to hand off to the customer.

56:21.400 --> 56:24.360
Like, I have a new customer that's three servers.

56:24.360 --> 56:28.000
They just issued me a $5,000 credit US for no reason

56:28.000 --> 56:29.560
other than to entice them to come in,

56:29.560 --> 56:32.840
because they know full well that once you're in there,

56:32.840 --> 56:33.720
you're going to spend.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.180
And that's just all there is to it.

56:35.180 --> 56:39.760
So they will go over backwards with architecture help.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.800
You get access to product managers.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.680
You can walk into their office and sit down

56:43.680 --> 56:44.640
and meet with them.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.200
They just want to get you hooked in,

56:47.200 --> 56:49.000
because they know you will spend.

56:49.000 --> 56:49.640
Simple.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.880
It's almost like the entire Amazon business model.

56:51.880 --> 56:53.040
Go in for market share.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.040
Get them on there first.

56:54.040 --> 56:55.140
Worry about profits later.

56:55.140 --> 56:58.680
But AWS is exceptionally profitable, actually.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.960
Well, market leader, they're just there first, right?

57:00.960 --> 57:04.200
It's like anyone who gets there first, you have an advantage.

57:04.200 --> 57:07.680
Yeah, and it's everybody else's game now to catch up.

57:07.680 --> 57:11.880
Well, so I think, still, there's something about it, though,

57:11.880 --> 57:14.440
that strikes me, just to conclude our thoughts.

57:14.440 --> 57:15.840
Just something about it strikes me

57:15.840 --> 57:19.200
that you could build something similar with free software

57:19.200 --> 57:19.720
yourself.

57:19.720 --> 57:22.080
Like, it's a very interesting time

57:22.080 --> 57:24.360
where something very similar is achievable on your own

57:24.360 --> 57:27.000
if you have the right time, the resources, and the reasons.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.760
Or you can go flip a switch and have it

57:28.760 --> 57:32.120
on this almost what seems like infinite scale.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.960
But it's the same essential free software underneath it all.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.000
Don't reinvent the wheel.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.040
Spend time inventing something new.

57:38.040 --> 57:38.800
Yeah.

57:38.800 --> 57:39.320
Yeah.

57:39.320 --> 57:42.240
And there's occasions when, depending

57:42.240 --> 57:46.120
on what you're working on, the focus of the business,

57:46.120 --> 57:48.200
you can't use the public cloud.

57:48.200 --> 57:51.320
You know, you may be the custodians of data

57:51.320 --> 57:55.120
that you simply don't have the agreement to put somewhere

57:55.120 --> 57:57.000
in a public instance.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
And one of the companies I worked for in the past,

57:59.000 --> 58:02.520
we created our own data center, effectively our own cloud.

58:02.520 --> 58:06.240
And we operated it because the customers that we were servicing,

58:06.240 --> 58:08.440
they all had sensitive data.

58:08.440 --> 58:11.460
And there was no way we would be successful as a business

58:11.460 --> 58:13.620
if we were using public cloud infrastructure.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.080
So we had to build our own.

58:15.080 --> 58:15.560
Right.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.080
There's stuff like VoIP comes to mind

58:17.080 --> 58:18.880
are the things we have latency guarantees

58:18.880 --> 58:19.680
that you have to make.

58:19.680 --> 58:20.520
Yeah.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.640
I'm not going to mention the nature of the business.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.280
But yeah, there's a lot of different strata

58:25.280 --> 58:27.720
of organizations where you simply cannot put it

58:27.720 --> 58:28.680
in the public cloud.

58:28.680 --> 58:29.600
The other thing that strikes me is

58:29.600 --> 58:32.320
it's harder sometimes to build those private clouds these days

58:32.320 --> 58:35.960
because people are using so much cloud infrastructure.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.720
Unless you're giant and can pay top dollar,

58:37.720 --> 58:39.460
those people go to build the public clouds,

58:39.460 --> 58:41.080
and they're not going to build yours.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.760
But even look at what Amazon's doing without posts,

58:43.760 --> 58:44.920
if you're familiar with it.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.560
It's basically Amazon in a box in your data center

58:47.560 --> 58:50.560
that they fully manage from the same console using

58:50.560 --> 58:52.720
the same APIs.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.800
When the cloud first came out, I was sitting here thinking,

58:55.800 --> 58:57.960
I don't know why it popped in my head.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.720
But I'm sure it's popped in everybody's head.

58:59.720 --> 59:02.480
They're just going to get rid of everybody's job.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.320
And then if they just spin stuff up,

59:04.320 --> 59:05.740
you don't have to worry about stuff.

59:05.740 --> 59:08.320
And then every year that goes by, every year that goes by,

59:08.320 --> 59:12.280
I would actually argue to say that architectures these days

59:12.280 --> 59:15.080
are more complicated than they were 10 years because

59:15.080 --> 59:15.640
of the cloud.

59:15.640 --> 59:18.680
You have 100 and some different AWS services,

59:18.680 --> 59:21.160
an infinite number of combination of things,

59:21.160 --> 59:23.720
awesome architectures like event-driven architectures

59:23.720 --> 59:25.800
that you're empowered to do.

59:25.800 --> 59:30.760
And now you can specialize in a specific component

59:30.760 --> 59:34.360
of expertise and just that in the cloud.

59:34.360 --> 59:36.360
Yeah, you're right.

59:36.360 --> 59:39.440
It's a continuing expansion.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.960
We were talking on Linux Action News this week

59:41.960 --> 59:43.960
about these little microcontroller devices

59:43.960 --> 59:46.840
for valves and whatnot that are now getting connected to AWS

59:46.840 --> 59:50.040
and getting managed by AWS.

59:50.040 --> 59:52.440
It's really everything.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.400
Not for everybody.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.480
We wouldn't be just very much pointed out very clearly.

59:56.480 --> 59:59.200
There are still plenty of use cases.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.160
Yeah, and you're right.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.280
It's getting even more complex now.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.000
And it gets even crazier when you start going multi-cloud

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.280
or you have some on-premises, some on-cloud.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.320
It can be really complicated now.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.820
Well, Chris, if you were ever going

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.640
to start a high-speed frequency trading software company,

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.560
you would for sure have to have your own on-premises

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.080
environment.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.920
I do know that.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.640
Oh, yeah?

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.360
Yeah.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.840
The speed matters.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.320
That makes sense.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.600
Or what about Bitcoin?

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.000
No, probably not Bitcoin.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.160
No, not Bitcoin.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.080
You can spin up all the GPUs.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.880
Well, before we get out of here, why don't we

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.000
do a couple of app picks?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.680
I promised you at the top of the show that we would give you

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.440
not one, but two different potential video editors

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.120
for the Linux desktop this week.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.640
Both have brand new versions that came out just this week.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.720
First off, the one, the only Flowblade,

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.000
describes itself as fast, precise, and stable.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.040
It's a GPL3-licensed video editor

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.400
based on the MLT framework, which

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.160
just got a brand new update.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.480
And one of the big things in here

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.960
is composite, mix, filter, and animate.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.360
My review of this is it's still in early days,

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.280
but it's getting better.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.800
When I mentioned that in the pre-show,

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.920
Mr. Wimpris jumped in with Shotcut.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.640
Yeah, I'm deeply, deeply in love with Shotcut.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.040
I'm by no means a well-versed video editor,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.800
but I did some research in the middle of last year

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.720
to choose a video editor that I was going to learn and use

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.600
for projects in the future.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.120
And Shotcut came out as my preferred choice.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.640
And the guys behind Shotcut, and this is Dan Denady,

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.440
he's got a long history in the video post-processing

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.840
and video editing industry, and is also

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.000
the guy behind MLT itself.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.300
So Shotcut is kind of like the reference implementation

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.120
of what Melt can do on the back end.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.080
And there's lots of killer features,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.400
but the things that have really started to stand out

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.960
in recent months in Shotcut is the key frame support.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.880
You can now have multi-point key frames,

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.560
so you can move effects and transitions

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.880
through multiple curves.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.040
Color grading is excellent.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.520
And the thing that I really love is first class

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.240
encode your video, render your video out on the GPU, which

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.240
for listeners at home, you only want to do on NVIDIA GPUs

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.320
because the quality on AMD is particularly bad.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.160
It's quite bad on Intel.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.720
On 10-series NVIDIA cards, it's acceptable.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.160
And on 20-series NVIDIA cards, it's excellent.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.480
Ah, good to know.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.320
Yeah, and conveniently, snap, install Shotcut.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.880
You'll always have the latest version.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.400
Oh, I love it.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.360
Also, the new version not only updates

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.840
to a new version of Qt, but it's got some feature in here,

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.200
a new feature, added English Great Britain translation.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.480
I don't know what that would be.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.360
I don't know what that would be.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:05.840
Oh, yeah.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.600
That's strange.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.360
Yeah, it's excellent now that we have the text appearing

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.840
in the application in traditional English

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.680
rather than simplified English.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.400
Well, thank you for the pick.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.800
Shotcut and Flow Blade, we'll have links in the show notes.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.880
LinuxUnplugged.com slash episode number, which insert

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.840
episode number here, which is 291.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.200
Or the links will be in your mobile podcast player.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.560
Guys, good luck.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.680
I think we have one more week or two before the meetup.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.200
But good luck with your Ubuntu meetup.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.040
And Popey, looking forward to seeing you at scale, sir.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.640
Oh, yes.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.800
I cannot wait.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.400
Yeah, it's going to be good times.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.520
All right, with that, we will begin to wrap it up.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.200
Go follow Anthony on Twitter, AnthonyDJames.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.440
I'm at ChrisLAS.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.400
Go follow Wes at WesPayne.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.960
Go check out Wes on the TechSnap program, TechSnap.Systems.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.480
I was hanging out with Jim Salter this week talking

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.640
about proper passwords, right?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.480
Is that what it was?

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.240
Oh, yeah.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.280
How to do proper password storage, not plain text.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.520
Never, never plain text.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.760
No, it was a really good episode.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.400
It was a good take on a topic that we've heard before.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.480
I really liked it.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.040
A lot of good information in there.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.560
Hey, coming up in just a little bit,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.200
if you're listening live, is the study group.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.680
But if you missed it, there may be a YouTube channel

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.360
in the meantime.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.280
Come back here next Tuesday.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:48.600
I'll see you guys next time.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:59.480
All right, let's do a little post-show and get out of here.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.360
Do our titles.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.000
We didn't have the votes going this week,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.200
so we've got to figure out what the heck we're

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.240
going to title this thing.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.960
Brent's doing some great work, working

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
the doc with some titles.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.280
Maybe you should read those out here.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.040
Propose them, Brent.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.680
Oh, really?

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.680
Good job, Brent.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.240
See, you're going to win this one.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.040
Well, I'm not up against very many people here,

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.600
so some of the best, I must say.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.160
That's true.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:19.800
That's true.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.840
What do you like the best, though?

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.480
Is there one of them you like?

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.400
Lifting the clouds.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.920
Lifting the clouds, flipping the switch on FOSS, dot or dash.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.880
I like that one.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.640
And clouding out open source.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.880
Clouding out?

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.760
Clouding out, like crowding out?

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.360
Like that kind of thing?

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:38.920
Like crowding?

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.600
Let it be what you want.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.920
$8 million a month in AWS.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.640
What?

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.680
Really?

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.560
Oh, oh, oh.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.560
I thought you meant that was, I was like, no way.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.440
I thought you said that.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.600
You think that was our bill?

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.400
Yes.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.800
No way, I was going to say.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.240
Isn't that what it was from Lyft, in the $8 million?

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.280
Yeah, it was $8 million, $8.9 million a month, I think.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.120
All right, so dot or dash, clouding out open source,

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.120
lifting the clouds, flipping the switch on FOSS?

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.040
What about flipping the switch?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.120
What was that about?

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.360
That was about ease of use.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.600
You mentioned it for, you can just

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.800
turn the switch on a server now and concentrate

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.100
on something more interesting.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:24.200
But if you had to ask, maybe it means it's not right.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200
Hmm.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:25.800
All right.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.920
Well, that's horrible then.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.880
That's horrible.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.040
What are you guys doing for the rest of the evening?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.200
Assuming you're not listening to the study group.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.880
Nobody's going to tell me what they're doing tonight?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.120
Yeah, my wife just came in to give me

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.920
my daughter's passport.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.800
Yeah, sorry.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.520
Good, keep that handy.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.920
I also, I'm building up a packing list for scale.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.720
Making sure I'm bringing along everything

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.000
I need to bring along, because otherwise I'll forget.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.800
I'm terrible.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.840
My memory's awful.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.040
What's the most important thing on there?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.800
I can't tell you.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.600
It's a surprise.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600
Oh.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.680
Oh.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.560
Oh.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.480
I bet it's for the bad vultures thing.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.520
Yeah, loads of stuff.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.760
They're just like, just in case.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.720
Because you know when you want to stand at an event,

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.480
you've got to have everything just in case.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:10.320
All the extra bits involved, USB keys, and a Raspberry Pi,

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.880
SD cards, and HDMI cables, and USB chargers, and all that crap.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.160
Always feel better with a pie in your pocket.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.920
Yes.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.240
Hadid got pulled over by TSA for traveling with my microphone.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:24.960
Really?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.240
This happens a few times, yeah.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.800
I meant to take the bag with me, but just the way it worked out.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.120
I guess it looks like a pipe bomb.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.720
Oh, I've had that.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.320
When I was flying to the States once,

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.520
they said the check at the gate, just before I got on the plane,

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.880
he emptied out my laptop bag.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.560
And I had my Zoom microphone in there.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.520
And he said, what's this?

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.920
I said, it's a microphone.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.560
He said, what's that for?

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.800
And I said, interviewing people.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.120
And he goes, are you a journalist?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.920
I was like, no.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.840
He goes, oh, because if you were a journalist,

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.920
you wouldn't be allowed into the States on the visa you've got.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.480
I was like, uh, what?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.400
No, I'm not.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.640
So I was like, oh, shit.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.680
That's crazy.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.760
I always get stopped, both for the microphone and then

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.200
a bag full of just photo gear that seems like no one would ever

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.520
carry that much, and then a glass jar full of oatmeal.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.600
They always give me a strange look for that one.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.920
A glass jar full of oatmeal, Brent.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.520
I love you.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.480
You're so great.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.040
Yeah, what kind of glass jar?

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.280
Like a mason jar, I'm picturing.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.400
It's got to be a mason jar.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.560
With a metal lid, though?

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.120
Does it have a handle?

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:24.880
No handle.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.120
It takes up too much room.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:27.680
Of course.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.160
But you get hot water on the plane

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.960
and throw some chocolate in there, you're all good.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh, my goodness.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.400
Clever.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.280
This is a travel hack we're getting.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:43.120
So you're getting the advantages of a dry, packable meal

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.600
that you can then get hot water on the plane, you add,

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.080
and you are also packing chocolates.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.520
This is huge, Brent.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.880
This is mind blowing.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.840
I am totally doing this on Wednesday.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.960
Why not just have a granola bar?

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.400
Because it's hot and comfy, and the look on their face

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.800
when they see a glass jar full of who knows what is priceless.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.720
Is that not considered, I guess, oatmeal's,

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.240
I guess it makes sense.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.040
It's not like it's made oatmeal when you're going through TSA.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.720
It's not like liquid, right?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.600
I could see them thinking it's pretty weird.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.240
How far can you push the boundaries

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.280
on taking stuff that is not liquid,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.480
but very clearly is made much better

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.880
with hot water on the plane?

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.960
How far can you go?

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.960
Pobie, you do know that we have food in the States.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
You can just eat here.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.560
You don't have to pack the food.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.520
Well, yeah.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.080
So that's a big thing.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.040
All your filthy chlorine-washed chicken

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.240
and like beef pumped full of barbiturates and stuff.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.760
I don't know if I can eat that.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.280
I've got to bring some oats.

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.520
That's what I've got to do.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.040
Yeah.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:10:11.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
