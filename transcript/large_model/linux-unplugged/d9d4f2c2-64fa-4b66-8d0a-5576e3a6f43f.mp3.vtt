WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
This can be one of those interesting episodes where we are gonna have people bailing from the mumble room and then joining back during the

00:06.360 --> 00:13.840
Show because right now as we record red hat summit is happening and Carl you're manning a booth virtually right now

00:14.280 --> 00:20.260
Yes, sir, the fedora in centOS chat room slash booth slash whatever you want to call it. That's awesome

00:20.260 --> 00:25.360
And are you getting decent attendance? Oh, yeah on-demand created a fedora badge, which is like a little

00:25.360 --> 00:31.200
little gamification thing that they do in the fedora community for attending and you just show up in there and let them know what

00:31.200 --> 00:36.880
Your fedora account system username is and they'll give you the badge. Oh great. I was just about to ask, you know virtual booth

00:36.880 --> 00:42.720
We need virtual swag. I was thinking the same thing. You know, this is like a different kind of summit, isn't it Neil?

00:42.720 --> 00:49.200
I'm just glad it's happening at all because like I've been I've been kind of depressed with all the events that have been canceling throughout

00:49.200 --> 00:55.600
The season and it's been nice to like at least get in listen to see what people are doing and and and chat with folks

00:56.200 --> 01:02.480
In there and hey, this is the first summit where I technically maybe gave a talk. So that's cool

01:02.560 --> 01:09.120
Yeah, and this year the concrete would be real bad and you're not gonna get that so that's a positive too. Oh, yeah

01:09.120 --> 01:15.220
I'm gonna look forward to not being basically bedridden for a month again. Like I was last year. I gave it a go

01:15.220 --> 01:21.640
I logged in I found it a little confusing but kind of like you I was just glad it was happening and I thought to myself

01:21.640 --> 01:23.560
I really appreciate

01:23.560 --> 01:27.240
The real Red Hat summit because when you go to the actual Red Hat summit

01:27.240 --> 01:31.740
You really get an appreciation for how dialed in Red Hat has that game?

01:31.740 --> 01:45.340
I've been to a lot of corporate events and they really have their summit game dialed in the virtual version. It's a little rough

01:50.260 --> 01:56.820
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, mr. Payne quite the show

01:56.820 --> 02:03.020
We have for 351 packed too much. We never do it. Just right. We can't help ourselves because we have

02:03.340 --> 02:07.140
So much to cover with a brand new fedora release and of course

02:07.220 --> 02:10.540
There's things to follow up on the new Ubuntu 2004 releases

02:10.540 --> 02:12.820
Well, we've had a little extra time with that

02:12.820 --> 02:14.100
but as we said

02:14.100 --> 02:21.180
We also gave the fedora 32 release a full try who could resist and I am happy to report that

02:21.180 --> 02:26.820
Just after the show last week actually during the show. They attempted to deliver my system 76 limmer Pro

02:27.420 --> 02:29.460
But they didn't really ring the doorbell

02:29.460 --> 02:35.480
You I think they like dropped it off on the porch and like I don't want the kovat and ran off and didn't even try

02:35.480 --> 02:39.500
But the next day I was like camped up by the door

02:39.500 --> 02:45.100
There's a window in the studio living room where I can see the entryway. And so there I was with my phone in hand

02:45.100 --> 02:50.700
Watching and they you know, sure enough knock knock on the door get the box

02:50.700 --> 02:55.740
I open it up tried it out for a little bit and then the next day had to put fedora 32 on it

02:55.740 --> 02:58.860
And I'll give you my impressions of what it's like in the next week

02:58.900 --> 03:00.100
We'll have the review

03:00.100 --> 03:06.140
But before we get into that before we get into the review of fedora 32 the follow-up of Ubuntu 2004 the community news

03:06.140 --> 03:07.580
I have to say

03:07.580 --> 03:16.780
Time appropriate greetings to that mumble room. Hello virtual lug whenever you guys do that

03:16.780 --> 03:21.580
I always watch it from a waveform perspective and it's very impressive visually I have to say hello everybody

03:21.820 --> 03:23.620
It's a great showing in there

03:23.620 --> 03:26.500
I know some of you may have to come and go as the summits going but

03:27.100 --> 03:32.080
Special hello to Matt DM Matt from fedora is back. Hello Matthews. Good to have you on the show

03:32.080 --> 03:36.280
Good to be here. Very glad you're here on fedora release day. Your timing is perfect sir

03:36.280 --> 03:41.580
And mr. Martin whimpers glad to have you back sir. Hello. Hello. Happy release to you as well

03:41.580 --> 03:43.380
Thank you very much. Good to be here

03:43.380 --> 03:51.620
Well, so why don't we start with you wimpy because there was a tweet from your fingers on April 24th saying there's new

03:51.620 --> 03:57.840
Features in the Ubuntu desktop that no one is talking about and I thought well, let's talk about them

03:58.260 --> 04:02.180
And the one that I thought maybe we could start with but I'd love to just go anywhere with you on this

04:02.180 --> 04:04.180
but the one I'd like to start with is

04:04.180 --> 04:11.060
It appears that with 2004 you can get a Ubuntu certified device right away

04:11.060 --> 04:16.820
Like we're not there's not this typical leg of months before OEM is certifying it. Is that true? It's not quite that

04:16.820 --> 04:23.780
So the way that it works now is that in the past the only way you could get a certified device experience

04:23.780 --> 04:29.660
which means the correct power endurance profiles the correct firmware for

04:29.660 --> 04:37.580
Auxiliary devices the right drivers by default all that sort of thing was via the factory image that came pre-loaded

04:38.260 --> 04:44.180
So what we've changed now is that when you do an install of the GA release of Ubuntu

04:44.540 --> 04:48.740
2004 it can identify if it's on a certified device and

04:49.380 --> 04:55.880
Automatically pull in all of that stuff that would have been in the pre-loaded factory image into the standard install

04:55.880 --> 05:00.680
So if you've got a certified device, maybe you bought it pre-installed with Windows

05:00.680 --> 05:06.080
And you want to dual boot Ubuntu alongside it or maybe you've decided to make the switch to Ubuntu

05:06.320 --> 05:08.320
You'll get the factory

05:08.840 --> 05:09.960
experience

05:09.960 --> 05:14.400
Just from the GA ISO. That is so cool

05:14.840 --> 05:16.800
Now there's a bunch of other things in here

05:16.800 --> 05:21.840
We should talk about because one of the areas we didn't jump into was like the fingerprint stuff and I'm curious if there's other

05:21.840 --> 05:26.120
Areas you feel like need a little more attention too. There are I mean the fingerprint stuff is interesting

05:26.120 --> 05:33.440
That was another OEM request and that's more around the support of new biometrics devices, which

05:35.160 --> 05:42.280
Mostly proprietary these days because they don't want people having sight of how the internals of those devices work

05:42.560 --> 05:50.300
So we needed a way to bring those devices into you know, the Ubuntu desktop and the wider Linux desktop ecosystem

05:50.300 --> 05:53.460
So we did some work with the three

05:54.260 --> 06:01.060
Largest suppliers of those biometric devices to find a way where those can be enabled on the Linux desktop

06:01.100 --> 06:03.620
so that was done in collaboration with the

06:04.180 --> 06:06.180
LibFprint project and

06:06.420 --> 06:11.900
Then also with the upstream GNOME design team who've got a new design

06:12.340 --> 06:18.060
To improve the way you enroll your fingerprints and then do fingerprint unlock

06:18.060 --> 06:23.860
So we don't have those new designs implemented in 2004, but they will land before

06:24.540 --> 06:28.980
2004.1. That is very exciting and also just impressive the amount of sort of backroom dealings

06:28.980 --> 06:33.420
You know working out arrangements and has to go on to actually make these user visible features happen

06:33.420 --> 06:40.420
So what we've done is we've created a LibFprint compatible protocol shim that sits in front of these

06:40.780 --> 06:44.100
proprietary drivers and translates the proprietary driver

06:44.100 --> 06:49.220
Implementation into a LibFprint compatible protocol clever

06:49.900 --> 06:54.220
Before we get to the the Scuttlebot. I've already seen over 2010

06:54.500 --> 06:57.180
What else was missed in the coverage of 2004?

06:57.180 --> 07:03.780
So I think it was subtle stuff that was more like a distro level rather than you know

07:03.900 --> 07:08.740
actual features of the desktop itself and some of this work was work that you know, I

07:08.740 --> 07:14.180
Was interested in doing a community level and it's stuff that predated

07:14.180 --> 07:16.900
You know me coming back to the Ubuntu desktop team

07:17.140 --> 07:23.780
But it's things like making sure that FFmpeg is NVENC and VAPI and OpenCL

07:24.260 --> 07:27.780
Accelerated in the distro so that things like

07:27.980 --> 07:32.940
OBS studio and the video editors and all the rest of it can exploit all of those

07:32.940 --> 07:40.940
Acceleration for scrubbing through timelines using acceleration and doing you know hardware accelerated video encode and all the rest of it

07:40.940 --> 07:43.180
Oh, that sounds great for folks who are you know new

07:43.180 --> 07:47.540
I mean, I know how to compile those things in but that's a big blocker if you're just trying to make some content

07:47.540 --> 07:50.500
Yeah, indeed and it was there in 1804

07:50.500 --> 07:57.940
albeit with the older way that NVENC was exposed via FFmpeg and then because of changes in the FFmpeg project it

07:58.420 --> 08:02.100
Fell away in subsequent releases and we wanted to bring that back

08:02.100 --> 08:05.660
So, you know, it's stuff like that and you know uplifting Steam

08:05.660 --> 08:11.820
So that all of the current crop of VR devices and controllers all work out of the box when you install Steam

08:12.180 --> 08:19.420
You know a whole raft of work around improving quality of life for people that want to make videos or want to

08:20.220 --> 08:22.980
livestream or want to play games and

08:23.860 --> 08:25.860
That also extends to

08:26.180 --> 08:30.620
Including ferals game mode Daemon. Yeah, this is interesting

08:30.620 --> 08:34.900
It's something that I don't recall being super easy to actually get running during the beta

08:34.900 --> 08:36.900
So I was surprised to see it in

08:37.260 --> 08:39.100
2004 final maybe I was wrong about that

08:39.100 --> 08:44.940
But I seem to recall early on in the process having some trouble actually getting game mode for 2004, right? So this was

08:45.540 --> 08:49.720
The last feature we landed in Ubuntu desktop 2004. Okay

08:50.380 --> 08:55.100
It landed release week. I think it landed on the Monday and we released on the Thursday

08:55.100 --> 08:59.460
So it was very late coming but it was something if you look at the bug

08:59.460 --> 09:04.460
Report for it. I think I started that process as like I think it's the first thing

09:04.460 --> 09:11.060
I did when I took over from Will was actually start that process and it sat and it sounds like a trivial thing

09:11.060 --> 09:15.580
Well game modes just a bit of software and it's just a package so that you just include it in the distro

09:15.780 --> 09:20.820
but for everything that is in the Ubuntu desktop, it has to be in the main archive and

09:21.240 --> 09:27.500
the main archive is traditionally the archive that gets all of the security support and

09:27.500 --> 09:30.420
You know proactive security maintenance

09:30.720 --> 09:38.220
So in order to get into that archive the security team have to conduct a manual security review and audit all of the code

09:38.220 --> 09:45.180
Of course, and we also have to do packaging checks to make sure that you know, the upstream is active

09:45.180 --> 09:48.280
They have the appropriate security reporting mechanisms

09:48.280 --> 09:54.700
The health of the packaging of the software is correct its standards compliant and a whole bunch of things. So

09:54.700 --> 10:01.660
we've gone through that process and again, if you look at the bug there, you will see references to the

10:02.180 --> 10:06.780
the work that the security team did and the upstream conversations they had in

10:07.420 --> 10:11.880
Ferals github around the security review that we did so, you know

10:11.880 --> 10:17.460
There was a number of you know changes and updates that happened in order for it to land in main

10:17.580 --> 10:23.060
Which I think happened a week before release and then subsequently get included in the image

10:23.060 --> 10:27.780
So yeah, it wasn't in the beta but it's in the final release. Well while we're talking about gaming

10:28.180 --> 10:36.100
there is one new touch that I didn't and I still haven't regretfully had a chance to try yet and that is if

10:36.620 --> 10:42.920
People out there have hybrid graphics or like myself. I have an external eGPU that I've talked about before on this show

10:43.300 --> 10:47.460
Well now you can right-click on an icon in the launcher, you know

10:47.460 --> 10:51.660
Where you normally have like new window or add to favorites what you know the options you normally have in gnome shell

10:51.660 --> 10:56.580
There's an option in there to launch using the dedicated graphics card. How the hell does this work?

10:56.580 --> 11:01.860
How is this possible and and do all I have to do is just plug in my eGPU and this just shows up in

11:01.860 --> 11:07.140
Gnome shell. Well, first of all, let's start the very beginning. This is an upstream gnome feature

11:07.740 --> 11:10.240
It was first introduced in gnome

11:10.820 --> 11:17.060
334 but it only worked with Intel and AMD drivers and what was added in

11:17.060 --> 11:23.580
336 was support for Nvidia. If you've got an Nvidia Intel hybrid system

11:23.580 --> 11:26.700
you need to be running the Nvidia proprietary drivers and

11:27.260 --> 11:30.900
The Nvidia proprietary drivers need to be in on-demand mode

11:30.900 --> 11:39.580
So you're choosing that mode where the Intel IGP is in use and is rendering the desktop and the Nvidia

11:39.740 --> 11:43.780
GPU is in this low power state waiting to be used and

11:43.780 --> 11:47.260
Although this is a feature that I think it's integrated in

11:48.080 --> 11:50.520
GLib, I may be wrong about that, but I think it's in GLib

11:50.560 --> 11:55.640
But essentially in order to run a process on a dedicated GPU

11:55.640 --> 12:00.760
It's just the case of setting a few environment variables prior to launching the process

12:01.240 --> 12:08.040
So what's happening behind the scenes is a few environment variables get inserted into the execution context

12:08.040 --> 12:14.640
for the application that you've chosen to run when you right-click and say launch on dedicated GPU and

12:14.800 --> 12:22.000
it puts the appropriate environment variables in there for if you're using an AMD graphics card or an Nvidia graphics card and then

12:22.240 --> 12:27.080
Subsequently that process is now running with the full capability of that GPU

12:27.120 --> 12:33.560
I've been doing that manually, you know on the terminal now for a while, but this is just such a level of

12:33.560 --> 12:38.140
Finesse that it feels it feels special

12:38.140 --> 12:41.660
It feels like something maybe just you'd normally see on the commercial operating systems

12:41.660 --> 12:47.780
I mean, I have to say that GNOME 3.36 has just just just been a load of stuff

12:47.780 --> 12:52.660
That's landed all at once that just makes it an outstanding version of GNOME

12:52.780 --> 12:53.420
You know

12:53.420 --> 12:59.300
there was lots of design refinement that I think was originally scoped out by the GNOME design team in

12:59.300 --> 13:05.920
2017 and they've been slowly working towards and then loads of it landed in this cycle

13:05.920 --> 13:10.840
So it's perfect time for you know us to be releasing an LTS because without doubt

13:10.840 --> 13:17.540
This is the best GNOME shell ever very well said and that is going to echo in my fedora 32 review as well

13:17.840 --> 13:25.740
It is the culmination of years of work that are landing in this version. What a what a perfect release for an LTS

13:25.740 --> 13:31.740
Yeah, it really is. I mean, yeah, it's a fantastic GNOME shell release, you know without question

13:31.860 --> 13:38.020
I'm curious if you have any other bits or thoughts on like the ZFS stuff or any early information on how that's going

13:38.020 --> 13:44.300
It's too early to look at the adoption rate on that just yet, but it's stronger than 1910

13:44.300 --> 13:48.540
So it'll be interesting to see how many people are opting into ZFS

13:48.540 --> 13:51.700
but the big change there is the introduction of

13:51.700 --> 13:57.700
Zsys, which is our integration layer that sits between

13:58.760 --> 14:06.600
ZFS and Vuntu and so that's responsible for doing event driven snapshots and that's

14:06.940 --> 14:09.620
mostly around if you do

14:10.340 --> 14:13.100
large package installs or upgrades

14:13.660 --> 14:18.980
Then snapshots ZFS snapshots are taken prior to those transactions being committed

14:18.980 --> 14:25.300
So if an update goes bad restore points are automatically exposed in the grub boot venue

14:25.300 --> 14:31.700
So you can simply choose to you know, boot into the point before that upgrade took place

14:31.700 --> 14:37.640
And it really does work. That's what's so great. Is it really works? I it saved my bacon a couple of times during the beta

14:38.180 --> 14:43.240
Fantastic. I'm glad to hear that's working for you. And this this lays the foundations for

14:43.820 --> 14:47.920
more backup restore capabilities that we're going to be building

14:47.920 --> 14:52.840
On top of that as we work towards 2204 wire guard

14:52.840 --> 14:59.300
obviously it has been back ported to the 5.4 kernel in 2004, but you were mentioning on the pre pre show that

15:00.320 --> 15:06.300
1804 users if they're sticking with 1804 eventually, they're gonna get wire guard back ported as well. That's right. So

15:06.800 --> 15:11.960
As you'll be familiar we do point releases for the LTS is and the next

15:12.600 --> 15:15.760
1804 point release will have another or a newer

15:15.760 --> 15:21.640
Hardware enablement stack which will include effectively. What is the 5.4 kernel from

15:22.080 --> 15:26.400
2004 and therefore by way of that you will get wire guard in

15:27.480 --> 15:31.900
1804 so for those people that are wanting to use 1804 for the long term

15:31.900 --> 15:36.720
Then you'll soon have wire guard built straight into the kernel. No DKMS modules

15:36.840 --> 15:44.560
In fact, that's an interesting point because we're not using DKMS modules for things like wire guard or the Nvidia drivers even these days

15:44.560 --> 15:46.560
So the Nvidia drivers are

15:47.200 --> 15:53.400
Distributors late-linked binaries that are signed so you can leave secure boot enabled

15:53.920 --> 15:57.480
Without you know, even with Nvidia drivers and wire guard turned on

15:57.480 --> 16:01.520
Oh, it's just so nice every time you update, you know not having to worry about DKMS

16:01.600 --> 16:06.760
The one disappointing part there is now what am I gonna do to you know, pressure people to move on to 1804

16:06.760 --> 16:08.760
I can't hold wire guard over their head

16:08.760 --> 16:15.640
Yeah, this is that Gnome 3.6 goodness. Gnome 3.6. Well any other spots you wanted to mention or bits of attention?

16:15.640 --> 16:18.920
You wanted to shine a light on that's a pretty good list. The thing that I

16:19.760 --> 16:26.160
Love above all other things about this release is the Yuru theme. It was

16:27.040 --> 16:31.240
Absolutely fantastic getting together with the the four guys

16:31.800 --> 16:34.040
Who are the sort of the core Yuru team?

16:34.040 --> 16:39.880
we had them in the canonical offices in London in January and we had members of the

16:40.080 --> 16:46.180
Ubuntu design team and desktop team and then hangers-on like me and poppy, you know cheering from the sidelines

16:46.840 --> 16:49.120
and we had this week-long sprint and

16:49.920 --> 16:56.280
completely changed the face of Ubuntu for this LTS and I have to say I'm very proud of

16:56.720 --> 17:01.220
Their accomplishments and I love the new bold look

17:01.220 --> 17:07.700
Even though it's unmistakably Ubuntu. It's it's you know, quite a change of direction. I absolutely love it

17:07.700 --> 17:14.380
I think it's my favorite default theme so far and we were having a conversation in the Jupiter broadcasting telegram group

17:15.020 --> 17:18.380
That a lot of us are loading it on other distros, too

17:18.380 --> 17:21.540
and it is fairly straightforward to do that and it just looks so great and

17:21.820 --> 17:28.540
I like the combination with the appearance setting in gnome settings where I can just go and it's one click and everything's dark

17:28.540 --> 17:33.620
And it looks really nice. The reason it's easy to install on other distros is no mistake

17:33.620 --> 17:39.660
that was actually a product of the design sprint based on feedback that we had from

17:40.780 --> 17:46.380
Gwadek and the Linux applications summit, which is there are obviously developers who are using

17:46.900 --> 17:53.220
Distributions that are not Ubuntu and they want to make sure that their applications look correct on

17:53.500 --> 17:57.980
You know other distributions and the criticism is well, I don't use Ubuntu

17:57.980 --> 18:00.980
So how can I check to see if my apps work fine on Ubuntu?

18:00.980 --> 18:05.980
So we've made sure that the Yuru theme is packaged and available everywhere

18:05.980 --> 18:11.300
It needs to be available so you can you know use that theme elsewhere to make sure everything's working, right?

18:11.420 --> 18:17.240
Well, it is great. Congratulations to you the team and of course all the upstream developers it all came together

18:17.460 --> 18:22.220
It's a great LTS. Thank you very much. I shall pass those words on please

18:22.620 --> 18:26.480
Pass on a thank you to whoever is making the Raspberry Pi 4 support

18:26.480 --> 18:28.480
so rocking awesome because

18:28.940 --> 18:30.380
I've been running

18:30.380 --> 18:34.700
2004 on my Raspberry Pi for a couple of weeks since before release upgraded right?

18:34.700 --> 18:40.980
No problem to the final version now and because of the version of kernel that's on 2004

18:40.980 --> 18:46.700
I can boot now from USB devices and my Raspberry Pi 4 feels like a real computer and

18:46.820 --> 18:51.460
I'm running an LTS on there at the same time and it's a distribution that I understand and trust

18:51.500 --> 18:53.900
I'm going all-in. I think I'm even gonna enroll them in landscape

18:53.900 --> 19:00.700
So that way I can just basically manage them without having to really think about it. That'd be a solid idea really Dave Jones

19:01.140 --> 19:04.980
Who has been in and around the Raspberry Pi community for years?

19:05.580 --> 19:11.300
Was hired by canonical about 18 months ago, and he's been leading that effort to really

19:11.900 --> 19:18.500
Deliver a first-class experience on the Raspberry Pi and I'm delighted to say we're in the middle of our product strategy planning sprint

19:18.820 --> 19:20.940
For this, you know this week for what will become

19:20.940 --> 19:24.340
2010 which is going to be the groovy gorilla and

19:25.620 --> 19:27.580
We had our talk about

19:27.580 --> 19:31.220
Raspberry Pi and I'm looking forward to everything to come in 2010

19:31.900 --> 19:38.540
For Raspberry Pi users. Oh, man, you're gonna get me upgrading now on my pie. Jeez Louise. Well, it's a good problem to have

19:38.700 --> 19:45.020
Well, great. Thank you for coming on and and covering some of that stuff and I hope you get some downtime now

19:45.020 --> 19:50.380
I hope you're gonna be able to catch your breath soon. Yeah, I'm gonna hang up my boots for a week and you know

19:50.380 --> 19:56.180
Go and sit in the garden and drink some champagne. Maybe well-deserved before we go

19:56.180 --> 20:01.380
Mini Mac has one question for you, and I'm kind of interested to hear it. So go ahead Mini Mac. Let's get that in

20:01.420 --> 20:05.700
Yeah, thank you. Wimpy on my 1804 Ubuntu box

20:05.700 --> 20:11.100
I have signed into the canonical life patch service to get the kernel patches live patched in

20:11.220 --> 20:15.300
But from time to time I had to reboot now I read that you did some work on that

20:15.300 --> 20:17.300
Can you be a little bit more specific on that?

20:17.300 --> 20:23.460
So livepatch is actually built on an upstream kernel implementation. So it's not our own thing

20:23.660 --> 20:29.780
It's just leveraging what's upstream and all we've done is contribute to that upstream effort to improve it

20:29.780 --> 20:35.900
But yes, livepatch is available in you know, limited numbers. I think it's like three or five machines

20:35.900 --> 20:38.220
I think if you're an Ubuntu member

20:38.220 --> 20:43.620
It's for 50 machines an Ubuntu member being somebody who is in the Ubuntu community

20:43.620 --> 20:49.260
And has been recognized as somebody making a sustained commitment to the Ubuntu project

20:49.620 --> 20:54.060
Then you get 50 activations. So, you know you all your home servers and your laptops

20:54.660 --> 20:57.960
But it's basically like high and critical

20:58.740 --> 21:05.900
CVEs in the kernel that you will get patched via livepatch where you don't require a reboot in order for them to take

21:06.220 --> 21:10.460
How lucky are we to have both Wimpy and and Matt here today incredible Matt?

21:10.460 --> 21:15.780
Congratulations on the announcement that there were soon will be ThinkPads shipping with Fedora

21:15.780 --> 21:22.180
This is huge and people have been talking about it since the moment this announcement landed and it looks like we're getting several models

21:22.180 --> 21:28.700
Off the bat. Yeah, what the ThinkPad p1 p53 and x1. Oh, yeah the x1. Yes

21:28.700 --> 21:34.580
Yes, now I think this isn't too surprising if everyone listening remembers

21:34.580 --> 21:40.620
Not too long ago. We announced that Lenovo was joining the Linux vendor firmware service

21:40.620 --> 21:45.220
And I think a lot of us went well, I know there's a lot of Linux users that use them already

21:45.220 --> 21:49.420
But I wonder if this is going somewhere bigger and I think maybe we're here

21:49.420 --> 21:54.660
So this is a big moment for the project Matt and it's fantastic that it's ThinkPads from Lenovo

21:54.660 --> 21:59.140
I am super super excited and Lenovo has been amazing to work with

21:59.140 --> 22:05.020
They're really interested in doing things the open source way being part of the community not, you know

22:05.020 --> 22:08.220
Not stepping on things and they really were interested in shipping

22:08.220 --> 22:11.500
Yeah, the stock Fedora image without any modifications

22:11.500 --> 22:16.740
Which is very exciting for us as well because we obviously work so hard to make that image good

22:16.780 --> 22:22.900
Talk to me about their comfort level with the cadence of Fedora because it sounds like maybe that that stock image aspect of it would

22:22.900 --> 22:27.540
Make it maybe fairly straightforward to just keep current on whatever the latest

22:27.540 --> 22:31.580
So in 33 ships, for example, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what they're planning to do

22:31.580 --> 22:35.100
They're already on a six-month cadence for Windows updates

22:35.100 --> 22:41.580
So it's basically the same thing with all of their processes. So they were not really concerned with that at all

22:41.820 --> 22:47.260
I'm surprised to hear that actually that's that's I didn't know they would be on that frequent of a cadence with Windows

22:47.260 --> 22:53.180
But you know, it is the Windows 10 era. Well as we've been talking about right now Red Hat Summit's going on and

22:53.180 --> 22:59.380
Mark P from Lenovo was in the Fedora and Centos community area and he said that right now

23:00.020 --> 23:05.460
They've got these three platforms as a pilot, but he says that if things were say to go well

23:05.860 --> 23:09.740
He could see it expanding to other platforms including desktops

23:10.020 --> 23:13.300
Although I won't say the numbers I talked to them about you know

23:13.300 --> 23:19.460
The number of sales that they want to make to feel like this was a success and it wasn't a crazy number

23:19.460 --> 23:25.740
So I'm very optimistic that they're going to hit those targets and see this as success and we'll see more

23:26.020 --> 23:27.020
Well, let me ask you a question

23:27.020 --> 23:32.460
I mean would it be possible that going forward when Red Hat employees?

23:32.740 --> 23:36.340
Maybe they get hired or it's time to replace their rig and they just get issued a machine

23:36.660 --> 23:41.740
Could it potentially be now one of these could that count towards that sale number? Yeah, I assume so

23:41.740 --> 23:48.920
We've been talking to our IT people about that. We Red Hat already has standardized on Lenovo laptops for their models

23:48.920 --> 23:53.580
So we are going to be ordering these particular SKUs in the future

23:54.140 --> 23:57.620
There may need to be some other models because like you said there are

23:58.020 --> 24:03.420
These three select models and there may be use cases that Red Hat has that doesn't fit those SKUs

24:03.420 --> 24:05.420
So we may order some other ones as well

24:05.420 --> 24:12.540
But yeah that that should be it and I guess they have some other large customers that were interested in Fedora

24:12.540 --> 24:19.220
It's where they're gonna demand for this came from their side that I hopefully will fill out a lot more of them as well

24:19.220 --> 24:24.820
But of course all of you and all of your listeners, you know, please help out next time you have a laptop to buy

24:26.460 --> 24:29.300
This is definitely a choice that you can make that will help

24:29.380 --> 24:29.900
Yeah

24:29.900 --> 24:30.300
I mean

24:30.300 --> 24:34.640
I think a lot of people have been waiting for a long time for current ThinkPads that would just be preloaded with Linux and there's

24:34.640 --> 24:36.660
Been various ways to get them over the years

24:36.660 --> 24:43.220
But the nice thing about the sort of focus channel approach is that it's much easier for people who are kind of just in that

24:43.220 --> 24:46.340
Shopping mode to kind of identify what they're getting, you know

24:46.340 --> 24:51.580
I've noted for years now and that's pretty impressive to be able to actually meet that but for years

24:51.580 --> 24:56.260
I've noted that the upgrade cycles on Fedora have been very painless. In fact, I

24:56.900 --> 24:58.540
think I had a machine that

24:58.540 --> 25:02.020
Had been upgrading from 22 and I brought it all the way up to 31

25:02.380 --> 25:05.700
Before I finally gave up and said alright, it's working. I don't need to keep trying this

25:05.700 --> 25:11.460
Do you think that has started to set in in the user base of Linux are people starting to get that that?

25:11.620 --> 25:15.940
That you don't necessarily have to have a long-term support. You don't necessarily have to have rolling

25:15.940 --> 25:20.100
There's a spot right here in the middle. I hope so. We've been focusing on that for a while

25:20.100 --> 25:24.980
We're kind of going to give the give the benefits of the newer software that people get with the rolling release

25:25.140 --> 25:26.580
but with a little more

25:26.580 --> 25:33.420
predictability and the ability for us to do solid QA on it to make sure that each release is something that we feel proud to

25:33.420 --> 25:38.420
Put our name on right, you know, I had a couple people tell me. Oh, I upgraded over lunch

25:39.780 --> 25:43.100
Think it's kind of a sweet spot and I think we're doing a good job of hitting it

25:43.540 --> 25:48.960
That along with having our actual release cycles be more predictable and making sure that you know

25:49.020 --> 25:54.300
We can have the the Mother's Day Halloween releases every year and you can basically

25:54.340 --> 26:00.000
You know plan around that happening and it's such a kind of a different world now for software availability

26:00.000 --> 26:04.940
Availability both from from video driver standpoint for both AMD and video and Intel

26:05.120 --> 26:06.840
but also just from a lot of the

26:06.840 --> 26:13.480
applications where you use these universal package formats and they just sort of stick around and work just between upgrades so it also kind of

26:14.080 --> 26:19.560
Abstracts that layer out. Alright, so I I gotta go back to the laptop and I got to ask a question that I think everybody listening

26:19.560 --> 26:25.860
Is wondering do you have any insight on when these things are actually going to be able to be purchased?

26:25.860 --> 26:32.780
Well, as I said on reddit, I know but I can't tell you and it's not because of lawyers

26:32.780 --> 26:39.200
It's because of the marketing people who would like to have their big splash and I would not like to ruin that sure

26:39.200 --> 26:43.820
And there's always there's some last things that they're going through to make sure all their regulatory

26:44.100 --> 26:48.740
Compliance and everything is all signed off on and so it's possible there'll be delays or something

26:48.740 --> 26:51.540
So I don't want to promise a date that isn't doesn't come true

26:51.540 --> 26:56.960
But it really shouldn't be that long now sounds reasonable sounds like we don't have to wait too much longer

26:56.960 --> 27:00.800
And there'll be news on it in the near future. It sounds like yeah, exactly

27:00.800 --> 27:05.180
I bet this is great news, you know made me think of folks who maybe not don't have a lot of laptop choice

27:05.180 --> 27:09.920
They're working for a larger IT organization and that organization wants to see this support from the manufacturer

27:09.920 --> 27:13.160
So sure you could get a bunch of on Dell's but now there's a whole new world of options

27:13.160 --> 27:15.720
Yeah, I know definitely when we joined Linux Academy, you know

27:15.720 --> 27:20.760
They were looking at just a couple laptop options like system 76 and the XPS 13

27:20.760 --> 27:24.720
Because if they were gonna if they were going to issue Linux laptops to employees

27:24.880 --> 27:28.280
They wanted it to be supported by the OEM exactly

27:28.280 --> 27:32.560
even if it meant that IT actually provides all of the support it just from almost like a

27:33.080 --> 27:37.480
Not a due diligence standpoint, but from like a responsibility of purchasing if you're gonna spend

27:38.200 --> 27:44.560
$1,800 to two grand on a machine you want it to be a supported configuration and have someone to yell at if it doesn't work

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
That's always nice

27:46.800 --> 27:51.560
A lot of these laptops I someone on hacker news. Their first complaint was well

27:51.560 --> 27:55.360
I was promised they'd have Ubuntu available and I can't buy it

27:56.000 --> 27:57.980
and the fact is

27:57.980 --> 28:05.040
Lenovo does ship Ubuntu and certified rail configurations on a number of their workstation class systems already

28:05.280 --> 28:09.840
But they're not available to you unless you go through a very complicated

28:10.040 --> 28:13.400
Channel process and are buying a whole bunch of them and you know

28:13.400 --> 28:19.600
There's a lot of paperwork involved. And so this is very exciting because this will just be like when you go to buy one of these

28:19.600 --> 28:23.000
Laptops, it'll be a drop down in the OS configurator

28:23.000 --> 28:28.520
You'll be able to you know pick through our workstation right next to whatever version of Windows you could choose instead

28:28.520 --> 28:31.400
I mean, I'm sure it's still having some scuttlebutt in discussion

28:31.400 --> 28:36.660
But I think if Red Hat summit was in person right now and this news had just dropped it would be

28:36.840 --> 28:41.380
One of the points of conversation amongst the attendees is this is this deal?

28:41.380 --> 28:45.900
Yeah, we were hoping to have the Lenovo people there at the fedora booth with us

28:46.340 --> 28:52.420
Obviously, I think the whole news cycles been just kind of disrupted and even your Red Hat summit not just going virtual

28:52.420 --> 28:57.900
But it's kind of the tone of announcements and news and press. It's like this is not the time

28:57.980 --> 29:03.420
So things are a lot more subdued. Yeah, on the other hand we had this in the works and we weren't gonna hide it

29:03.420 --> 29:07.340
So I think people have noticed though. I think at least in our circles people have noticed

29:07.340 --> 29:10.420
It's been getting a lot of conversation in our community channels

29:10.420 --> 29:15.500
I think job done is probably not the perfect time to make that kind of announcement, but I think you got pretty close

29:15.500 --> 29:20.260
Well, thank you Matt stick around we're gonna talk about fedora 32 here in a little bit. But first

29:22.100 --> 29:24.500
Little housekeeping to do is as we do

29:25.060 --> 29:29.660
If you know that we're doing this live, but you don't know when did you know that we have a solution West?

29:29.940 --> 29:34.580
Did you do thanks to the magic of the Internet? Yeah, this is something that was brand new

29:34.580 --> 29:37.940
So I don't blame you for never knowing about it. We've never mentioned it before on the show ever

29:37.940 --> 29:44.220
It's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar. Oh wait, what was that? Oh, hold on West

29:44.220 --> 29:48.180
I'm getting I'm getting a note here from the been there for almost eight years. Oh, yeah

29:48.180 --> 29:53.780
Well Jupiter broadcast and maybe I I probably I probably don't need to mention it Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

29:53.780 --> 29:59.800
I just realized how fast I say that Jupiter broadcasting comm Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

30:00.260 --> 30:02.260
Calendar. Yeah, there you go

30:02.260 --> 30:08.700
RSS feed for this show is that Linux unplug comm slash subscribe where you can get the feeds and put it in any pod catcher

30:08.700 --> 30:16.420
You'll like if you'd like to join us in the telegram community. It's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash telegram and please do yes

30:16.420 --> 30:22.460
And if you are an ACG subscriber a cloud guru has launched the cloud playgrounds for business customers

30:23.060 --> 30:25.940
In the in the biz that term is called B to B

30:26.380 --> 30:30.500
B to C is business to customer and B to B is business to business

30:30.500 --> 30:34.660
The more you know, yeah, well you think about it you get into a place you need to skill up

30:34.660 --> 30:38.940
It's actually a very very handy thing. Yeah, having good, you know training right there available from your employer

30:38.940 --> 30:40.940
Hey hard to beat I am

30:41.340 --> 30:44.220
Thrilled to say that we had another luck log on Sunday

30:44.580 --> 30:48.800
Wes and I made it and cheesy was there and a whole bunch of folks in the mumble room were there

30:49.100 --> 30:51.760
Neil was neck deep in a v-bolt and

30:52.780 --> 30:54.100
instance and

30:54.100 --> 30:58.260
Just ready to go and we talked about as the pine devices a little bit

30:58.260 --> 31:01.460
We really got into some really cool his history stuff, too

31:01.460 --> 31:04.740
We were really kind of talking about old Linux and just a great chat

31:04.740 --> 31:08.580
I hung out for a couple hours then I don't know how long did anybody know how long it went after I left

31:08.700 --> 31:13.880
About three hours after you left. Yeah, so that's fantastic. It's noon Pacific

31:14.400 --> 31:17.580
Which is the same time we do this show on Tuesdays?

31:17.580 --> 31:21.180
So we just take the Tuesday time and we put it on a Sunday. You see what we did there

31:21.180 --> 31:25.260
It's very clever wasn't my idea keep it simple because otherwise I don't think you would remember when to show up

31:25.260 --> 31:27.340
No, and you know what's weird about it is

31:27.340 --> 31:28.540
the

31:28.540 --> 31:32.620
Timing because that was when I recorded land on Sundays

31:32.620 --> 31:36.060
And then the weekend that I would have been doing land

31:36.060 --> 31:40.740
But I no longer had land the mumble was meeting and it was like, I don't know

31:40.740 --> 31:43.900
I just like step from one to the other it was really deep your groove and now you got more community

31:43.900 --> 31:44.780
Yeah, it's pretty great

31:44.780 --> 31:49.900
And so we hang out and I turn on the loudspeaker so my wife can listen in too and and have a chuckle

31:49.900 --> 31:56.580
I'm sure Sheila it was pretty great. So if you want to join us, there's an IRC room

31:56.580 --> 32:02.100
It's IRC geek shed net pound lup lug and then we just hang out on our mumble room

32:02.100 --> 32:06.380
Which it's kind of great because it gives you maybe a chance to try out mumble

32:06.500 --> 32:10.900
Try out your mic before Tuesdays and then you got everything set up. You could just join us the same spot

32:10.900 --> 32:14.780
Yeah, low-pressure fun casual hangout. Yeah, it's pretty great. We'd love to see you. So

32:15.340 --> 32:17.220
Join us on Sundays

32:17.220 --> 32:20.500
Love plug actually went all the way to 10 p.m. Pacific

32:21.900 --> 32:24.220
Holy, so just spend your whole Sunday there

32:24.900 --> 32:27.300
Grab a pizza grab a couple of beverages

32:28.540 --> 32:30.540
Put your feet up

32:31.300 --> 32:34.700
All right, well today fedora 32 is

32:36.020 --> 32:40.040
Officially released you may recall a few episodes ago episode

32:40.580 --> 32:44.260
Dig a D. I put it lower down in the dog. He did 348

32:44.260 --> 32:49.340
348 that was a really fun episode. So Linux unplug calm slash 348

32:49.500 --> 32:53.340
we we took one of the big features of

32:53.780 --> 32:58.660
fedora 32 and just sort of zoomed in on that and that is the early out of memory killer and

32:59.140 --> 33:05.580
It's fascinating the difference it makes so check that out because that's a big part of what makes fedora 32 on the desktop experience

33:05.580 --> 33:11.340
A little bit different but along with that is your standard updates to things like gnome

33:11.340 --> 33:15.740
You have gnome 3.36 in here, which includes that new

33:16.380 --> 33:17.460
beautiful

33:17.460 --> 33:19.460
beautiful login and

33:19.580 --> 33:24.700
Unlock screen. I mean, I've been using it for a while, but every time I like wake my computer up. It's just a treat

33:24.700 --> 33:30.140
That's just such a great example. Like wimpy was intimating earlier that work was started in 2017

33:30.780 --> 33:35.060
At a hack fest in London and now it's landed here in 2020

33:35.260 --> 33:39.140
It's a special thing that is you got it. You got to actually use it to see it

33:39.140 --> 33:43.300
It feels beautiful full stop. Yeah, it really it feels elegant

33:43.580 --> 33:47.500
So along with early out of memory manager enabled by default

33:47.820 --> 33:54.140
which helps improve the desktop experience and then the fixes that have landed in gnome 3.36 that have helped improve

33:54.980 --> 33:56.780
experience in

33:56.780 --> 34:02.180
IO load so that's something that a lot of work went into with this release of gnome where these bug fixes landed is

34:02.180 --> 34:08.740
rooting out what caused gnome shell to stall during heavy IO load situations and

34:09.020 --> 34:11.020
tons of those fixes have landed

34:11.460 --> 34:15.580
Fedora 32 sort of doubles down on that by including that early out of memory killer

34:15.580 --> 34:20.220
but also by doing things like enabling trim by default on the SSDs and

34:21.820 --> 34:28.420
Twitching firewall D defaults to using NF tables fedora. You're so modern. So tell us about this West

34:28.420 --> 34:33.100
This is kind of a neat little trick. Yeah, I mean NF tables has been around since 2013

34:33.100 --> 34:37.740
I think and that's been a long time. But as usual no major distros

34:37.740 --> 34:40.900
I've gotten around to really adopting it or adding it in places. Sure. You could use it yourself

34:40.900 --> 34:42.940
It's been in the kernel and really that's sort of what you know

34:42.940 --> 34:49.140
Folks upstream in the kernel have been working on been in the kernel since kernel 3.13

34:51.420 --> 34:56.620
That's how long it feels like a long time ago, but you know, nobody's used it. Like you said

34:56.620 --> 35:03.060
So this is this is kind of I guess the quote-unquote new packet filtering engine if you could call it that

35:03.980 --> 35:07.700
But why why well as always when you upgrade things you just get you know

35:08.060 --> 35:10.060
Get rid of some of the cruft from the past

35:10.100 --> 35:15.260
There's a lot of code duplication and inconsistencies in the current IP tables world in particular

35:15.260 --> 35:20.220
there's a lot of protocol specific extensions that are hacked in there to make it work for an individual protocol and

35:20.660 --> 35:24.060
Nothing that would let you match on packet fields or do that in a more elegant way

35:24.060 --> 35:27.540
So instead of having to add in all this custom work, that's just handled for you

35:27.540 --> 35:30.500
There's also a lot better handling if you've got a dual stack set up

35:30.500 --> 35:33.060
So IP v4 and IP v6 at the same time

35:33.100 --> 35:37.300
If anyone's used IP tables for that and had to use both IP tables and IP 6 tables

35:37.420 --> 35:41.180
It's just kind of a confusing mess and that's a lot better handled in NF tables

35:41.260 --> 35:47.820
That's nice and something that I haven't yet played with but seems like one of those things would be worth just dorking around with

35:47.820 --> 35:55.500
There's also the adoption of sysusers.d format, which I also don't really quite understand or even really appreciate what this is

35:55.540 --> 36:00.420
Can you help me understand this one? Well, so if you think about it, a lot of packages are out there installing users, right?

36:00.420 --> 36:02.380
Yeah, but that's not always super introspectable

36:02.380 --> 36:03.700
Especially if it's just in some you know

36:03.700 --> 36:07.700
Like post install script where they run the actual commands just install the user

36:08.140 --> 36:15.820
So this change uses the sysusers.d format add some hooks into the packaging system so that you can do this in a declarative way

36:15.820 --> 36:18.660
And there's kind of a theme and a lot of these changes around being more declarative

36:18.660 --> 36:22.140
So yeah, you just look at the packaging and see like oh it needs this user

36:22.140 --> 36:25.220
And then you'll know that that'll actually get handled in the right way

36:25.220 --> 36:32.260
So instead of like hashing together some sort of bash script that like checks to see if that you ID and G ID exist and all

36:32.260 --> 36:38.860
Of that it's just sort of like a handoff to say hey OS. I want this thing done. Yeah, exactly

36:39.420 --> 36:44.220
There's also maybe some changes in the future to integrate with system D sysusers now that's not happening now

36:44.220 --> 36:47.980
But this change makes a future switch like that easier. You can just stub it out

36:47.980 --> 36:51.860
There's other small tweaks like DNF getting a little bit faster at counting a few things

36:51.860 --> 36:55.100
Although I think we're about to realize the benefits of that in the next release

36:55.620 --> 36:59.740
Also the ability to restart services at the end of an RPM transaction has been changed

36:59.740 --> 37:03.100
So that's another one of those declarative changes where yeah, you could do that yourself

37:03.100 --> 37:07.020
But you might have complicated dependencies between different services and you need to get that right

37:07.020 --> 37:09.500
So now again, you can see what needs to be restarted

37:09.500 --> 37:14.540
You can register that with the package system so that all those things get started at once and you avoid some of those nasty race

37:14.540 --> 37:17.340
Conditions. This is what I love about a fedora release is

37:17.980 --> 37:21.940
On the surface. It's like oh, it's it's a new gnome shell. Okay, right

37:21.940 --> 37:25.220
but when you actually go below the surface and

37:26.020 --> 37:27.540
You see what they're doing here

37:27.540 --> 37:34.020
You see like there's so much stuff that we've been talking about for months now that is landing like kernel 5 6 which has wire guard

37:34.580 --> 37:36.420
Python 3.8

37:36.420 --> 37:38.660
LLVM 10 but also

37:38.660 --> 37:41.560
GCC 10 which is a big deal and

37:42.380 --> 37:43.700
system D

37:43.700 --> 37:47.740
245 so the big deal about system D 245 version

37:48.140 --> 37:54.540
245 if you can believe that is the first release that includes the new system D home D stuff. Oh

37:55.380 --> 37:59.460
Change in the world once again, nothing's really being done with it at this time, but it's there now

37:59.460 --> 38:04.100
Yeah, you've got home CTL right on your command line already after you install you can start setting things up

38:04.100 --> 38:07.260
I tried it a little bit and didn't quite get it working before the show

38:07.260 --> 38:12.500
But I've also never used it before and it will definitely be something I'm playing with. I just seems that seems like a big deal

38:12.500 --> 38:13.580
I don't know. That's like a big one

38:13.580 --> 38:18.020
And then the other thing that we've been watching for what feels like a hundred years

38:18.020 --> 38:22.440
But has seen some significant improvements in this release is pipe wire

38:22.940 --> 38:28.900
Some early work on I'm kind of making pipe wire sort of fit and finish stuff is now getting laid down

38:28.900 --> 38:32.540
but more importantly this release they say has

38:32.540 --> 38:40.460
Basically full-on jack compatibility and full jack support. So now pipe wire can fully integrate with jack on both ends and

38:41.700 --> 38:44.540
They did something I can't remember because I just read this this morning

38:44.540 --> 38:47.700
But essentially they've changed the way they do like a direct frame buffer copy

38:47.940 --> 38:54.100
For for streaming the desktop and they've made it much more efficient now to like capture the desktop and put that into a video stream

38:54.100 --> 38:57.020
And send that to an application. That's how to rework as well

38:57.020 --> 39:01.740
Oh darn sounds like we're gonna have to reinstall the studio after the show. Yeah, right

39:01.740 --> 39:08.540
Right, right. Hey also retiring Python 2. Uh-huh. That's another sign of those changes where they it has to happen

39:08.540 --> 39:11.300
It's been a long time fedora isn't afraid to push ahead

39:11.380 --> 39:16.820
There's some performance benchmarks if you like those kinds of things that we have linked in the show notes. Michael arable did the whole

39:17.540 --> 39:21.260
fedora 32 versus 2004 with versus

39:22.060 --> 39:28.860
x11 versus Wayland on and then also one that I always love is the cross desktop benchmarks

39:28.860 --> 39:31.940
right gnome shell versus LX see versus

39:32.660 --> 39:34.220
Plasma and all the others

39:34.220 --> 39:37.580
That's all linked in there essentially the takeaway is it depends?

39:38.740 --> 39:42.580
Which is what always happens with these reviews on like all these sort of similar releases

39:42.580 --> 39:45.860
You know as I've been playing with the beta up till you know up till the release today

39:45.860 --> 39:50.700
I will say if it order 32 has been a dream to virtualize even just you know using Wayland

39:51.140 --> 39:54.560
No issues whatsoever. I kind of forgot I was using it in a virtual machine for a while

39:54.560 --> 39:59.980
So I put this on the limo pro from system 76 it feels so wicked

40:00.440 --> 40:05.480
Fast that it's been one of those where like I show it to people. I'm like try this try this

40:06.160 --> 40:12.880
both 2004 and fedora 32 part of the boot experience now is so smooth because they're using the OEM

40:13.520 --> 40:17.320
UEFI load yeah, right exactly hands-off from the bootloader very nicely and so

40:17.920 --> 40:21.200
It boots about as long as it used to take a PC to just post

40:21.200 --> 40:26.320
That's literally how long it takes a little more pro with fedora 32 to boot like wouldn't you know when you beep and then you?

40:26.320 --> 40:30.440
Get a memory count and then it would flip over to the next screen and it's all your PCI devices

40:30.440 --> 40:33.760
And then you would go to your bootloader, and then your OS boots

40:34.280 --> 40:41.040
With this it's it's vendor logo, then there's a flash of the vendor logo, and then there's a flash in your on

40:41.040 --> 40:43.720
It's not even really a flash. It's more of a transition and you're at GDM

40:43.720 --> 40:47.900
I mean you almost can't tell like was this just hibernated or suspended or did I do a full boot yeah?

40:47.900 --> 40:52.240
I'd say it's it's just a few shakes slower than waking from sleep if sleep

40:52.340 --> 40:56.620
Waking wasn't so dang fast now like if it was like what used to be back when you stuff of like a disk spin up

40:56.620 --> 41:02.560
Or something yeah, it's really really fast, and it's smooth the the theme is

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
clean very clean and

41:05.560 --> 41:11.520
The gnome experience is also very clean because there's not a lot of tweaks some of the things I got to admit

41:11.520 --> 41:16.320
I do like that canonical tweaks is like the appearance tab. I've learned to kind of like my

41:16.320 --> 41:18.960
Favorites to a dock thing so there's just extensions

41:18.960 --> 41:23.200
I go turn on but it's even easier to manage that now because there's a dedicated extensions app

41:23.200 --> 41:25.520
That's like officially upstream supported

41:25.520 --> 41:30.320
And so it's even easier now to manage your extensions and toggle ones that aren't working and toggle them on and off

41:30.320 --> 41:34.400
And I love all that right. I don't know about you, but it's great experience

41:34.400 --> 41:39.540
I had on 2004 I think fedora 32 is feeling faster the performance does seem a little bit a little bit

41:40.040 --> 41:43.160
It's been super snappy. I did a clean install last night

41:43.160 --> 41:46.640
of the ISO image and it was

41:47.160 --> 41:53.300
Within seconds I had everything up-to-date the the software experience is really smooth for installing both firmware packages

41:53.300 --> 41:58.920
But also the OS upgrades no kidding and then that you know that nice little pop-up asking if you want to

41:59.200 --> 42:05.400
Turn on third-party repos is clean and just simple if you'd show me this like even let's say three three years ago

42:05.400 --> 42:11.420
I don't know. I would believe it was desktop Linux. It really is pretty great. So what was the bacon take well?

42:11.420 --> 42:16.960
I mean there were a few things again. I just looked at it with my bacon eyes. I suppose you're cheesy bacon eyes

42:16.960 --> 42:23.980
I do like the wallpapers that they've put in there's some some pretty stylish ones that they've created for themselves

42:24.560 --> 42:30.400
Especially the 3d printed one because I'm a nerd like that and I've been 3d printing everything as of late

42:30.400 --> 42:33.320
I thought you might like that one and honestly it just looks really sharp

42:33.320 --> 42:38.840
You know the nice depth of field in there exactly exactly and so that's my default wallpaper at the moment

42:38.840 --> 42:43.680
And one thing that I really liked about your first initial

42:44.600 --> 42:51.480
Impression of fedora was the fact that especially for new users you have the the help comes up right there

42:51.680 --> 42:56.200
But they've also added these nice little video clips just to show you how to navigate

42:57.320 --> 43:00.800
The genome system itself. So how to switch workspaces

43:01.680 --> 43:06.520
How to quickly open up the applications menu and I think that those are nice little touches

43:06.520 --> 43:10.320
especially for someone that you know might be getting a

43:11.000 --> 43:12.760
Lenovo

43:12.760 --> 43:17.520
Laptop preloaded with fedora and have never used Linux before so this might you know

43:17.520 --> 43:22.780
Really help those types of users out and I thought another really interesting feature was

43:23.240 --> 43:25.240
Once you initially installed the system

43:25.440 --> 43:31.360
The updates were done in the background for you on that first boot and then applied for you on the reboot

43:31.360 --> 43:34.280
So similar to how you would have a progress bar

43:34.280 --> 43:39.400
With Windows or Mac OS or something like that letting you know that updates are being installed

43:39.880 --> 43:43.480
I thought that that was a really clean way to handle that initial

43:44.000 --> 43:47.440
First boot and I think that kind of goes back to you know

43:47.440 --> 43:53.880
These additional little features like the videos and helping new users kind of get a feel for it and understand the system

43:54.280 --> 43:56.280
There were a couple of dislikes

43:56.640 --> 44:02.120
You know things that I think could be worked on. I think the partitioning is still a little awkward

44:02.120 --> 44:04.600
Especially if you are a new user and you're coming over

44:05.080 --> 44:10.280
It's it's definitely not as clean in my opinion as say Ubuntu is on

44:10.840 --> 44:16.840
Partitioning and knowing what you're going to do a couple of things like telegram wasn't available for me in the default store

44:17.520 --> 44:19.840
So I had to go to flat hub and pull that down

44:20.320 --> 44:23.520
you know, you guys would probably know more about this, but I

44:24.280 --> 44:28.840
Don't know if flat hub is integrated into the software store

44:28.840 --> 44:33.040
The software store. Well when you go to flat hub and you do the quick setup

44:33.760 --> 44:38.960
After that point it will be it's just added as one of the repositories flat pack itself is pre-installed. Yes

44:39.040 --> 44:44.880
Yeah, just a flat hub repo is not added. But thankfully it's like a one-line command. You don't even have to pseudo for it

44:45.880 --> 44:49.260
Again fractional scaling, you know while built in it wasn't in the UI

44:50.120 --> 44:53.600
So not really a big deal for me on my on my test machine

44:53.600 --> 44:59.520
But when I'm pushing, you know something on my 4k monitor, I would like to see that available there

44:59.520 --> 45:05.560
And I thought it was kind of weird that there were two image viewers. So you had photos and then images as well

45:06.480 --> 45:11.040
Photos I assume is a fedora project while images is a gnome project

45:11.040 --> 45:11.320
well

45:11.320 --> 45:18.680
I think it's photos is like to manage and organize a photo library similar to photos on Mac OS and iOS and then

45:18.680 --> 45:25.720
Image viewer or viewer whatever it's called is for like viewing JPEGs in your downloads folder or PDFs and things like that

45:25.720 --> 45:28.720
It doesn't have the same sort of like albums or favorites or that's right

45:28.720 --> 45:31.560
So got you and that's and that's kind of what I thought would be the case, right?

45:31.560 --> 45:34.760
It would be more for managing photos as opposed to images

45:34.760 --> 45:38.760
You know, I noticed that you could crop and rotate and do a couple editing features in there as well

45:39.200 --> 45:46.000
But I didn't take a deep dive into either one of those applications to be honest, but I think overall it's a great release

45:46.000 --> 45:52.400
I mean, I enjoyed it. I liked the the little nuanced features that they added for the new user, you know the theming

45:52.400 --> 45:55.800
I think you know, they've just used the stock gnome theme

45:55.800 --> 46:01.460
I think that's something they could work toward in the future is maybe dialing that in a little bit and and maybe

46:02.280 --> 46:04.280
Enabling the yard routine by default

46:04.960 --> 46:07.560
Careful, you could be touching the third rail there on that one

46:07.560 --> 46:11.280
Do you know how contentious that whole thing thing gets I think all of us

46:11.280 --> 46:18.200
Are looking forward to maybe I'll bring Madden on this point is I believe in the next release of fedora

46:18.240 --> 46:23.720
There is going to be a transition for DNF that will improve performance fairly considerably

46:23.720 --> 46:28.160
Is that did I read that right Matt that that's being worked on for the next release. They're working on it

46:28.160 --> 46:31.840
I don't know how much of it's going to land in the next release because

46:32.740 --> 46:35.220
When you're looking at the update system

46:36.040 --> 46:39.960
It's fairly sensitive. So you want to make sure any changes like that are

46:39.960 --> 46:41.960
safe

46:42.000 --> 46:45.920
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah better to take it slow and steady with that

46:45.920 --> 46:51.060
so I was sitting here thinking fedora in a very special way represents the

46:51.480 --> 46:56.940
collective works of so many upstream projects some of which Red Hat incubates and others outside of that and I

46:57.360 --> 47:03.920
Wonder if you've noticed something that has stood out to Wes and I Matt and that is as we dug into this for research for the show

47:03.920 --> 47:09.740
We realized there was significantly more in this release than what is in the written press right now

47:09.740 --> 47:13.520
Not to like take away from what they've done because it's great that it's getting coverage

47:14.040 --> 47:19.600
but it seems like fedora has a bit and I hate to be cliche, but it has a bit of an iceberg scenario where

47:20.040 --> 47:27.040
Some of the big features like the new desktop release or out-of-memory killer or some package transition those are visible

47:27.040 --> 47:28.960
But then below the surface

47:28.960 --> 47:34.520
there's so many more things about this release of fedora that we didn't realize and still we started doing our research and I wonder if

47:34.520 --> 47:39.640
You feel like that stuff isn't properly getting exposure if you've noticed this too. Oh, yeah

47:39.640 --> 47:43.580
absolutely, and there are thousands of packages in fedora with a

47:44.080 --> 47:46.080
huge rate of change and

47:46.240 --> 47:53.080
We used to a couple years ago have a couple people on our docs team who are really dedicated to making sure we had release

47:53.080 --> 47:54.920
notes that had a

47:54.920 --> 48:00.760
Broad coverage of a lot of that change and that's kind of fallen off just as people moved on to other things

48:01.160 --> 48:06.180
It would be awesome to have some people focusing on that again. So that's an area we could use some help

48:06.180 --> 48:11.320
So this is maybe maybe a call to help join the fedora docs team and see what you can do around release notes

48:11.320 --> 48:16.280
It's an easy way to make things better. What a great way to contribute and in the announcements

48:16.280 --> 48:18.280
We kind of you know, try to pick a few highlights

48:18.320 --> 48:21.320
But even there I kind of rely on people to tell me hey

48:21.320 --> 48:27.300
This is an interesting thing I did and then I kind of talk together with our marketing people and a PR people and say okay

48:27.300 --> 48:30.840
What are the things we should kind of put up the front here so that you know

48:30.840 --> 48:32.880
They get get the attention this time around

48:32.880 --> 48:39.940
I try to rotate those things a little bit so it's not always like new version of GCC every time or whatever

48:40.320 --> 48:46.560
Whatever piece of software new GNOME new core OS things so there's a little bit of different attention

48:46.560 --> 48:50.580
But yeah, there's just there's so much it can't all get the all get the attention

48:50.580 --> 48:54.960
It deserves there really is and you would think you would think I was just it's a small release

48:54.960 --> 48:58.380
But there's so much in there and then there's so many packages that have such

48:58.380 --> 49:03.280
Huge things still changing and we just go along and upgrade and it all just works typically always

49:03.280 --> 49:08.600
I think what we want is the nerd report all the all the nitty-gritty Colonel newbies, but for fedora. Yeah, really that'd be great

49:09.360 --> 49:13.160
Somebody get on that get in contact with Matt. I don't know. I know Maddie

49:13.160 --> 49:16.560
What's the best way for people to get ahold of you if they actually did want to maybe help out with that?

49:16.560 --> 49:18.880
You can join our fedora mailing lists

49:19.240 --> 49:22.680
Matt DM on Twitter Matt DM fedora and read it

49:22.680 --> 49:29.720
Those are probably the best places you can email me. I am generally available IRC. I'm around

49:30.120 --> 49:31.720
Well, I got to say

49:31.720 --> 49:35.800
This release with the improvements to GNOME shell and whatnot feels wicked fast

49:36.240 --> 49:40.120
it really is pretty impressive at being a longtime desktop Linux user and

49:40.840 --> 49:42.840
Seeing this level of improvement

49:43.360 --> 49:47.080
Continually over the years, you know, I think it's something that we take for granted

49:47.160 --> 49:50.680
It could have gone very much the other way it could be getting slower and more and more

49:50.680 --> 49:53.600
Right loaded and we've we've gotten the exact opposite

49:53.600 --> 49:59.160
Is there anything that's in this 32 release that you don't think is getting a lot of attention right now that you want to?

49:59.240 --> 50:02.560
Shed a little light on yeah, a couple of interesting things

50:04.240 --> 50:07.240
One of them is finally the fedora core OS

50:07.240 --> 50:12.720
We are getting to our different streams of having a next and updates and a stable stream and fedora core OS

50:13.280 --> 50:16.380
Which is an important step of making that actually something

50:16.380 --> 50:21.960
I really want to recommend people to use to install their compute clusters and things on top of

50:22.720 --> 50:24.720
another neat thing the

50:25.280 --> 50:31.280
computational neuroscience SIG in fedora special interest group put together a spin of

50:31.920 --> 50:37.680
The desktop you basically install a live CD that has all this neuroscience stuff on it

50:37.960 --> 50:44.800
So that people in the neuroscience community can get their brain imaging and all the software open source software that does that in one nice

50:44.800 --> 50:48.240
easy slick place and I really love this because

50:49.080 --> 50:50.800
You know, obviously that's a niche

50:50.800 --> 50:56.560
But I really want fedora to be a place where people who have niche interests can come and you know

50:56.560 --> 51:03.920
Make a solution for their particular users and groups another one that's in the works. We've had a fedora jam

51:04.560 --> 51:05.480
audio

51:05.480 --> 51:08.000
focused version of fedora for a while and

51:08.000 --> 51:15.400
Someone has picked that up again. And I think especially with the pipewire stuff you're talking about really want to have fedora

51:15.400 --> 51:19.600
Be a premier system for doing audio production. I think that'll be that'll be pretty neat

51:20.840 --> 51:26.840
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I noticed that image. I'm like mental note gonna check that out in a bit. I also noticed a

51:27.640 --> 51:32.800
Gaming ISO what's the gaming image that one hasn't been updated for a little while?

51:32.800 --> 51:36.160
But it's kind of an idea about show sort of showcasing open source games

51:36.160 --> 51:38.200
So it's not so focused on you can you know?

51:38.200 --> 51:43.200
The big news of course now is you know proton and steam on Linux and kind of proprietary games

51:43.200 --> 51:48.120
Yeah, but it is nice to remind ourselves like there's some really great free games, too

51:48.200 --> 51:52.160
Yeah, and that's kind of what that is meant to show off in general

51:52.160 --> 51:57.080
I would love for anybody who has you know, kind of a special interest and thinks that there would be a particular

51:58.240 --> 52:03.560
You know focus they could put on the operating system that would would showcase something for their users

52:03.560 --> 52:07.440
I mean another one I often give as an example is the Python classroom lab

52:07.640 --> 52:12.760
Which is meant to you know for teachers teaching how to program in Python

52:12.760 --> 52:18.480
It's gonna have an environment you can boot into and there you go. Everything's all ready for you that kind of thing

52:18.840 --> 52:24.160
32 just continues this feeling that I've had for I think really since like 28 or 29 and that is

52:24.720 --> 52:29.920
That fedora is such a great DevOps showcase Linux workstation OS

52:29.920 --> 52:32.920
You know like the same thing I felt for 24

52:32.920 --> 52:36.920
It's like we're so fortunate to have all this great work from all these different projects kind of coming together and land yes

52:36.920 --> 52:37.840
and

52:37.840 --> 52:43.120
I think it's pretty cool that you guys went ahead and pulled the trigger on the early out of memory killer stuff too like that's

52:43.120 --> 52:45.120
Something else a lot of people aren't moving on

52:45.320 --> 52:50.920
Were you involved in any of the conversations or they maybe pros and con debates on actually doing something?

52:50.920 --> 52:57.320
That's kind of aggressive like that that one. I watched go by like the conversation was was was going okay

52:57.320 --> 53:05.320
So, you know, there's there sometimes some of these development conversations feel like they are going off the rails or need some intervention

53:05.320 --> 53:08.320
But I think a lot of times the process just kind of works

53:08.320 --> 53:13.320
There was another example of that that I thought was pretty awesome in this distribution

53:13.320 --> 53:19.320
If you're looking through those for Onyx performance results, you'll see that Python in particular is a lot faster

53:19.320 --> 53:23.320
And this is because someone had a suggestion that

53:23.320 --> 53:28.320
Python would be a lot faster if it were compiled statically rather than dynamic linking

53:28.320 --> 53:33.320
For some technical reasons related to Python blah blah blah, which is cool

53:33.320 --> 53:36.320
But there's a lot of downsides to static linking Python

53:36.320 --> 53:42.320
So kind of the community discussing together came up with an idea of a particular compiler flag

53:42.320 --> 53:47.320
Which gives a lot of the benefits with much smaller downsides

53:47.320 --> 53:51.320
You actually can't LD preload things into Python anymore the way we're building it

53:51.320 --> 53:56.320
But as a result, we get like a 20 percent performance increase on Python

53:56.320 --> 54:00.320
Wow, that really does feel like a great developers workstation

54:00.320 --> 54:05.320
I just always notice like Kexec already installed a ton of the tools that I have to install on other distributions

54:05.320 --> 54:06.320
Fedora has them right out of the box

54:06.320 --> 54:11.320
Also, I have to give honorable mention I didn't really do much with it this time around

54:11.320 --> 54:17.320
But Fedora Toolbox, I believe, has been transitioned from like a bash project to a go project

54:17.320 --> 54:19.320
And there's some story around that, too

54:19.320 --> 54:22.320
Well, the bash was always kind of a prototype

54:22.320 --> 54:30.320
And, you know, once as a sysadmin, you know, once your bash scripts gets to be more than, you know, fits in one screen of your text editor

54:30.320 --> 54:33.320
It's probably time for it to stop being a bash script

54:33.320 --> 54:35.320
Oh, I think Wimpy might disagree

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
You should see some of his bash scripts

54:37.320 --> 54:41.320
It had exceeded that by quite a bit in complexity

54:41.320 --> 54:44.320
So it was time for it to move on to something else

54:44.320 --> 54:49.320
And just a lot of the tooling, you know, Podman and container tooling is written in Go

54:49.320 --> 54:52.320
So Go is a natural ecosystem choice for that

54:52.320 --> 54:56.320
We really should make our pick that bash, was that bash top? Is that what it was called?

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
That monstrosity bash script

54:58.320 --> 55:00.320
There's a bonus app pick for everybody

55:00.320 --> 55:02.320
Go check out bash top

55:02.320 --> 55:05.320
Well, yeah, and, you know, Fedora Toolbox is very, very handy

55:05.320 --> 55:07.320
So I've talked about it before on the show

55:07.320 --> 55:12.320
But it's just such a quick way to get like an environment where it feels very much like you're on the same box

55:12.320 --> 55:15.320
You're in the same, you can share resources

55:15.320 --> 55:19.320
But you also are able to play in a way that's isolated from the rest of the operating system

55:19.320 --> 55:22.320
And you can recreate them and spin them up very fast

55:22.320 --> 55:23.320
And I just loved it

55:23.320 --> 55:26.320
But I didn't really give it a go this time around because I got the concept

55:26.320 --> 55:30.320
But I appreciate that the work's continuing and the investment's continuing there

55:30.320 --> 55:35.320
It was designed for running on Core OS and on Silverblue where you have an immutable base OS

55:35.320 --> 55:41.320
On those systems, it's basically vital because you kind of need to have some environment to mess with

55:41.320 --> 55:43.320
So this gives you that

55:43.320 --> 55:47.320
But it's also really useful just on a standard Fedora workstation desktop

55:47.320 --> 55:52.320
To give you kind of that sandbox space where it's safe to mess it up

55:52.320 --> 55:55.320
And then you can destroy it and create a new one or whatever

55:55.320 --> 56:00.320
Well, especially if you're a bozo like me who's installing 30 different apps a week

56:00.320 --> 56:02.320
So he can talk about them on his podcast

56:02.320 --> 56:05.320
You know, eventually your system starts to pay for that

56:05.320 --> 56:09.320
So that's what I, when I was running Fedora as my main workstation, I really found that pretty useful

56:09.320 --> 56:11.320
I wonder if I can get Fedora Toolbox on Manjaro right now

56:11.320 --> 56:13.320
I bet you can

56:13.320 --> 56:15.320
Yeah, something tells me

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
Yeah, something tells me

56:16.320 --> 56:17.320
Well, cool man

56:17.320 --> 56:21.320
I mean, I just, I gotta say congratulations to you and the entire team

56:21.320 --> 56:23.320
Another great release

56:23.320 --> 56:27.320
And our team installed it and pretty much universally liked it

56:27.320 --> 56:31.320
And we were, you know, messaging, telegramming each other back and forth

56:31.320 --> 56:34.320
Like, did you see this? What about that? Yeah, it's very fast

56:34.320 --> 56:36.320
And I'm running on this, I'm running on this

56:36.320 --> 56:37.320
Okay, I have it in this VM

56:37.320 --> 56:40.320
And I very much concur with Wes

56:40.320 --> 56:43.320
It was pretty, pretty performant in all of those situations

56:43.320 --> 56:46.320
It feels, it feels like this is the fastest Linux we've ever had

56:46.320 --> 56:48.320
And I know there's some benchmarks that suggest otherwise

56:48.320 --> 56:51.320
But I don't know man, when you put everything together

56:51.320 --> 56:53.320
When you put the gnome shell improvements together

56:53.320 --> 56:55.320
You put, even having trim on the SSDs

56:55.320 --> 56:57.320
You put an early out of memory manager on there

56:57.320 --> 57:00.320
Plus the improvements like with Python and whatnot

57:00.320 --> 57:03.320
Like it all really comes together to a fantastic release of Fedora

57:03.320 --> 57:04.320
Well, thank you

57:04.320 --> 57:06.320
Well, thank you actually

57:06.320 --> 57:08.320
Don't thank me, I'm thanking you guys

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
Please thank the whole team

57:09.320 --> 57:10.320
I will

57:10.320 --> 57:13.320
So, would it be outrageous for me to ask you

57:13.320 --> 57:17.320
What the not so distant future might hold for Fedora

57:17.320 --> 57:18.320
As far as you're concerned?

57:18.320 --> 57:20.320
More of the same, I think

57:20.320 --> 57:23.320
Continuous releases on a cadence

57:23.320 --> 57:26.320
I'm excited about more of the IoT stuff

57:26.320 --> 57:29.320
Hopefully we'll get some more devices

57:29.320 --> 57:31.320
We've always had some trouble with, you know

57:31.320 --> 57:33.320
Everybody's favorite Raspberry Pi

57:33.320 --> 57:36.320
With, you know, upstream support and things like that

57:36.320 --> 57:38.320
And, you know, Fedora really

57:38.320 --> 57:41.320
We really like to keep everything

57:41.320 --> 57:43.320
So that we have one operating system

57:43.320 --> 57:45.320
That installs on all devices

57:45.320 --> 57:46.320
Not a separate kernel

57:46.320 --> 57:48.320
Not these kind of things

57:48.320 --> 57:50.320
And so that's been a long road

57:50.320 --> 57:55.320
I think that as the ARM device world matures

57:55.320 --> 57:58.320
We'll have more things that Fedora will work out of the box on

57:58.320 --> 58:01.320
And I think there's some neat stuff in Fedora IoT

58:01.320 --> 58:02.320
That's coming up

58:02.320 --> 58:05.320
I hope to see some cool stuff around that with Fedora 33

58:05.320 --> 58:07.320
I agree on those points

58:07.320 --> 58:09.320
I do hope to see some more maturing there

58:09.320 --> 58:12.320
Maybe Wes and I will talk about our RockPro experiments

58:12.320 --> 58:13.320
In the post show

58:13.320 --> 58:14.320
Yeah, in particular, actually

58:14.320 --> 58:18.320
The RockChip stuff has a lot of new support in Fedora 32

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
So hopefully that should go more smoothly for you

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
I'm hoping so

58:21.320 --> 58:22.320
We'll find out

58:22.320 --> 58:24.320
Wes Payne will be back with the results in a moment

58:24.320 --> 58:25.320
But before we get there

58:25.320 --> 58:26.320
I just wanted to say thanks

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
Thanks for coming by, Matt

58:28.320 --> 58:30.320
You know, I know it's probably a super busy time

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
You know, probably if you have a little downtime

58:32.320 --> 58:34.320
The last thing you really want to do is jump on the computer

58:34.320 --> 58:35.320
And chat with people about it

58:35.320 --> 58:37.320
You'd probably love to just be kicking back and relaxing

58:37.320 --> 58:38.320
Having a beer right now

58:38.320 --> 58:40.320
So I appreciate you making the time

58:40.320 --> 58:43.320
I'm going to be back to the Red Hat Summit now

58:43.320 --> 58:44.320
Right, of course

58:44.320 --> 58:45.320
Enjoy

58:45.320 --> 58:46.320
No downtime for you at Summit time

58:46.320 --> 58:47.320
I forgot, of course

58:47.320 --> 58:48.320
Well, thanks for making the time

58:48.320 --> 58:49.320
I really appreciate it

58:49.320 --> 58:50.320
Be glad to

58:50.320 --> 58:51.320
Bye

58:51.320 --> 58:52.320
And congratulations again

58:52.320 --> 58:54.320
And Wimpy, congratulations again to your team on the release

58:54.320 --> 58:55.320
Thank you for stopping by

58:55.320 --> 58:58.320
And a big plug for the Ubuntu podcast

58:58.320 --> 59:01.320
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast at UbuntuPodcast.org

59:01.320 --> 59:03.320
Season 13 is in full swing

59:03.320 --> 59:04.320
Thank you very much

59:04.320 --> 59:05.320
No, thank you

59:05.320 --> 59:07.320
And those look like some tasty potatoes

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
We do make good potatoes

59:09.320 --> 59:11.320
You guys are making me hungry

59:11.320 --> 59:12.320
Oh, yeah

59:12.320 --> 59:13.320
I'm not done podcasting yet

59:13.320 --> 59:14.320
We have a whole post-show still

59:14.320 --> 59:15.320
Well, we will see about that actually

59:15.320 --> 59:16.320
We're getting long

59:16.320 --> 59:17.320
We'll see

59:17.320 --> 59:20.320
Before we go, I want to mention that this show actually has a Twitter account

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
If you want to be following

59:22.320 --> 59:23.320
I don't know

59:23.320 --> 59:25.320
Maybe you want to be up to date on like new releases

59:25.320 --> 59:26.320
Maybe you want to know when things are live

59:26.320 --> 59:27.320
I don't know

59:27.320 --> 59:28.320
I don't know what you want

59:28.320 --> 59:29.320
It's Linux Unplugged, right?

59:29.320 --> 59:30.320
Just at Linux Unplugged?

59:30.320 --> 59:31.320
Is that what it is?

59:31.320 --> 59:32.320
At Linux Unplugged

59:32.320 --> 59:33.320
That's what it is

59:33.320 --> 59:35.320
You say it like that so I believe you think that's what it is

59:35.320 --> 59:38.320
But I know you're double checking just in case it's not that right now

59:38.320 --> 59:39.320
You got to do your due diligence

59:39.320 --> 59:40.320
And I'm right

59:40.320 --> 59:41.320
All right

59:41.320 --> 59:43.320
We'll be live again next Tuesday at noon Pacific

59:43.320 --> 59:47.320
And links for everything we talked about at Linux Unplugged slash 351

59:47.320 --> 01:00:00.320
See you next Tuesday

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:28.320
You and I were doing kind of concurrent projects before the show started

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320
Because our mumble server was down

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.320
And so I was kind of keeping the live stream up to date

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.320
And chatting with the mumble admins who are wonderful people

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
Amazing

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.320
Volunteers that are truly just the best people on the earth

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.320
That took care of a little outage we had right before the show

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.320
Which clearly our virtual log is such a huge part of this podcast

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
So the fact that we were possibly going to be without mumble

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.320
I was slightly panicked so Mitt Fried jumped in on it

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.320
And got the system back up and running and we were able to keep going

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
Saved the show

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320
While we were kind of doing all of that

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.320
You were out in the server room aka studio garage

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.320
And you were messing around with the Rock Pro 64 we have out there

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320
And Fedora images

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.320
And the thing is I didn't get a chance to see if it actually ended up working or not

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320
So how far did you get with Fedora 32 on the Rock Pro?

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.320
Not quite

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.320
We're still learning our way around that thing that's for sure

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.320
And it seems like occasionally when we reboot it

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.320
It needs a little cool down period before it's ready to try booting up again

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320
Like fully unplugged

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320
Yeah

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.320
And that's something that I'm not sure if other people experience

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.320
But we have to kind of leave it unplugged or else it won't post again properly it seems

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
Only after a failed boot

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.320
We can reboot it from the command line and it comes right back up

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320
So that's not a problem

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Yeah

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.320
So based on my limited knowledge and deciphering

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.320
While the Manjaro image that we used as a test booted up just fine

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.320
Neither of the two Fedora images I found were able to do so

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320
Okay

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320
And that's just from the SD card

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Yeah and these are just the ones you know put out on the alternative downloads page from today

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.320
So I don't know that they've been optimized for anything but you know the processors

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.320
And so there may need to be some bootloader work etc done to actually get it loaded and working

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.320
As they say in your Zoom meetings we're going to circle back on that topic and put a pin in it

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:20.320
And see if we can't sink on a solution and then maybe bring some other stakeholders in and verify the results

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:39.320
Oh my God Chris
