WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
Wes, I think I found the creepiest run Linux

00:02.900 --> 00:03.940
I've ever seen.

00:03.940 --> 00:06.580
Oh, you mean this weird robot cat?

00:06.580 --> 00:10.380
Yeah, Python, robot, and cat that runs Linux.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.740
It's the Mars cat.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.700
Just like a real cat, Mars cat is fully autonomous,

00:15.700 --> 00:20.700
stretching, tapping, and even burying litter.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.060
It may express different emotions

00:23.060 --> 00:25.060
by different meows or gestures.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.460
Mars cat can play with you or your toys.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.220
Or your children.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.060
Here.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.900
Mars, go sleep.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.740
And see.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.500
It can interact with objects or people nearby.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.940
Even play with real cats.

00:41.940 --> 00:44.220
It sounds so great, but if you watch the video,

00:44.220 --> 00:46.420
which we'll have linked in the show notes,

00:46.420 --> 00:48.500
the thing doesn't move like a cat.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
No, cats are graceful animals,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.100
and this is an awkward robot.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.940
It's very awkward, it's very stiff,

00:54.940 --> 00:56.900
it's very scary looking,

00:56.900 --> 00:59.460
and they want you to treat it like a real cat.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.980
It heals with purr sounds.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.900
Every Mars cat is unique.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.260
From its eyes, body, to personality,

01:07.260 --> 01:11.320
you can pet it and shape its characters in your own way.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.880
Dress it up, make it more adorable.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.500
Mars cat is open sourced and programmable.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.460
With powerful quad core Raspberry Pi,

01:21.460 --> 01:24.380
you can create your own applications.

01:24.380 --> 01:28.020
Mars cat is also an ideal choice for education,

01:28.020 --> 01:30.260
research, and commercial purpose.

01:31.820 --> 01:32.720
Or other things.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.700
This thing is, like they said,

01:34.700 --> 01:37.100
powered by Raspberry Pi, uses Python,

01:37.100 --> 01:39.940
it has a series of APIs available to control the camera,

01:39.940 --> 01:42.760
the microphone, it has touch sensors,

01:42.760 --> 01:45.940
16 servos, which it needs about 30 more,

01:45.940 --> 01:49.980
and it's a platform for a bionic cat

01:49.980 --> 01:51.220
for the first home robot.

01:51.220 --> 01:52.780
The weird thing is, and this is in the video,

01:52.780 --> 01:55.140
when they take this thing apart to see the insides,

01:55.140 --> 01:57.900
it's as creepy as if they were taking apart a real cat.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.620
Yeah, I mean, I like a lot of these ideas,

01:59.620 --> 02:00.700
I love that it's open sourced,

02:00.700 --> 02:03.620
but you have to be able to actually be around the thing.

02:03.620 --> 02:07.780
And I also wonder, it is powered by USB-C,

02:07.780 --> 02:09.380
but where do you plug it in?

02:09.380 --> 02:14.380
Hello friends, and welcome in to the Unplugged program.

02:19.660 --> 02:20.500
My name is Chris.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.340
My name is Wes.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.620
Hello Wes, you've got that very special edition look going,

02:24.620 --> 02:26.100
you've dressed up all nice.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.940
Oh yes, to the nines.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.580
I don't know why you have to dress up like that,

02:30.580 --> 02:31.580
but I appreciate it,

02:31.580 --> 02:34.100
and it makes me feel like it's a very special episode.

02:34.100 --> 02:34.960
It's all for you.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.260
Today, we're going to bridge the gap

02:38.260 --> 02:42.180
between shareware and free software.

02:42.180 --> 02:44.240
Those of us who have been around for a piece

02:44.240 --> 02:48.780
remember a time when you bought software in bags on walls,

02:48.780 --> 02:51.820
and it was the full version of the program,

02:51.820 --> 02:54.020
but it often came with certain limitations.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.300
How did we get from that to open source

02:58.300 --> 03:00.440
and free software really in the world?

03:01.860 --> 03:03.200
We're gonna talk about that today,

03:03.200 --> 03:06.620
as well as some news, some discussions,

03:06.620 --> 03:08.380
and of course, we've got Alex and Jeezy here.

03:08.380 --> 03:09.300
Hello gentlemen.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.700
Hello. Hello, hello.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.140
And as always, we have our virtual lug,

03:13.140 --> 03:15.380
a fantastic showing, hello Mumble Room,

03:15.380 --> 03:16.340
time appropriate greetings.

03:16.340 --> 03:17.340
Hello, hello.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.260
Happy Linux Tuesday. Hello, hello.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.100
Hola.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.260
Happy, happy Linux Tuesday.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.660
Thank you all for making it here.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.000
We have a lot,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.460
I think we're gonna have a really fun discussion,

03:25.460 --> 03:27.000
a lot to get into today.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.300
So let's start with some good news, not robot cat news,

03:30.300 --> 03:32.020
but good news for Kubuntu users

03:32.020 --> 03:34.720
who might be interested in a laptop

03:34.720 --> 03:35.820
that comes pre-bundled

03:35.820 --> 03:37.680
with what they're calling Kubuntu Focus.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.300
Michael Liarbull over at Feronix

03:39.300 --> 03:40.780
had a chance to give it a look,

03:40.780 --> 03:43.740
and he says, I've been testing out for several weeks.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.820
So he got it like under a embargo.

03:45.820 --> 03:46.740
Oh, look at him go.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.780
An old NDA skis, as they say in the biz.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.660
This is the first generation of the Kubuntu Focus laptop.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.940
You ready for the hardware specs, Wes?

03:53.940 --> 03:55.300
Oh please. You got any guesses?

03:55.300 --> 03:57.700
Well, I'm guessing I'll probably be a little disappointed.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.920
I thought it was,

03:58.920 --> 04:01.300
I mean, when I first heard the initial rumors,

04:01.300 --> 04:03.220
I thought it was gonna be an ARM box, right?

04:03.220 --> 04:05.380
Yeah, something small and minimal.

04:05.380 --> 04:10.020
This sucker has a Intel Core i7-9750 processor,

04:10.020 --> 04:12.700
an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.540
Wait, what?

04:13.540 --> 04:15.800
It's got a 16.1 inch, 1080p screen

04:15.800 --> 04:17.580
that runs at 144 Hertz.

04:17.580 --> 04:19.180
It's IPS too.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.180
It's got a terabyte Samsung Evo drive in it.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.520
And then all of the other kind of niceties

04:23.520 --> 04:25.780
that a Clevo laptop of this size has,

04:25.780 --> 04:27.340
which have been getting pretty competitive.

04:27.340 --> 04:30.760
Do I also see it's got 32 gigs of RAM?

04:30.760 --> 04:31.600
That's right.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.300
Wow, okay, I'm interested.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.100
Yeah, I mean, as far as a laptop of this nature,

04:37.100 --> 04:40.500
a high-end laptop, if you're a plasma user,

04:40.500 --> 04:41.940
Liarbull seems to be pretty impressed.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.020
He says the software side's looking choice.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.220
Yeah, that's right, Kubuntu 18.04.3 is shipped on the device

04:48.220 --> 04:51.100
with some alterations around the default desktop environment

04:51.100 --> 04:53.540
and themes, so you get a little bit of customization there,

04:53.540 --> 04:55.740
including the dark theme by default.

04:55.740 --> 04:56.900
Chris, you'll like that.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.140
Well, now I'm sold.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.740
You know, you have that NVIDIA GPU too,

04:59.740 --> 05:02.340
so Google Chrome is included and already tweaked

05:02.340 --> 05:05.660
with all of the GPU options for maximum acceleration.

05:05.660 --> 05:07.580
Also of note, it ships with disk encryption

05:07.580 --> 05:09.340
turned on by default.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.580
So if you're listening to this and you're wondering,

05:11.580 --> 05:13.220
what's Kubuntu focus?

05:13.220 --> 05:14.820
We'll have a link to it in the show notes.

05:14.820 --> 05:17.680
You can also just go to kfocus.org.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.140
It's the result of the collaboration

05:19.140 --> 05:22.140
between the Kubuntu Cancel and Tuxedo

05:22.140 --> 05:24.860
working to create something that they felt

05:24.860 --> 05:28.140
was pretty well focused on the user.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.100
We maintain the platform so our customers

05:30.100 --> 05:32.060
can focus on work and play.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.620
Yeah, I mean, you could really see it.

05:34.620 --> 05:38.940
There's not a very wide selection of pre-built hardware

05:38.940 --> 05:40.020
shipping with plasma.

05:40.020 --> 05:43.980
I mean, I'm really struggling to think of anything that,

05:43.980 --> 05:46.260
I mean, almost all of them that you could buy that's

05:46.260 --> 05:48.860
System76 or Dell or somebody else

05:48.860 --> 05:50.340
would be generally GnomeShell.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.300
Right, right.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.980
Not all of them, I guess, not 100%, but a lot of them.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.140
Some of them, you know, you got like the Mint hardware

05:56.140 --> 05:57.940
stuff like that that's probably Cinnamon.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.100
And there's a couple others, but.

05:59.100 --> 05:59.740
But yeah, you're right.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.500
Plasma's been somewhat underrepresented,

06:01.500 --> 06:04.820
and it's nice to see what seems like a great offering now.

06:04.820 --> 06:09.580
OK, can I admit what feels like an insecurity to you guys?

06:09.580 --> 06:10.540
And I think it might be.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.740
You know, that's what we have this virtual users group for,

06:12.740 --> 06:12.980
Chris.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.860
You can be honest, share your feelings.

06:14.860 --> 06:15.420
All right.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.460
Hi, my name is Chris, and I'm afraid

06:17.460 --> 06:21.660
that the Windows Terminal is getting extremely competitive.

06:21.660 --> 06:25.340
And the worst thing about it is Microsoft

06:25.340 --> 06:28.620
is incorporating legit nice features that

06:28.620 --> 06:31.380
have been contributed by outside community members

06:31.380 --> 06:32.860
into their core product.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.420
It's like they freaking get it, too.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.380
And that's really the most frustrating.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.380
They're using open source to compete against it.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.060
Oh, they got it.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.100
They figured it out.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.260
Maybe that's why they love it so much.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.420
That was our secret.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.820
I am talking about, of course, they have now

06:45.820 --> 06:48.940
added those cool CRT retro effects

06:48.940 --> 06:51.100
that you get from like cool retro term

06:51.100 --> 06:55.740
into the Windows Terminal itself, which was a contributing.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.620
The community member was called, I love his handle, Irony Man.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.660
Not Iron Man, but Irony Man contributed the CRT retro

07:02.660 --> 07:03.740
effects to this.

07:03.740 --> 07:06.020
And now it's shipping as an experimental feature.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.660
There's other really kind of cool things in here, too.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.820
Some things you might like.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.300
Yeah, they've got some nice updates to usability,

07:11.300 --> 07:14.180
things like you can now modify your profiles.json

07:14.180 --> 07:16.540
to have your own default profile settings.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.180
And once you set that property, you

07:18.180 --> 07:20.140
can have it applied to like all your profiles.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.660
Yeah, so if you always want a certain font or a certain size,

07:23.660 --> 07:26.700
you can set some defaults across all profiles.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.220
That sounds really nice, and it sounds

07:28.220 --> 07:29.580
like the direct kind of feature you

07:29.580 --> 07:33.220
add when you've been listening to the users of that terminal.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.980
Yeah, stuff, too, like some improvements

07:34.980 --> 07:36.340
to how tab sizing works.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.180
It's getting pretty slick.

07:38.180 --> 07:42.300
The reason why I wanted to pull this story in because there's

07:42.300 --> 07:46.540
an interesting connection here from a company that was really

07:46.540 --> 07:49.660
ignoring its terminal for many, many releases.

07:49.660 --> 07:52.540
We spent years ragging on old command.exe.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.540
Yeah, and then they really focused in on it,

07:55.540 --> 07:58.100
and it really has exploded.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.460
I think your insecurities are somewhat right, though, too.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.820
I mean, it helps them that they've got this open source.

08:02.820 --> 08:05.220
But even already on the Mac desktop,

08:05.220 --> 08:06.460
they've got competitors, too.

08:06.460 --> 08:07.940
I think we need to step up our game.

08:07.940 --> 08:10.900
Yeah, so that, as you read in my mind, is what I was thinking.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.380
Imagine if one of the distros really got it in its head,

08:14.380 --> 08:15.780
like, you know what I'm going to do

08:15.780 --> 08:17.260
is I'm really going to invest in the terminal.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.340
I'm going to make the terminal really great.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.820
I know most people are listening and probably thinking

08:20.820 --> 08:22.200
to themselves, oh, the terminal's fine.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.700
There's nothing really wrong with it.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.260
But I don't know, man.

08:25.260 --> 08:29.580
I think with the WSL2 stuff and terminal and all of that,

08:29.580 --> 08:32.660
I think it's very likely that more and more power users are

08:32.660 --> 08:34.740
getting at least a little bit what they want.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.980
At least they can stay on the Windows platform.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.500
And I guess good enough for them.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.380
Maybe I shouldn't be, maybe it's fine.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.300
Maybe it's fine.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.580
It is hard to say, and I don't like thinking,

08:42.580 --> 08:45.780
that a beautiful, well-functioning open source

08:45.780 --> 08:47.500
terminal somehow makes the world worse.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.540
You know one thing that really I always

08:49.540 --> 08:51.000
struggle with on a Windows terminal,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.420
whether it's PuTTY or whether it's the built-in one,

08:54.420 --> 08:55.780
is copy and paste.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.020
It's just really difficult for some reason.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.700
Yeah.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.220
You know, my favorite, favorite thing

09:02.220 --> 09:03.460
about using the terminal on Linux

09:03.460 --> 09:06.740
is that X clipboard when you just highlight something

09:06.740 --> 09:08.340
and then you just middle click to paste it.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.060
Yeah.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.340
Soon as I'm on any other terminal system

09:11.340 --> 09:13.760
and I go to highlight, and I'm like, oh, yeah, right.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.340
It just changes.

09:14.340 --> 09:15.300
Like you think you already have it.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.260
You've copied it.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.140
So quick, so fast, so fast.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.260
Now, Wes, I want to go to our reporter on the ground

09:22.260 --> 09:24.340
in Enlightenment Island.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.820
Minimek, do you have an E17 perspective

09:26.820 --> 09:28.260
on this particular situation?

09:28.260 --> 09:28.760
Over.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.460
And tell us what you're learning now.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.940
Oh, ha.

09:31.940 --> 09:35.180
So Enlightenment, we started with terminology,

09:35.180 --> 09:38.700
which is a future terminal, which is really cool

09:38.700 --> 09:41.380
because you can watch a video while doing

09:41.380 --> 09:44.380
some commands on your command line and everything

09:44.380 --> 09:46.340
and all that in your terminal.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.460
So it's quite an interesting terminal.

09:48.460 --> 09:51.140
And it is available in the Ubuntu, I think.

09:51.140 --> 09:51.940
OK.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.080
And of course, a cool retro term.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.260
I like what Node Runner said in the chat room, though.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.140
The future is the GUI.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.060
But have you tried the terminal?

10:01.060 --> 10:01.900
That's exactly it.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.420
Nailed it.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.220
That is so exactly it.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.780
The future is a great GUI where I run a really nice terminal.

10:08.780 --> 10:11.400
All right, so last week, we've talked

10:11.400 --> 10:14.740
about some community transitions that were happening

10:14.740 --> 10:16.720
around container Linux.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.240
And there was also a recent story

10:20.240 --> 10:24.220
about a pretty big upset within the Rust community

10:24.220 --> 10:27.220
around the ActixX project.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.540
I wanted to say ActiveX, but the ActixX project.

10:30.540 --> 10:35.620
And that developer, who is actually a Microsoft employee,

10:35.620 --> 10:39.020
experienced significant burnout and quit the project,

10:39.020 --> 10:40.760
pulled the repos off.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.760
Now, this is actually a pretty significant project

10:42.760 --> 10:43.740
for the Rust community.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.260
So it made headlines pretty quickly.

10:46.260 --> 10:48.340
How would you describe its relevancy?

10:48.340 --> 10:50.380
It's probably one of the few that,

10:50.380 --> 10:52.540
or it's the largest that does what it does in the community.

10:52.540 --> 10:52.740
Right.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.080
So it's sort of a whole framework

10:54.080 --> 10:57.500
for web services, interactive, HTTP sorts of servers.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.780
It's kind of the biggest one.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.820
At least one of the earlier and most well-known

11:00.820 --> 11:01.420
in the community.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.740
And the number of projects that had used it,

11:03.740 --> 11:06.100
the sort of community that had developed around it,

11:06.100 --> 11:09.420
led you to think it was, maybe there was a team behind it,

11:09.420 --> 11:12.300
it was well-maintained or endorsed by the community.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.500
Turns out, mostly just one hardworking maintainer.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.300
Yeah, we covered this story.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.460
The whole cycle happened during the week of Linux Headlines.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.420
And I'm happy to say there is a resolution, which

11:23.420 --> 11:27.020
is also covered in Linux Headlines at linuxheadlines.show.

11:27.020 --> 11:32.700
But the really quick summary is, he got overwhelmed

11:32.700 --> 11:35.900
and felt probably a little taken advantage of,

11:35.900 --> 11:38.460
and was sick and tired of justifying well-thought-out

11:38.460 --> 11:40.620
design decisions over and over again,

11:40.620 --> 11:43.140
like the same stuff would get noticed and thrown at him.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.980
And he just reached a point of, I'm done with open source,

11:46.980 --> 11:48.540
and I'm pulling the repo.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.180
And then people panicked because of the value of this project.

11:51.180 --> 11:53.460
Well, and I think there was another side of that, too,

11:53.460 --> 11:56.180
is that it started as a personal project,

11:56.180 --> 11:57.340
and it grew.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.940
And so you could say, you know, there were design decisions.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.280
And I think a lot of the community

12:01.280 --> 12:03.780
had some rising standards, or at least standards

12:03.780 --> 12:05.500
that they wanted to implement.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.380
And that takes a lot more work, or maybe just

12:07.380 --> 12:10.100
a different style of management than a single maintainer

12:10.100 --> 12:10.940
can provide.

12:10.940 --> 12:14.940
Though, after some time, the developer had a think,

12:14.940 --> 12:16.940
and came back and said, here's what I'm going to do,

12:16.940 --> 12:19.860
is I'm going to hand the reins over to another community

12:19.860 --> 12:20.980
member.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.460
And said, oh, the repositories are back online.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.160
And a transition is taking place, and it's all amicable.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.500
And it's really nice to see that.

12:28.500 --> 12:32.820
But it's a reminder of a constant problem.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.500
And I really feel for these developers,

12:36.500 --> 12:38.760
because they start something in some cases

12:38.760 --> 12:40.220
that they don't plan to monetize,

12:40.220 --> 12:42.100
or they don't plan to turn it into a business

12:42.100 --> 12:43.060
or a foundation.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.540
It's really scratching their own edge.

12:44.540 --> 12:45.580
Scratching their own ends, trying to learn,

12:45.580 --> 12:46.780
or just help the community.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.140
And in this case, this individual just

12:49.140 --> 12:52.620
nailed the timing, because interest in Rust was growing,

12:52.620 --> 12:55.820
and there was interest in having these types of services.

12:55.820 --> 12:58.980
And so it just took off like wildfire,

12:58.980 --> 13:02.500
and he ended up running a fairly large project.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.700
Pretty common story.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.540
And it's something that we have a hard time

13:05.540 --> 13:08.060
fully appreciating, because we don't do the work.

13:08.060 --> 13:13.380
I have definitely, as I've gotten to be an old fat fart,

13:13.380 --> 13:13.660
is-

13:13.660 --> 13:14.700
Wisened, wisened.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.700
Oh, thank you.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.860
I really didn't understand how much work went into all

13:19.860 --> 13:21.900
these different career trajectories.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.580
And when you think you know what a plumber's job is,

13:25.580 --> 13:27.980
or an electrician's job, or a media person's job,

13:27.980 --> 13:30.900
or a software developer's job, you just

13:30.900 --> 13:33.260
can kind of only really appreciate what

13:33.260 --> 13:34.680
you were able to observe from afar.

13:34.680 --> 13:34.900
Right.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.980
You get the surface level, and none of the hard work

13:36.980 --> 13:38.060
that goes on underneath.

13:38.060 --> 13:43.620
And there was a blog post by Drew DeVault that it

13:43.620 --> 13:45.260
was like, I wrote this.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.700
Only it could be all about content creation,

13:47.700 --> 13:49.000
and he's talking about software.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.140
And so I think this is a universal human problem.

13:52.140 --> 13:56.740
And he posted this last week as this episode goes out.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.700
And I think this is so worth a read.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.620
So I want to encourage you to go to Drew's entire blog

14:01.620 --> 14:03.980
to read the entire thing.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.020
But he just recently crossed a major milestone.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.860
February will mark one year that I've

14:08.860 --> 14:11.540
been working on self-directed free software projects

14:11.540 --> 14:12.740
full time.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.540
I was planning on writing an optimistic retrospective

14:15.540 --> 14:17.740
article around this time, but given

14:17.740 --> 14:19.420
the current mood of the ecosystem,

14:19.420 --> 14:22.220
I think it would be better to be realistic.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.580
In this stage of my career, I now

14:23.580 --> 14:27.460
feel at once happier, busier, more fulfilled, more engaged,

14:27.460 --> 14:29.260
more stressed, and more depressed

14:29.260 --> 14:32.100
than I have at any other point in my life.

14:32.100 --> 14:32.660
Yeah.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.180
Isn't that a weird mix?

14:35.180 --> 14:37.420
And it's point can I really?

14:37.420 --> 14:39.100
It's the hobby turned profession.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.700
There's a lot of emotions there.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.340
I mean, he speaks to that more.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.060
I also have mixed feelings about how busy I am.

14:45.060 --> 14:48.580
Every day I wake up to 100 new emails, delete half of them,

14:48.580 --> 14:51.740
and spend three to four hours working on the rest.

14:51.740 --> 14:54.060
Patches, questions, support inquiries, monitoring,

14:54.060 --> 14:54.980
and reports.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.500
It's endless.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.220
On top of that, I have dozens of things

14:58.220 --> 15:00.380
I already need to work on.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.900
The CI work distribution algorithm

15:01.900 --> 15:03.620
needs to be completely redone.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.300
I need to provision new hardware.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.940
Oh, yeah, and the hardware that I need

15:06.940 --> 15:09.260
ran into shipping issues again.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.460
I need to improve monitoring.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.140
I need to plan for FOSDEM.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.860
I need to finish the Wayland book.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.380
I need to figure out the memory issues in Himitsu,

15:16.380 --> 15:18.620
not to mention write the rest of the software.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.060
I need to file taxes, which is twice as much work

15:21.060 --> 15:22.380
when you own a business.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.460
I need to implement data export and account deletion.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.100
I need to finish the web-driven patch review UI.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.780
I need to finish writing docs for Alpine.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.860
I have to work more on the Pine phone.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.020
I have a legacy server which needs to be overhauled

15:35.020 --> 15:38.020
and is now on the clock because of Acme V1.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.140
That's a lot of stuff.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.940
Yeah, and that's not even all of it.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.220
He's like, that's what's off the top of my head.

15:43.220 --> 15:44.580
He says, not to mention the tasks which

15:44.580 --> 15:46.860
have been on hold for longer than they've been planned

15:46.860 --> 15:48.460
for in the first place.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.620
Alpine is still going to have hundreds of Python 2 packages

15:51.620 --> 15:53.580
by the end of life.

15:53.580 --> 15:56.140
RISC-V work has been stalled because the work is currently

15:56.140 --> 15:59.700
blocked by a large problem that I simply can't automate.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.260
There's another project he's committed

16:01.260 --> 16:03.500
to called Fospay, which is having issues pulling data

16:03.500 --> 16:04.580
figures from Patreon.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.980
And he has to restart a process manually every so often

16:07.980 --> 16:08.780
to get it to work.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.380
And there's dozens of other loose ends.

16:10.380 --> 16:14.660
And he says, that's not even considering any personal goals.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.940
And I think anybody that's kind of been in this situation

16:16.940 --> 16:19.660
has been here, it's like you just get so focused on work.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.940
He says, which I have vanishing little time for.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.660
I get zero exercise.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.380
And though my diet is mostly reasonable,

16:25.380 --> 16:31.820
the majority of it is delivery, unless I get the odd two hours

16:31.820 --> 16:33.020
to visit the grocery store.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.780
That is, unless I want to spend those two hours with my friends,

16:35.780 --> 16:37.620
or in my case, family and wife, which

16:37.620 --> 16:39.060
means it's back to delivery.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.700
My dating life is almost non-existent.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.860
I want to spend more time studying Japanese,

16:43.860 --> 16:47.540
but it's either that or keeping up with my leisure reading.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.580
Lofty goals of also studying Chinese or Arabic

16:50.580 --> 16:52.500
are but dust in the wind.

16:52.500 --> 16:56.740
And to make matters worse, I'm addicted to caffeine again.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.860
There have been healthy ways and unhealthy ways

16:58.860 --> 17:01.280
of dealing with the occasional feelings of being overwhelmed

17:01.280 --> 17:02.660
by all of this.

17:02.660 --> 17:07.060
The healthier ways have included taking walks, reading my books,

17:07.060 --> 17:09.940
and spending a few minutes with my cat, doing chores,

17:09.940 --> 17:11.780
and calling my family to catch up.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.380
Less healthy ways have included walking to the corner store

17:14.380 --> 17:16.100
to buy unhealthy comfort foods.

17:16.100 --> 17:16.900
Oh, yeah.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.420
Consuming alcohol or marijuana too much or too often,

17:20.420 --> 17:22.740
getting in stupid internet arguments,

17:22.740 --> 17:24.460
being mean to my friends and colleagues,

17:24.460 --> 17:28.060
and googling myself to read negative comments.

17:28.060 --> 17:28.620
Yeah.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.860
He says, I've been trying to do that my entire life,

17:31.860 --> 17:34.060
trying to get all of this balanced.

17:34.060 --> 17:36.380
Writing code for someone else has always been a huge drain

17:36.380 --> 17:38.020
on my emotional well-being.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.660
That's why I worked on my side projects in the first place,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.460
to have an outlet through which I could work

17:42.460 --> 17:45.300
on self-directed projects without making compromise

17:45.300 --> 17:47.180
for some arbitrary deadline.

17:47.180 --> 17:49.380
I recently had that realization that I

17:49.380 --> 17:52.620
should do a personal side podcast just

17:52.620 --> 17:59.100
so I have a pure creative outlet so I can stick to what

17:59.100 --> 18:00.740
works here, like the topics.

18:00.740 --> 18:04.460
And if I want to talk about RVs or whatever it might be,

18:04.460 --> 18:06.060
I need to have an outlet for that.

18:06.060 --> 18:07.740
But I don't need to put it into a Linux show.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.740
Or shoehorn it in.

18:08.740 --> 18:11.780
So and the idea of taking as long

18:11.780 --> 18:15.540
as I want to make content, because I've been doing

18:15.540 --> 18:16.700
weekly content for so long.

18:16.700 --> 18:17.900
I could really kind of connect with this.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.100
He says, when I'm in the zone writing lots of code

18:20.100 --> 18:22.820
for a project I'm interested in, knowing

18:22.820 --> 18:25.020
it's going to have a meaningful impact on my users,

18:25.020 --> 18:27.340
knowing that it's being written under my terms

18:27.340 --> 18:29.820
is the most rewarding work I've ever done.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.380
This isn't a retrospective I wanted to write,

18:32.380 --> 18:34.820
but it's nice to drop the veneer for a few minutes

18:34.820 --> 18:37.180
and share an honest take on what it's like.

18:37.180 --> 18:40.500
This year has been nothing like what I expected it to be.

18:40.500 --> 18:45.140
It's both terrible and wonderful and very busy.

18:45.140 --> 18:48.060
I have a bit of advice for Drew via podcast here.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.180
Just for a moment, the rest of you can skip ahead.

18:50.180 --> 18:53.060
But my advice directly to Drew is, and to be clear,

18:53.060 --> 18:54.140
this isn't our Drew.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.820
This is software developer Drew.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.700
Our Drew, Drew DeVore, is not.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.900
This is Drew DeVault, which now realizing sounds

19:02.900 --> 19:04.620
a lot like Drew.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.260
Drew's also very busy, so I'm sure he sympathizes with this.

19:07.260 --> 19:08.420
Yeah, this is not our Drew.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.860
This is software developer Drew, full-time software developer

19:10.860 --> 19:11.260
Drew.

19:11.260 --> 19:13.220
Sway maintainer, and many other cool projects.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.380
Yes, we've talked about him before on the show,

19:14.380 --> 19:16.940
so I kind of went in with a little bit of assumption.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.660
But my advice to him, and really anybody

19:18.660 --> 19:20.740
who finds themselves in these positions actually,

19:20.740 --> 19:24.700
is try not to get in the, oh my god, I'm so busy mentality.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.620
Because it's a way of thinking, and it's

19:26.620 --> 19:28.660
a way to immediately say, no, I can't do that, I'm too busy.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.580
I can't do that, I'm too busy.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.740
Nah, what's the point of running out for 15 minutes?

19:31.740 --> 19:33.220
I'm too busy.

19:33.220 --> 19:38.620
And it's a cycle you can get in that amplifies your feelings

19:38.620 --> 19:42.780
about not being appreciated for the software you're creating,

19:42.780 --> 19:44.980
or people not understanding your rationale.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.500
Those all get amplified by this, I'm too busy

19:47.500 --> 19:49.380
to deal with this crap mentality.

19:49.380 --> 19:52.300
And you've got to break it, and you've got to just say,

19:52.300 --> 19:55.880
right now is quite busy, but there will be time.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.760
And you have to just shift your mentality,

19:58.760 --> 20:00.220
and try to say yes to a few things.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.660
I know that sounds hard when you're really busy,

20:02.660 --> 20:06.060
but it is a tricky mindset you can get locked into,

20:06.060 --> 20:08.140
and it's very counterproductive.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.700
So and I think it leads to burnout.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.300
That's always hard to prioritize long term over short term,

20:12.300 --> 20:13.820
but you have to make time.

20:13.820 --> 20:17.820
Yeah, I mean, it's like I'm some expert at it.

20:17.820 --> 20:20.780
I was feeling quite overwhelmed when I lived in England

20:20.780 --> 20:23.540
and working in London.

20:23.540 --> 20:25.340
Living in a big city like that, I actually

20:25.340 --> 20:28.180
found it quite oppressive.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.740
And I was going to an office every day,

20:29.740 --> 20:31.780
so I had an excuse to get out the house.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.780
And so one of the big things, obviously,

20:33.780 --> 20:35.360
as some of these listeners will know,

20:35.360 --> 20:39.020
is that I obviously emigrated last year to the US.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.660
And one of the primary drivers for that was quality of life.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.780
And it was me being honest with myself, and sort of saying,

20:45.780 --> 20:47.820
and looking at my life as it was,

20:47.820 --> 20:50.140
and saying, am I happy with how this is going?

20:50.140 --> 20:53.340
And would I be willing to try and change some things

20:53.340 --> 20:55.340
to try and improve it?

20:55.340 --> 20:57.340
And then I got this job with Red Hat,

20:57.340 --> 20:59.100
where I'm working from home the whole time.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.340
As in, if I want to never leave the house,

21:02.340 --> 21:05.540
I could literally never leave my front door ever again.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.460
So I've kind of swapped one set of problems

21:07.460 --> 21:12.020
for another set of problems, which is kind of great,

21:12.020 --> 21:14.860
because I don't miss a commute, I'll be perfectly honest.

21:14.860 --> 21:20.220
I miss the kind of disconnection between the office and home,

21:20.220 --> 21:23.180
that 20, 30 minutes, or sometimes two hours.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.960
Clear separation of where you're doing work.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.900
Yeah, I don't miss a commute.

21:27.900 --> 21:28.980
Genuinely, I don't.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.740
But there are some days where you think,

21:30.740 --> 21:32.740
it would be nice to take 20 or 30 minutes.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.580
And a great example of this is, before we recorded

21:35.580 --> 21:38.340
the last self-hosted episode, I went and said to Chris,

21:38.340 --> 21:40.260
look, I just need to take a 20, 30 minute walk

21:40.260 --> 21:42.340
to clear my head and just get some air,

21:42.340 --> 21:44.500
because I actually hadn't left the house that day.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.820
And it was like, what, 4.30 PM at that point?

21:46.820 --> 21:50.420
So there's a bunch of stuff you've got to be cognizant of.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.540
I did that recently, and I should do it more often,

21:52.540 --> 21:55.900
because I have found I have a huge resistance to doing it.

21:55.900 --> 21:58.340
But if I go and then come back, not only

21:58.340 --> 22:01.380
do I feel good for actually having gotten it done,

22:01.380 --> 22:03.340
and that gives me a bit of a boost,

22:03.340 --> 22:07.180
but I tend to have a bit of a temperament or mind

22:07.180 --> 22:08.500
shift on a topic.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.060
And when I got back, I really cranked out a lot of work,

22:11.060 --> 22:12.260
which felt really awesome, too.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.760
So then it was like a double whammy.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.060
And so it felt like it was worth the time,

22:17.060 --> 22:18.660
and it was nice to get a break in the rain.

22:18.660 --> 22:20.580
Brent, you said you were just struggling with this stuff

22:20.580 --> 22:21.660
earlier this morning.

22:21.660 --> 22:25.860
Yeah, I mean, I've been working as a solo photographer now,

22:25.860 --> 22:31.060
I guess, solo photographer slash podcaster for basically ever.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.380
And Alex, you sort of expressed this as well,

22:33.380 --> 22:37.140
but being in your own little office in your house,

22:37.140 --> 22:39.820
or a lot of people feel this at work, too,

22:39.820 --> 22:42.640
you feel kind of isolated somehow.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.260
And so I find myself just really empathizing with everything

22:46.260 --> 22:49.020
you read there, because most of those thoughts

22:49.020 --> 22:51.660
that he expressed, I was thinking just this morning,

22:51.660 --> 22:56.260
like, oh, jeez, I can't do the 20 minutes of yoga

22:56.260 --> 22:58.740
that my body is craving that I know helps me

22:58.740 --> 23:00.460
throughout the day, because I feel

23:00.460 --> 23:02.820
like I have too many things that I need to get done,

23:02.820 --> 23:07.740
and those 20 minutes feel really precious.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.660
But I think sometimes I remind myself

23:09.660 --> 23:12.340
that, like you were saying, Chris, it's a bit of a trap,

23:12.340 --> 23:15.780
because by taking those 20 minutes to go for a walk

23:15.780 --> 23:19.500
or to eat a healthy meal or something like that,

23:19.500 --> 23:23.780
your future minutes are actually spent far better.

23:23.780 --> 23:26.140
And when you're just overloaded with work,

23:26.140 --> 23:28.380
I think it's easy to forget that kind of stuff.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.180
Think about it like painting a wall print.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.860
Like, the prep's the worst part, but once you actually

23:32.860 --> 23:34.940
get there and you do it properly,

23:34.940 --> 23:38.380
take the extra time to prepare for the day properly.

23:38.380 --> 23:40.540
It's a really good point, and I think something we need

23:40.540 --> 23:43.940
to remember every single day.

23:43.940 --> 23:48.580
But I even hit with the topic of social life,

23:48.580 --> 23:52.940
because it feels like often we feel as though we have

23:52.940 --> 23:56.060
some quasi-social interaction through our computers

23:56.060 --> 23:57.660
via the internet and stuff like that.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.740
But it's just not the same, and it doesn't give us the same.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.660
Slow bandwidth.

24:01.660 --> 24:05.220
Yeah, there's not the same human connection

24:05.220 --> 24:06.980
that is life-giving.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.540
Our factual evolved brain's like, oh, this is good.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.620
I'm chatting with people.

24:10.620 --> 24:11.380
I'm very social.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.420
But there's this lower level part of you.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.020
I think we also need to remember, too,

24:15.020 --> 24:17.100
to accept that when working in open source,

24:17.100 --> 24:20.300
there are others in day-to-day life that let other people make

24:20.300 --> 24:22.100
time for their own health and well-being

24:22.100 --> 24:23.980
if you're going to keep interacting with them.

24:23.980 --> 24:25.660
I think there's room for developers

24:25.660 --> 24:28.500
to have a better set of expectations for their users

24:28.500 --> 24:29.780
to be able to set expectations.

24:29.780 --> 24:32.980
And I think there's room for users, a lot of room,

24:32.980 --> 24:36.180
for users to adjust their expectations of open source

24:36.180 --> 24:36.740
projects.

24:36.740 --> 24:40.020
And a lot of people blame GitHub and the GitHub model for this,

24:40.020 --> 24:42.660
but I actually think you could use that same argument,

24:42.660 --> 24:45.260
say people could be spending the time to look into who's

24:45.260 --> 24:46.460
contributing to this project.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.460
Do the freaking math and realize it's one developer

24:48.460 --> 24:49.780
and set their expectations accordingly.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.740
Once you start using it, say like, this is important to me.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.240
How do I make sure that this project

24:53.240 --> 24:54.380
is healthy and maintainable?

24:54.380 --> 24:54.980
Yeah.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.020
Yeah, really.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.980
The other thing I feel is important is collaboration.

24:58.980 --> 25:01.780
It feels like when two people are working on a project,

25:01.780 --> 25:05.460
it's far better than two isolated people working

25:05.460 --> 25:06.340
on a project.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.660
The throughput is more than twice the times, right?

25:09.660 --> 25:11.660
And someone can cover the other person

25:11.660 --> 25:14.260
while they're taking some downtime and that kind of thing.

25:14.260 --> 25:17.380
And really, healthy collaboration

25:17.380 --> 25:21.180
is often not given the right kind of praise.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.420
Well, remind me, let's pick this back up in the post-show

25:23.420 --> 25:25.540
because I think we all probably have more thoughts on this.

25:25.540 --> 25:28.020
And this is probably, we could expand this conversation a bit.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.980
But I think we should get back on the main track

25:29.980 --> 25:32.860
here because we have a lot to get to.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.860
But I think this is a very important conversation

25:34.860 --> 25:37.620
and then we can pick it back up here in a little bit.

25:37.620 --> 25:40.260
And it's one that keeps cropping up every few months.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.980
Yeah, I don't think this will be the last episode we talk about.

25:41.980 --> 25:44.980
We could go through and make so many examples.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.460
But it's good to see in the case of Rust

25:47.460 --> 25:49.580
that a resolution is there.

25:49.580 --> 25:50.700
Things are moving forward.

25:50.700 --> 25:51.780
People are talking.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.420
I think was some learning happened.

25:54.420 --> 25:58.420
So in this case, and I think I really

25:58.420 --> 26:05.180
want to commend Drew Duvall for posting that very honest.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.420
I mean, he took the time out of all those other tasks

26:07.420 --> 26:09.140
to write this retrospective blog post

26:09.140 --> 26:11.620
and share some of his private personal feelings on this.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.820
Yeah, that takes a lot.

26:12.820 --> 26:15.100
And I think that's the exact kind of thing that

26:15.100 --> 26:18.540
can help us have a better connection with these developers,

26:18.540 --> 26:21.260
help us empathize a little bit more with their position.

26:21.260 --> 26:24.700
So I think that actually him being vulnerable like that,

26:24.700 --> 26:26.500
I think really kind of, see, look at that.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.820
It's an episode of vulnerability.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.140
Vulnerability helps everybody.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.700
Every now and then a little vulnerability is good.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.620
Oh, is it that time?

26:33.620 --> 26:34.620
That's right.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.060
It's time for housekeeping.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.220
Few things to mention today.

26:38.220 --> 26:41.460
I want to plug the outrageously awesome Telegram group

26:41.460 --> 26:43.780
that we have raging now at jupiterbroadcasting.com

26:43.780 --> 26:46.700
slash Telegram, having a really fun conversation in there

26:46.700 --> 26:48.980
this morning about Project Off Grid,

26:48.980 --> 26:52.420
which is something I'm working on, and a few other things.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.060
Sometimes we make a few jokes.

26:54.060 --> 26:56.260
People like to give me a hard time every now and then.

26:56.260 --> 26:56.760
You never.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.860
Pokey pops in there, teases me, that kind of stuff.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.220
So that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com

27:01.220 --> 27:02.260
slash Telegram.

27:02.260 --> 27:03.620
A lot of the crew hangs in there.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.300
So we're hanging.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.460
Yeah, come chat with us.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.000
It's like the JB water cooler, only instead of a water cooler,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.340
it's a town water tower, because it's really

27:12.340 --> 27:15.500
kind of the population of like a small town, like a small.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.460
All crammed in there.

27:16.460 --> 27:16.740
Yeah.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.940
And they've got a lot to say.

27:17.940 --> 27:18.860
And then we just got.

27:18.860 --> 27:19.620
Yeah.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.940
Sprinkle a little Linux on top.

27:21.940 --> 27:22.440
Yeah.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.740
Few bots to keep the order.

27:24.740 --> 27:25.580
And it's all good.

27:25.580 --> 27:28.660
So that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.540
Do we have anything else for the housekeeping?

27:31.540 --> 27:33.860
Go check out Self Hosted, selfhosted.show,

27:33.860 --> 27:37.140
where I give a major Project Off Grid update probably

27:37.140 --> 27:39.260
in the next episode by the time this is coming out.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.140
I don't know.

27:40.140 --> 27:42.180
Time math is hard, because we're recording ahead.

27:42.180 --> 27:44.900
So I don't know how it works.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.420
Time is just a construct, man.

27:46.420 --> 27:47.700
Yeah.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.820
Not going to get held down by it.

27:50.820 --> 27:53.060
New media.

27:53.060 --> 27:53.700
Right?

27:53.700 --> 27:56.420
All right, so how did we get to free software from shareware?

27:56.420 --> 27:58.860
Those of us that remember the term shareware,

27:58.860 --> 28:03.440
remember an era of software that you would download and maybe

28:03.440 --> 28:05.020
use it for a certain amount of time,

28:05.020 --> 28:07.580
and then you get a pop-up, or maybe you could do certain kinds

28:07.580 --> 28:08.100
of functions.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.980
There's a lot of different types of shareware.

28:09.980 --> 28:14.540
Eggware, crippleware, trialware, donationware, negware.

28:14.540 --> 28:17.700
You know what's funny is this is a topic that is literally

28:17.700 --> 28:20.220
about as old as I am.

28:20.220 --> 28:24.860
And it goes back to an early era of the industry

28:24.860 --> 28:27.660
that was still figuring out how to even distribute software

28:27.660 --> 28:32.940
pre-internet, pre-CD-ROM, so you didn't have a lot of capacity.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.420
Everything was on floppies.

28:35.420 --> 28:37.340
And then BBSs came along, and then stores

28:37.340 --> 28:38.740
started to come along.

28:38.740 --> 28:42.460
So we thought it'd be great to go back in time.

28:42.460 --> 28:53.140
I think it was somewhere back in 1988-ish.

28:53.140 --> 28:54.820
That's right.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.940
We go to the authorities, the Computer Chronicles,

28:56.940 --> 29:01.300
in which they have an episode dedicated to shareware,

29:01.300 --> 29:04.380
and their struggle to figure exactly what it was.

29:04.380 --> 29:04.980
Oh, it's great.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.300
Why are you giving this away?

29:06.300 --> 29:07.300
How does it work?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.140
How is this even possible?

29:09.140 --> 29:10.740
Do those people take advantage?

29:10.740 --> 29:12.100
Is there a trade of money?

29:12.100 --> 29:13.420
Today, we're going to take a look

29:13.420 --> 29:15.380
at some of the best examples of shareware,

29:15.380 --> 29:17.820
both for the IBM PC and the Macintosh,

29:17.820 --> 29:20.220
and we'll meet the man who helped create the concept, Jim

29:20.220 --> 29:20.900
Button.

29:20.900 --> 29:24.060
Jim Button gets a lot of credit for coining the term shareware,

29:24.060 --> 29:24.860
doesn't he?

29:24.860 --> 29:26.980
Yeah, and it's a little bit complicated,

29:26.980 --> 29:30.060
because he was an IBM employee back in the 80s,

29:30.060 --> 29:32.940
and he wrote a program to help his local church congregation.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.300
And as we were just talking about,

29:34.300 --> 29:36.940
demand for his program consumed too much of his time,

29:36.940 --> 29:40.300
so he left IBM and created his company, Buttonware,

29:40.300 --> 29:42.380
released his first program, PC File,

29:42.380 --> 29:43.900
which was like a flat file database.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.980
I don't know, old technology, right?

29:45.980 --> 29:49.020
In 1982, he called that user-supported software.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.820
And it really was one of the first examples.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.940
There were a couple other terms thrown around, freeware,

29:52.940 --> 29:53.940
but that was copyright.

29:53.940 --> 29:57.860
So eventually, it landed on shareware.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.540
Johnny Ginson, the city of now, the man

29:59.540 --> 30:01.540
they sometimes call the father of shareware,

30:01.540 --> 30:03.500
Jim Button, CEO of Buttonware.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.340
And next to Jim is Russell DeMaria, author of the book

30:06.340 --> 30:07.660
Public Domain Software.

30:07.660 --> 30:08.380
Gary?

30:08.380 --> 30:10.060
Jim, what's the background behind shareware?

30:10.060 --> 30:11.220
Where'd it come from?

30:11.220 --> 30:14.020
Shareware started really in 1982.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.940
And I think Andrew Flugelman probably

30:15.940 --> 30:19.200
was first with the idea out of San Francisco,

30:19.200 --> 30:23.300
and he produced a product called PC Talk.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.700
It was the first shareware product on the market.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.140
There was no free software.

30:27.140 --> 30:29.420
There was no open source.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.820
There was really not even an agreed-upon way

30:31.820 --> 30:33.220
to distribute the software.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.580
No, and most of the software you're

30:34.580 --> 30:36.200
going to get at this time, well, it all

30:36.200 --> 30:38.020
came from big commercial software houses

30:38.020 --> 30:41.060
with expensive price tags because it was business users.

30:41.060 --> 30:44.260
This was at the dawn of personal computing.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.060
And the software originally with shareware was very generous.

30:48.060 --> 30:50.580
Some of it was run for as long as you want.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.020
There's a few examples of that still.

30:52.020 --> 30:55.500
WinRAR comes from that era.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.740
But people, just like some now, struggle

30:58.740 --> 31:00.340
to understand free software.

31:00.340 --> 31:02.300
Back then, struggled to understand

31:02.300 --> 31:04.740
the concept of shareware.

31:04.740 --> 31:06.940
And Button says, well, think of it really

31:06.940 --> 31:09.180
as just a marketing term.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.500
Shareware is a distribution method

31:11.500 --> 31:15.460
and is primarily a way of distributing full function

31:15.460 --> 31:17.420
demo disks.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.140
Users are invited to share the full function

31:20.140 --> 31:22.380
disks with all of their friends and to use them

31:22.380 --> 31:23.940
in the comforts of their home.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.700
Money changes hands when the user decides that he really

31:26.700 --> 31:30.100
likes the program, wants to put it into productive use,

31:30.100 --> 31:32.460
and develop a relationship with the author, which

31:32.460 --> 31:34.740
would include technical support, printed manual,

31:34.740 --> 31:35.660
and things like that.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.620
And what are the typical prices for a package?

31:38.620 --> 31:41.900
Shareware prices go all the way from $15 to $20

31:41.900 --> 31:45.340
up to there's one product on the market that's $100.

31:45.340 --> 31:46.940
Doesn't that sound familiar?

31:46.940 --> 31:48.020
Hey, use it if you want.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.540
If you like it, help out.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.420
Yeah.

31:50.420 --> 31:53.580
And you never really saw shareware as a concept really

31:53.580 --> 31:56.620
take off on the Linux desktop crossover?

31:56.620 --> 31:58.420
I guess you could technically say, does it?

31:58.420 --> 32:00.380
They let you try it for 30 days or something like that?

32:00.380 --> 32:03.940
And there's a few helpful but proprietary applications

32:03.940 --> 32:05.780
or source not available that are floating out.

32:05.780 --> 32:07.280
But they're definitely the exception.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.020
Yeah.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.220
When shareware was really getting going,

32:10.220 --> 32:11.760
there was all these different schemes,

32:11.760 --> 32:14.220
like we mentioned here at the top, all these different ways

32:14.220 --> 32:15.700
of doing things.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.140
And the more successful the app was,

32:18.140 --> 32:20.620
the more riskier shareware model they could take.

32:20.620 --> 32:22.100
But what about, you were telling us

32:22.100 --> 32:24.100
about the decompression and the compression software,

32:24.100 --> 32:25.700
about how depending on what you're going to do with it,

32:25.700 --> 32:26.660
you have a different price?

32:26.660 --> 32:29.940
Yeah, Stuffit in particular, Ray Lau, who wrote the program,

32:29.940 --> 32:31.540
has a very nice scheme.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.740
If you're just using it to decompress files

32:33.740 --> 32:36.600
that you're getting from some online service or elsewhere,

32:36.600 --> 32:37.420
it's free.

32:37.420 --> 32:39.440
And there is no donation requested.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.940
If you're using it to archive files to upload,

32:42.940 --> 32:45.360
then he requests $18.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.420
This doesn't actually even seem that far

32:47.420 --> 32:48.820
from the free core model.

32:48.820 --> 32:49.340
No, right?

32:49.340 --> 32:50.580
It's a natural analog.

32:50.580 --> 32:51.920
Hey, here's some basic features.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.300
If you want more, well, we want you to help us maintain

32:54.300 --> 32:55.460
and make this sustainable.

32:55.460 --> 33:00.580
But yeah, I kind of became aware of the shareware industry

33:00.580 --> 33:05.300
when it was sort of in the CD-ROM era, when it went big time.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.580
The CD-ROM revolution meant that you

33:08.580 --> 33:12.380
could pack and ship hundreds of shareware applications

33:12.380 --> 33:14.020
on a single CD-ROM.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.920
And the way it could be sold was the entire applications

33:16.920 --> 33:19.420
on this disk, look at all these great applications, everything

33:19.420 --> 33:23.260
you would ever need is on the CD-ROM.

33:23.260 --> 33:26.500
And the companies that nailed that,

33:26.500 --> 33:28.900
and you would have the really, really sweet shareware

33:28.900 --> 33:33.660
companies, would have books that you would order, like magazines.

33:33.660 --> 33:35.540
And you could go through that, and the magazine

33:35.540 --> 33:36.980
might come with a CD-ROM.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.180
And I'm not talking like a thin magazine.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.700
I'm talking like a Sears catalog.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.420
Put on some music, kick back.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.700
Look at all the options.

33:43.700 --> 33:44.420
Yeah, it was.

33:44.420 --> 33:47.000
And of course, there was BBSs that were dedicated to this.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.380
And of course, there was Warez sites

33:49.380 --> 33:51.760
that were dedicated to trading a lot of the keys to unlock

33:51.760 --> 33:52.820
or crack the shareware.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.100
Right.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.500
Just still kind of a thing in the Windows world.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.300
And so when I came along, it was kind of during this part

33:59.300 --> 34:01.740
where the internet hadn't really become a thing yet.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.020
But that really changed the game, too, especially dial-up.

34:05.020 --> 34:09.980
My dad and I used to have like a collection of shareware apps

34:09.980 --> 34:11.860
that we loved that whenever we could,

34:11.860 --> 34:13.320
we'd buy like the family edition,

34:13.320 --> 34:15.620
and we'd share that because that became a thing for a while,

34:15.620 --> 34:17.500
too, to get a family license for this.

34:17.500 --> 34:22.380
But the thing that I witnessed was the biznification,

34:22.380 --> 34:25.500
where a business could come in and make a sweet offer

34:25.500 --> 34:28.500
to a developer and say, we want to buy

34:28.500 --> 34:31.020
a year's worth of your software where you develop it,

34:31.020 --> 34:34.780
but we rebrand it, different icon, different name,

34:34.780 --> 34:37.140
and we bundle it with other shareware.

34:37.140 --> 34:38.820
And then we'll even put it in a box,

34:38.820 --> 34:40.500
and we'll put it on the shelf, and you'll

34:40.500 --> 34:42.300
get a cut of the sales.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.660
So the shareware developer would maintain a public shareware

34:45.660 --> 34:47.620
edition of their software.

34:47.620 --> 34:50.460
And then there would be like a sneaky rebranded version

34:50.460 --> 34:57.380
that would be sold in a box, and these big shareware middlemen

34:57.380 --> 34:58.180
would come in.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.460
They were huge operations.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.620
They would come in and organize all of it,

35:01.620 --> 35:05.420
the deals with the shipping companies, the magazines,

35:05.420 --> 35:07.580
the deal with CompUSA or whoever it

35:07.580 --> 35:09.380
was that was going to put it on the shelf.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.180
They would manage all of that.

35:11.180 --> 35:14.420
And one of the bigger ones, you might remember

35:14.420 --> 35:20.060
if you're from my era, was a company called PC SIG.

35:20.060 --> 35:23.180
If you've ever bought shareware, chances are fairly good

35:23.180 --> 35:24.940
that you got it from here.

35:24.940 --> 35:28.620
This is PC SIG, the world's largest shareware distributor

35:28.620 --> 35:32.660
with a library of over 25,000 programs and sales

35:32.660 --> 35:35.380
of some 1,000 disks each day.

35:35.380 --> 35:37.900
Well, shareware is the alternative to the high price

35:37.900 --> 35:39.420
commercial spread.

35:39.420 --> 35:41.500
The shareware programs that are now available

35:41.500 --> 35:44.540
are equal, if not better, than a lot of the commercial programs

35:44.540 --> 35:47.460
on the market, and hundreds of dollars

35:47.460 --> 35:49.500
less when it comes to registration.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.940
PC SIG is the conduit between shareware authors and users,

35:53.940 --> 35:56.940
handling the marketing and advertising for the authors

35:56.940 --> 35:59.740
and guaranteeing quality for the customers.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.700
When we get a program in here that's submitted,

36:02.700 --> 36:03.940
it goes through our librarian.

36:03.940 --> 36:04.700
He looks it over.

36:04.700 --> 36:09.140
If it meets what we consider to be good shareware standards,

36:09.140 --> 36:11.860
he then sends it out to an independent reviewer.

36:11.860 --> 36:15.900
Then it's reviewed again before it's placed in the catalog.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.860
Everything sold here is also supported by full-time staffers.

36:19.860 --> 36:21.300
Technical support.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.700
PC SIG's success has allowed it to branch out

36:23.700 --> 36:25.140
into some new areas.

36:25.140 --> 36:28.220
It now publishes a bi-monthly magazine.

36:28.220 --> 36:33.740
You can buy all 25,000 programs at once on this CD-ROM disk.

36:33.740 --> 36:37.900
And you can buy some of the titles now in retail stores.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.580
And the company has also branched out

36:39.580 --> 36:42.980
into the business of selling hard-to-find videos.

36:42.980 --> 36:46.140
In other words, shareware has been very good to PC SIG.

36:46.140 --> 36:48.620
It's come a long way from the founder's garage

36:48.620 --> 36:52.620
to a company now making several million dollars a year.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.420
In Sunnyvale, California, for the Computer Chronicles,

36:55.420 --> 36:57.820
I'm Wendy Woods.

36:57.820 --> 36:59.420
Oh, the short reign that they had.

37:02.060 --> 37:03.660
I love that sound at the end there.

37:03.660 --> 37:06.060
That was floppy disk moving on an assembly line.

37:06.060 --> 37:06.700
Yeah, right?

37:06.700 --> 37:07.200
Yeah.

37:07.200 --> 37:11.340
I mean, I tell you, the method of shipping software

37:11.340 --> 37:14.860
has changed, and so it has really changed

37:14.860 --> 37:17.380
the entire software industry.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.540
And the growth of open source and Linux

37:19.540 --> 37:21.380
kind of rocked all of this.

37:21.380 --> 37:23.500
There was a period of time where commercial software

37:23.500 --> 37:27.300
was the default. Closed source software was the default.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.940
And even in the Unix era, it was keeping your own innovations.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.660
That was really the default. It wasn't

37:33.660 --> 37:37.180
until really a bit of a revolution

37:37.180 --> 37:39.780
came along and changed everything.

37:39.780 --> 37:41.580
We do have one sector that is taking off today.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.900
It is the Linux-related sector.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.780
And I thought this might be a good opportunity

37:45.780 --> 37:47.540
to say, what is Linux?

37:47.540 --> 37:49.260
And I'll answer this question for you.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.640
Many of you probably already know,

37:50.640 --> 37:53.300
but there are 12 million users out there, a computer operating

37:53.300 --> 37:56.420
system developed by hundreds of programmers collaborating

37:56.420 --> 37:59.300
on the internet, a challenge to Microsoft Windows NT,

37:59.300 --> 38:01.420
very popular for its speed.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.720
And so this is what the craze is about.

38:03.720 --> 38:08.060
The internet combined with the free software movement

38:08.060 --> 38:12.620
and Linux and then the explosion of the web in the late 90s

38:12.620 --> 38:16.580
was all perfectly timed to fundamentally shift

38:16.580 --> 38:19.580
value of software and the entire software industry.

38:19.580 --> 38:22.100
And during this transition, shareware

38:22.100 --> 38:25.140
as a normal concept of software distribution

38:25.140 --> 38:28.780
sort of became an ancient idea that very few things.

38:28.780 --> 38:29.280
Right.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.900
It's interesting when you think, too, how you interact with it.

38:31.900 --> 38:35.140
Shareware, the focus is on delivery of the application

38:35.140 --> 38:37.200
as its runtime, a running executable,

38:37.200 --> 38:39.980
because it's filling some business need.

38:39.980 --> 38:43.980
But as computers came more and more into our lives,

38:43.980 --> 38:46.140
the need to have that freedom and to be able to modify

38:46.140 --> 38:49.020
and control things, that becomes a lot more important.

38:49.020 --> 38:49.860
Yeah.

38:49.860 --> 38:54.660
And the shift, again, to hosted services versus selling

38:54.660 --> 38:57.140
directly to consumers, there's more value now

38:57.140 --> 38:59.660
in building something that runs on a back end

38:59.660 --> 39:02.180
than, in most cases, than building something

39:02.180 --> 39:04.220
that consumers use directly in terms of software.

39:04.220 --> 39:07.620
Not in all cases, but it's been a big shift.

39:07.620 --> 39:11.620
And if it wasn't for it, imagine.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.700
I mean, just the world's so much better off for it.

39:13.700 --> 39:17.420
I encourage everyone to watch Revolution OS

39:17.420 --> 39:20.740
if you haven't watched it or you haven't watched it recently.

39:20.740 --> 39:22.380
Boy, is it a time capsule.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.780
But it perfectly covers, and I wish

39:24.780 --> 39:25.740
we could play a lot of clips from it,

39:25.740 --> 39:27.140
but they'd slam us for copyright.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.140
But it perfectly covers this transition period

39:30.140 --> 39:31.780
we're talking about, this period of time.

39:31.780 --> 39:36.340
It really captured it, captured the mentality.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.940
And it really kind of reminds us of the wars

39:39.940 --> 39:41.420
we were fighting back then with Solaris

39:41.420 --> 39:42.500
and the different Unixs.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.900
And it's just really something.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.020
We've come a long way.

39:46.020 --> 39:49.740
I mean, we could have been in a world where Windows NT just

39:49.740 --> 39:50.940
consumed everything.

39:50.940 --> 39:52.540
It was kind of close for a while.

39:52.540 --> 39:54.100
Yeah, did you notice in that clip,

39:54.100 --> 39:58.140
they're talking about NT and hundreds of developers?

39:58.140 --> 39:59.740
It's so quaint.

39:59.740 --> 40:01.780
It really is something special.

40:01.780 --> 40:04.940
So shareware eventually faded away,

40:04.940 --> 40:06.100
and it's not completely gone.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.220
But I think the big default became the transition

40:09.220 --> 40:11.860
to open source software for not just server-side development,

40:11.860 --> 40:13.420
but really for anything that you wanted

40:13.420 --> 40:15.700
to get a large market adoption.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.140
It kind of just became the default.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.780
Right, and I think having easier modes of communication,

40:19.780 --> 40:20.300
that helps.

40:20.300 --> 40:22.420
Because before, let's say you had your source there.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.460
That might be nice, but probably 80% of the people

40:24.460 --> 40:25.860
you shipped your shareware to, they

40:25.860 --> 40:27.900
weren't going to have the tooling or knowledge

40:27.900 --> 40:29.820
to be able to modify that.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.580
But now anyone who's interested has easy ways

40:31.580 --> 40:33.700
to participate in a code base that's open.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.460
So much has shifted because of the way

40:35.460 --> 40:37.620
we can distribute software over the internet

40:37.620 --> 40:40.420
and then interact directly with the people that are distributing

40:40.420 --> 40:44.420
that software, and then build wikis and forums around that

40:44.420 --> 40:45.580
to help people get it set up.

40:45.580 --> 40:48.580
And it's just such a huge shift from when

40:48.580 --> 40:51.660
you were getting it in a disk in a bag in a little shop

40:51.660 --> 40:53.900
somewhere, or buying it from a developer

40:53.900 --> 40:56.460
and downloading it over your modem using

40:56.460 --> 40:58.220
GitRite, which was also shareware.

40:58.220 --> 41:01.500
Best downloader I had back in the day was GitRite.

41:01.500 --> 41:05.780
And classic shareware games like Doom,

41:05.780 --> 41:07.300
that was how Doom monetized.

41:07.300 --> 41:09.220
You could get the first few levels.

41:09.220 --> 41:11.140
It was like in-app purchases now.

41:11.140 --> 41:12.420
Oh my god, what's old is new.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.180
Holy crap.

41:13.180 --> 41:13.780
I don't know if you remember this.

41:13.780 --> 41:15.220
You can actually, we'll have a link in the show notes.

41:15.220 --> 41:18.260
There's a version on archive.org in DOSBox.

41:18.260 --> 41:19.860
It's the shareware version of Doom.

41:19.860 --> 41:22.260
And so the first bit of Doom, the first level,

41:22.260 --> 41:25.180
or 10 levels, I can't remember, was free.

41:25.180 --> 41:27.820
And then if you wanted to play all of the other levels,

41:27.820 --> 41:31.740
you had to pay for the shareware.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.660
It's kind of not unusual when you think of it

41:34.660 --> 41:36.140
in the terms of apps on mobile devices.

41:36.140 --> 41:36.940
No, not at all.

41:36.940 --> 41:40.580
That's how the new Mario run and Mario games work on the phone.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.340
It's like you get the first couple levels.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.340
And if you want to play all of them,

41:43.340 --> 41:44.660
you've got to pay the in-app purchase.

41:44.660 --> 41:46.980
I guess there's just some core models that work.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.220
And it comes back to talking about marketing.

41:50.220 --> 41:53.980
It's a way to get your stuff out there, to try before you buy,

41:53.980 --> 41:56.500
but then still have a way back to actually support

41:56.500 --> 41:58.900
continued development.

41:58.900 --> 42:00.500
Oh, Wes.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.180
I love running those old clips.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.860
It's very nostalgic.

42:03.860 --> 42:05.500
Computer Chronicles was great.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.780
But I think, do we have a link to that full video?

42:07.780 --> 42:08.300
We should.

42:08.300 --> 42:08.620
Yeah.

42:08.620 --> 42:11.380
We should put a full link in the show notes to that.

42:11.380 --> 42:11.860
All right.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.180
Well, why don't we get to our picks

42:13.180 --> 42:15.300
before we get out of here in this special edition?

42:15.300 --> 42:16.220
Yeah, because it turns out, you know what?

42:16.220 --> 42:18.140
We do live in the current day.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.700
We have access to tons of great open source software.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.100
And this is the part of the show where we tell you about it.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.460
Picks, guys.

42:24.460 --> 42:25.220
Pick over.

42:25.220 --> 42:26.780
Well, that's why it's picks and not pick.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.300
This is, oh, OK.

42:28.300 --> 42:28.860
All right.

42:28.860 --> 42:29.460
OK.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.900
Well, this first one's pretty great, especially for those

42:31.900 --> 42:33.500
of us who think the terminal's the future.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.940
Hashtag terminal future.

42:35.940 --> 42:37.300
That sounds bad.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.780
That doesn't sound good.

42:38.780 --> 42:39.900
That doesn't sound good.

42:39.900 --> 42:42.740
So this first one's called BROOT, B-R-O-O-T.

42:42.740 --> 42:44.740
I was going to try to make Wes say it, but he didn't speak up.

42:44.740 --> 42:46.100
So then I had to say it.

42:46.100 --> 42:49.500
And it gives you an overview of a directory, even a big one,

42:49.500 --> 42:51.620
in a really nice, concise, readable way.

42:51.620 --> 42:51.820
Right.

42:51.820 --> 42:53.740
Think of it as a combination of maybe something

42:53.740 --> 42:58.060
like if you used ncdo to manage and clean up files, which

42:58.060 --> 43:00.460
shows you an interactive, Curses-based application

43:00.460 --> 43:02.420
to drill down and get to sizes.

43:02.420 --> 43:02.740
I do.

43:02.740 --> 43:03.500
Do you ncdo?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.260
Oh, yeah, of course.

43:05.260 --> 43:07.820
And if you've maybe used the tree command,

43:07.820 --> 43:10.380
it prints you a little tree of the directory structure.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.020
BROOT's something of a combination of those,

43:12.020 --> 43:14.020
but it's a very interactive environment.

43:14.020 --> 43:15.300
So you can drill down.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.060
It stores past locations.

43:17.060 --> 43:19.580
It's like the tree file viewer manager for your terminal.

43:19.580 --> 43:21.580
You never knew you wanted.

43:21.580 --> 43:22.100
I'm sorry.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.420
I'm just distracted by your special edition outfit

43:24.420 --> 43:25.220
that you wore today.

43:25.220 --> 43:25.740
It's just.

43:25.740 --> 43:26.500
Isn't it nice?

43:26.500 --> 43:27.020
Yeah.

43:27.020 --> 43:28.620
I mean, it's nice, except for the sequences

43:28.620 --> 43:30.260
are a little bit much, because we have the lights on.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.940
So that's a bit much, but.

43:31.940 --> 43:32.660
Yeah, but I didn't.

43:32.660 --> 43:34.740
I mean, did you even know they made this color?

43:34.740 --> 43:37.380
No, I did not.

43:37.380 --> 43:38.940
I don't even know how you found that.

43:38.940 --> 43:40.780
All right, well, we have another pic here.

43:40.780 --> 43:45.100
This one is, again, hashtag terminal future.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.740
Oh, that's not good.

43:46.740 --> 43:49.900
And I don't know how we say this one.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.380
How come I'm always the dumb ass that has to read the names?

43:52.380 --> 43:54.940
I think it's Tizonia.

43:54.940 --> 43:57.380
I was going to say that, or Tizona.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.380
Tizona?

43:58.380 --> 43:59.740
Tizonia?

43:59.740 --> 44:00.700
Yeah.

44:00.700 --> 44:03.860
It's a cloud music streamer for your terminal.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.540
So if you got your spotifiers, or your Google Play

44:06.540 --> 44:09.700
musics, or your sound clouds, or your YouTubes,

44:09.700 --> 44:11.340
maybe you got a Plex, maybe you want

44:11.340 --> 44:12.700
to Chromecast this business.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.660
I do, I do.

44:13.660 --> 44:15.300
Well, who wants to do it in a GUI

44:15.300 --> 44:16.660
when you can do it in the terminal, right cheese?

44:16.660 --> 44:17.180
Boom.

44:17.180 --> 44:18.060
Cheesify it.

44:18.060 --> 44:19.020
Absolutely.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.060
That's what we're going to call when you put stuff

44:20.060 --> 44:21.460
in the terminal, we're just cheesifying it.

44:21.460 --> 44:22.420
Cheesifying it?

44:22.420 --> 44:22.940
I like it.

44:22.940 --> 44:24.020
I'll go with that term.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.620
When you can take something and do it in the terminal,

44:26.620 --> 44:28.340
that's putting a slice of cheese on it.

44:28.340 --> 44:29.020
That's what we're doing.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.940
Putting a slice of cheese on your music app.

44:30.940 --> 44:33.900
Oh, looks like they've got Docker, Snap packages,

44:33.900 --> 44:36.300
Ubuntu packages, even one for Raspbian.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.180
Well, it says right here on the website, too,

44:38.180 --> 44:40.300
that it's the most powerful cloud music player.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.780
So power's good, right?

44:42.780 --> 44:44.100
I mean, you're welcome, everybody.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.300
What else do you need to know?

44:45.300 --> 44:46.420
It's the most powerful.

44:46.420 --> 44:49.820
And apparently, it's the first implementation of OpenMAX

44:49.820 --> 44:52.980
Hill 1.2, which I don't know what that is.

44:52.980 --> 44:55.660
But it's the first implementation of it.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.740
So it's a standard for integration

44:57.740 --> 44:59.700
of multimedia components into media frameworks

44:59.700 --> 45:01.540
to simplify development of audio, video encoders,

45:01.540 --> 45:02.140
and decoders.

45:02.140 --> 45:02.820
Duh, cheese.

45:02.820 --> 45:06.540
Yeah, from the Khronos Group, everybody knows that.

45:06.540 --> 45:07.860
Everybody knows the mobile market

45:07.860 --> 45:10.180
is constantly evolving and demanding ever-increasing

45:10.180 --> 45:13.100
multimedia functionality and performance cheese.

45:13.100 --> 45:15.900
Duh, why am I even here?

45:15.900 --> 45:16.900
Slug out.

45:16.900 --> 45:18.700
Do your homework.

45:18.700 --> 45:21.700
Anyways, we'll put a link to Blot, right?

45:21.700 --> 45:22.700
Was that the first one?

45:22.700 --> 45:23.180
Brut.

45:23.180 --> 45:24.060
Oh, yeah, whatever.

45:24.060 --> 45:24.900
Brut.

45:24.900 --> 45:26.140
I'm going to make you use it now.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.700
You're just being so mean to the poor thing.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.500
Well, I've already got NCDU, and I got DF.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.660
I don't need this crap.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.300
But it's fine.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.100
It's fine.

45:32.100 --> 45:35.740
You want to put it in my show, it's fine.

45:35.740 --> 45:37.140
We've been streaming for too long.

45:37.140 --> 45:41.380
And then Tizona, which just sounds like a delicious calzone.

45:41.380 --> 45:41.900
Oh, wait.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.260
Brut's written in Rust, so there you go.

45:43.260 --> 45:44.260
You'll change your mind now.

45:44.260 --> 45:44.740
Oh, I love it.

45:44.740 --> 45:45.260
Oh, OK.

45:45.260 --> 45:46.140
Pfft.

45:46.140 --> 45:48.020
All right, why didn't you say so earlier?

45:48.020 --> 45:48.420
That's great.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.340
Have you guys heard of Brut?

45:49.340 --> 45:51.900
It's a really nice way to view the director's even,

45:51.900 --> 45:52.820
even big ones.

45:52.820 --> 45:53.620
Check it out.

45:53.620 --> 45:56.340
We'll have a link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com

45:56.340 --> 45:58.540
slash 328.

45:58.540 --> 46:00.900
Over there at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe is where you

46:00.900 --> 46:01.420
can get it.

46:01.420 --> 46:03.020
338.

46:03.020 --> 46:05.220
You know what?

46:05.220 --> 46:06.620
No, we're changing this.

46:06.620 --> 46:07.620
Never mind.

46:07.620 --> 46:09.900
We're starting over.

46:09.900 --> 46:10.540
All right.

46:10.540 --> 46:11.060
All right.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.980
So it's 328.

46:12.980 --> 46:13.820
338.

46:13.820 --> 46:14.340
338.

46:14.340 --> 46:16.420
338.

46:16.420 --> 46:18.300
Where am I?

46:18.300 --> 46:19.500
All right, there you go.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.060
linuxunplug.com slash 338.

46:22.060 --> 46:24.020
I would redo it so that way Joe could clean it up,

46:24.020 --> 46:25.460
but I think we'll just keep it in there like that.

46:25.460 --> 46:27.860
Because we podcast hard for you, and this is the result.

46:27.860 --> 46:28.820
We get a little loopy.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.020
That's what happens.

46:30.020 --> 46:31.220
You'd think the caffeine would keep you

46:31.220 --> 46:32.180
on the straight and narrow.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.820
No, it just slowly destroys you.

46:33.820 --> 46:35.380
And Wes was like, we should be drinking today.

46:35.380 --> 46:38.340
And I was like, no, we've got to stay on the straight and narrow.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.020
Yeah, that's how it went.

46:40.020 --> 46:45.460
Anyways, linuxunplug.com slash 338 for links to everything,

46:45.460 --> 46:47.660
as well as the contact pages over there.

46:47.660 --> 46:50.060
We'll be back live at our regular Tuesday noon

46:50.060 --> 46:50.700
Pacific time.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.940
You can get that converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com

46:52.940 --> 46:54.220
slash calendar.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.420
A massive shout out to our virtual log.

46:56.420 --> 46:58.420
A fantastic showing.

46:58.420 --> 47:00.540
Really appreciate everybody making it.

47:00.540 --> 47:03.740
And each one of you now go to linuxheadlines.show

47:03.740 --> 47:04.820
and subscribe.

47:04.820 --> 47:06.500
It's a good little show.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.620
I feel like I'm proud of it or something.

47:08.620 --> 47:09.620
It's a good show.

47:09.620 --> 47:14.740
Like when you're a parent of a kid or a pet

47:14.740 --> 47:16.460
and you watch them learn something,

47:16.460 --> 47:18.700
you get proud of them, the first time you taught your dog

47:18.700 --> 47:21.460
to piss outside and you're like, I'm so proud of that dog.

47:21.460 --> 47:23.420
That's how I feel about headlines.

47:23.420 --> 47:25.500
It's also just super handy, because sometimes you

47:25.500 --> 47:27.340
don't have time to keep up on the news.

47:27.340 --> 47:30.340
Yeah, and who wants your podcast to piss in the house?

47:30.340 --> 47:31.940
Wow.

47:31.940 --> 47:32.700
Wow.

47:32.700 --> 47:34.700
This has been Linux Unplugged, the podcast that

47:34.700 --> 47:35.940
won't piss in your house.

47:35.940 --> 47:36.940
And headlines only there.

47:36.940 --> 47:37.860
It's really well trained.

47:37.860 --> 47:39.260
It's been domesticated.

47:39.260 --> 47:40.100
And I really like it.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.660
So check it out at linuxheadlines.show.

47:42.660 --> 47:45.060
Go get more Alex and I at selfhosted.show.

47:45.060 --> 47:46.500
And I got one more for you.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.340
A little bit different, though.

47:48.340 --> 47:49.860
Different TLD, so brace yourself.

47:49.860 --> 47:51.340
Techsnap.systems.

47:51.340 --> 47:52.100
What?

47:52.100 --> 47:54.100
Yeah, I didn't even know that systems was a thing.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.020
Turns out it is.

47:55.020 --> 47:56.500
There's so many great things.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.220
Turns out.horse is a thing.

47:58.220 --> 47:59.380
.audio is a thing.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.460
Who knew?

48:00.460 --> 48:01.540
Oh, I guess I did.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.100
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

48:03.100 --> 48:04.800
for the times in the local zone, because we would

48:04.800 --> 48:06.300
like you to join us next week.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

48:08.540 --> 48:09.820
Woo!

48:39.820 --> 48:48.820
The Unplugged Program. Love that song. You know, I'm a big fan now of the longer outros

48:48.820 --> 48:53.780
but the tighter intros. Bring them in nice and short. Over the years, you can chart the

48:53.780 --> 48:58.340
length of the unplugged intro. It's just gotten shorter and shorter and shorter.

48:58.340 --> 49:01.180
Well, you want the intro because you're excited about the content, right? If you're listening

49:01.180 --> 49:04.620
to the podcast, but the outro, that's your nice, the long outro gives you time to pick

49:04.620 --> 49:06.220
what you're going to listen to next.

49:06.220 --> 49:12.340
Well, when we were new at podcasting, we thought, we told ourselves, well, we got to set the

49:12.340 --> 49:17.340
tone. We got to set the mood. So we got to have a nice long intro that really sets the

49:17.340 --> 49:22.520
mood for my great podcast. And you know, you see this on YouTube now, like so many like

49:22.520 --> 49:27.020
YouTubers have these really long intros with fancy graphics.

49:27.020 --> 49:31.420
Hey, Chris. Hey, Chris. Let's get to it. Don't you love it when they say that? Let's get

49:31.420 --> 49:34.140
right to it after like an eight minute intro.

49:34.140 --> 49:39.080
Yeah. So let's get right to it. Yeah, but podcasts do this too. But then what happens

49:39.080 --> 49:44.780
is if you're a listener and you've heard that podcast a hundred times, think about how much

49:44.780 --> 49:48.040
of your life has been just listening to that same intro music, which is coming in in a

49:48.040 --> 49:51.140
compressed MP3 likely or a compressed YouTube video.

49:51.140 --> 49:55.460
But I love it. Like one of the transformation experiences of my year last year was sat in

49:55.460 --> 49:59.140
the studio with you listening to the intro of LUP, recording LUP.

49:59.140 --> 50:02.300
Well, you got to have a little something, I think, you know, you got to, you got to

50:02.300 --> 50:04.980
have a little, you got to have a little something. So that way, when you hear the song, you're

50:04.980 --> 50:08.080
like, oh, that's from the show I like. So you got to have a little something. But I

50:08.080 --> 50:13.100
think where you go long is in the outro where I think the balance is struck really well

50:13.100 --> 50:19.100
is in user air. It's got an identifiable bong right in. But then it's got that beautiful

50:19.100 --> 50:21.980
long outro that I listened to every single time.

50:21.980 --> 50:23.740
Right. You don't have to skip it. You just let it fade out.

50:23.740 --> 50:24.740
I always have.

50:24.740 --> 50:26.220
What was that intro like again?

50:26.220 --> 50:39.900
You're trying to get me. All right. We got to pick our title. JBtitles.com.

50:39.900 --> 50:43.420
You know, when you guys were talking about the shareware and the freeware and stuff.

50:43.420 --> 50:44.420
Yeah, I remember that.

50:44.420 --> 50:47.020
Oh, yeah. And I wanted to come back to the other thing, too.

50:47.020 --> 50:48.300
And you had mentioned WinRAR.

50:48.300 --> 50:49.300
Yeah.

50:49.300 --> 50:50.940
You still haven't paid for years, bud? Oh, man.

50:50.940 --> 50:54.980
It was an adware, right? But the one thing about it that I don't think a lot of people

50:54.980 --> 50:59.860
knew is that if you just right clicked on your file, you could extract it and never

50:59.860 --> 51:00.860
get nagged.

51:00.860 --> 51:06.180
Oh, I think it was classically famous for that. So tag me in the mumble room if you

51:06.180 --> 51:09.420
had other thoughts on the whole developer burnout topic that we discussed, because I

51:09.420 --> 51:14.020
knew a couple other people wanted to jump in on that. Because I think what I really

51:14.020 --> 51:19.420
appreciated about that blog post that we read was it really made me realize that this isn't

51:19.420 --> 51:24.860
a Linux problem or an open source problem. It's a human problem, and you can apply it

51:24.860 --> 51:30.940
to software development. You can apply it to basically everything. Anybody who's in

51:30.940 --> 51:35.580
a situation where there's a lot of those kind of types of dynamics at play. So, Colonel,

51:35.580 --> 51:38.100
I wanted to give you a chance because I saw you had pinged me earlier.

51:38.100 --> 51:44.020
Yeah, I've been thinking for a while now about is there some way that we could maybe the

51:44.020 --> 51:49.340
open source community band together and create an organization that would put a framework

51:49.340 --> 51:56.140
around bringing in volunteers to deal with the non-development side of maintaining a

51:56.140 --> 52:00.900
project. So things like managing the money coming in, managing, creating a foundation

52:00.900 --> 52:06.700
if it gets that far for that project, maybe maintaining the servers for like a website

52:06.700 --> 52:09.900
or a racket chat or something like that.

52:09.900 --> 52:15.740
Yeah. Wes and I were actually just brainstorming this yesterday, and I think we both agreed

52:15.740 --> 52:20.420
it probably wouldn't work, but the idea was is a loose group of volunteers who are kind

52:20.420 --> 52:23.780
of like a team that can come in and say, we can help you get these things set up. They

52:23.780 --> 52:28.100
don't run it for you necessarily, or maybe they get something immediately resolved for

52:28.100 --> 52:33.060
you, but they connect you with the right people to get a foundation established or get a contractor

52:33.060 --> 52:35.460
in to help you with the accounting or something like that.

52:35.460 --> 52:37.660
It strikes me as it's kind of the other side of the coin. You know, we've often talked

52:37.660 --> 52:44.020
about how we have a lot of open source developers, but not always like technical writers or people

52:44.020 --> 52:48.500
to do UI work. Accountants. Yeah, but no one's managing your backlog for you when you have

52:48.500 --> 52:52.740
this open source project. Communications, troubleshooting, tech support. And these are

52:52.740 --> 52:56.780
all important roles. It kind of makes me want to put it together. You know what I mean?

52:56.780 --> 52:59.900
Like I want to put together a strike team that like comes, but then we started talking

52:59.900 --> 53:03.260
about it. We're like, you know, a lot of these developers are pretty proud of doing it their

53:03.260 --> 53:07.020
own way. That's the other part is it's not for work. You're not getting, right? It's

53:07.020 --> 53:10.220
your project and there's a little more ownership and care. And it's kind of like, Hey, knock,

53:10.220 --> 53:14.980
knock, we noticed you're doing a bad job. Would you like us to help you solve it? I mean that,

53:14.980 --> 53:18.460
you know, you'd have to really be careful on who you approached, how you approached

53:18.460 --> 53:21.940
it. Gotta be, gotta be respectful. Yeah. But maybe if you'd done it long enough, you'd

53:21.940 --> 53:25.620
have a reputation where people would come to you. But I kind of was thinking something

53:25.620 --> 53:29.380
along the same lines, Colonel. It would be nice to have a little organization that could

53:29.380 --> 53:34.540
pop in and just help manage that. All right. Uh, we'll do drifter first and then we'll

53:34.540 --> 53:37.940
do pie crash. So go ahead drifter. What were your additional thoughts? Well, I was just

53:37.940 --> 53:42.500
thinking like it's, it's definitely a developer thing. Being a developer myself, it's a huge

53:42.500 --> 53:47.260
issue to get burned out and it's really hard, especially when you have like the consumer

53:47.260 --> 53:51.020
or user, um, who, you know, is approaching you and, Oh, I got all these things that have

53:51.020 --> 53:55.860
to be done. And it, like you were mentioning, it's, it's really difficult if you're not

53:55.860 --> 53:59.780
getting out, you don't get those breaks, you burn out really easy. But I think that it's

53:59.780 --> 54:05.360
just a human problem. Sometimes it's really easy, whether that's like via our ticketing

54:05.360 --> 54:09.500
system or something like that, it's really easy to forget that there's just people behind

54:09.500 --> 54:13.480
it. Like it's a, it's a person problem. We forget that it's these people, sometimes they

54:13.480 --> 54:17.780
need need a little bit of a little bit of slack on that. Yeah. I can't tell you how

54:17.780 --> 54:24.360
many, how many emails I've gotten where somebody really gives me the third degree about something.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.460
Maybe maybe it's generally somebody who's pretty passionate about something. And then

54:27.460 --> 54:34.020
I just kind of respond and address a few of their points and nine out of 10 times they

54:34.020 --> 54:40.340
respond back saying, Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were like a dude that was just talking

54:40.340 --> 54:47.460
to another dude. And I was having a bad day. And I mean, I've seen that a thousand times

54:47.460 --> 54:53.240
over the years because people that are part of a project or somebody that's just on Twitter

54:53.240 --> 55:00.100
or a celebrity or podcaster is a bit of an abstraction. And so you're communicating with

55:00.100 --> 55:03.020
an abstracted concept of a human. You know, you don't, you don't see, you know, you don't

55:03.020 --> 55:08.500
see me here with my belly and, and my beard and my hair that still looks pretty great

55:08.500 --> 55:12.300
and all of that. You don't see that, right? You just, you have the concept of Chris and

55:12.300 --> 55:16.760
you communicate with that concept. Um, and that's what I was saying earlier in the show

55:16.760 --> 55:20.620
that this low bandwidth aspect of communication over the internet really matters to like base

55:20.620 --> 55:24.940
levels in our monkey brain. All right. So Mr. Crash, I wanted to give you a chance to

55:24.940 --> 55:25.940
jump in.

55:25.940 --> 55:32.980
So the thing I wanted to talk about, it's like, uh, burnout is pretty much in every,

55:32.980 --> 55:39.020
everyone's problem. I mean, startup people get burnout and even students get burnout.

55:39.020 --> 55:45.220
I'm a student myself and I got some problem with burnout a couple of years ago. And it's

55:45.220 --> 55:51.820
like the problem is, uh, that's, you need to learn. And so we all need to learn to ask

55:51.820 --> 55:58.740
for help before we are burnout. Actually, that's a really big problem. And it's a good

55:58.740 --> 56:05.420
thing what wrote, that's just like, I'm asking for help.

56:05.420 --> 56:10.540
Yeah. And just a little understanding even just to kind of connect with where I'm at.

56:10.540 --> 56:11.540
Brent, what do you think?

56:11.540 --> 56:16.620
Yeah. Uh, this is a huge topic, uh, and an important one. And I feel like if, yeah, there's

56:16.620 --> 56:23.220
some way that we can allow our experts, you know, those who are coding, they're best at

56:23.220 --> 56:27.940
coding and yet they have, you know, a hundred other tasks that surround that activity to

56:27.940 --> 56:35.460
make it successful. Um, we need some open source, you know, it's really in any area,

56:35.460 --> 56:40.080
but if we're talking just open source, we need some people who are really passionate

56:40.080 --> 56:45.380
open source accountants who can, you know, come and help 10 developers with that area

56:45.380 --> 56:51.140
so that the developers or podcasters or photographers or whatever their expertise is, can focus

56:51.140 --> 56:57.020
on what they're actually really good at and not waste their cycles doing, you know, inefficient

56:57.020 --> 57:03.060
and also oftentimes really frustrating work that they just need to get done to allow them

57:03.060 --> 57:07.140
to, to make a living, but, um, aren't jazzed about.

57:07.140 --> 57:13.380
Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of that. I think too, conversations like this, which remind

57:13.380 --> 57:18.860
us, um, that they're human and conversations like you have on brunch remind us that these

57:18.860 --> 57:22.860
are human, humanizes these people. And I think that's also pretty helpful, even if it's only

57:22.860 --> 57:28.100
part of the solution. I think it's still good to do, especially in free software and open

57:28.100 --> 57:31.220
source. Yeah. I agree, Drifter. This could be a whole topic, couldn't it? I mean, you

57:31.220 --> 57:32.940
could have a whole podcast dedicated to this.

57:32.940 --> 57:37.600
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and I think we could all definitely use it too. Just being able

57:37.600 --> 57:40.220
to have like an area just to vent, right?

57:40.220 --> 57:46.140
Yeah. Yeah. And that, I mean, I've been bashing on internet communications, but it's, it's

57:46.140 --> 57:51.300
at least we have this. And so, I mean, I think you could glass half full it too and say,

57:51.300 --> 57:55.460
it's not enough, but it's better than absolutely nothing. And just being by yourself in a room

57:55.460 --> 58:01.100
quiet, uh, it's nice to have this connection. So I think there's some positives to it too.

58:01.100 --> 58:02.100
What do you think, Alex?

58:02.100 --> 58:06.380
I think recognizing burnout and being honest with yourself and being able to have the courage

58:06.380 --> 58:12.560
to say, yes, I'm not enjoying what I'm doing is, is a real, you know, it's a real scary

58:12.560 --> 58:18.460
thing the first time, you know, my personal experience was, I was working for Apple on

58:18.460 --> 58:23.960
the genius bar and everything about that told me I should love it because I was repairing

58:23.960 --> 58:28.700
stuff and I was enjoying it, you know, the technical side, but dealing with customers

58:28.700 --> 58:35.820
all the time, just wore me down and admitting to myself that that wasn't what got me out

58:35.820 --> 58:40.260
of bed in the morning. Took me a couple of years, honestly.

58:40.260 --> 58:43.020
From Apple to Red Hat, but it took some analysis, right?

58:43.020 --> 58:48.580
Yeah. Yeah. And reading, reading books, honestly, on the topic, I would say is a huge help because

58:48.580 --> 58:53.060
it gives you, as you're reading, it gives your brain that time to sort of say, yeah,

58:53.060 --> 58:57.740
I identify with the way that this author is trying to make me feel or, or whatever it

58:57.740 --> 59:02.920
is and sort of say, it's okay to, you know, make mistakes in, in terms of thinking that

59:02.920 --> 59:07.380
this role or, you know, being a developer, it wasn't right for me either because it was

59:07.380 --> 59:12.020
too monotonous, but where I am now, I love it because, you know, every, no two days are

59:12.020 --> 59:17.220
the same, even though broadly speaking, I do the same thing every day, you know, different

59:17.220 --> 59:21.780
cases and whatever come through. So it's, it's a real balancing act and being honest

59:21.780 --> 59:27.180
with yourself is the real key to unlocking, I don't want to say like super cheesy, like

59:27.180 --> 59:34.060
happiness, but genuinely, I mean it, that being able to say, I need to change something

59:34.060 --> 59:38.480
and then putting a plan into place and kind of sticking to it, even though it can take

59:38.480 --> 59:41.380
several years is well worth the effort.

59:41.380 --> 59:45.700
Yeah. And sometimes having something to work towards and just being able to see measurable

59:45.700 --> 59:50.620
improvements out of a situation is really all it takes to change your attitude around,

59:50.620 --> 59:56.340
which kind of doubles your net result because you're, you know, you're energized, so you're,

59:56.340 --> 59:59.420
you're getting more creative, you're working a little bit harder, you've got energy again,

59:59.420 --> 01:00:03.740
so it's not as much of a slog. And it's just simply by just having a, it doesn't have to

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:09.140
be a master plan, but just a few key milestones that you're working towards and you can see

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.500
progress and if you can, you need to be able to realize that progress to actually get the

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.620
boost. But if you can pull it off, it can be a trick. And I, you know, it's not building

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.440
that momentum and sort of like, right, I just got that done. Okay. It was a tiny piece,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
but I can keep going.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.460
I'll tell you the other thing as well is, isn't, it's not necessarily just about huge

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:34.260
life changing stuff like changing job or emigrating, right? It's about incremental change as well,

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.100
making small tweaks to your morning. Like Brent said earlier, you know, take the 20 minutes

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:43.420
and do the yoga, but do it regularly and build that into your routine. Like node runners

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.500
saying in the IRC, get a standing desk so you can change it up or go and, you know,

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.020
if you're working from home, go and work on the couch for 20 minutes or whatever it is,

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.320
you know, he actually did that today is, um, before the show I was out in the living room

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.700
of the studio working from there just to, just to change it up, change up the energy

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.300
flow a little bit. So that way I was getting, that way I get a little more peppy for on

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.740
air, you know, get myself work going again and get out of the sleepy chair that I'd been

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.900
in since like 7 a.m. And yeah, it actually does work. Just little tricks like that. That

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.180
seems silly. That's how I describe it. It seems like a silly thing to do, but sometimes

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.100
it works and you just got to find the ones that do for you. If you think this is something

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.900
we could talk more about, uh, let me know. You can either tweet me at Chris LAS or Linux

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.820
unplug.com slash contact because I think, you know, maybe that maybe we do an extra

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.660
on it or something like that. I don't know what, I don't know what that avenue would

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.500
be. People in the chat room are saying do a special on it because it does, it does apply

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.780
so much to open source development, but it's, it's broader than that too.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:41.980
I would like to think that mr devault got something out of even writing that post, you

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:48.380
know, simply putting those words down and acknowledging that himself and you know, there's,

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.980
there's a level of, of it being, you know, just therapy, uh, for lack of a better word

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.220
to sit down and put your thoughts out like that and admit it to the public. Right. Exactly.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.580
And then put those thoughts, you know, somewhere where the public can actually read them and

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.940
understand the struggles that you're going through, I think helps a lot. And it's, it's

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.020
kind of a first step to acknowledging that and, and changing the way that you operate

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:15.180
so that you do have that little bit of downtime and you don't necessarily have to schedule

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.820
everything, every single event of your, of your, you know, your life to, to try and,

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.380
you know, have a little bit of time for your family or, um, that time just to walk around

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:30.300
the block and, and, you know, get out of a head space for a moment.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.100
I think, uh, I hope at least, and I think he probably did hear from a few people like

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.220
right there with you, man, so much on all of that, because I think it resonated with

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.740
a lot of us listening to it. Okay. Well, um, I have something kind of special for us that

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:48.740
I say for the post-show because probably it's probably too retro. Maybe Wes and I are the

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:54.300
only ones that remember this, but this just felt extremely appropriate with today's topic.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:17.100
So I leave you with this.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:24.580
It's down for you, no comment, San Diego, no more Oregon trail Tetris and the others.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:29.180
They're all going to fail. Not because we want it, but because you just taking it disrespecting

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:35.700
all the folks who are making it. The more you take the less there will be. The disc

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.660
becomes fewer. The games fall away. The screen starts to shrink and then it will fade. Programs

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:45.980
fall through a black hole in space. The computer world becomes bleak and stark, loses its life

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:56.140
and the screen goes to dark. Welcome to the end of the computer age.
