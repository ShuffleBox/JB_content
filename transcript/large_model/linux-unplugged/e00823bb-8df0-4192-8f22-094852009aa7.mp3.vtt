00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Geez, did you see Ubuntu touch on the Pinebook?

00:02.240 --> 00:03.840
This came across my Twitter feed today.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.960
I did, in fact.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.240
It's on the OG Pinebook, even.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.680
It's not the Pinebook Pro.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.240
But I'm sure they'll have it working for that as well.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.720
I mean, it's touch on a laptop, so I

00:15.720 --> 00:17.320
don't know how I feel about that.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.160
I kind of like it.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.340
I mean, you get one shot.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.360
So I can't make a big judgment out of this.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.400
But it feels kind of perfect, because it always

00:25.400 --> 00:28.120
was meant to be convergent, to be usable on a desktop.

00:28.120 --> 00:28.680
Truth.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.520
And I don't know.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.120
I think it's sort of the perfect side project

00:34.120 --> 00:35.080
to try for something.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.680
It's like, why I love the Pinebook.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.400
It's why I love this so much.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.120
And I feel like the guy that put it together, that

00:43.120 --> 00:46.440
built that experimental release, is just like one of us.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.040
He's just, can we get it working?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.280
Can I get it on here?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.600
Can I make it functional?

00:50.600 --> 00:51.520
And they have.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.800
They said it's a little sluggish, as you would expect.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.000
It's an experimental version.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.920
But you can actually go and pick it up out of their GitHub,

00:57.920 --> 00:58.760
I believe.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.600
If we ended up with a Pinebook and could

01:00.600 --> 01:03.000
have put Ubuntu Touch on there, Westpane,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
would you accept a challenge to use it for an entire workday?

01:06.000 --> 01:06.880
Oh, yeah, I would.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.120
Two workdays?

01:08.120 --> 01:09.480
No, you're pushing it.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.040
Yeah?

01:10.040 --> 01:10.760
Two workdays?

01:10.760 --> 01:11.440
How about this?

01:11.440 --> 01:15.000
I'll use it while we do one of these shows live.

01:15.000 --> 01:15.960
All right.

01:15.960 --> 01:28.200
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux Unplugged

01:28.200 --> 01:28.700
program.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.200
My name is Chris.

01:29.200 --> 01:29.960
My name is Wes.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.480
Hello, Wes.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.040
How are you?

01:31.040 --> 01:32.120
Hello, I'm doing great.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.560
We've got a lot of things to cover.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.480
It turns out it really is Linux Tuesday today.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.880
Yeah, it's a big laptop you got there in front of you.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.000
Very big and with a beautiful screen.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.200
I'm really enjoying using it.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.960
We'll review the System76 at our workstation

01:43.960 --> 01:45.640
here in just a little bit.

01:45.640 --> 01:49.200
And the community news, so much big news.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.240
We got to say hi to you over there, Mr. Bacon.

01:51.240 --> 01:51.960
Hey, Cheesy.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.960
Hello, everyone.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.040
How are you today?

01:55.040 --> 01:56.120
Quite well, quite well.

01:56.120 --> 02:00.960
Very, very excited about the arrangement of topics we have.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.460
There's a couple of news stories today

02:02.460 --> 02:04.160
that if it was the only news story,

02:04.160 --> 02:05.760
I would be absolutely elated.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.920
That would have been great.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.440
Yeah.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.400
And of course, we've got our virtual lug,

02:09.400 --> 02:11.200
time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:11.200 --> 02:11.680
Hey, hey.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.180
Hello.

02:12.180 --> 02:12.680
Hello there.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.760
Hello.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.680
Hello, Brandon and Neil.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.000
And who else do we got in there?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.720
We got Laura Deak in there, MiniMech, Tat2D,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.400
and The Drifter.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.280
Of course, The Silent Drifter.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.000
What, you wouldn't call him Tat2D?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.080
I think it's a good name.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.000
No, it's a great name.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.840
It's a great name.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.720
He's just cracking up over there silently,

02:30.720 --> 02:33.720
throwing me under the bus, that's all.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.760
All right, yeah, OK, well, we got some big news

02:35.760 --> 02:36.680
to get into today.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.120
First of all, hot off the presses,

02:39.120 --> 02:45.040
CentOS version 8 has been released, build 19.05.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.640
As I mentioned last week, I think,

02:47.640 --> 02:50.120
at least I mentioned it in Linux Action News,

02:50.120 --> 02:54.760
this is the release of CentOS, which is based on RHEL 8.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.080
Which came out back in May.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.800
Which is based on Fedora 28, essentially.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.680
So you get things like software modularity,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.480
a little bit easier and more modern approach

03:05.480 --> 03:08.360
to installing third-party drivers, a lot of things

03:08.360 --> 03:10.280
that are really nice in Fedora 28

03:10.280 --> 03:13.760
that made its way into this version of CentOS.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.280
And that would be big news.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.920
This is a release I've actually been personally looking forward

03:17.920 --> 03:19.720
to for a really long time.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.840
But Red Hat has gone and made even bigger news

03:22.840 --> 03:25.680
and announced CentOS Stream.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.200
CentOS Stream, Westpac.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.400
Yeah, that's right.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.840
What is CentOS Stream?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.000
OK, well, the CentOS Stream project

03:33.000 --> 03:36.280
sits between the Fedora project and RHEL

03:36.280 --> 03:38.040
in the RHEL development process.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.880
So it provides something like a rolling preview of future RHEL

03:41.880 --> 03:43.680
kernels and features.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.680
This enables developers to stay one or two steps ahead

03:46.680 --> 03:49.960
of what's coming in RHEL, which was not really previously

03:49.960 --> 03:52.880
possible with the traditional CentOS release style.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.360
Right.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.520
You wouldn't use CentOS to figure out how to build.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.680
It doesn't make sense.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.320
You could maybe figure out if you

03:58.320 --> 04:00.080
target a certain version of Fedora,

04:00.080 --> 04:02.560
you're likely to be building for a future version of RHEL.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.880
But it wasn't a clear-cut solution,

04:05.880 --> 04:08.120
whereas this really is now.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.640
And keep in mind, this is going to be in parallel

04:11.640 --> 04:13.360
with the existing CentOS release.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.160
So nothing changes for current users of CentOS, Linux,

04:17.160 --> 04:18.240
and services.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.400
They can just keep using it like they always have.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.480
This is an additional release stream now.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.280
That's pretty neat.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.120
That is neat.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.600
I actually kind of think we're maybe really good candidates

04:28.600 --> 04:31.240
for this kind of thing here in the studio, potentially.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.000
Because one way you could consider this,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.840
though they won't call it this, but it's

04:35.840 --> 04:40.120
kind of like a Fedora LTS a little bit.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.520
So Fedora is the foundation for future RHELs,

04:43.520 --> 04:47.880
but CentOS Stream will be really an ecosystem for developers

04:47.880 --> 04:51.720
and folks like us that want to see not just a great, stable,

04:51.720 --> 04:54.360
enterprise-grade distro, but something that stays fairly

04:54.360 --> 04:55.600
modern and current, too.

04:55.600 --> 04:55.880
Right.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.400
And it's interesting, now there's

04:57.400 --> 04:59.920
a way for people who want to contribute back up

04:59.920 --> 05:02.960
and are using CentOS, or at least using CentOS Streams,

05:02.960 --> 05:03.640
to do so.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.800
They can have more input on what's

05:05.800 --> 05:09.000
going to end up in RHEL and therefore in CentOS.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.160
This is a pretty cool development.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.600
Didn't really see this coming.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.640
I was just expecting CentOS 8.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.240
Neil's here.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.240
I'm curious to know what your take is on this.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.480
Well, this is actually super exciting.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.000
When I was at Red Hat Summit, there

05:21.000 --> 05:23.440
were hints about doing something like this.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.440
But I was kind of blown away this morning

05:25.440 --> 05:27.840
when I read the news about it.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.800
So from how I've digested it, it's

05:29.800 --> 05:33.480
basically we now have a neat little progression

05:33.480 --> 05:37.400
going from Fedora to internal RHEL development,

05:37.400 --> 05:43.400
now becoming CentOS Stream to RHEL to CentOS stable.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.520
And I think this gives us something closer

05:46.520 --> 05:50.920
to how people have talked about Fedora LTS, as you mentioned.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.680
But also, it gives people a way to develop

05:54.680 --> 05:56.960
for what people will be using in the future,

05:56.960 --> 05:59.200
because everything that's in CentOS Stream

05:59.200 --> 06:01.400
eventually lands in CentOS stable

06:01.400 --> 06:03.360
when the next point release comes out.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.840
And the bigger point to this that I think a lot of people

06:07.840 --> 06:10.920
kind of missed is that this will also

06:10.920 --> 06:13.320
be an avenue in which the community can contribute

06:13.320 --> 06:14.720
directly to RHEL.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.080
Because what a lot of people don't understand,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.280
maybe because it's not immediately obvious

06:20.280 --> 06:22.280
because we don't talk about it that much,

06:22.280 --> 06:26.320
is that the relationship between Fedora and RHEL

06:26.320 --> 06:28.800
is more or less a one-time thing.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.720
When a release is about to be cut

06:30.720 --> 06:34.360
and they branch from Fedora, that is a permanent branch

06:34.360 --> 06:37.400
for that whole, the lifecycle of that release.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.240
From that point, they're operating with their own lifecycle,

06:40.240 --> 06:42.080
their own components development,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.200
their own patches and things like that.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.280
So they create their own bugs.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.320
And so the idea behind this is that

06:48.320 --> 06:52.880
if the community discovers these things in the CentOS Stream,

06:52.880 --> 06:56.240
they can send changes to be incorporated

06:56.240 --> 06:58.200
by the RHEL engineering team

06:58.200 --> 07:00.160
to integrate into RHEL and CentOS.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.160
And it gives an avenue for that to be

07:03.160 --> 07:06.800
a proper community enterprise platform.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.040
Yeah, so a couple of notes I made here is,

07:11.040 --> 07:11.880
I got a couple of questions.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.640
I'm wondering if you have some of the same questions

07:13.640 --> 07:15.920
or if you've heard any answers, but one note,

07:15.920 --> 07:18.240
there are gonna eventually be clear differences

07:18.240 --> 07:22.880
between CentOS 8 proper and CentOS 8 Stream.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.000
And so on their Wiki,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.560
I don't know if this link will last forever,

07:25.560 --> 07:28.480
but in our show notes, we have a link to the Wiki spot

07:28.480 --> 07:32.320
where they're documenting the differences between the two.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.080
Right now, it's just like a kernel difference.

07:34.080 --> 07:34.920
Yeah, right.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.000
They say the Linux kernel is the first part

07:36.000 --> 07:37.720
of CentOS Stream to move ahead

07:37.720 --> 07:39.400
of the upcoming RHEL point release.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.400
But here's what I'm wondering, Neil.

07:41.400 --> 07:46.400
Will this roll into eventually CentOS Stream 9

07:47.160 --> 07:52.160
or will they cut major versions to match every major RHEL?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.120
So I think it'll actually be both.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.440
So currently right now,

07:55.440 --> 07:58.680
if you look at how it is synced out to the mirror network,

07:58.680 --> 08:00.320
it's called Stream 8.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.520
So the way I suspect it's going to work

08:03.520 --> 08:07.920
is that there will be a Stream 9 after they branch

08:07.920 --> 08:10.800
based on how they're gonna set up this structure.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.240
And then people can switch to Stream 9

08:14.240 --> 08:16.320
and help with the development

08:16.320 --> 08:19.080
of what will eventually become the RHEL 9 tree.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.440
And that is actually gonna be super exciting

08:22.440 --> 08:24.520
because that would bring,

08:24.520 --> 08:27.520
because I've had the experience of this process

08:27.520 --> 08:30.440
with the way that SUSE Linux Enterprise has now developed.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.120
Since SLE 15, they've done it this way

08:33.120 --> 08:37.960
where OpenSUSE Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise releases

08:37.960 --> 08:39.840
are actually developed in parallel

08:39.840 --> 08:41.560
and community contributions can go in

08:41.560 --> 08:44.360
and feed into SLE during development and vice versa.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.120
So having this on the Red Hat family

08:48.120 --> 08:51.320
is going to be a big improvement, I think, across the board.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.880
And it's gonna be very interesting

08:52.880 --> 08:55.560
to see how the community takes up with it

08:55.560 --> 08:56.880
because historically speaking,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.240
CentOS is a very passive community.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.160
There isn't very much that they have been

09:01.160 --> 09:03.640
historically allowed to contribute to.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.720
And now I think this is going to give them

09:05.720 --> 09:08.560
the opportunity to step up and turn into

09:08.560 --> 09:10.960
what I feel is more of a proper diverse community

09:10.960 --> 09:13.240
of users and contributors

09:13.240 --> 09:14.680
because there's now an avenue

09:14.680 --> 09:17.720
in which they can influence the RHEL branch

09:17.720 --> 09:20.520
to improve it for what they need.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.000
Yeah, I think it's a huge change for them

09:23.000 --> 09:24.840
and it's gonna mean that the project's gonna have

09:24.840 --> 09:27.280
some growing and adjusting to do.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.880
But going back to one of the things

09:29.880 --> 09:32.000
that I'm wondering about technically here

09:32.000 --> 09:35.040
is how does this now work with software modularity

09:35.040 --> 09:37.360
or I think what RHEL calls app streams.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.200
Could one somehow use software modularity now

09:41.200 --> 09:45.080
to use a CentOS 8 stream repository?

09:45.080 --> 09:49.000
So you could be on CentOS 8 proper or RHEL 8

09:49.000 --> 09:51.120
but using software modularity,

09:51.120 --> 09:54.920
take advantage of a CentOS 8 stream.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.640
In theory, yes.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.360
I think in practice,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.040
people won't necessarily do this

10:01.040 --> 10:02.520
without switching all of their content

10:02.520 --> 10:04.400
over to the 8 stream version.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.480
But of course, I think it's absolutely possible.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.840
That's gonna be something.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.120
But because of the way that this stuff is being set up,

10:13.120 --> 10:16.120
I think that moving on to 8 stream proper

10:16.120 --> 10:20.200
is not going to be as dangerous or problematic for people

10:20.200 --> 10:21.760
and I suspect a larger portion

10:21.760 --> 10:24.320
than what they would have normally expected

10:24.320 --> 10:27.280
will switch from 8 stable to 8 stream

10:27.280 --> 10:29.560
and start leveraging that content

10:29.560 --> 10:31.440
and become part of that process,

10:31.440 --> 10:33.040
especially since there is now an avenue

10:33.040 --> 10:35.200
for them to help make that better

10:35.200 --> 10:39.800
because it means that if there is problems

10:39.800 --> 10:41.800
and things like that and they know how to fix it,

10:41.800 --> 10:44.160
there is a way to make sure it stays fixed

10:44.160 --> 10:45.760
rather than having to work around it locally

10:45.760 --> 10:48.680
like a lot of CentOS users do today.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.920
Yeah, this is really cool

10:51.920 --> 10:53.400
and it's something that we'll play around with

10:53.400 --> 10:54.240
here in the studio.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.200
I was about to say something tells me

10:56.200 --> 10:57.760
we're gonna be reinstalling.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.200
I think it could work pretty good on FakeNAS.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.920
Right now we have Fedora 30 on there

11:01.920 --> 11:04.120
and we were wondering if we were gonna go to 31

11:04.120 --> 11:06.800
or CentOS 8 and now I think we might consider

11:06.800 --> 11:10.000
CentOS 8 stream, although CentOS 8 could be fine.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.160
There's a lot to consider now.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.560
Right, but if we just jump on for the ride,

11:14.560 --> 11:16.800
we'll find out how it goes.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, get on board.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.520
One other thing that is something

11:20.520 --> 11:21.960
you might have to get on board with

11:21.960 --> 11:25.080
at All Systems Go, a conference about

11:25.080 --> 11:26.600
some of the plumbing things

11:26.600 --> 11:28.560
in our beloved operating system.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.640
The one and the only Mr. Lenot Pottering

11:30.640 --> 11:35.280
gave a presentation about reinventing home directories

11:35.280 --> 11:37.680
and introducing a new technology

11:37.680 --> 11:40.240
called System D, Home D.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.840
Yes, you heard me right, System D, Home D.

11:43.840 --> 11:48.400
Hi, I'm Lenot Pottering and I'm going

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
to take away your home directories now.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.400
So what's happening here is kind of a rethink

11:56.760 --> 12:00.040
on the concept of Unix home directories,

12:00.040 --> 12:02.280
which really hasn't changed much

12:02.280 --> 12:04.560
in the last nearly 40 years.

12:04.560 --> 12:09.560
And System D, Home D is a way to make the home directory

12:09.560 --> 12:13.760
fully portable and treat the user

12:13.760 --> 12:16.880
as a file on the operating system.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.040
Everything is a file.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.120
So yeah, self-contained home directories, right?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.640
The metadata about the user

12:21.640 --> 12:23.680
should not be distributed across the system

12:23.680 --> 12:25.960
with all its information about the user itself,

12:25.960 --> 12:27.560
with all the resource management and stuff.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.520
It should be part of the home directory itself.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.120
This then means that the mere existence

12:36.120 --> 12:39.160
of the home directories file,

12:39.160 --> 12:40.560
where everything's stored,

12:40.560 --> 12:43.720
should synthesize the user account in full, right?

12:43.720 --> 12:48.240
It should make sure that if you call get pwnem

12:48.240 --> 12:51.440
or something like this, like the classic Unix APIs

12:51.440 --> 12:56.440
to query user, the mere existence of the user file store

12:59.600 --> 13:02.200
should synthesize everything else, right?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.680
In a way, you could say I want that,

13:04.680 --> 13:06.640
yeah, you know, Unix, everything's a file.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.000
But yeah, users should be a file too, right?

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
Like where you just have one concept in the file system

13:14.520 --> 13:19.520
and that everything else comes from there during runtime

13:19.600 --> 13:23.360
and is not propagated persistently anywhere else.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.000
This is a radical new idea.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.920
He's talking about divorcing user configuration

13:30.920 --> 13:32.520
from system configuration.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.360
Right.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.680
Getting us closer to having a fully immutable system,

13:36.680 --> 13:38.920
getting us closer to having an Etsy directory

13:38.920 --> 13:40.360
that can be read only.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.640
Yeah, you could have a machine

13:41.640 --> 13:42.760
that you've totally configured

13:42.760 --> 13:45.360
and then some user in your organization,

13:45.360 --> 13:47.520
whatever that may be, just walks up to it,

13:47.520 --> 13:50.760
maybe with a thumb drive with all their user info on it

13:50.760 --> 13:53.640
and they can just pop up and use the system.

13:53.640 --> 13:58.640
The existence of the home directory creates the account.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.120
So you're not modifying the system

14:02.120 --> 14:03.920
to create or change passwords.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.800
It's all stored in there.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.640
Really the whole idea is to manage this stuff

14:08.640 --> 14:11.640
at scale and sort of solve problems

14:11.640 --> 14:13.320
that we've hacked together in the past.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.040
We always have this goal that if a system's configuration

14:17.040 --> 14:21.440
not supposed to change, Etsy should be read only,

14:21.440 --> 14:23.320
should be immutable ideally even.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.440
And hence the requirement that if a user is created

14:26.440 --> 14:28.240
or removed or modified or whatever,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.240
you need a writable Etsy kind of sucks

14:30.240 --> 14:34.560
because a user's existence is not really configuration

14:34.560 --> 14:36.200
at least in my view, right?

14:36.200 --> 14:40.280
So the concept that mixes state,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.640
yeah, I believe that the user record is state,

14:42.640 --> 14:43.960
it's not configuration.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.800
And the rest in Etsy is generally understood

14:45.800 --> 14:47.160
to be configuration this way.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.800
So there's this semantical,

14:48.800 --> 14:50.360
this is a philosophical problem already

14:50.360 --> 14:52.840
that Etsy mixes state and configuration

14:52.840 --> 14:54.680
and then this propagates into the problem

14:54.680 --> 14:56.120
that Etsy needs to be writable.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.040
There's a couple of new ideas in here

14:58.040 --> 15:00.200
that make all of this really kind of possible

15:00.200 --> 15:02.080
including West's favorite.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.440
There's some of my JSON magic.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.280
Oh yeah.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.600
There are two new concepts.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.760
Like one of them is,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.360
I want to go for JSON user records, right?

15:10.360 --> 15:11.280
Like everyone knows JSON.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.840
JSON is like what the internet people all do.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.760
I think we should just start using that

15:14.760 --> 15:16.440
for our user records.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.840
Yeah, the reason why JSON is because

15:19.840 --> 15:21.280
it's just the most basic thing.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.480
It's supposed to be machine readable.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.960
It's not supposed to be so much something you write.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.840
It's something that computers write for you

15:26.840 --> 15:28.440
and things like that.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.560
And it's also what probably most of the internet

15:31.560 --> 15:34.840
facing user databases probably use anyway

15:34.840 --> 15:37.720
when they exchange information about users

15:37.720 --> 15:38.800
across the network.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.640
So that's the first thing.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.720
JSON user records.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.840
And we keep saying the user is a file.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.080
The user directory is a file.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.600
What the hell kind of file are we talking about?

15:46.600 --> 15:49.040
We're talking about, in some cases,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.360
a LUX encrypted loopback file.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.520
So everything is encrypted to a LUX key.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.760
Concept B is I want that home directories

15:58.760 --> 16:03.760
are encrypted LUX loopback files in slash home, right?

16:03.760 --> 16:08.760
So that if I have a user called foobar in slash home,

16:08.840 --> 16:10.520
traditionally there was slash home slash foobar

16:10.520 --> 16:11.760
and it was a plain directory.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.240
I want that there now is slash home slash foobar dot home

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
and it's a file.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.720
And it's actually a LUX loopback image.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.760
And then when the user logs in, what do we do?

16:21.760 --> 16:25.800
We set it up via LUX stuff as a loopback file.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.960
And then we finally mount it after validating

16:27.960 --> 16:29.120
that everything's okay.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.880
And by making it a file, you also make them portable.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.840
The goals that I want to be able to deliver

16:36.840 --> 16:38.200
with what I'm talking about here

16:38.200 --> 16:40.840
is first of all, migratable home directories, right?

16:40.840 --> 16:42.560
Migratable home directories means

16:42.560 --> 16:45.400
that you can take a home directory as one unit

16:45.400 --> 16:47.480
from this laptop to your new laptop

16:47.480 --> 16:50.120
or to your third laptop and it will always work

16:50.120 --> 16:51.680
and be self-consistent in itself

16:51.680 --> 16:55.960
and comprehensive and hence migratable, right?

16:55.960 --> 16:58.480
So this basically means that as little as necessary

16:58.480 --> 17:00.800
should leak into the system surrounding it

17:00.800 --> 17:02.720
and particularly when it comes to configuration,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.320
which is very different from what was there before, right?

17:05.320 --> 17:08.840
Like before, home directories user accounts

17:08.840 --> 17:10.080
were not migratable, right?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.520
Like because as mentioned,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.360
we have all these sidecar databases

17:13.360 --> 17:16.600
and there's no way you can sensibly migrate

17:16.600 --> 17:18.200
all that metadata that's distributed

17:18.200 --> 17:19.920
in all these configuration files in Etsy

17:19.920 --> 17:23.320
and all the weird sidecar database in VAR and whatnot

17:23.320 --> 17:24.800
from one system to another.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.880
We'll talk more about those sidecar databases there

17:26.880 --> 17:29.880
in a moment, but he's demonstrating a system

17:29.880 --> 17:32.440
where you can have everything on that thumb drive

17:32.440 --> 17:34.360
you plug it in, you're now a member of that system,

17:34.360 --> 17:35.680
you remove the thumb drive,

17:35.680 --> 17:37.960
you're no longer a member of that system.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.000
But he also wants to address some glaring security issues

17:41.000 --> 17:43.960
that we just don't talk about in the current configuration.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.160
Number one, if you're on a laptop,

17:45.160 --> 17:47.360
you're likely at this point using Lux, I am.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.800
It works really well for me.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.040
One thing that sucks about it

17:50.040 --> 17:52.280
is it's a shared password by default

17:52.280 --> 17:55.680
because everyone has to use that one password to unlock it.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.280
This was an issue at my wife's clinic.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.560
They all have to know the encryption password

17:59.560 --> 18:01.040
to get the system to boot.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.400
Then there's their user password,

18:02.400 --> 18:04.480
and then usually passwords for services.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.160
Lenart's proposing you change that

18:06.160 --> 18:08.320
and link it to the user password.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.000
And he's proposing to solve the other problem,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.120
which we never talk about.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.480
And that is when you suspend these systems,

18:15.480 --> 18:19.160
when you put them to sleep, the data remains unencrypted.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.520
The key remains in memory.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.600
And I don't know about you,

18:22.600 --> 18:24.920
but that's pretty much what I always do with my laptop.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.160
It's always in my bag of sleep.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.960
Yeah, of course, that's just the most convenient option.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.400
And I'm like, oh, my data's protected.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.200
No, if they get it, not only will it still be unencrypted,

18:34.200 --> 18:37.000
but with USB-C, they can plug it into any old USB-C thing

18:37.000 --> 18:38.160
to keep it going.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.840
And they'll have physical access to my box.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.480
And sitting in memory is your password right there.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.400
Yeah, so he wants to solve that problem.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.320
Also, one of my really important goals, actually,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.080
is to lock Lux on system suspend.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.920
So nowadays, I'm pretty sure that, first of all,

18:54.920 --> 18:56.480
most of you probably use hard disk encryption

18:56.480 --> 18:57.320
on your laptop.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.160
And second of all, I think most of you probably

18:59.160 --> 19:01.320
don't even turn off the computers anymore at all, right?

19:01.320 --> 19:04.400
Like usually, you just close the screen

19:04.400 --> 19:07.680
and that suspends the system.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.000
And then when you come back, you just authenticate again.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.160
But it systematically, I mean, it kind of defeats

19:12.160 --> 19:14.720
the encryption, like the encryption that you have there,

19:14.720 --> 19:17.480
because basically, the way it's currently implemented,

19:17.480 --> 19:20.440
you use hard disk, like full disk encryption.

19:20.440 --> 19:25.440
So while the system is up, suspended or running,

19:25.440 --> 19:30.440
yeah, up in that context, the decryption key is in memory.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.920
Right, so if I go through customs to a country

19:35.920 --> 19:38.000
that I don't trust, and I have the laptop with me

19:38.000 --> 19:40.240
and it's suspended, and I pick up the laptop,

19:40.240 --> 19:42.320
in that memory, you'll find the decryption key

19:42.320 --> 19:43.960
from a hard disk, and that's something I think

19:43.960 --> 19:45.680
we should not do, right?

19:45.680 --> 19:49.080
We should, and this is something that people might

19:49.080 --> 19:50.760
not find important, but I think it's actually

19:50.760 --> 19:52.720
one of the most important things

19:52.720 --> 19:56.640
in this entire approach at all, is yeah,

19:56.640 --> 20:00.320
when you suspend the system, the decryption keys

20:00.320 --> 20:02.760
need to be removed from memory, right?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.960
So that I know for sure that if somebody steals

20:04.960 --> 20:06.880
my laptop in suspended state, because that is

20:06.880 --> 20:08.960
the most common state that they will probably

20:08.960 --> 20:12.080
steal my laptop in, they should not be capable

20:12.080 --> 20:14.920
of getting any access to my hard disks, right?

20:14.920 --> 20:16.880
Again, this is something you really, really

20:16.880 --> 20:18.720
should care about, because it basically,

20:18.720 --> 20:21.280
so far, defeated all kind of encryption that you had,

20:21.280 --> 20:24.160
because yeah, as long as you did system suspend

20:24.160 --> 20:26.160
and everybody of you does that,

20:26.160 --> 20:27.120
if somebody steals your laptop,

20:27.120 --> 20:29.160
they can extract everything they want.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.840
Now they are proposing to make the system

20:30.840 --> 20:33.760
backwards compatible with the existing approach.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.480
Yeah, right, there'll just be shims in place,

20:35.480 --> 20:38.320
so all the existing Unix tooling will talk to system D.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.520
And it's mostly a collection of existing utilities,

20:41.520 --> 20:44.280
like PAM and other mechanisms.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.880
It's not like system D is re-implementing

20:45.880 --> 20:47.920
all of this stuff in some giant binary.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.520
Right, and it just uses Lux, right?

20:49.520 --> 20:51.840
It's not rolling its own encryption there either.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.320
And it could use other backends as well,

20:53.320 --> 20:54.760
that are just file system stuff,

20:54.760 --> 20:56.680
like it can use SIFs or whatever.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.080
So there's all kinds of network possibilities.

21:00.320 --> 21:04.000
It does require some workarounds or development though,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.520
because it kind of turns, it turns out

21:06.520 --> 21:09.400
all this stuff's a bit of a hot mess.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.560
I never really appreciated how patched together

21:11.560 --> 21:14.000
all of this is, and certain things,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
just kind of like bypass our basic authentication

21:17.000 --> 21:18.400
mechanisms as it is.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.920
Certain kind of important things that a lot of us rely on.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.040
There's some complications with all of this.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.240
SSH logins, right?

21:28.240 --> 21:31.360
I mentioned that I wanted that user authentication

21:31.360 --> 21:33.720
and decryption of the hard disk is the same thing, right?

21:33.720 --> 21:35.520
This is inherently incompatible

21:35.520 --> 21:38.480
with how SSH traditionally works, right?

21:38.480 --> 21:41.000
Because as mentioned, if you authenticate via SSH,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.720
it goes via the authorized keys file in the home directory.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.120
So if you want to authenticate something

21:48.120 --> 21:49.760
that is inside of the home directory

21:49.760 --> 21:51.280
so that it can access the home directory,

21:51.280 --> 21:53.320
where does the decryption key come from

21:53.320 --> 21:55.040
to access the home directory, right?

21:55.040 --> 21:56.160
You follow what I mean?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.760
It's the chicken neck problem.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.480
You're reading out the key that allows you access

22:01.480 --> 22:03.120
from the encrypted thing,

22:03.120 --> 22:06.080
which you only can after you authenticate it, right?

22:06.080 --> 22:08.000
And there's a couple of ways to solve that problem,

22:08.000 --> 22:12.040
like maybe just unlocking it locally first

22:12.040 --> 22:15.560
or coming up with mechanisms to patch that process.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.400
Right, and a lot of this too is, Leonard tries

22:18.400 --> 22:20.040
to be pretty clear that he's,

22:20.040 --> 22:21.480
some of this stuff is more general, right?

22:21.480 --> 22:24.640
Just like this extensible user record, however it's stored.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.240
That's an interesting idea on its own.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.960
Some of this encryption stuff makes sense really

22:28.960 --> 22:30.760
only for client machines, right?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.960
Machines that will be offline or you may want to protect

22:32.960 --> 22:34.240
because you're moving them around,

22:34.240 --> 22:36.360
not server machines that you have up

22:36.360 --> 22:38.080
and unencrypted anyway.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.800
Right, it's both trying to solve a problem

22:39.800 --> 22:43.920
of making querying users more rich

22:43.920 --> 22:45.680
and like information you can store about them,

22:45.680 --> 22:47.240
maybe that are appropriate for your company.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.840
So that's all in that JSON file.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.360
It's also about supporting things like Yuba keys

22:52.360 --> 22:54.560
for authentication by default.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.560
There's a lot of those kinds of the common,

22:57.560 --> 22:59.880
making the UIDs on systems common

22:59.880 --> 23:02.320
and in solving for conflicts.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.280
But it's also about kind of solving the whole hot mess

23:05.280 --> 23:06.240
of authentication.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.920
You heard Leonard earlier mentioned

23:07.920 --> 23:10.440
that there's all these sidecar databases.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.240
And when you think about it, it's a bit of a hot mess.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.880
I also see the problem.

23:14.880 --> 23:19.080
Yeah, Etsy, PassWD only knows Unix passwords, right?

23:19.080 --> 23:20.720
Like passwords as you know them.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.360
It doesn't know anything else, right?

23:22.360 --> 23:24.720
Everything else how you might want to authenticate

23:24.720 --> 23:27.280
these days, Yuba keys, whatever else,

23:28.280 --> 23:31.080
cannot be an Etsy PassWD because it's not extensible.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.840
Right, so anything more modern,

23:32.840 --> 23:35.440
anything if you even want to authenticate with a pattern,

23:35.440 --> 23:36.880
right, like which is what phones do

23:36.880 --> 23:38.520
and which you might want to do on your laptop too

23:38.520 --> 23:40.200
if you have a touchscreen,

23:40.200 --> 23:41.560
doesn't really fit into that model

23:41.560 --> 23:45.200
because yeah, there's no way how that's viable there.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.240
It's not extensible.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.000
This is actually a massive problem, right?

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Like Etsy PassWD, this database was designed in 1985

23:54.120 --> 23:55.160
or something like this,

23:55.160 --> 23:57.840
has not been modified once since then.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.360
There has been this extension like the shadow database

24:00.360 --> 24:02.840
which added like five more fields or something like this,

24:02.840 --> 24:05.920
but everybody wants to add their own fields.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.440
And this is like fucking ugly if you ask me

24:09.440 --> 24:12.160
because they created these sidecar databases, right?

24:12.160 --> 24:15.160
These databases that extend the user record,

24:15.160 --> 24:17.360
but they're not actually stored in Etsy PassWD

24:17.360 --> 24:20.560
in the user database itself, but at some other place.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.080
And that other place means something very different

24:23.080 --> 24:24.240
regarding where you're looking.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.360
All right, if you're going now, this sounds interesting

24:26.360 --> 24:28.840
or this is a horrible idea or I want to know more,

24:28.840 --> 24:32.040
we have a link in the show notes to Lenard's talk

24:32.040 --> 24:33.960
which includes the slides

24:33.960 --> 24:36.880
from the All Systems Go conference.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.560
And there's a lot more in there.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.000
Yeah, right, I mean, you should also know

24:40.000 --> 24:42.240
that signing of these user records,

24:42.240 --> 24:43.520
that's another big part of this.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.920
There's a lot of implications for security

24:44.920 --> 24:46.520
and how you might manage this at scale,

24:46.520 --> 24:49.120
but you're going to have to go learn more yourself.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.840
It may never hit a desktop near you

24:51.840 --> 24:55.280
or it could end up all happening and be totally transparent

24:55.280 --> 24:57.320
because that's the other thing to take away from this

24:57.320 --> 25:00.240
is all said and done, you log in,

25:00.240 --> 25:03.760
your home directory would mount and you wouldn't even know.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.040
You could just, if you've got these services going,

25:06.040 --> 25:06.920
you can just add this on

25:06.920 --> 25:08.480
and not have to change anything else.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.120
And because it's backwards compatible

25:10.120 --> 25:11.920
with the previous system,

25:11.920 --> 25:15.000
it's not like something distributions are forced to adopt,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.120
but you could see where at scale operations

25:17.120 --> 25:18.880
might want some of this management capability.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.200
Hey, I want to play with it already.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.360
I mean, it could be handy even for smaller stuff too, right?

25:22.360 --> 25:24.640
Like you could add me and I have a little movable account.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.720
If I need to use a new studio machine,

25:26.720 --> 25:28.360
just pop up right on it and use it.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.960
Yeah, absolutely.

25:29.960 --> 25:34.080
Or I use sync thing to sync around my Lux home directory

25:34.080 --> 25:36.720
to all the systems and just set down everywhere

25:36.720 --> 25:38.240
and I'm good to go, maybe.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.120
Could be the dream one day, we'll see.

25:40.120 --> 25:44.280
Hey, just a quick bit of good news for OBS, OBS,

25:44.280 --> 25:47.240
our streaming application of choice.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.000
Also, you know, people sometimes say,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.080
hey, what's a great quick screen cap application now?

25:52.080 --> 25:54.200
There's a bunch out there, but OBS is one of the best ones

25:54.200 --> 25:55.840
too, just for that kind of stuff.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.080
It's such a cool project.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.040
It's like the number one streaming application

26:00.040 --> 26:02.080
that Twitch streamers use or people,

26:02.080 --> 26:03.840
a lot of people use it for-

26:03.840 --> 26:05.640
It's just taken for granted now.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.120
You remember the days before a project like this

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
and it was just only commercial applications

26:10.120 --> 26:11.480
that probably didn't run on Linux.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.040
It's so quickly become just like the go-to

26:13.040 --> 26:15.200
that it's almost like a non OBS, yeah.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.000
But I mean, game changer.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.920
And so that's why it's so great to see Twitch becoming

26:18.920 --> 26:21.240
the premier sponsor of the OBS project.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.120
It seems like a pretty good match.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.200
They write on the page that we're excited to announce

26:25.200 --> 26:28.760
that Twitch is now officially sponsoring my work on OBS.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.720
This sponsorship allows me to work full-time

26:30.720 --> 26:32.440
on the project without much worry.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.040
And with it allows me to support other contributors

26:35.040 --> 26:37.120
to help maintain, manage the project

26:37.120 --> 26:38.840
and work on important features.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.920
I expect more good things from the OBS project

26:40.920 --> 26:41.760
in the future.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.600
Yay.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.480
I am so happy for them because it's such a great tool.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.360
We run it dang near 24 seven here in the studio,

26:48.360 --> 26:50.560
either doing live stream reruns

26:50.560 --> 26:52.680
or doing something in-house and-

26:52.680 --> 26:54.600
And it makes a lot of sense for Twitch to do this too,

26:54.600 --> 26:55.440
right?

26:55.440 --> 26:58.240
I mean, they, so many of their users are using this.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.080
No kidding.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.600
They needed to stick around and stay healthy, don't they?

27:01.600 --> 27:02.440
They sure do.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
That's a really good point.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.200
All right, how about a little housekeeping?

27:07.200 --> 27:09.520
So if you are not signed up

27:09.520 --> 27:12.580
as a Linux Academy community member, it's free.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.420
Totally free.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.400
Go check that out because every month

27:15.400 --> 27:17.840
L is dropping new batches of content

27:17.840 --> 27:21.360
and October is just around the corner, my friends.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.720
So you can still get a little bit of September in there

27:23.720 --> 27:25.240
and then go check out the October stuff.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.600
Plus there's evergreen stuff that stays free all the time.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.040
L curates that.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.000
I really recommend it.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.300
So we'll have a link in the show notes

27:32.300 --> 27:34.000
for the September courses.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.560
But if you just Google like Linux Academy community account

27:36.560 --> 27:39.320
or go to linuxacademy.com, go get that

27:39.320 --> 27:41.440
because that's a great deal.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.480
Absolutely free.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.720
Texas Cyber Summit also I want to let you know about

27:44.720 --> 27:46.040
is coming up very soon.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.800
The crew is getting ready to go a party

27:47.800 --> 27:49.600
at Texas Cyber Summit.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.480
There's going to be a hacker birthday meetup.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.560
Pre-funk the summit.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.080
For L and Ali, it's their birthdays

27:55.080 --> 27:55.920
and we're going to do a meetup.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.880
We're going to just combine the whole thing

27:56.880 --> 27:58.080
and make it great.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.280
It's October 10th and the 12th

28:00.280 --> 28:03.640
for a Texas Cyber Summit, texascybersummit.org.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.480
Are you going, Wes?

28:04.480 --> 28:05.320
Yeah.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.160
Yeah, yeah.

28:06.160 --> 28:06.980
Of course.

28:06.980 --> 28:07.820
Was I going to miss this?

28:07.820 --> 28:08.660
No way, man.

28:08.660 --> 28:09.500
You'd hike there if you had to.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.340
That's right.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.000
I think we just did a ticket giveaway too, didn't we?

28:12.000 --> 28:12.840
Yeah.

28:12.840 --> 28:13.680
Oh yeah.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.380
I think Rob was our winner from the ticket giveaway.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.080
If you would like a chance to win a ticket,

28:20.080 --> 28:22.600
you too can enter to win.

28:22.600 --> 28:30.600
And to do that, all you have to do is go to tcs2019.ellopunk.com.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.720
It's tcs2019.ellopunk.com.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.640
You'll be dropped into the Telegram chat

28:35.640 --> 28:40.880
and Elle has a randomizer, name randomizer

28:40.880 --> 28:42.400
that she's using to pull those.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.880
And Rob was our first winner.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.880
So if you want to go and maybe you don't have the money

28:46.880 --> 28:49.760
just to drop to go, jump in there.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.720
See if you can't win yourself a ticket or two.

28:51.720 --> 28:52.560
And if you're in the area,

28:52.560 --> 28:54.560
you could always join us at Two Brothers Barbecue

28:54.560 --> 28:55.600
for the birthday party.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.000
Details at meetup.com slash jupesbroadcasting.

28:59.000 --> 28:59.840
That's Jupiter.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.680
If you want to hear more too,

29:00.680 --> 29:03.400
there's an extra out over in Jupiter Extras.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.880
That's what I was trying to remember.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.720
Right.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.240
Elle and I sat down with the blind hacker

29:07.240 --> 29:10.280
and he tells us a little bit about the great ABCs

29:10.280 --> 29:12.240
of CTF's talk he's giving,

29:12.240 --> 29:14.480
which might just help us, Chris,

29:14.480 --> 29:16.040
if we're going to impress Elle.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.840
There's been some really good stuff

29:18.840 --> 29:20.200
pop into the Extras feed.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.280
We haven't been plugging it very hard,

29:22.280 --> 29:24.080
but if you're looking for just a little bit extra

29:24.080 --> 29:27.000
Jupiter Broadcasting content, extras.show,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.560
some good stuff in there,

29:28.560 --> 29:30.640
usually something coming out every single week.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.440
And of course it's an easy RSS subscribe

29:32.440 --> 29:34.720
to go get that extras.show slash subscribe.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.080
But that, my friends, is everything in the housekeeping.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.120
All right, let's talk about your next Linux laptop.

29:43.120 --> 29:46.320
I'm curious to know what your requirements are

29:46.320 --> 29:49.280
and if they shift like mine do.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.520
So you've been sitting there

29:50.520 --> 29:53.080
using the System76 Adder workstation.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.160
Yes, I have.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.880
And you traditionally spend your days

29:55.880 --> 29:57.560
on your ThinkPad T480.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.680
That's right.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.240
And if you were to go in the market today

30:01.240 --> 30:03.720
and buy one for yourself personally,

30:03.720 --> 30:05.120
I'm curious to know what your requirements

30:05.120 --> 30:06.600
for your next Linux laptop would be.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.960
And I'd like to know the audience's too.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.080
Let me know at chrisles,

30:09.080 --> 30:11.920
because I'm kind of wondering if your shift like mine do,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.520
mine kind of swing between ultra portable,

30:14.520 --> 30:17.040
long battery life and, oh my God,

30:17.040 --> 30:18.600
I want all of the power.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.760
Yeah, I mean, workloads vary, right?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.240
And I absolutely do love something that's ultra portable.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.280
A lot of work that I am doing is just reading the news

30:26.280 --> 30:27.520
or working in a terminal.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.800
And that's perfect for that,

30:28.800 --> 30:30.760
especially when you might be flying to a conference

30:30.760 --> 30:31.600
or something.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, that's where portable and low powered,

30:33.000 --> 30:33.960
like there's nothing better.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.720
Yeah, but also, I mean, we're doing work with audio,

30:36.720 --> 30:37.560
we're rendering things out,

30:37.560 --> 30:40.560
maybe doing some video work from time to time.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.960
Plus, I just can't stand when the machine is slow.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.280
You know, once you start noticing those little stutters

30:45.280 --> 30:47.520
or delays, it doesn't feel right.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.480
Yeah, this machine did break me in a couple of ways,

30:50.480 --> 30:51.760
which I'll talk about here in a second.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.080
But first, let me tell you what we have here in the studio.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.400
So the System76 Adder workstation that we have

30:57.400 --> 31:02.400
is configured with a Core i7 9750 at 4.5 gigahertz,

31:03.400 --> 31:07.160
six physical cores, 12 threads.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.920
It is ridiculous having 12 threads on a laptop.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.600
It feels like it's like,

31:12.600 --> 31:14.880
I feel like I'm getting a deep fake CPU over there.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.920
It's incredible.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.920
This has two eight gig modules in there, DDR4.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.000
So it's a pretty smokin' fast RAM.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.680
It's got a Samsung 970 EVO 250 gig.

31:25.680 --> 31:30.400
And get ready for this, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070

31:30.400 --> 31:32.160
with eight gigabytes of RAM.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.800
Whoa!

31:33.800 --> 31:35.160
That's insane. Yeah.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.280
And it's running Pop OS based on Ubuntu 19.04

31:38.280 --> 31:41.880
with Gnome Shell 3.2.2, X Server 120,

31:41.880 --> 31:46.880
NVIDIA graphics driver 435.21, and a screen resolution

31:46.920 --> 31:50.440
nominally running at 3840 by 2160.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.480
Although I did mess around with that a bit.

31:52.480 --> 31:57.480
So by my calculation, my price before tax and shipping,

31:57.920 --> 32:02.920
I suppose, is a grand total of $2,314.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.520
Okay, so not on the cheap end, but-

32:05.520 --> 32:06.880
It is a workstation laptop.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.320
Yeah, this is spec'd out.

32:08.320 --> 32:12.840
It's got a 15.6 inch 4K OLED display.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.720
Ooh, and boy is that putting my ThinkPad display

32:15.720 --> 32:17.000
to shame today.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.080
Oh my God, lapping the ThinkPad display

32:19.080 --> 32:20.360
doesn't appropriately describe-

32:20.360 --> 32:21.200
Not even close.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.880
How much of it is just crushing the ThinkPad display.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.480
But in fairness, this legitimately might be

32:27.480 --> 32:28.880
one of the best displays I've ever looked at

32:28.880 --> 32:32.600
because the blacks on this OLED are so incredible

32:32.600 --> 32:37.320
that basic logos when video games load look incredible.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.000
That's it, everything that we've been doing,

32:39.000 --> 32:39.880
even just basic stuff.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.600
I'm looking at like a night mode notes program right now,

32:42.600 --> 32:43.520
and it's beautiful.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.360
Like the fonts pop off the screen.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.840
And then it is running in high DPI mode,

32:47.840 --> 32:50.240
so of course it looks gorgeous.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.400
It has two M.2 slots in there,

32:53.400 --> 32:56.360
so you can pop in two MV&E drives or something.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.480
So you can get up to eight terabytes of MV&E storage

32:58.480 --> 32:59.840
if you like.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.960
Yeah, it's also got a gigabit ethernet,

33:02.960 --> 33:06.000
of course it's got Intel AC, yep, oh yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.880
It's got one USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort on there.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.000
It's also got another USB 3.1 Gen2

33:13.000 --> 33:15.040
with Thunderbolt Type-C connector.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.440
So it's got a Thunderbolt port Type-C connector,

33:17.440 --> 33:20.880
and then three USB 3.0 ports.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.200
With the blue coloring, which is always a nice touch.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.800
Plus SD card reader.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.720
It's got a big power adapter,

33:26.720 --> 33:28.640
not like as big as I've seen in the past,

33:28.640 --> 33:30.480
but it's big compared to what you would normally get

33:30.480 --> 33:32.480
on some systems, but that's because this thing's got

33:32.480 --> 33:34.600
all of this machinery in there.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.000
230 watt power adapter, so it does not charge over USB-C,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.720
but that's because you can't deliver that much power

33:40.720 --> 33:42.080
over USB-C.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.080
What I would love to see, and this is Cheez's idea,

33:44.080 --> 33:47.480
is in the future, I would love to be able to charge

33:47.480 --> 33:50.920
the battery over USB-C when the system is off,

33:50.920 --> 33:53.280
because this is something I do with the old ThinkPad ski,

33:53.280 --> 33:57.880
is I have a dash charger in my RV that is USB-C,

33:57.880 --> 34:00.960
so I just plug it in, and it takes all night to charge,

34:00.960 --> 34:01.800
but I don't care.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.840
Right, if you're just leaving it there

34:02.840 --> 34:03.680
and you're not using it.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.800
In fact, it may be better for the health of the battery

34:05.800 --> 34:08.040
to charge slower with less heat, who knows?

34:08.040 --> 34:09.520
So that'd be fun to see down the road,

34:09.520 --> 34:13.920
but in the meantime, it makes up for it

34:13.920 --> 34:16.240
by the fact that a lot of the bulky ports,

34:16.240 --> 34:18.360
like your HDMI and the power adapter,

34:18.360 --> 34:21.440
which is a bit of an L-plug, are on the back.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.340
So your big I.O. plugs are all on the back,

34:24.340 --> 34:25.800
coming out the back of the laptop,

34:25.800 --> 34:27.040
which means they're not along the side,

34:27.040 --> 34:28.840
so it's not blocking your hands from mouse in.

34:28.840 --> 34:29.680
I love that.

34:29.680 --> 34:32.280
I mean, I frequently sort of add my ThinkPad to a desk

34:32.280 --> 34:35.120
and take it away, and that's not the best on the ThinkPad.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.140
Honestly, this would do better.

34:36.140 --> 34:38.500
Yeah, it's so nice having those big ports on the back.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.820
I love that.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.900
It does have a removable six cell lithium battery

34:42.900 --> 34:45.500
at 62 watt hours, so you're getting,

34:46.600 --> 34:48.540
with my rather aggressive usage,

34:48.540 --> 34:53.540
you're getting an hour and 45 to two hours of pushing it.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.720
If you're sitting there doing a little light work

34:55.720 --> 34:58.100
and you're using Firefox as opposed to Chrome,

34:58.100 --> 34:59.840
you can push that a little bit further,

34:59.840 --> 35:02.960
but it's definitely enough power that we could use it

35:02.960 --> 35:05.200
during the show on battery and do some work,

35:05.200 --> 35:07.320
and as long as we eventually get back to the plug, we're okay.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.840
If you're just gonna go to a coffee shop for an hour or two,

35:09.840 --> 35:11.120
great, if you're gonna be there all day,

35:11.120 --> 35:12.460
then pack the plug.

35:12.460 --> 35:15.000
And it is a 5.51 pound stock,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.600
depending on your config, it'll change.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.240
5.5 pound laptop, two and a half kilograms.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.640
It's kind of right on the boundary.

35:21.640 --> 35:22.980
It's honestly not that heavy.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.960
I'm sitting here with all my knees as we're doing the show,

35:25.960 --> 35:29.780
and I think I could reasonably carry it around in a backpack,

35:29.780 --> 35:32.360
but it's not exactly comfortable,

35:32.360 --> 35:35.280
and it would be a little bit much on a plane, I think, too.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.080
I took this on a trip down to the river.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.280
I took my RV down to a river, had very little connectivity,

35:41.280 --> 35:45.720
and really kind of spent as much time offline as possible

35:45.720 --> 35:47.680
playing No Man's Sky when I was online

35:47.680 --> 35:52.280
or just sort of enjoying having a little bit of peace

35:52.280 --> 35:54.900
and quiet, and so I ended up lugging it around

35:54.900 --> 35:57.760
in a backpack that you and I got as a company event.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.400
So it's a Linux Academy swag backpack.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.480
Standard issue.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.360
And yeah, standard swag issue.

36:04.360 --> 36:08.560
And you know, I thought I'd be griping about,

36:08.560 --> 36:11.120
oh, it was so heavy to carry around in the backpack,

36:11.120 --> 36:14.400
but my ThinkPad with its extended battery on there,

36:14.400 --> 36:17.760
kind of, I mean, it's a little bit heavier,

36:17.760 --> 36:19.640
but not a lot heavier.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.320
It's like 4.8 pounds versus 5.5 pounds.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.880
It feels like what you think it would feel like.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.240
It's not like it seems heavier than it should be or anything.

36:26.240 --> 36:26.880
And that's great.

36:26.880 --> 36:27.880
Oh, Jesus.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.120
Oh, I know.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.620
So there's some things I don't like,

36:30.620 --> 36:32.680
and there's some things I really like.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.360
I'll start with a couple of things that I really like.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.520
Number one, this isn't unusual, but System76

36:38.520 --> 36:41.000
does a great job of putting together

36:41.000 --> 36:43.840
what they kind of coined a quick start guide,

36:43.840 --> 36:45.320
but it's more than that.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.720
It completely illustrates everything

36:47.720 --> 36:50.840
from what each key and port does to how

36:50.840 --> 36:53.120
to pull out the cooling on the CPU

36:53.120 --> 36:56.440
in case you want to repaste it, and everything in between.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.600
See, that's so nice.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.080
With color-coded motherboard diagrams

37:00.080 --> 37:03.560
of this is your storage, this is your Wi-Fi, totally like.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.200
You don't get that from other vendors.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.520
No, and in that same kind of vein,

37:07.520 --> 37:09.480
replacing the keyboard is simple.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.120
Just requires a cross-head screwdriver,

37:11.120 --> 37:13.000
and you could pop that keyboard off if you damage it

37:13.000 --> 37:13.960
and replace it.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.300
So there's aspects about this that I find when you're

37:16.300 --> 37:19.100
investing in a workstation where it really kind of matches

37:19.100 --> 37:20.200
that workstation name.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.340
Replaceable keyboard, replaceable battery,

37:23.340 --> 37:26.640
the storage, the memory, technically even the CPU

37:26.640 --> 37:28.240
cooling if you really want to go crazy,

37:28.240 --> 37:29.840
they're all user serviceable.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.600
That is really pretty great.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.440
And when you consider if you're going to spend $2,200, $2,300

37:35.440 --> 37:37.120
on a machine like this, you kind of

37:37.120 --> 37:37.800
want to be able to do that.

37:37.800 --> 37:38.680
It's a big investment, yeah.

37:38.680 --> 37:38.960
Right.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.600
So I think that kind of stuff actually does matter,

37:40.600 --> 37:42.480
and it's something you don't see very much.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.800
Also, without making a big fuss about it,

37:44.800 --> 37:47.320
there's some keyboard combos that I really like.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.080
One keyboard combo kills the webcam.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.760
I like that a lot.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.680
Another keyboard combo can turn on and off airplane mode.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.180
So you can just kill all the radios.

37:56.180 --> 37:56.720
Nice.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.220
Doesn't have to be some tacky switch on the side of the case.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.640
It's just a keyboard combo.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.840
And something else I like, because every now and then I

38:02.840 --> 38:05.160
know I'm going to just push this machine to the limit,

38:05.160 --> 38:08.520
you can toggle on and off the fans to absolute maximum.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.800
I discovered this once on accident, but now that I know,

38:10.800 --> 38:14.640
it's like function F1 or function 1, something like that.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.920
Now that I know it's that, and it's in their quick start

38:16.920 --> 38:18.040
guide, I love it.

38:18.040 --> 38:18.540
Right.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.600
Maybe it's a hot summer day here in the Pacific

38:20.600 --> 38:22.880
Northwest, but you just need to get some work done.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.440
It's a hot summer day in the Pacific Northwest,

38:25.440 --> 38:28.600
and Chris Fisher and Wes Payne are turning their laptop fans

38:28.600 --> 38:29.940
up to max.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.560
I don't know what just happened there.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.600
I don't know what happened there.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.400
But speaking of laptop fans, I did

38:34.400 --> 38:37.360
want to kind of talk about fan noise a little bit.

38:37.360 --> 38:42.320
So I'm no Wendell Wilson, but it seems to me

38:42.320 --> 38:45.440
that they have a somewhat kind of aggressive cooling

38:45.440 --> 38:48.080
curve on there where I'll hear the fan kick in,

38:48.080 --> 38:50.480
and then it kind of holds sort of low,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.740
and then it really kicks in.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.960
And I'll give you an example.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.240
This is near the side of the laptop

38:57.240 --> 38:59.520
during some benchmarking that I conducted,

38:59.520 --> 39:01.900
just to give you kind of idea what the laptop noise is like.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.680
It's not horrible, but it's noticeable.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.560
And you'll hear it kind of ramps up now.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.720
It moves quite a bit of air.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.920
There's two fans in this thing, so you can actually

39:16.920 --> 39:19.680
hear a little bit of fan noise, and it's just on the table,

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
right?

39:20.680 --> 39:27.880
And it's not horrible, and we were playing some games,

39:27.880 --> 39:30.080
and you could hear it over the speakers, which

39:30.080 --> 39:30.880
were turned up all the way.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.280
You could still hear the fans, but it wasn't that bad

39:34.280 --> 39:35.640
for what you're getting.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.280
You're getting incredible graphics.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.680
So it's sort of like, what do you expect?

39:40.680 --> 39:43.880
I suppose I would love to see something a little more

39:43.880 --> 39:46.560
graceful in the ramp up, but at the same time,

39:46.560 --> 39:48.520
I'm a stick it in high performance kind of guy

39:48.520 --> 39:49.440
and just let it go.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.000
Right, and you've got some control,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.040
just not maybe all the control that you'd like.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.600
So this laptop was an opportunity for me

39:55.600 --> 39:58.720
to really experience something with some profoundly better

39:58.720 --> 40:00.160
graphics than what I'm used to.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.360
I've spent the last year and change on Intel graphics.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.000
So when I was digging around in Pop OS

40:06.000 --> 40:08.200
and seeing different options for switching graphics

40:08.200 --> 40:12.080
and performance governor options that were in the Nome menu,

40:12.080 --> 40:14.200
I wanted to know if this is something they invented

40:14.200 --> 40:16.280
or if this is just something that people that

40:16.280 --> 40:19.080
have these fancy graphics cards experience.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.480
That is not specific to System76 products.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.640
It's any time you have a battery show up on the system,

40:26.640 --> 40:28.680
it assumes the system is a laptop.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.080
And the System76 power daemon, which

40:31.080 --> 40:35.960
is a component of Pop OS, creates that extension.

40:35.960 --> 40:40.680
So it allows you to set the CPU into a lower power mode.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.160
I'm sure you've seen that there's the performance mode,

40:44.160 --> 40:46.040
there's the balance mode, and then there's

40:46.040 --> 40:47.600
the battery saver mode.

40:47.600 --> 40:52.840
And what those do is change the turbo settings of the CPU.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.440
And also, there should be a graphic switch

40:55.440 --> 40:59.080
that shows up in that same area if you have NVIDIA Optimus.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.880
And this is on any system, not just our systems,

41:02.880 --> 41:07.260
although many of our systems have NVIDIA and have Optimus.

41:07.260 --> 41:10.220
It's super cool having a machine with these advanced graphics,

41:10.220 --> 41:12.340
because it's like a whole new world of things

41:12.340 --> 41:13.240
I get to play with.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.160
And one of the other things that I don't often get to mess around

41:16.160 --> 41:18.960
is really brilliant high DPI screens.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.000
My last experience is on a really kind of small high DPI.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.200
This is a very large screen for a laptop.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.880
And I noticed when I went into Nome Shell display area,

41:26.880 --> 41:29.200
there's some customization there to enable that.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.720
Can you talk about that a little bit?

41:30.720 --> 41:31.240
That's right.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.560
So on the Adder, we have an OLED high DPI screen.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.960
It's our flagship in terms of displays.

41:38.960 --> 41:42.920
I'm typically on a Galago with a 13-inch high DPI screen.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.040
And it is a world of difference when you move to OLED.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.040
It's so bright.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.240
The colors are crisp.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.560
The contrast is incredible.

41:50.560 --> 41:54.280
But software support is not that great right now

41:54.280 --> 41:55.900
in upstream Nome.

41:55.900 --> 42:00.080
So what we had to do was develop a number of items

42:00.080 --> 42:04.080
to perform brightness control for OLED screens.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.360
Brightness control is done in software on OLED screens.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.880
Since there is no backlight, the brightness

42:09.880 --> 42:12.860
of each individual pixel has to be

42:12.860 --> 42:15.440
edited by the graphics card, essentially,

42:15.440 --> 42:16.560
using a transform.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.400
So we do that with X11 gamma settings.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.840
And this works in X11 in any display environment,

42:24.840 --> 42:26.960
in any desktop environment.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.320
So whether you're in Nome or KDE,

42:29.320 --> 42:33.820
we have a daemon called System76-OLED that controls

42:33.820 --> 42:35.680
the X11 gamma settings.

42:35.680 --> 42:39.320
In addition, Nome with Wayland, we

42:39.320 --> 42:44.160
have integrated into Nome Settings daemon the ability

42:44.160 --> 42:47.360
to control gamma settings in Wayland as well.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.240
So there is Wayland support.

42:49.240 --> 42:53.240
But since there isn't a common way of setting gamma,

42:53.240 --> 42:55.760
it's only available in the Nome Wayland setting,

42:55.760 --> 42:58.400
not in other Wayland sessions.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.320
OK, that makes sense.

43:00.320 --> 43:04.240
And how portable is some of those System76 daemons?

43:04.240 --> 43:07.920
Say, maybe, I'm an Arch guy or an OpenSUSE guy or gal.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.760
Am I going to have a shot of running those?

43:09.760 --> 43:11.800
Yes, they're highly portable.

43:11.800 --> 43:18.560
What you have to do is just go to the GitHub page for PopOS

43:18.560 --> 43:21.920
and search for System76-OLED.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.600
That project, you can compile.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.080
It's standalone.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.560
It requires the Rust compiler.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.920
And there's already, I believe, an Arch package

43:29.920 --> 43:33.280
for it on the AUR, which, of course, there is, right?

43:33.280 --> 43:34.720
Of course, yes.

43:34.720 --> 43:40.000
In addition, we hope to upstream the Nome support for this.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.080
So we're not sure exactly what the transition will

43:43.080 --> 43:45.160
look like for non-Nome environments.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.920
But I do predict upstreaming the Nome support for OLED.

43:50.920 --> 43:56.960
It will require specific DMI information for each model.

43:56.960 --> 44:00.440
When we were doing this, we did some research and development.

44:00.440 --> 44:03.400
We tried to figure out what other vendors were doing.

44:03.400 --> 44:06.520
It turned out none of them were enabling backlight support

44:06.520 --> 44:08.800
or brightness support on OLED.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.160
So there's a Lenovo laptop that has OLED.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.720
There's a Dell laptop that has OLED.

44:14.720 --> 44:19.800
The Dell one actually comes with Linux out of the box from Dell.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.560
And they simply don't enable brightness control.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.960
And that really struck me as odd.

44:26.960 --> 44:31.120
But it also made us think, how would this have to be?

44:31.120 --> 44:34.760
If we're the first laptop company

44:34.760 --> 44:37.080
to upstream something like this, how would it

44:37.080 --> 44:41.720
have to merge into the X11 stack, into Nome,

44:41.720 --> 44:43.400
into different desktop environments

44:43.400 --> 44:48.840
to be as open as possible and work

44:48.840 --> 44:51.920
across different laptop vendors?

44:51.920 --> 44:55.280
So hopefully what we've done is generic enough

44:55.280 --> 44:57.640
that other laptops from other vendors

44:57.640 --> 45:00.120
can use it if they have an OLED display.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.880
Something else that came up on your call

45:01.880 --> 45:05.560
was some additional work for high DPI users.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.480
There's an additional component.

45:07.480 --> 45:12.240
So in addition to OLED support, we have a high DPI daemon.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.320
And what that does is if you plug

45:14.320 --> 45:18.040
in displays that have different DPIs,

45:18.040 --> 45:24.240
it will attempt to match them using a combination of X11

45:24.240 --> 45:27.640
scaling and changing the DPI settings.

45:27.640 --> 45:31.240
And with Nome Shell, this works really well.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.920
So you could plug into your adder

45:32.920 --> 45:35.960
a low DPI display or a standard DPI display,

45:35.960 --> 45:38.600
I guess is the way you should call it.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.040
And it will ask if you want to render the standard DPI

45:42.040 --> 45:47.200
display in X11 at two times its native resolution.

45:47.200 --> 45:50.120
And that way you get really crisp graphics

45:50.120 --> 45:52.600
on both displays without compromising

45:52.600 --> 45:57.400
software compatibility or having to move to Wayland.

45:57.400 --> 46:01.040
I want to thank Jeremy again for taking a few minutes there

46:01.040 --> 46:02.960
to take my call.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.920
And it's just so nice to be able to pick up the phone

46:04.920 --> 46:06.560
and just say, I got a couple of questions for you.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.960
System 76 is great.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.240
Right, easy, straightforward.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.340
You don't have to go through layers of bureaucracy.

46:11.340 --> 46:13.680
And you get to find out all of the cool details there.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.400
All the very details.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.720
So I played around with what he was talking about there.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.640
And this is how I eventually ended up

46:18.640 --> 46:20.920
setting the panel to 120 hertz.

46:20.920 --> 46:24.360
So when I set it down to 1080 to match a 1080 screen

46:24.360 --> 46:27.400
that I was plugging in, I noticed

46:27.400 --> 46:31.920
I had the option to set the refresh rate to 120 hertz.

46:31.920 --> 46:33.600
And when I ran XRender, it looked

46:33.600 --> 46:35.840
like I might be able to get other fun combinations

46:35.840 --> 46:36.840
if I wanted to push it.

46:36.840 --> 46:38.040
But I didn't want to push it.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.360
I just wanted to see what that was like.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.560
To my eye, and I'm curious to see what you think,

46:43.560 --> 46:46.040
but to my eye it seems, did you just change it?

46:46.040 --> 46:48.800
You're changing it right now?

46:48.800 --> 46:54.240
To my eye, it feels like a whole other dimension.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.960
When you and I were playing No Man's Sky, when that thing was

46:56.960 --> 47:00.320
at 120 hertz, now granted, you take your 4K screen down

47:00.320 --> 47:02.200
to 1080p to do this.

47:02.200 --> 47:06.120
No Man's Sky, it looked like we were looking through a window,

47:06.120 --> 47:09.320
not like we were looking at a screen.

47:09.320 --> 47:12.520
You described it as it's broken that screen game barrier.

47:12.520 --> 47:13.040
Yeah.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.640
I mean, you were just immersed in it.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.720
It broke me.

47:16.720 --> 47:19.440
We were both just sitting there gawking at it, playing with it,

47:19.440 --> 47:22.400
just moving, just looking around the world.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.480
I will never be able to unsee that on all of the systems

47:25.480 --> 47:26.600
I game on now.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.260
It will never be as satisfying as gaming on this system.

47:30.260 --> 47:33.440
Because of that graphics card in there with that screen, which

47:33.440 --> 47:39.160
means the blacks just are truly black, and then at 120 hertz,

47:39.160 --> 47:41.480
and you're getting like, oh, I don't know, 70,

47:41.480 --> 47:42.800
80 frames per second.

47:42.800 --> 47:45.200
I mean, when you're playing this thing at 1080p,

47:45.200 --> 47:47.800
the frame rate is just ridiculous.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.680
I mean, it's like, even at 4K in some of the games,

47:50.680 --> 47:53.480
I was getting 70 frames a second on some of my games.

47:53.480 --> 47:57.880
So even at 4K, I was getting great frame rates.

47:57.880 --> 48:03.400
So when you're in 1080p at 120 hertz, I can't even describe it.

48:03.400 --> 48:07.040
It broke my brain, and I will never be able to go back.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.000
Now I know my next system I build,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.520
I will have to have these components in the chain.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.280
That's just how it's going to be.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.240
And again, 12 cores on that system means anything you do.

48:17.240 --> 48:21.360
I built our app pick that we're about to talk about today

48:21.360 --> 48:23.520
on there, and it's just nuts because then I built it

48:23.520 --> 48:26.960
on my six core Intel desktop, and that thing really

48:26.960 --> 48:27.920
did trounce it.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.200
So that's what I want to talk about now

48:29.200 --> 48:30.760
is I want to talk about the actual performance

48:30.760 --> 48:32.920
because that's what you're buying this thing for.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.760
And I guess it depends.

48:34.760 --> 48:37.400
If you're buying the Adder workstation

48:37.400 --> 48:40.440
to take on, say, like a Thalia workstation

48:40.440 --> 48:46.200
or a similar system that you would build with modern parts,

48:46.200 --> 48:49.520
that desktop is going to beat this laptop when

48:49.520 --> 48:51.000
you go toe to toe.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.280
It's just how it is because it's a laptop.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.120
However, if you are looking for something

48:56.120 --> 48:59.120
that is beating all of the other laptops on the market,

48:59.120 --> 49:01.080
that's where this thing really shines.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.920
This is like, in my estimation, as good

49:03.920 --> 49:08.520
as it kind of gets right now in supported Linux laptops

49:08.520 --> 49:10.280
for ultimate performance.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.920
Like a mobile workstation that does all the things

49:12.920 --> 49:15.720
you might want or need to do on a desktop,

49:15.720 --> 49:16.920
but you can move it around.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.440
It's not as fast as a desktop of today,

49:19.440 --> 49:22.080
like a really great desktop of today.

49:22.080 --> 49:25.760
But it is as fast as a really great laptop of today

49:25.760 --> 49:26.920
that has full Linux support.

49:26.920 --> 49:30.040
And I want to make a couple amendments to that.

49:30.040 --> 49:34.600
First of all, this laptop has a pretty good set of compromises.

49:34.600 --> 49:38.000
Most laptops are a series of compromises.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
This one has weighed in a couple of ways

49:42.000 --> 49:46.960
that I am in my current phase of future laptops appreciating.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.720
I could see myself with something like this

49:48.720 --> 49:50.040
because of this.

49:50.040 --> 49:54.320
It compromises portability and battery life and USB-C

49:54.320 --> 50:01.080
charging for a really just unbelievable screen,

50:01.080 --> 50:07.120
a extremely fast processor, and extremely competent graphics,

50:07.120 --> 50:09.400
and a lot of storage.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.160
You can put a lot of storage into this thing.

50:11.160 --> 50:15.240
You can also put standard SATA SSDs in this thing.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.880
I mean, I have an Evo in this thing right now.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.600
But it also has, like I said, two slots, two M.2 slots.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.240
Ready to go.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.160
So you can put a lot of storage.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.760
You get a lot of CPU power.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.520
You get a lot of GPU power.

50:27.520 --> 50:30.360
It's leaning to that power side, not as much the portability

50:30.360 --> 50:30.880
side.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.000
If you're doing encoding, you're doing TensorFlow,

50:33.000 --> 50:36.400
you're doing these kind of CUDA work, these kinds of tasks,

50:36.400 --> 50:41.720
this is so far and above and beyond buying something else

50:41.720 --> 50:43.480
that you would slam Linux onto.

50:43.480 --> 50:46.600
But if the one thing you need and above anything else

50:46.600 --> 50:49.040
is just raw horsepower, a desktop's

50:49.040 --> 50:50.360
still going to beat this thing.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.160
That's just the reality of it.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.920
So it really does depend on what you need.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.920
So here's what I did.

50:55.920 --> 50:59.080
Last night and this morning, I uploaded a few benchmarks

50:59.080 --> 51:01.840
to openbenchmark.org.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.800
Memory speed benchmarks, where this thing really

51:03.800 --> 51:05.880
crushes it, by the way.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.760
File system stressing benchmarks and graphics magic computation

51:09.760 --> 51:11.640
benchmarks.

51:11.640 --> 51:15.560
So you can do a one-to-one comparison with this laptop

51:15.560 --> 51:16.600
to your laptop.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.520
There's a command line when you go to the web page.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.400
If you have the Ferronix benchmark installed,

51:20.400 --> 51:21.840
there's a command line that you can

51:21.840 --> 51:25.480
copy that will compare your system to this system,

51:25.480 --> 51:28.400
using all of the data I have uploaded OpenBenchmark.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.520
And you can use that to put real numbers to compare

51:31.520 --> 51:34.760
what kind of difference you would see in your workloads

51:34.760 --> 51:36.600
and maybe quantify the value.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.800
So if you're on the fence and you can't really decide,

51:38.800 --> 51:42.280
use that tool, because it's a fantastic resource.

51:42.280 --> 51:46.080
But I'll note, as you've sat here now, because we kind of

51:46.080 --> 51:47.200
mentioned the fan noise.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.840
As you sat here just using it, running, I presume,

51:49.840 --> 51:51.160
Chrome or Firefox, maybe?

51:51.160 --> 51:52.840
Yeah, I got Chrome going here.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.280
Nice, because I didn't put Chrome on there.

51:55.280 --> 51:59.040
No, I installed Chrome.

51:59.040 --> 52:00.160
It hasn't made a peep.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.360
There's been zero fan noise.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.400
No, it's been totally fine.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.200
I got NetData going on here, too, and you can tell.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.000
It's just, you know.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.320
You're putting NetData on there?

52:06.320 --> 52:09.360
Well, yeah, and it looks beautiful.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.600
So if you're not pushing it, the noise profile

52:12.600 --> 52:13.680
is surprisingly low.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.280
In fact, I think it's probably one

52:15.280 --> 52:18.880
of the quietest large system 76 laptops I've ever used.

52:18.880 --> 52:22.200
And when you push it, it doesn't seem unreasonable,

52:22.200 --> 52:24.000
because it's got to have cooling in there,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.680
because you've got a big old GPU and you've got a big old CPU.

52:26.680 --> 52:27.800
Like, you've got to cool that.

52:27.800 --> 52:29.680
And that's the compromise you make on this kind of thing.

52:29.680 --> 52:31.380
And it's not like a really harsh noise.

52:31.380 --> 52:32.680
It's kind of a white noise fan noise.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.080
No, it wasn't offensive at all.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.680
Overall, I'm really impressed with this.

52:36.680 --> 52:39.360
The keyboard is pretty good.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.840
It's not my favorite keyboard.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.240
It's not a ThinkPad keyboard, but it's better than a MacBook.

52:44.240 --> 52:46.240
Oh, but by far and away, yes.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.480
Trackpad is bigger than they typically have been.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.360
It's smooth.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.160
It's not my favorite trackpad.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.000
It's not better than a MacBook, but it's

52:53.000 --> 52:56.640
better than historically we've gotten on laptops.

52:56.640 --> 52:57.440
It's not bad.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.400
I mean, I jumped on it today, and it hasn't been a big issue.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.240
I actually, I really kind of got my,

53:02.240 --> 53:03.840
with the exception of when I'm gaming,

53:03.840 --> 53:06.040
I've been using the trackpad for the entire review,

53:06.040 --> 53:08.160
which at times was hard.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.680
But I'm just not a big trackpad guy to begin with.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.840
The I.O. is fantastic on this thing.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.600
And when you match it with the performance,

53:15.600 --> 53:16.680
it's pretty killer.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.360
And throughout, I was like, can I

53:18.360 --> 53:20.280
do this on a different distribution?

53:20.280 --> 53:22.080
I actually thought, just as a side tangent,

53:22.080 --> 53:23.520
I actually thought I'd blow Pop!

53:23.520 --> 53:26.120
OS away and put Fedora on there, or Manjaro.

53:26.120 --> 53:26.840
Sure.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.040
Never bothered.

53:28.040 --> 53:32.680
I was so impressed with the entire process

53:32.680 --> 53:37.200
from first time setup, where it reinstalls and encrypts

53:37.200 --> 53:43.920
the drive, to the pop shop, the extensions that they've

53:43.920 --> 53:47.040
chosen to install, the theme.

53:47.040 --> 53:49.400
All of it was so damn nice.

53:49.400 --> 53:52.480
And then you combine a really fast gnome shell

53:52.480 --> 53:55.200
at 120 hertz, where the animations are butter.

53:55.200 --> 54:00.680
Even at 4K, when the thing's at 60 hertz, it still looks great.

54:00.680 --> 54:03.920
I was never compelled to remove Pop!

54:03.920 --> 54:06.320
Partly because for a large portion of my usage,

54:06.320 --> 54:08.480
I was mostly offline.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.520
So I really couldn't download a distro,

54:10.520 --> 54:11.560
and so I kind of had to stick with it.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.960
But once I got rolling, I was like, this is pretty great.

54:13.960 --> 54:17.160
I mean, just having Linux already on it,

54:17.160 --> 54:19.600
then you can just sit down and get to work.

54:19.600 --> 54:23.040
And I also can now better appreciate

54:23.040 --> 54:26.080
Pop! OS's role in System76's mission,

54:26.080 --> 54:30.400
using it on their hardware, where they've got just

54:30.400 --> 54:33.800
some rough edges smoothed, like moving between GPUs,

54:33.800 --> 54:35.440
and hooking up the external display,

54:35.440 --> 54:38.720
and these little things that you could get to on any distro,

54:38.720 --> 54:41.000
probably, but they've already done it for you.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.320
And now I get it.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.600
Oh, they're really actually doing

54:43.600 --> 54:44.840
quite a bit of customizations.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.360
They've done their own installer.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.800
They have their own shop.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.400
They are making these extensions pre-installed by default

54:50.400 --> 54:52.280
that they think make their experience better.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.000
And I agree.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.640
In fact, there was not a single one I went in there

54:54.640 --> 54:55.240
and pulled out.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.720
And I'll be the first to be like, nope.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.520
And opened that out of there, did not do any of that with these.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.240
The entire through-and-through process

55:02.240 --> 55:05.200
felt like it was very cohesive.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.920
And I want to remind everybody that I've

55:06.920 --> 55:09.000
bought a lot of System76 hardware over the years.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.700
I was one of their very first customers.

55:10.700 --> 55:13.280
So I've experienced different levels of integration

55:13.280 --> 55:14.880
with the operating system.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.880
And in, I don't know, what is this, 12 years

55:16.880 --> 55:18.560
that I've tried out System76 hardware?

55:18.560 --> 55:18.920
I don't know what.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.200
It might be more than that.

55:20.200 --> 55:23.400
This is clearly the most integrated experience

55:23.400 --> 55:24.800
I've ever seen.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.160
And my instincts on it are, I don't know,

55:27.160 --> 55:28.520
but my instincts on it is they're still

55:28.520 --> 55:29.360
just getting really started.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.320
There are only a couple of releases into this.

55:31.320 --> 55:33.020
And that's why, through the entire review,

55:33.020 --> 55:35.920
I was fishing to see is it dependent on Pop!

55:35.920 --> 55:36.840
OS?

55:36.840 --> 55:38.120
Because I think that's a deal breaker for some

55:38.120 --> 55:38.760
of our audience.

55:38.760 --> 55:39.600
Sure, right.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.000
And each time, the answer was no.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.360
Sometimes, well, you might have to build it.

55:42.360 --> 55:42.760
Right.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.200
You might have to do a little customization yourself

55:44.200 --> 55:45.480
that we've done for you.

55:45.480 --> 55:47.240
But it's all out there in the open, right?

55:47.240 --> 55:49.240
And that's one thing we love about System76.

55:49.240 --> 55:50.400
It's pretty nice.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.120
Pretty good rig.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.620
You just got to make the decision for yourself.

55:52.620 --> 55:55.600
So that's why I encourage you to try out the Ferronix test

55:55.600 --> 55:57.200
suite, it's absolutely free.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.960
And that's the tool that Michael Larable uses

55:59.960 --> 56:00.960
for the Ferronix website.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.980
And compare it to the ones I did.

56:02.980 --> 56:07.720
I uploaded the ones that I thought were more relevant.

56:07.720 --> 56:09.120
I tried a few.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.760
Some of them didn't execute properly.

56:10.760 --> 56:12.120
Some of it was a bit of a mixed bag.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.320
But one of the fun things is that comparison.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.120
Because it'll generate all the charts for you.

56:16.120 --> 56:16.960
I love that.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.680
So geeky.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.320
And we'll have more information in the show notes

56:21.320 --> 56:23.360
if you would like it.

56:23.360 --> 56:26.780
Mr. Westpain, I've got a very fun app pick for you this week.

56:26.780 --> 56:29.240
I know you need another terminal, right?

56:29.240 --> 56:32.680
Like you need another shell, I guess.

56:32.680 --> 56:36.520
But Starship is a minimal and fast shell prompt that is,

56:36.520 --> 56:39.720
get ready for it, written in Rust.

56:39.720 --> 56:40.220
Yep.

56:40.220 --> 56:40.720
Yeah.

56:40.720 --> 56:44.640
And because of that, I saw you sneak this into the show notes.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.140
And I've got it installed right here.

56:46.140 --> 56:46.400
Yeah.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.100
Isn't it cool?

56:47.100 --> 56:47.600
It is.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.480
So did you use Cargo on that system?

56:49.480 --> 56:52.120
No, they've also got some release binaries

56:52.120 --> 56:53.840
that you can go download and just stick it

56:53.840 --> 56:54.880
on your path somewhere.

56:54.880 --> 56:55.380
Yeah.

56:55.380 --> 56:57.800
Then you've got to just add a little thing that starts it up

56:57.800 --> 56:58.920
in your Bash RC.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.080
They've got instructions.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.960
Or maybe you're doing CSH or Phish or whatever.

57:02.960 --> 57:05.360
And it's much like it's a Powerline style

57:05.360 --> 57:07.660
prompt that you might be familiar with from other things.

57:07.660 --> 57:09.320
But it's just fast.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.520
It's fast and has a nice, what looks

57:11.520 --> 57:13.600
like a nice little Tomwell configuration file

57:13.600 --> 57:15.360
if you want to customize it a little more.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.000
Yes.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.160
You will have to install the Powerline font first,

57:18.160 --> 57:20.960
which is how to do that is linked in the guide

57:20.960 --> 57:22.560
that we have in the show notes.

57:22.560 --> 57:23.680
It is just fun and cool.

57:23.680 --> 57:24.680
I just thought it'd be.

57:24.680 --> 57:25.480
You know, there's nice little things

57:25.480 --> 57:27.540
like indications of return code status

57:27.540 --> 57:29.880
or how long the last command took

57:29.880 --> 57:32.780
and how long it executed right there for you out of the box.

57:32.780 --> 57:33.680
I do like that.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.360
I'm a numbers guy with that kind of stuff.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.280
Yeah, there's lots of little configuration options,

57:37.280 --> 57:38.360
which are really cool, too, like ways

57:38.360 --> 57:41.280
to display the current prompt order and configuration

57:41.280 --> 57:44.200
on how your path should look, all those little things

57:44.200 --> 57:46.400
that you can really tweak to make the shell feel

57:46.400 --> 57:47.400
like it's perfect.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.080
It's nice that it's fast, too, because some of those prompts,

57:50.080 --> 57:51.840
once you've got a lot of options,

57:51.840 --> 57:53.280
they can get kind of sluggish.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.280
And it's always annoying when you open up a terminal

57:55.280 --> 57:58.560
and it takes any time at all to be ready for you.

57:58.560 --> 58:00.400
I'll tell you my motivation.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.920
I wonder what you think of this.

58:02.920 --> 58:04.680
Oh, that's cheese, too.

58:04.680 --> 58:08.320
I have been thinking about becoming

58:08.320 --> 58:13.040
one of those guys that's like, rah, rah, use the terminal.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.920
Noobs should use the terminal.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.360
Yeah, come join me, man.

58:17.360 --> 58:20.720
Because it's like the universal interface

58:20.720 --> 58:23.000
to all Linux distributions.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.680
You can message people commands that they can run.

58:26.680 --> 58:31.680
But also, it's like the common denominator.

58:31.680 --> 58:33.640
Your system can be really, really hosed.

58:33.640 --> 58:36.360
And if you're somewhat comfortable on the command line,

58:36.360 --> 58:38.320
you have a chance of getting it going again.

58:38.320 --> 58:39.200
Jeez, you think I'm crazy?

58:39.200 --> 58:40.680
You think I'm going to scare off all the noobs if I

58:40.680 --> 58:41.840
tell them to use the command line?

58:41.840 --> 58:43.800
No, I mean, I feel that, yeah, it

58:43.800 --> 58:46.600
can be intimidating to jump in the command line initially

58:46.600 --> 58:48.480
and try and figure it out yourself.

58:48.480 --> 58:50.120
I know it was for me whenever I first

58:50.120 --> 58:53.160
started experimenting with Linux back in the 90s.

58:53.160 --> 58:55.640
But it's really one of those things now where

58:55.640 --> 58:56.800
you can jump right in.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.840
You shouldn't be scared to get in there on the terminal

58:59.840 --> 59:01.040
and do a little bit of work.

59:01.040 --> 59:05.160
And like you said, it can really save you a lot of grief

59:05.160 --> 59:08.880
if you know enough to get in and start looking at what's

59:08.880 --> 59:11.960
going on in the bootloader.

59:11.960 --> 59:13.560
It can instantly lead you down a path

59:13.560 --> 59:16.280
to troubleshoot for yourself.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.920
So here's the other reason.

59:17.920 --> 59:21.320
Inevitably, it always happens.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.400
You're browsing the web for a guide.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.920
You eventually come across something

59:24.920 --> 59:28.120
that says, copy this command and paste it in your terminal.

59:28.120 --> 59:31.520
Now, if you have no idea what any of these commands do,

59:31.520 --> 59:33.800
you've got no idea if that's a good idea or a bad idea.

59:33.800 --> 59:34.880
You can't evaluate it.

59:34.880 --> 59:37.600
How are you supposed to be a responsible command line

59:37.600 --> 59:40.680
user if you don't use it from time to time?

59:40.680 --> 59:43.120
And then you eventually will come across an opportunity

59:43.120 --> 59:46.080
where somebody says, pop open the old terminal

59:46.080 --> 59:49.440
and sudo w get this bash script.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.640
I mean, we've all seen that.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.400
I like your idea here, though, because I don't

59:52.400 --> 59:53.480
think it needs to replace it.

59:53.480 --> 59:55.720
We should still try to get great graphical user

59:55.720 --> 59:56.800
interfaces out there, right?

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.480
But for some people, that can be better for some interfaces,

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.160
for some commands, for some tasks on the system.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.240
And we happen to have a great terminal

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.640
environment on these Linux operating systems.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.920
We should take advantage of it.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.560
That's just it.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.520
There's some really good tools in there that aren't hard to use.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.800
They're just different to use.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.120
One example, too, and I mentioned this last week,

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.080
with the 2-in-1 laptop that I was messing with,

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.200
it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope in it.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.440
And so whenever the machine boots up,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.040
the login screen would be rotated and upside down.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.640
I would still be able to log in.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.140
And as soon as I launched a terminal,

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.880
I could run XRender, TACO, normal, and boom.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.440
Everything's right itself.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.160
I'm good.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.520
I can go back and blacklist kernel modules, whatever

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.840
I need to do from there.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.520
And then I'm done, right?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.160
Yeah.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.840
And yeah, I mean, it took a couple of commands

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.280
on the command line to do that, because even the GNOME

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.160
rotation lock wouldn't work in that instance.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.560
So you can get yourself out of some really tricky situations

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.080
by just knowing a few commands and not

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.160
being intimidated by the terminal, for sure.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.040
Back in my day, you had to write your own Xconfig.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.800
That's what I say.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.240
Get out of here, old man.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.320
XF86 config, baby.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.240
All right, listen, there's a few bits of housekeeping

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.360
that we should probably wrap on, too.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.480
We should include these in the actual housekeeping.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.160
Too late.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.760

01:01:44.400 --> 01:02:14.200
I'm Chris Ellis, and I'll see you next week.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:22.520
CentOS Stream, CentOS Stream, CentOS Stream.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.560
Which one do you like better?

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.480
I kind of like CentOS.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.000
CentOS.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.760
Yeah, I think I find myself using multiple ones.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.480
I mean, mostly CentOS and CentOS.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.160
But it's so it's hard to keep that straight.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.480
I fluctuate on pronunciations.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.960
Thankfully, everyone knows what you're talking about either way.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.520
I personally use CentOS, but a lot of people around me

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.160
have been using the word CentOS, and it's

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.560
bled into the way I refer to it.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.280
I'm having that happen with GNOME Shell.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.000
The reverse of it.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.760
Yes.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.960
Like at some point, I was like, I'm going to be stubborn.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.480
I'm just going to call it GNOME.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.240
But then now everybody around me has been calling it GNOME,

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.200
and now I'm GNOMing it up over here.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.840
Tell you what, on the GNOME desktop and the GNOME Shell.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.400
One of the things about the adder

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.040
that I think is really interesting too

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.560
is that there is the full gigabit ethernet there.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.560
So you have all this power, and you actually

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.560
have the bandwidth to push these, I don't know,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.040
heavy graphics projects through video rendering,

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.280
whatever you might be doing.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.160
Also, you got DisplayPort, HDMI, and you

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.480
can do video over one of the USB-C ports.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.960
So there's all of the ways to get screens on this thing.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.440
Right.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.620
If you ever show up to a conference and they're like,

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.120
you're going to need a DisplayPort, you're like, dude,

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:31.620
I got it.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.120
I got it.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.280
I got it, yeah.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.200
I was like, I wish I had enough screens

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.120
to try to use up all the ports on this thing

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.520
just to go at it for a little bit.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.880
But they do not grow on trees around here, unfortunately.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.640
But I love that those ports are on the back.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.200
Love that.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.240
You got a USB on the back.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.360
You got your ethernet.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.360
You got your display adapters and your power

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.480
all on the back behind the screen.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.960
So you never have to see the cables.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.360
They're never on the side.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.840
And if you're Bluetooth mousing it,

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.440
you're basically good to go.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.520
It's pretty nice.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.360
Yeah, that's great.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.200
But I don't know.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:06.040
I am very giddy about CentOS 8 and CentOS stream

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.520
because starting about Fedora 28,

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.760
I started really enjoying Fedora.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.080
And so it's essentially time-capsuled

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.120
what has been one of my favorite releases of Fedora.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.800
And I've got all these projects right now.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.400
I've got these Raspberry Pi.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.920
So I'm going to set up another Raspberry

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.760
Pi in a few weeks.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.160
And I'm thinking, well, do I maybe try out CentOS now?

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah, I think you do.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.280
I think you do, bud.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.440
But do I do CentOS 8?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.920
Do I do CentOS stream?

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.880
Definitely stream.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.800
You think so?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.160
You start with 8, and then you can go to stream

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.640
whenever the hell you want.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.360
OK, I just got to process that for a second.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.320
That's really cool.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.200
It does make sense, too, right?

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.920
I mean, with the Rel8 transition and focus

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.640
on containers, which, I mean, you're also

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.560
running a whole bunch of containers.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.840
So it's ready for you.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.760
It's important to realize that the CentOS stream is not

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.520
fundamentally different than CentOS 8 right now.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.760
It is just essentially, at this point,

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.600
going to eventually become CentOS 8.1 or CentOS 8.2.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.200
So it's just a little bit of the future

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.120
with maybe some new stuff that Red Hat has been cooking

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.640
on backporting from Fedora into the Rel tree.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.040
That seems like the right gearing for a home server.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.000
It does sound nice, right.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.760
Because you don't need crazy stability,

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.560
but you also don't need a whole bunch of crazy new changes.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.320
Yeah.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.320
Oh, boy.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.360
One really cool thing that I noticed today

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.280
researching all this and looking at it,

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.000
the 8 stream has a newer kernel than what's

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.280
in the Rel8.1 beta right now, which is awesome.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.040
Yeah, because right now, CentOS stream

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.640
is actually based on 8.2.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.720
Of course.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.360
Right.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.280
That's how it's going to be.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.120
Well, just the kernel right now, the rest of the stuff

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.280
matches 8.0.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.440
Yeah, they say they'll document it on the wiki.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:49.960
We shall see.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.600
I'm going to be watching this pretty closely.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.400
I honestly didn't think Rel would get first to streaming.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.520
I mean, I appreciate it's not Rel, or to rolling.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.520
I thought, honestly, we'd see an Ubuntu rolling first.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.400
It doesn't make sense for an Ubuntu rolling

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.080
to really exist, because what is Ubuntu rolling but just

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.080
a rebuild of Debian most of the time?

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.760
The way that the Ubuntu development process starts

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.000
from is they are mass importing Debian packages

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.200
and just rebuilding it with the Ubuntu branding.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.060
They don't make changes until they freeze the tree

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.480
and stop importing.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.600
I feel like I'm much more comfortable running

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.200
an Ubuntu LTS on a server than a current release of Debian.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.120
And I know that sounds crazy to some people.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.620
And I am running Debian on a server.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620
I acknowledge that.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:42.560
But to me, an Ubuntu LTS feels more like a Fedora,

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.640
and Ubuntu feels more like a Rel in LTS.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.040
And I think they don't necessarily

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.320
need a rolling, because they've kind of nailed the update

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.920
methodology where they backport the driver enablement

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.520
stack to the LTS release.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.280
This just sort of keeps that LTS relevant and ticking.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.200
Debian default doesn't have that live patch ability either

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.360
that you do get with Ubuntu, because I'm the same way.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.800
I have a Debian, Armbian based server

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.160
running on a single board computer,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.320
but I also have stuff in the cloud running LTS.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.400
Also, another thing that I don't know

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.880
if anybody picked up on in the last couple of months or so,

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.640
but now Red Hat is slowly working through,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.760
including kernel live patching in the basic subscriptions

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.320
for Rel.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.920
It's no longer a separate component.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.000
I don't think we will see that trickle down into CentOS

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.200
yet, because the amount of effort

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.600
it actually takes to make live patches that work

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.920
is kind of ridiculous.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.200
Hey, Neil, I think you mean CentOS.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:56.560
Oh, I mean CentOS.
