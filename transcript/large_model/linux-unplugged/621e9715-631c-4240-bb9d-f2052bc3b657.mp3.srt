1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Going back to Popey's argument about filing a bug,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,400
this is not one I think,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,560
and I don't know, maybe it's my bias.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,760
I've been around for a while.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,800
This is not one I think is worth my time.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Because it's-

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah, that's what I heard for six months

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
from the people complaining about wireless on 1604.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,160
I disagree with that.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
I didn't actually have that problem, but that would've been-

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Oh my God.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,000
That would've been one that would've been.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,360
But that's exactly the problem.

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,880
Like not everyone had this problem.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,800
There were people like very close to you

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
ranting about how wireless on 1604 was completely busted

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,240
and everyone should avoid it on 2604.

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,320
It turns out, no, it's not busted for everyone.

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,440
It's not busted for anyone in Canonical.

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
It's only busted for certain select people

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,920
with certain chipsets in certain environments.

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,760
That's crazy.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,200
Those fuckers wouldn't tell us

24
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,040
what the details of that system was.

25
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,360
If you don't tell us, we can't fucking fix it.

26
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,640
I think this is a real problem.

27
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,680
I think the core problem that that issue,

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,400
the thing is, is I'm not gonna spend my time.

29
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
I'm not gonna spend, I'm not gonna, like I said,

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,200
if I'm working 65 hours this week,

31
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm not gonna work 67 hours

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,280
so that way I can report a bug

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
and then watch them tell me it's an Nvidia problem.

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm not gonna do it.

35
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Doesn't Canonical maintain a list of certified hardware?

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
We do, yeah.

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
So if you're buying outside of that list,

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,720
but you don't wanna spend time there to report the issues,

39
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,360
like that's kind of seems like.

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,680
Also, it's a bit cheeky to say

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,800
that you're not willing to put in the extra hours

42
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,160
when all these people who are working their day job

43
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,000
and then in their spare time, in their evenings,

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
are working on open source projects.

45
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,000
I agree.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm just telling you, I think that's what's happening.

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,760
I think that's it.

48
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,280
And I think that's just human nature.

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,800
People are, they're at their wits end with so many things,

50
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,520
especially in the US, that I think that's the issue,

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
is people are out of bandwidth.

52
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,320
That you gotta buy the certified hardware.

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,040
Right, I mean, there's a little, and there's other,

54
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,280
I mean, there's a lot of different answers,

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,240
but I think the core problem

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
of people not reporting what's going on,

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
like they're not gonna get a bug report from me on this.

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm just gonna either move on or, you know,

59
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
I don't know what.

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
So this is one of the reasons,

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,080
and it's a slight change of topic,

62
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,280
but this is one of the reasons

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,200
why we want that crash reporting information from people.

64
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,560
Cause it's not just like, you know,

65
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,920
weirdness that happens on your display,

66
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,840
but when shit crashes, we want to know about that

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
so we can fix it.

68
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,640
And we know there are plenty of people.

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,920
I can sit here and berate you

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000
and encourage you to file a bug,

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
but I know there are, for every one of you,

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,560
there's a hundred or a thousand,

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,720
or maybe a hundred thousand people who will not file a bug,

74
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,280
don't know how, didn't know it's even possible, right?

75
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,240
But if under the covers, when something crashes,

76
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,280
if we can, in a tasteful way, take that crash report

77
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,440
and aggregate it with all the other crash reports

78
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
that are similar, and we can analyze that and say,

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
okay, we've got a problem.

80
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,720
We need to fix this thing.

81
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
We don't even ever have to interact

82
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,760
with human beings out in the field.

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Which is how it should work.

84
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,040
Fix that code, right.

85
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,560
But not everything is a crash, right?

86
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,720
And what you're experiencing is not necessarily a crash.

87
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,600
And that's the problem, is not everything can be captured

88
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,040
and fixed via crash reports.

89
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,120
Well, this is my long way of saying

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm switching to elementary OS.

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Sweet. Boom.

92
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Awesome.

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
You know how many-

94
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
You're still gonna have Nvidia problems.

95
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,120
So don't fuck it up, Dan.

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,600
May you have a nice time and the Nvidia RNG gods bless you.

97
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm just worried you're gonna screw this whole thing up.

98
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,440
You got a good thing going, that's all.

99
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
So just keep it going, Dan.

100
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't mess things up.

101
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Or thinking about putting an Amazon search in.

102
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Oh yeah. Oh, that would be so handy.

103
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah. Yeah, good.

104
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
That's great timing.

105
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,200
Generates revenue, mate.

106
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Whatever you might think, it generates revenue.

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 244.

108
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

109
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,560
that's sitting in front of so many Linux rigs,

110
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm starting to lose track.

111
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
My name is Chris.

112
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
My name is Wes.

113
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,080
Hello, Wes.

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,040
That's a little bit of a behind the scenes joke,

115
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
I suppose. It sure is.

116
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
But I'll tell you what, Wes,

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
everything we have to talk about

118
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
is gonna be in front of the scenes this week?

119
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,240
Out in the open.

120
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
Wes and I are gonna be out in the open

121
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
coming up really soon.

122
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,280
We'll tell you about where you can come hang out with us

123
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,880
and perhaps watch a live taping of this very show.

124
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,840
ZFS on Linux has a bit of a butterFS bug.

125
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,080
We'll tell you what's going on,

126
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
and no, it's not actually that bad.

127
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,400
And Steam Machines are perhaps not so dead?

128
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,920
We kind of got down on Steam Machines last week,

129
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,400
so we gotta follow up on that.

130
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,560
NVIDIA is taking away your cookies,

131
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,840
and there's a new tool out

132
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,560
that let's just say it's gonna make your stuff look better.

133
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
It's gonna make your stuff look better.

134
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,680
The stuff you back up,

135
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
the stuff you back up off the web

136
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
is gonna look better with this.

137
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm not gonna say any more than that

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
because the copyright lawyers may be listening right now,

139
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
but we'll move on.

140
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Then later on in the show,

141
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,920
we have a new segment called Plasma Corner,

142
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,040
which changed a little bit before the show started,

143
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,680
but we'll talk about Plasma Vault,

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
which is a really sweet Plasma applet

145
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,320
that gives you a front end to creating encrypted vaults

146
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,600
and some new features that are coming to Plasma Vault

147
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
really soon that I think you're gonna love,

148
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,880
and then we'll discuss, I think,

149
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
the only dock you should be using

150
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
if you should so choose to do so on the Plasma desktop.

151
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,080
Now, I'm not saying you should.

152
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm not saying you should, but I found a dock,

153
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
replaced my Plasma panel with it, and I'm loving it.

154
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll tell you about that,

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,920
and then we'll talk a little bit about Falcon,

156
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,400
a cross-platform QT web browser

157
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,160
that, not bad, it's not bad.

158
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
So how about that, Wes?

159
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,120
That is a full show.

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
That's some things, that's some things.

161
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Let's get into it.

162
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
So let's not go any further

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
without bringing in our virtual lug time.

164
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
Appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Hello. Hello.

166
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Hello.

167
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Hello.

168
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,280
Hello.

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Jeez, hi, guys.

170
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
It's good to be connected with all of you.

171
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
Thanks for being here.

172
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
I wanna just start the show out with a plug skis

173
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
for Linux Fest Northwest 2018,

174
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,240
which will be April 28th through the 29th this year,

175
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
and Wes and I will be there,

176
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,000
as well as many others from the Jupiter Broadcasting crew,

177
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
including Noah and Alan Jude and Angela and others.

178
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
We'll be doing some live shows from there.

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,440
We'll have a booth.

180
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,800
We'll have some swag.

181
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,840
We'll be chatting with people.

182
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,520
We'll be drinking beers and hanging out

183
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,080
and doing all the things you do when you're in Bellingham.

184
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,120
So join us there, Linux Fest Northwest.

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,720
You can find out more at linuxfestnorthwest.org.

186
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,200
Just a little bit left.

187
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,440
I think, just a little bit of time left,

188
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,280
but I think not so many rooms left.

189
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,680
So that's why I camp in the parking lot in my RV.

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,400
Linux Fest Northwest 2018.

191
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Go check it out, linuxfestnorthwest.org.

192
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,520
It looks like it's already the biggest Linux Fest this year.

193
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
I mean, this year's already the biggest.

194
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
You know what I mean?

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
It's the biggest one yet,

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,000
because they've sold out of all the things,

197
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,880
and we'd love to see you there and hang out with us.

198
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,920
I think that'd be a lot of fun.

199
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
I'm looking forward to it.

200
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,120
We may just try, I don't know.

201
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,360
We may just try to do like a weekend edition of this show,

202
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,520
and do it live there at the Fest.

203
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
That'd be a lot of fun.

204
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,760
So stay tuned for that, linuxfest.org, if you wanna go.

205
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,160
And I may try to make it down

206
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,600
to Southeast Linux Fest this year too.

207
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
So may see you down there as well.

208
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
There's other events coming up,

209
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,920
but I think Linux Fest Northwest is one of the best,

210
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
and Bellingham is a ton of fun.

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
Just before the show, Wes and I were talking

212
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
about how much we're looking forward

213
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,800
to just going back to Bellingham.

214
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
It's just a great place to hang out.

215
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,720
It's such a wonderful place.

216
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
It's a college town.

217
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
There's a lot of different breweries there.

218
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
There's just a lot going on.

219
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
It's a cute quintessential Pacific Northwest place.

220
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
All right, so now let's talk about destroying your data.

221
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Now that that's out of the way, you know me.

222
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm a pretty big fan of the ZFS,

223
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,200
but you knew this day was coming.

224
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,680
You knew a reckoning was in the works,

225
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,040
and let's be honest, you still rolled the dice.

226
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,320
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

227
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Okay, well now not all of us have rolled the dice,

228
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,160
but there is a disappearing files issue

229
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,960
on ZFS on Linux right now.

230
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,160
On certain distributions, and I want to do a breakdown

231
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,800
just so you can be aware of what's going on.

232
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
The ZFS team is already well aware of it,

233
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,800
but if you are on ZFS version 0.77 on say like CentOS,

234
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,120
you should absolutely seriously consider downgrading to 7.6,

235
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,840
or if by the time you're listening to this,

236
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,120
7.8 is available upgrade.

237
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Gen2 is also affected.

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,760
Ubuntu and Debian users are not affected

239
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
because they are on older versions of ZFS.

240
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Ubuntu specifically is on version 0.75,

241
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,720
but it's a regression that's been introduced in ZFS 0.77

242
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,120
on some Linux systems.

243
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,880
It's sort of complicated,

244
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,600
but it's kind of a combination issue

245
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,680
as a lot of times these problems are.

246
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,320
It's a combination of a change

247
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,520
that was made in GNU core utils

248
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
in the way that CP works, yeah,

249
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,760
and a patch that was made to ZFS,

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,520
and the two things collided.

251
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,280
So I talked to Alan Jude last night,

252
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,840
and he says that, he went through this whole thing,

253
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,520
and he's been kind of been following this from day one.

254
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,400
The team's been working on this.

255
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
They're already working on the patch.

256
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
He says they found part of the problem

257
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
is based on a change to core utils,

258
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
but it doesn't go to,

259
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
and that's why some people can reproduce the problem,

260
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
some people couldn't.

261
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,600
So you had to have a certain version of ZFS,

262
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,560
and you had to have a certain version of core utils,

263
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
but in the version of core utils that CentOS is using,

264
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,280
there is a hard limit that was accidentally introduced

265
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,600
with a recent patch to ZFS.

266
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,560
They limited the attempts to expand the ZAP,

267
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,400
which is the, when I asked Alan,

268
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,160
what the hell, Alan, is a ZAP?

269
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
It's the ZFS Attributes Processor.

270
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,680
It's basically, yeah.

271
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Well, of course, Chris.

272
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, so the ZAP is a ZFS Attributes Processor

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,760
that's basically a key store value, yeah, okay?

274
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,200
And it's how directories are stored in ZFS,

275
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
and this bug that was introduced

276
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,600
limited the attempts to expand the ZAP to two,

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,280
which is not enough.

278
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,840
And so that means two attempts.

279
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,640
And so when you're copying thousands of files,

280
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,040
after a couple of attempts, it would just say,

281
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,160
oh, can't do it anymore,

282
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,960
and it would just start dropping the files, essentially.

283
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,880
And so the ZFS team, Richard Yao, is a part of this,

284
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
is working on the fixes.

285
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
We've dropped everything.

286
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
We have a dozen people around the world

287
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,040
who are working on this.

288
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,360
We have a fix.

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,800
We're kind of narrowing in on the exact circumstance,

290
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
because you had to have a certain version of core utils,

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,640
you had to have a certain version of ZFS on Linux,

292
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,320
and you had to be doing a certain kind of copy of new files.

293
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,680
This didn't impact existing files.

294
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,840
And some people had to test, like, does it matter

295
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,680
if I'm in a mirror?

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Does it matter if I'm in a RAID, you know, whatever?

297
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Like, all this different testing had to happen,

298
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,480
but you can watch, we'll have a link in the show notes,

299
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,920
you can watch them work through this

300
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,320
over the process of days as they narrow it down.

301
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,360
I asked Alan, like, what triggered this upstream change

302
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,120
in ZFS that accidentally triggered this zap limit?

303
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,280
And he says, well, they were actually just trying

304
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,160
to make some changes to how it all worked

305
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,880
on a case-insensitive file system.

306
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,520
Yeah, optimizing for a totally different case.

307
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, and then that's what caused all of this.

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,520
And it really shows you what a house of cards all of this is.

309
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,240
So the moral of the story is, if you're on Gentoo or CentOS

310
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,480
or Scientific Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,480
you need to either be on ZFS 7.6 or ZFS 7.8,

312
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,160
and you won't have this issue.

313
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
So that's my breakdown of it.

314
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Unfortunately, there's really no other coverage of this,

315
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,480
so I can't link you to, like, a Ferronix post

316
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
or anything like that.

317
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,840
This is it.

318
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
We had to do the original reporting on this for you,

319
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,200
but all of the information, including a better description

320
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,640
and quotes from Alan Jude, are in the show notes.

321
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,560
If this impacts you, if you're using this in production,

322
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,560
just go to linuxunplug.com slash 244 for that information.

323
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I mean, it says a lot that this is the first thing

324
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,400
of this scale we've seen for a long time

325
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
with our handy-dandy friends in ZFS.

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,320
The other thing that was really fascinating

327
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
is because all of this is on GitHub,

328
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,400
so all of the GitHub utilities are immediately put into play.

329
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Like, they're finding the exact commits,

330
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,520
like, they have the code highlighted,

331
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,600
they're linking everybody to it.

332
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,760
It is fascinating to watch.

333
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,600
Yeah, everybody's on the same page.

334
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,440
So you can say a lot of things about GitHub

335
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,440
and about open source projects being on a commercial platform.

336
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
Boy, was that useful, tracking this thing down.

337
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,720
You could really see how the team was just busting

338
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
through this at a breakneck pace, figuring it out.

339
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,640
And then to really see Richard Yao,

340
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,680
just to mention to Richard Yao,

341
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
who is really just tackling this thing.

342
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,800
He's just being a real leader in this situation,

343
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,720
and he's going to the Hacker News and Reddit comment threads

344
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
and he's answering sysadmin's questions

345
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,280
that are in there saying, so this is my scenario.

346
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,400
Do I need to worry about this?

347
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,280
And he's specifically addressing their exact questions

348
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
while he's working around the clock

349
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,520
to help the team get the patch together, so.

350
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,560
It's impressive.

351
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,000
It's unfortunate, and it shows you that even things like ZFS

352
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,720
are not, you know, infallible.

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
And of course, Alan had to get a dig in there

354
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,960
that it only affects Linux.

355
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,280
Of course.

356
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
You're welcome, Alan.

357
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,520
I made that into the show.

358
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,600
Anyway, so if you're running ZFS on Linux,

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
you need to know about that.

360
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
We wanted to let you know.

361
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,960
Just a little bit of heads up here on the Unplugged program.

362
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,200
And we got links to everything in the show notes

363
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,240
if you want to see the whole thing or where the exact,

364
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm showing it on the screen right now, that exact,

365
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,240
right there, right there, that's it.

366
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,160
Oh, don't do it, no.

367
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
I know, that's it.

368
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
Now everybody's been infected, Wes.

369
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh no!

370
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Oh wait, it doesn't work like that at all.

371
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
But you know what does work like that?

372
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,240
An idea, an idea like Ting.

373
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
That's right, linux.ting.com.

374
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,760
Go there and get $25 off a Ting device

375
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,120
or $25 in service credit.

376
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
That'll probably pay for more than your first month.

377
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,200
I brought over one of those old EVO 4Gs,

378
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,720
you know, the ones that had, what was it?

379
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
WiMAX.

380
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,240
WiMAX, yeah.

381
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,400
And I was like, I had no use for this thing.

382
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,920
So I brought that over to Ting and I'm like,

383
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,760
all right, well, you know what?

384
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,200
We'll give you $25 in service credit.

385
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm like, wait, what, really?

386
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,680
Like, yeah, just put it on that device

387
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,840
and see what you think for a month.

388
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,880
And you know, I'm like, a month?

389
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,720
All right.

390
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,760
At the end of the month, I hadn't even used all $25.

391
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
And I was like, oh, oh, I get it.

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,160
I get it now.

393
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,320
And you can too, linux.ting.com.

394
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,400
It's smarter than unlimited.

395
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,240
If you use less, you pay less.

396
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,480
$6 a month for your line.

397
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Then your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

398
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
Whatever you use, that's what you pay.

399
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
And they have a nationwide networks, GSM and CDMA,

400
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,920
no contracts, no other termination fees.

401
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,240
That's what I love about Ting.

402
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,040
And you're in control all of the time

403
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
from the control panel to the great customer service

404
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,480
or if you wanna use CDMA or GSM.

405
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,520
And because they support both networks,

406
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,160
you probably wanna check their BYOD page.

407
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
They probably support a device you already have

408
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
and then you can really save some money.

409
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,200
But if you don't wanna use an old device,

410
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,680
you wanna get something new,

411
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,160
they got a sale going right now on those motos,

412
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,560
those moto devices, like three or four different

413
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,960
moto devices that are really nice.

414
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
So go check those out,

415
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,960
cause those are great value and it's no contract

416
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,520
and you're just paying for what you use.

417
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
linux.ting.com.

418
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,720
You go there to support the show,

419
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,960
get the $25 in either service credit

420
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,880
or off a hardware device, which that's a great deal.

421
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
And then you're good to go.

422
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
You start going and you see, you know what?

423
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,600
This is a totally different way to do mobile.

424
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,440
You'll see it.

425
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,320
And it's like the veil has been lifted,

426
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
you're woke all of a sudden.

427
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,160
You're staying woke over at Ting.

428
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,840
They gotta take that.

429
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,080
They stay woke at Ting.

430
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,520
linux.ting.com.

431
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,680
A big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program

432
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,000
and go check it out because it's really,

433
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,320
it's a totally different way to do mobile.

434
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,680
It's a better way to do mobile

435
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,960
if they had to hit the reset button today.

436
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,880
That's how they do it.

437
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
linux.ting.com.

438
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,520
My millennials, stay woke.

439
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,280
So go check it out.

440
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,880
All right, so Mr. Daniel Foray, as he is one to do,

441
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,720
joins us here on the show, which we always love having him.

442
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,680
And this week he talks about something

443
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
that's near and dear to my heart,

444
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,280
because you've often, if you've listened to this show

445
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,560
or Linux Action News, you may have heard Joe say,

446
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,640
Chris, you ought to just use XFCE.

447
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,120
Oh, you having some plasma problems?

448
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,160
I feel bad for you, son.

449
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh, gnome's getting a little weird on you?

450
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,640
I feel bad for you, son.

451
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
You ought to just use XFCE.

452
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
And I'll sit here and go, Joe, I don't want to use the damn XFCE.

453
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
I'd rather go back to the 90s.

454
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,080
So this is a conversation that happens all the time.

455
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,640
And part of my reluctance to go to i3,

456
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,040
which is great, or XFCE, which is fantastic,

457
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,880
but my personal reluctance, it's just

458
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
this dumb thing of somebody I think

459
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,760
that's unique to somebody that's probably my age

460
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,920
or around my age, and that when I started using computers,

461
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,720
you could only run one application at a time.

462
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,080
My first computer got hooked up to a television.

463
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,680
I put cartridges in my first computer,

464
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,840
and it could do one thing at a time.

465
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,120
It was delightful when I could make the damn thing beep.

466
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,240
So I've just been through a lot of iterations of the shit pile

467
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,680
that we call modern technology.

468
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,920
And I've been through a lot of promises

469
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,120
about the next great thing that's

470
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,760
just around the corner that's going to finally make

471
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,720
the computer better and finally make it user friendly.

472
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,520
And I've been listening to that promise since I could read,

473
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
since I could take in information.

474
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,920
I am just at a point in my life where

475
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm done with computers being below a certain standard.

476
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,480
And it doesn't mean I'm a Mac user

477
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,160
or I'm some Windows 10 power user

478
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,680
writing PowerShell scripts.

479
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,480
It just simply means I've been through iterations

480
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,800
of this entire industry now.

481
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
And I've gotten to a point where I just

482
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,520
expect a certain standard of living on my desktop

483
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,800
environment.

484
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,000
And it's not that I couldn't make do and go camping in XFCE

485
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,960
and be totally fine with a weekend in I3.

486
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
It's simply if I'm going to build a home

487
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
and I'm going to live there, I got a certain standard.

488
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,560
Because it's where I live.

489
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,000
And it's just XFCE, I3, these other desktop environments

490
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,560
are simply unappealing to me in that regard.

491
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,520
It's nothing about the excellence of the projects,

492
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
the functionality that they serve for other individuals.

493
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
It has no statement on your use of them.

494
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,960
It's simply my esoteric preferences

495
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,280
as somebody who has gone through the life experiences

496
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
that I have.

497
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,180
So I am really at a point where if it's not

498
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,800
of a certain standard that's my own personal standard,

499
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm not interested.

500
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,000
And that's why I'm on Plasma right now.

501
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,760
That's why I stayed on GNOME 3 for a really long time.

502
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
And it's why I follow the elementary project

503
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
with keen interest.

504
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,660
And they really kind of hit my note this week

505
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,440
when they started talking about improving

506
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,640
the look of the applications and start

507
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,960
talking about building the next generation of applications

508
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
for their Linux desktop.

509
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
And this is something that they've been working on

510
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
for over seven years.

511
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,120
And they've introduced multiple generations.

512
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,760
And it's really something to see.

513
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
So I'm going to put a link in the show notes

514
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,300
to encourage you to go look at the screenshots.

515
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,040
Because visually, it's, again, one of these posts

516
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,460
where you could just really see the progress visually.

517
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,040
But there's so much more than just the visual aspects of it.

518
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,360
So Dan is joining us.

519
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,960
And I loved this post, Dan, because you start out

520
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,320
with Generation 1, which is really

521
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,920
the first version of an elementary OS,

522
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,900
like the best shot for a new team.

523
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,160
And they were pretty good.

524
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,040
I think maybe that's where some of the early criticism

525
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
about design copying came from.

526
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
But GTK2 was limited.

527
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,920
And you could only get so far.

528
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,040
But now in 2018, we're in a totally different place.

529
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,760
One of the things that I think is kind of central to the story

530
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
that I wanted to present in this post

531
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,160
is that when we first started out,

532
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,320
we didn't really know how to be a good code shop.

533
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,640
And we actually went to the Ubuntu Developer Summit.

534
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
And we wanted to pitch some of our apps

535
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,720
for being included in Ubuntu.

536
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,160
And one of the Unity developers kind of sat us down

537
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
and gave us a talk.

538
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,160
And he was like, hey, listen, you guys are bad at coding.

539
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,200
And he told us all the things we were doing wrong

540
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,920
and how to step up our game.

541
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,640
And we came back from that.

542
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,880
And we picked a standard language.

543
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,940
We created code style guides.

544
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,680
We started doing code reviews.

545
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
We started getting really serious

546
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,920
about the quality of the code that goes into our applications

547
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,440
and not just what goes on top as far as design.

548
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah, and boy, do I appreciate that as an end user.

549
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:19,160
That's why I did this whole setup is I think this is the solution

550
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,240
to the problem where I've seen these promises over and over

551
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,000
again.

552
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And then we do these hard resets,

553
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,120
or we have these big focus changes.

554
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,460
And what is clear now, especially

555
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,160
as we're getting close to the next release

556
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,880
of elementary OSes, you guys have really

557
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,720
been on a trajectory where I'd say it's refining focus over

558
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,680
and over again.

559
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,040
And you could definitely see it in Gen 2 of your applications.

560
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,960
They're solid looking.

561
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,880
They're GTK3 by Freya.

562
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,040
Is that true?

563
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,240
Yep.

564
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,940
So you give us some hints where things are going.

565
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,200
So where do we go in Gen 2 to Gen 3?

566
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,920
What kind of is the next thing that we

567
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,360
might see in future versions of elementary OS

568
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
that may not yet be released?

569
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,360
Where is this going?

570
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,080
So one of the big things that happened

571
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
is we came out with App Center.

572
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,400
And when we did that, a focus for us

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,120
was making sure we had a lot of automated tests in place

574
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
so that when developers submit their applications,

575
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
we could run them through these tests

576
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,480
and get their apps published very quickly.

577
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,000
And when we did that, we kind of set a set of standards

578
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,320
for them as far as naming.

579
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,440
We forced developers to use the reverse domain name notation

580
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,920
so that, for example, their binaries and the names of files

581
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,400
like.desktop files or AppStream data files

582
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,680
all follow this RDNN notation, where it's like com.github.username.

583
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,320
So what's the benefit there?

584
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,400
That sounds good, but what's the benefit?

585
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,540
So the point of this is to ensure

586
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,360
that we don't have any sort of naming conflicts,

587
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
not only when developers are publishing their applications

588
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
on elementary OS, but also when we're talking

589
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,360
about upstreams, repackaging.

590
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah, I bet.

591
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,840
And this is something that the GNOME team has embraced as well,

592
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,960
and it's pretty common on Android and other platforms

593
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
like that.

594
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,680
So we're going to a point where not only are we

595
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,580
enforcing this for all of our third-party applications,

596
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,560
but we want to practice what we tell other people to do.

597
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,520
And so all of our first-party applications

598
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,960
are going to be using RDNN from now on as well.

599
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,520
Can you expand on that a bit?

600
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
So you're working with GNOME, or it's kind of the same thing,

601
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,360
or what's that about?

602
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
I think it's more of just kind of a de facto standard

603
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,160
that everybody's moving towards as we realize

604
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,160
that we want to have this world eventually where we're shipping

605
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,440
not just like a few thousand applications,

606
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,160
but where we have millions of applications, right?

607
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,700
And in order to get to that world with the constraints

608
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,960
of file-based package managing, we

609
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,600
have to make sure that these files do not

610
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,200
conflict with each other.

611
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
Well, I'm glad you're thinking about it, that's for sure.

612
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,800
The hype train, it's successful, this one.

613
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,040
I mean, just think of it.

614
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,520
I got a machine that's destined for this.

615
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
I think that's the case.

616
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,880
Well, Dan, is there anything else we should mention?

617
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,480
Well, real quick, I do want to plug

618
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,800
that there's a bunch of other stuff

619
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
that we talk about that people can check out

620
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,080
in the article, which you said will be in the show notes.

621
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,320
But I want to make a point that our continuous integration

622
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,800
suite that we've developed for App Center,

623
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,160
we're now making it available as something

624
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,840
that you can run through Travis CI on your own projects.

625
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,760
So anybody can use this full testing suite

626
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,320
that elementary is working on, even if you're not planning

627
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
to publish in App Center.

628
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
Thank you for mentioning that.

629
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,440
That's great.

630
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,280
Yeah, no kidding.

631
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,040
That's totally worth it.

632
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,320
We were just talking about Travis CI.

633
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,840
That's so cool.

634
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,120
Yeah, all right, so that's good.

635
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,640
That's definitely great, so check that out.

636
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,840
The link, like you said, is in the show notes.

637
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,040
And now I want to just kind of, just

638
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,960
from a big picture perspective, how do you, as a project,

639
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,120
how do you feel like, yep, this stuff is ready to go.

640
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,240
You must have a lot of people besides yourself testing this,

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
maybe a small group, 10 people, 1,000 people.

642
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,960
How does the beta process work for elementary OS?

643
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,760
Yeah, so right now, we're kind of in a pre-release state

644
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,880
where we just have some builds that we're running internally.

645
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,760
And we just publish those on our Slack

646
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,600
channel, which has a little over 100 people in it,

647
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
I think, right now.

648
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,840
And so we've got a small group of just developers testing.

649
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,800
We have projects up on GitHub, which you can actually see.

650
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,080
It's a public project where we're tracking regressions

651
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,440
and things like that.

652
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,160
And so once we get through those tasks

653
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,880
and we feel like we've handled all the regressions we

654
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,480
know about, then we'll go to public beta.

655
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,000
And that'll be an open public beta anybody can download.

656
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,360
And then we'll figure out from there

657
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,880
how much we have left to do before we

658
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,480
can do final release.

659
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,800
I'm excited to hear that.

660
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,680
Well, neat.

661
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,880
Well, thank you for coming on and explaining this.

662
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,480
I like the fact that you guys.

663
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,120
So it's called FlightCheck.

664
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,760
Is that what it's called?

665
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
So that's the name of the component.

666
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,960
The full application is called Houston.

667
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
Houston.

668
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
Yeah.

669
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,320
Love it.

670
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,400
And so this part, we're calling it Houston CI.

671
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
OK.

672
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
That's great.

673
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,660
And you're making it available for anybody

674
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,540
if they want to integrate into their projects.

675
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,120
That's so cool.

676
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,800
And this is all regular open source standard stuff.

677
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Like this checks, validates metadata for.desktop files

678
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
and app data files.

679
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And it does a lot of good open source citizen stuff.

680
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
And we're looking to integrate tests

681
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,280
that other platforms use.

682
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,440
Like the Debian maintainers have a good set of tests

683
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,080
that they use for packages.

684
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
So we really want to make sure this is all

685
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,800
open source standard stuff.

686
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
That's fantastic.

687
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,400
Yeah.

688
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,440
And it's using computers for what they're good at,

689
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,560
which I'm always a fan of.

690
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,980
It's like, might as well if you can.

691
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
If you can have some of this stuff tested for you

692
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,440
statically, even if it doesn't replace actual testing,

693
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,680
it's just another data point.

694
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,320
And it's pretty valuable.

695
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,200
It's good to hear.

696
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,740
That's good to hear.

697
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,240
All right.

698
00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:00,480
Well, last week, we may have reported too soon.

699
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Steam machines were dead.

700
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,680
Although I'm actually not sure it's not the case,

701
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,420
in my personal opinion.

702
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,560
But Valve took to the web after last week's episode

703
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,240
and said, we've noticed that what started out

704
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,360
as a routine cleanup of our Steam store, where we removed

705
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,560
all links to Steam Machines, all references to Steam Machines

706
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,400
and SteamOS, and buried them, we noticed that some of you

707
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
interpreted that incorrectly.

708
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,240
I may have editorialized it a little bit.

709
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
Wrote a little bit, yeah.

710
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,240
I may have a little bit of editorializing.

711
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,320
But while it's true Steam Machines aren't exactly

712
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
flying off the shelves, Reed, we haven't sold any

713
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,120
for the last couple of months, our reasons

714
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
for striving towards a competitive and open gaming

715
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,920
platform haven't significantly changed, Reed.

716
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,600
We're working on fundamentals.

717
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,360
We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads down

718
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
on addressing the shortcomings we've observed.

719
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,480
Reed, Linux was a bit of a dumpster fire.

720
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,000
Nap.

721
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Taking a nap, for sure.

722
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,260
And we think an important part of that effort

723
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,080
is our ongoing investment in making Vulkan a competitive

724
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,820
and well-supported graphics API, as well as making sure

725
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,920
it has first class support on those platforms.

726
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,620
I think that's great.

727
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,880
I completely think that's great.

728
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,600
I think that is true.

729
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,460
And they say now, here's the part that got my attention.

730
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,160
Tell me what you think about this, Wes.

731
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,800
You ready for this one?

732
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,280
They go on about how we're continuing

733
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,560
to invest significant resources in Vulkan ecosystem and stuff.

734
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,480
But then they just throw this in as one sentence.

735
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
It's not even a complete sentence.

736
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,960
They say, we also have other Linux initiatives in the pipe

737
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,360
that we're not quite ready to talk about yet.

738
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,040
Fascinating.

739
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,960
What does that mean?

740
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,000
What now?

741
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,840
We have other Linux initiatives in the pipe.

742
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,960
Not the pipeline, the pipe.

743
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,040
The pipe, yep.

744
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,720
That we're not quite ready to talk about yet.

745
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
Maybe they're stuck in the pipe.

746
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,660
That's why they can't talk about them.

747
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,120
They need to get them out of the pipe.

748
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,240
I think it's VR on Linux.

749
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,320
That's what it seems like, right?

750
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,000
I mean, what else could it be?

751
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,380
Does anybody else in the Mamba room

752
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,800
have speculation on what might be in Valve's pipe?

753
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,960
What could be in Valve's pipe that's regarding Linux?

754
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,760
It's not SteamOS, it's not Vulkan,

755
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,080
it's not the Steam client, it's not the Steam controller.

756
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,840
Steam TV.

757
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
Maybe.

758
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,160
Steam Kodi?

759
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
I would so be down for that.

760
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,500
If SteamOS could be Kodi, basically,

761
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,560
with SteamOS, Steam integration, that

762
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,520
would be such a product for me.

763
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,160
Halfpipe 3.

764
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
All right, so nobody's got any ideas.

765
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,280
You guys are no good.

766
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,360
What a mystery.

767
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
It is a bit of a mystery.

768
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,480
What would Valve have in their pipe?

769
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
So let us know, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

770
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,760
and send us in your ideas for what might be in Valve's pipe.

771
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,100
I don't know.

772
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm thinking it's VR or AR.

773
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,240
And sort of as a related note, screw you 32-bit users.

774
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,020
NVIDIA is giving you the middle finger this time

775
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,800
and is ending support for 32-bit OSes.

776
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,880
It's not just Linux users, it's everybody.

777
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,960
So it's equal screwing.

778
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,160
The times, they aren't a-changin'.

779
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah, they're going to halt GeForce GPU driver

780
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,680
support at the end of April, meaning

781
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,640
users will lose access to new GeForce experience

782
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,840
features and game updates.

783
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
But more importantly, and you got a little more runway

784
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,800
on this one, NVIDIA will end security updates January 2019.

785
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,640
So you can continue to use your 32-bit OS with a GeForce card

786
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,240
at least until 2019 and get security updates.

787
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,400
And then really, in theory, you could keep running it

788
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
probably for a lot longer.

789
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,580
It's just there's going to be security things

790
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,560
that they won't fix, like, I don't know,

791
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,640
new versions of Spectre.

792
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm not sure what that would be, I guess.

793
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,520
I mean, what kind of security?

794
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,680
Actually, I take that back.

795
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,100
Now that I think about TechSnap, there's

796
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,160
been a few stories where NVIDIA drivers have been involved,

797
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,080
including even running cryptoware on the NVIDIA GPU.

798
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh, no.

799
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,120
Yeah, but Wes and I were just talking

800
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,280
about all kinds of speculative execution attacks

801
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,600
on the TechSnap program.

802
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,280
That'll be coming out later this week,

803
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,440
TechSnap.systems slash 363, I think it was, if you want to.

804
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,240
I think you're right.

805
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,760
Yeah.

806
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,920
And speculative execution, turns out,

807
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,240
is going to be a fun bag for lots of people.

808
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,040
And we talk about some of the new exploits in that episode.

809
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,860
So let's now talk about DigitalOcean,

810
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,320
our sponsor for this week's episode

811
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,720
of the Unplugged program.

812
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,680
DigitalOcean is what I use for a lot of our back

813
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
end infrastructure.

814
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,520
We're recording portions of the show using DigitalOcean.

815
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,780
We're streaming portions of the show using DigitalOcean.

816
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,880
In fact, the bot that manages our titles

817
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,080
is using DigitalOcean, Wes.

818
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,200
It sure is.

819
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Talk about jog foodin'.

820
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,320
Yeah, we really do.

821
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,520
And it's because it's great infrastructure.

822
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,880
You can deploy in seconds, and it's super fast.

823
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,880
You can develop locally and deploy globally.

824
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,600
DigitalOcean, go to do.co slash unplug to get a limited 60

825
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,400
days.

826
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,760
But yet, it's kind of great.

827
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
$100 credit.

828
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,480
I can't believe I even get to say that.

829
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,440
You have to go to that URL, do.co slash unplugged.

830
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,000
That arms your web browser with the knowledge

831
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,520
of the $100 deal.

832
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,160
Once you create a new account, you get the $100 deal.

833
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,040
I think you might have to have a legit credit card on file,

834
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,120
although I don't know if that's actually true.

835
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,840
But you do get the $100 credit if you

836
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,360
go to the do.co slash unplugged, and it's a new account.

837
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,460
You create the account, and then you can really play around.

838
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,200
Because really, my favorite system is $0.03 an hour.

839
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,400
And so when you think about $100,

840
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,720
I mean, you could really try out their new high CPU droplet.

841
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,240
You could be like Westpain and be spinning up VPN systems.

842
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
All the time.

843
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,040
What's the last?

844
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,120
Do you remember the last droplet you created?

845
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,200
It's got to be sometime earlier this week.

846
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,880
I know.

847
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,640
I know.

848
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
We'll be sitting here discussing an idea for the Tech Snapshow,

849
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
and we'll be like, well, let's go spin up a droplet

850
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
and try that real quick.

851
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,200
It's like, OK.

852
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
That's a great idea.

853
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,960
And that's what I love about it, because it's so fast.

854
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
They have a really easy to use web interface,

855
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,160
a super straightforward, well-documented API,

856
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,040
and then just tons of well-constructed documentation

857
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,760
on top of that to make it easy for beginners or experts

858
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,480
to go all the way with DigitalOcean.

859
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,760
You can deploy a single bare Linux rig

860
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,800
or an entire application stack.

861
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,280
They have tutorials.

862
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,880
They have a lot of community meetups, surprisingly.

863
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,380
That's a big thing I never actually

864
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,000
have mentioned about DigitalOcean,

865
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,360
is there is a large meetup community.

866
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,240
Seattle has some.

867
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,640
Wow, I had no idea.

868
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah, it's a big thing.

869
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,320
Fantastic.

870
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,120
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

871
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,840
There's all kinds of neat things about DigitalOcean.

872
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,120
We only get to touch on parts of them,

873
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,520
like the fact that they provide back-end infrastructure

874
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,920
for tons of the open source projects

875
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,640
that we talk about here on this very show.

876
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,960
And of course, the fact that they're

877
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,120
supporting, for a long time now, this crazy Linux

878
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,340
podcast that's barely structured that just talks

879
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,960
about frickin' Linux things.

880
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,760
I mean, that's just kind of great in itself.

881
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,160
Go to do.co slash unplugged to get the $100 credit,

882
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,680
and then play around.

883
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,180
Try out their flexible droplets where you can mix and match

884
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,680
resources.

885
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,560
It's pretty cool.

886
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,920
Do.co slash unplugged.

887
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,280
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

888
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,000
for sponsoring this here humble Linux program.

889
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,020
So prominent Ubuntu community developer, Mr. Simon Quigley,

890
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,440
has joined us in the Mumble Room to talk about his proposal

891
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,020
to dramatically change the release cycle of Ubuntu's

892
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,760
early builds, like the alphas and the betas.

893
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,900
So Mr. Simon, Mr. Prominent Ubuntu developer community,

894
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,720
thank you for joining us on the show today, sir.

895
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,760
Actually, very much thank you for making the time.

896
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
I do appreciate it.

897
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,100
But what is the Quigley proposal?

898
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,760
Because Feronix tells me it's going to fundamentally change

899
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,160
the way beta releases work for Ubuntu, and I'm intrigued.

900
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,840
So right now, the way that milestones

901
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,020
work in Ubuntu, we have two alpha releases,

902
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,880
and we have two beta releases.

903
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,320
So the alpha 1 and the alpha 2, the first alpha 1

904
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,080
comes a couple months after the release cycle opens up.

905
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,720
Then a month after that, typically, is alpha 2,

906
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,160
and then there's a beta 1, and then a final beta.

907
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,080
And then from there, we get release candidates

908
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,600
and that sort of thing, and actually go into the release.

909
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,000
So with this proposal, as of right now,

910
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,200
Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server,

911
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,360
they do not participate in the first two alphas

912
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,560
and the first betas.

913
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,160
So basically, they've been, for the past couple release cycles,

914
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,120
not longer, they've been opt-in milestones.

915
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,120
So the goal here is to just evaluate

916
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,840
to see if these are still necessary,

917
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,720
to see if these are still something that we need.

918
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,280
So looking at the past release cycle,

919
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,800
we didn't have alpha 1 and alpha 2

920
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,280
because of the Spectre meltdown stuff.

921
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,120
Beta 1, well, Ubuntu had some issues.

922
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,080
Other flavors had a release, but otherwise, I looked at this.

923
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,280
I looked at what happened during this release cycle,

924
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,200
and I sort of analyzed to see what

925
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,760
the benefit would be to taking these optional milestones away

926
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,320
because, like I said, it's been optional,

927
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,600
and flavors really drive these.

928
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,440
So Ubuntu, Ubuntu Chillin, Ubuntu Monte usually

929
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,320
comes in around beta 1, that sort of thing.

930
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,920
So the goal here would be to just get rid of these milestones

931
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,480
completely, and instead of having a release cycle where

932
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,400
we have set release times, we would

933
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,000
have a coordinated testing.

934
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Now, the advantages of this are with the milestone releases,

935
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,400
it's basically you could pick any day in a month,

936
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,360
and you could pick a daily out of that month's span

937
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,520
of dailies, the ISO, and you could label that beta 1,

938
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,840
and people would install that, but that's

939
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,080
an image that's frozen in time, and that's a blessed image.

940
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,520
But with the nature of Ubuntu release cycle,

941
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,320
things go fast enough that the next day, you

942
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,280
could have fixes.

943
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,800
So if you install beta 1 on a system,

944
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,080
you just update your system, and there's really

945
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,240
no advantage to having it frozen in time ISO.

946
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,040
So the main goal of this would be

947
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,120
to also make things a little bit faster

948
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
and make our automation a little bit better, because

949
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,400
at the moment, after I made this proposal,

950
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
someone followed up on the mailing list

951
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,640
and said that Ubuntu Desktop and Server,

952
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,120
while they don't participate in these initial milestones,

953
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
they do have some automated testing.

954
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,520
So they have some testing where it just

955
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,320
does some smoke tests that the flavors would usually

956
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
do manually.

957
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,600
So it's just overall just looking

958
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,880
at the different milestones that we do

959
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,600
and making sure that what we do and what we spend our time on

960
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,280
is useful.

961
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,480
So the goal of the testing weeks would also

962
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,440
be to coordinate everything together.

963
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,800
And while you're not releasing something,

964
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,880
it would also be an opportunity for flavors to announce changes

965
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,640
that they are making in the dailies

966
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
without actually having to release something.

967
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,800
Yeah, I like this idea of the test week or test weeks,

968
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,520
I suppose.

969
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,080
That's pretty clever, and I think

970
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,480
it's reminiscent of a hack fest in a way,

971
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,120
but it's protracted a little bit.

972
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,240
It's not quite as intense, and it sort of

973
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,600
elicits community participation and gives people

974
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,680
a time to focus.

975
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,580
And it's also, in its very nature, kind of a reminder,

976
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,080
hey, the next release is pretty close.

977
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,000
This is kind of your last chance to make sure

978
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
this thing's working right.

979
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
I like that idea, Simon.

980
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,120
And Michael Irobel liked it too, apparently,

981
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,640
because he wrote it up and tossed it up on Ferronics.

982
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,480
Seems like there's some decent reception so far.

983
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,160
Yeah.

984
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,680
Well, Simon, thank you for coming on and explaining it

985
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,880
in your own words, because I really like it.

986
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,600
When I hear your idea, and the other thing

987
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
I like what you're doing about it

988
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,000
is you're just kind of rethinking this process.

989
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,040
I think it's one of those things that is just sort of easy.

990
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,840
It's a decision that's been made,

991
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,000
and let's just move on and just get the job done.

992
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,160
And you're kind of revisiting something

993
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,520
that's been assumed for a long time and going, well,

994
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,480
why are we doing it this way?

995
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,640
What if we did it this way?

996
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,440
Right, and that was sort of the point of it,

997
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,760
just to sort of see if we can improve anything.

998
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,960
One other thing that I do want to mention is that,

999
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,420
I don't think I mentioned before,

1000
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,480
is that it's the goal, because these are optional milestones,

1001
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,600
the goal would be for, in my proposal,

1002
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,520
the goal would be for desktop and server

1003
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,720
and everybody to participate in these testing weeks.

1004
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,980
So you would see, we would improve our automated testing,

1005
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,700
but we would also have a wide variety of flavors

1006
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,440
participating, rather than just a few people who feel like they

1007
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,360
have something to release, like two or three people

1008
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,040
release one blessed image, and then that's just put out there.

1009
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,480
No, the goal would be for everybody to participate,

1010
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
so we could all collaborate and we could all

1011
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,120
work together on that.

1012
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,640
I like that idea too, especially when

1013
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,560
you've got these different flavors now that are beginning

1014
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,760
more and more prominent, and more and more larger user

1015
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,360
bases, so their feedback on some of this would be.

1016
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,280
Get some critical mass and get some bugs fixed.

1017
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,160
Exactly.

1018
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,920
I have a question for you, Wes.

1019
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,440
What is your process?

1020
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,280
I mean, theoretically, I'm not saying

1021
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,360
that Wes Payne, the actual individual, does this,

1022
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,920
but Wes Payne, the presenter, theorizing,

1023
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,120
in his personal opinion, what is your process for backing up

1024
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
movies to, say, a storage medium?

1025
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,320
Do you do this, and do you have a process?

1026
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,480
You know, I haven't done it for a long time.

1027
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,680
Back in the day, I'd certainly ripped some DVDs,

1028
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,040
archived them, if you would say.

1029
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,440
Do you now more rely on the public backup?

1030
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,720
Yeah, or streaming services.

1031
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah, that's what I primarily do too.

1032
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,520
But I have picked up a few.

1033
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,980
I'll tell you, there's a thing about the kids,

1034
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,640
is they don't have a high preference.

1035
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
Like right now, they're young enough

1036
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,680
where they just don't care.

1037
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,500
They just need something.

1038
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,340
Yeah.

1039
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,540
Kind of colorful and fun.

1040
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,600
Family members are passing down a lot of DVDs to us,

1041
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,680
and we're picking up some Blu-rays at Garage Sale.

1042
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,740
Ange is always good at picking up, like,

1043
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,720
she's part of these, have you heard

1044
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,960
of these Buy Nothing groups?

1045
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
No.

1046
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh, yeah, it's a big thing on Facebook,

1047
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,980
especially with the people that are really kind of thrifty.

1048
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,040
It's a real, it's a big thing in the rural towns

1049
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
that are short.

1050
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,700
They're saving some money.

1051
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,540
Yeah.

1052
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,380
People use some resources.

1053
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,720
Yeah, so instead of throwing something out

1054
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,440
that's still perfectly good, you put it up

1055
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,580
on a Facebook group and say, hey, I got this thing.

1056
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,520
And people, hey, I got this thing, all the time, right?

1057
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,360
All the time.

1058
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,240
So like a distributed Goodwill.

1059
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,480
Yeah, I wanna get rid of all my young kids stuff

1060
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,960
that we've had in the garage for the last 10 years.

1061
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,400
Would somebody like to just come grab this?

1062
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,520
It's distributed Goodwill.

1063
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,320
It's P2P Goodwill.

1064
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,080
And so you get DVDs, Blu-rays, you get all VHS,

1065
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,920
all kinds of crap.

1066
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,740
Sure, right?

1067
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,920
Like a bunch of, here's a bunch of kids movies.

1068
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,740
Have at it.

1069
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,360
And my kids love all of it.

1070
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,500
And you know, we just went on a spring break trip recently.

1071
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,920
I took the kids down to Seaside, Oregon, and Lady Joops.

1072
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
Loaded up Lady Joops.

1073
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,720
And I am ridiculously proud of this.

1074
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,600
And it's not even all of that elegant,

1075
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,260
but I am super proud of the fact

1076
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,720
that I can disconnect Lady Joops from shore power,

1077
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,480
is what they call it, which would be like utility

1078
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,520
from like the city, right?

1079
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,040
You power.

1080
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,320
And Lady Joops can go into battery mode.

1081
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,320
And this transition does not interrupt the TVs or the land.

1082
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,480
Ooh, that's lovely.

1083
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,440
The land, the TVs, and the Black Server.

1084
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,120
He just hot swappin' and boom.

1085
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
They all stay up.

1086
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,940
Not a blink.

1087
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,920
I can fire up our on-board generator, and it can kick in.

1088
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,840
And so technically, the entire, this is kind of a big deal.

1089
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,320
The whole house will switch from DC to AC.

1090
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,540
Wow.

1091
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,200
And the TVs, the Black Server, the land,

1092
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,560
the internet connection, all stay up.

1093
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,040
So I'm pretty proud of this.

1094
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,080
And it's just so awesome because we have these

1095
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,480
built-in screens in Lady Joops, these flat screens.

1096
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,200
And so when you're going down the road,

1097
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,780
the kids can like chill on the bed,

1098
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,360
like in the master bedroom, and they can like just,

1099
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,620
quote-unquote master bedroom, it's a queen-size bed.

1100
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,720
They can chill on the bed and watch TV

1101
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,560
and do whatever while we're going down the road.

1102
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,160
They're not distracting you while you're driving.

1103
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,320
Yeah, it's great, it's great.

1104
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,140
And so I wanted to get some of the stuff

1105
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,140
that we collected recently into my Plex server.

1106
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,000
Right, you already have a system.

1107
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You don't need to be hauling DVDs all around.

1108
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,740
Side note, funny enough, Plex took a total shit on me

1109
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,800
for an unrelated reason, because of an Android update,

1110
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,240
and so I ended up just using Kodi, but that's a side note.

1111
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,540
But I needed to encode a lot of this stuff.

1112
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,500
I use MakeMKV and other tools to sort of encode this stuff.

1113
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,880
But I needed a way to, or to get it onto my system,

1114
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,920
but I needed a way to encode it.

1115
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,400
And I'm a long-time Handbrake user, really like Handbrake,

1116
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
because really underneath the scenes it's using FFmpeg

1117
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,240
with just a bunch of same presets and stuff like that.

1118
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,960
And they're using like good codecs, like x264 and stuff.

1119
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,760
And so this week they've released Handbrake 1.1.0,

1120
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,560
which has a total UI overhaul, a redesigned main window

1121
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,800
with consistency that's just, I don't know,

1122
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,440
I just think it looks a lot better, I'll say.

1123
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,880
And I like the way they preview the video image.

1124
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,860
They've redone the way you select presets,

1125
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,200
no more old like kludgy drawer system.

1126
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,760
It's an updated user interface, updated icons,

1127
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,860
high DPI support.

1128
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,400
They've added newer presets for Vimeo and YouTube

1129
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,580
and in some TV playback boxes.

1130
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,660
But there's been some nice,

1131
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,680
actual specific Linux improvements too.

1132
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
They've added an option to configure

1133
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,740
a low disk space warning level, which this is nice

1134
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,080
because I've actually, with this version,

1135
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,400
we've moved over encoding the BSD Now program to Handbrake,

1136
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,880
and Angela's doing this on Handbrake.

1137
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,920
And so it's nice to have this,

1138
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,760
because she has like that.

1139
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,580
That's fantastic.

1140
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,760
Yeah, she has like a bin that she sends these to.

1141
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,180
And when that fills up, she needs to know.

1142
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,240
And so this gives her a warning now.

1143
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,000
That's just like the timing, it's a small thing,

1144
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,380
but the timing was just aces.

1145
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,040
They also added Intel QuickSync video encoding support.

1146
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,200
It's experimental.

1147
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,480
It requires a very specific version of the Intel driver.

1148
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,840
So I haven't tried this yet,

1149
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,720
but that could be great. That would be really nice, yeah.

1150
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,560
That could be really great.

1151
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
If it's meeting your quality, you know, nice and fast.

1152
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,280
Yeah, and also check about,

1153
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
check just that, just like being like,

1154
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
just talk about being, that's what I'm trying to say.

1155
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,080
Talk about being ahead of the curve here.

1156
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,280
Official support for 1804.

1157
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,700
Beautiful. Yeah.

1158
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,760
Oh, it looks like they just, as we're covering it,

1159
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,200
they just uploaded 110 to the PPA.

1160
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,160
I wasn't there right earlier in the show.

1161
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,000
Sweet.

1162
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Go get your hands on it right now.

1163
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,820
Check it out. Sweet.

1164
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,660
You know what, Wes?

1165
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,880
That's officially like some Linux unplugged

1166
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,080
breaking news right there.

1167
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,440
Like we just broke a little handbrake news

1168
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,600
on the unplugged program.

1169
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,640
This is CNN breaking news.

1170
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Unplugged.

1171
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,480
Breaking news.

1172
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,160
Yeah, come on. Unplugged breaking news.

1173
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,720
Yeah, and then there's been some updates

1174
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,440
for something called Windows.

1175
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,460
Not familiar with it, but we'll find out later.

1176
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,600
No, that's why I look outside.

1177
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,280
And Mac, which is something that McDonald's makes,

1178
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,740
but they have some improvements too,

1179
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,000
but they look like bullshit stuff

1180
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,920
that I wouldn't want to use anyways.

1181
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,880
Anyway, so handbrake, new release,

1182
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,640
link in the show notes, super great.

1183
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,360
And I use that, so once I got the,

1184
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,720
so this is Chris's quick,

1185
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,480
if I could just summarize my long story I gave you earlier.

1186
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,200
My quick tip is use the right tool for the job.

1187
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,840
So if it's a Blu-ray and a DVD, I recommend Make MKV.

1188
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,080
Bring those onto your hard drive.

1189
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,120
And then people have asked me a lot,

1190
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,960
should I just keep that MKV

1191
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,920
or should I re-encode it as an MP4 file

1192
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,880
or something like an MKV file with an H.265 for video?

1193
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,200
You know, having tested a lot of it,

1194
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,320
X.264 at a high quality bit rate,

1195
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,120
if you do two pass encoding,

1196
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I would challenge you to really see the difference

1197
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,720
between that and what you rip directly off the Blu-ray

1198
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,000
using Make MKV.

1199
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,680
And there is a substantial, substantial,

1200
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,680
substantial file size difference, substantial.

1201
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,960
I would tell you to focus more

1202
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
on what you're doing with the audio.

1203
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,600
Are you doing pass through audio?

1204
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,280
Are you re-encoding that audio?

1205
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,320
Are you accidentally mixing down multi-channel to stereo?

1206
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Pay attention to that, my friends.

1207
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,800
Because the number one question you guys are sending me is,

1208
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,760
should I encode it or not encode it?

1209
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,680
And you're not even asking me about the audio stuff.

1210
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,200
Having tested this back, you know, from doing like,

1211
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,320
I'm just taking the Blu-ray,

1212
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,400
which is like an AVC H.264 encoded file.

1213
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,800
Keep in mind.

1214
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,960
Having taken that Blu-ray

1215
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,280
and looked at just raw Blu-ray versions

1216
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,600
versus re-encoded using Handbrake,

1217
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,960
I really, I cannot tell the difference.

1218
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,320
And I am particularly picky about that kind of stuff.

1219
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,000
And I'm looking in like water scenes

1220
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,280
where there's a lot of motion and fire.

1221
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,600
I mean, I'm talking like, you know,

1222
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,440
really paying attention to specific scenes

1223
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,000
where the encoding should break down.

1224
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,480
And it looks good to me.

1225
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,640
So I really, I give a really, really hearty recommendation

1226
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,280
to Handbrake and the presets that they have been including

1227
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,760
because they've really tuned those presets

1228
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,520
with this new release and the stuff just looks so great.

1229
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,240
If you do the 1080p high quality, it will be double pass.

1230
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,480
It will be good audio.

1231
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,240
It's like, it's really what I think

1232
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,680
a professional video encoder would recommend.

1233
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah, my MB setup, it's not the beefiest.

1234
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,480
So if I can get it to a format

1235
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,960
that's like widely recognized already

1236
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,120
and then just direct play, that's all the better too.

1237
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,080
Exactly, that's another nice thing about this

1238
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,240
is it'll let you target certain types of devices.

1239
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,880
So if you knew you're gonna be playing it back

1240
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,800
on a Roku, for example, you could target that device,

1241
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,360
you could play it on MB, it'll do direct pass through,

1242
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,840
nothing's getting double encoded.

1243
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,360
It's the best quality possible.

1244
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,760
That stuff really does make a difference.

1245
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,360
So anyways, that's hopefully just answers

1246
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,760
a bunch of questions that come into the show

1247
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,920
and it's a really handy tool.

1248
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,000
And it's something that we're now using on a weekly basis

1249
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,400
for one of our Jupiter broadcasting programs too,

1250
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,280
the BSD Now show.

1251
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,800
Yeah, congrats on the new release.

1252
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,640
Yeah, great software.

1253
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,120
Yeah, and apparently a new new release, breaking news.

1254
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,360
All right, well, let's take a moment

1255
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,300
and talk about something new coming from Linux Academy.

1256
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,980
They have a huge batch of updates in the month of April.

1257
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1258
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,360
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

1259
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,560
and support the show.

1260
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,080
It's an advanced training tool

1261
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,160
that gives you all of the knowledge you need

1262
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,640
for Linux and the things built on top of Linux.

1263
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,720
A full featured training library.

1264
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,360
They have hands-on scenario based labs

1265
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,740
that they spin up on demand that you log in

1266
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,040
over SSH to a Linux box and you start working

1267
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,440
on the real applications and technologies.

1268
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,720
You write the real config files.

1269
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,240
You see the real results.

1270
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,200
They have self-paced in-depth video courses

1271
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,280
on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

1272
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,280
And now in the month of April,

1273
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,920
they are launching more than 70 new courses.

1274
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,700
They got to do challenges and learning activities.

1275
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,160
Wow. Wow.

1276
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,800
I mean, that's a lot of new stuff.

1277
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,840
Yeah, they're refreshing old content as well.

1278
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,280
They're looking at all kinds of,

1279
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,360
you think about Linux Academy,

1280
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,840
they're always looking at all kinds of ways

1281
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,320
to update the old stuff too.

1282
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,840
So I often talk about the new content they're adding,

1283
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,040
but I think just as valuable

1284
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,680
is they're going back and retouching.

1285
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,920
You always know you can go there.

1286
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,080
You'll find stuff that's up to date.

1287
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,920
That's nice.

1288
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,280
Some refreshes across the course

1289
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
where 50 new cloud assessment courses,

1290
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,680
hands-on learning activities, and new challenges,

1291
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,840
as well as they have a new real-time grading platform.

1292
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,920
So you can get feedback as you're working on the lab.

1293
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,640
You don't have to wait till the end.

1294
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,460
That's great.

1295
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,300
That's amazing, really.

1296
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,140
That's so cool.

1297
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,760
Fast feedback when you're learning easy resources.

1298
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,740
It's just...

1299
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,920
Yeah, and a seven-day free trial

1300
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,560
when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1301
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,440
They have study tools as well that you can download

1302
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,000
and listen to and use offline

1303
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,720
if you need to go offline for a little bit,

1304
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,240
and a community stack full of Jupiter Broadcasting members.

1305
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,040
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1306
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,760
That's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

1307
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,840
for that free seven-day trial,

1308
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,040
and to support this here podcast.

1309
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,760
So I want to talk about Plasma Vault.

1310
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,040
This is our official KDE corner, if you will.

1311
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,160
And Plasma Vault is an applet

1312
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,000
and a set of services and backend services

1313
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,440
that create encrypted vaults that are easily accessible

1314
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,000
from the Plasma desktop.

1315
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,440
Now, I do have a disclaimer that I have to make.

1316
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,180
Before this episode started, about 10 minutes,

1317
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,320
I updated to resolve another issue I was having on Plasma,

1318
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,300
and after I did that update, I lost access to my desktop,

1319
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,880
and I lost access to being able to add Plasma widgets.

1320
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,280
Alls I have is a black screen,

1321
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,440
and you can see my mouse cursor.

1322
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,880
Oh, that's all you need for a nice desktop.

1323
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,480
I can't right-click, I can't add widgets, so...

1324
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,600
So minimal.

1325
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,800
I was gonna tell you about this.

1326
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,760
This is a really cool application,

1327
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,600
but at this point, I actually would not be able

1328
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,300
to access the vaults I'm about to get to.

1329
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,520
So just so you guys are aware,

1330
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,960
there may be some issues that could...

1331
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,800
Why are you laughing?

1332
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,160
The hackers are dropping malware into your system.

1333
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,980
No, I don't think I was, I was not hacked.

1334
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,880
It was an update, it was an update,

1335
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,300
and it was my bad.

1336
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,360
And I've been told it's related to my Nvidia binary driver.

1337
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,080
No, say it ain't so.

1338
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,960
It appears to be so.

1339
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,000
The Plasma applet, though, called Plasma Vault

1340
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,840
is pretty cool.

1341
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,960
It doesn't really use anything that you couldn't bust out

1342
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,080
on the command line and solve yourself.

1343
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,000
It can do an overlay encryption file system

1344
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,640
or it can do a whole volume.

1345
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,680
And it's this UI that you add.

1346
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,100
It can be a little icon down in your dock,

1347
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,360
or it could be, or actually, I'm using a dock right now,

1348
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,660
but it could be your regular Plasma desktop.

1349
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,240
Or it could be a new widget on your desktop.

1350
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,560
So you click on the widget.

1351
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,520
You can say create new vault.

1352
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,320
When you do that, you give the vault the name.

1353
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,640
So like in this case, it might be, you know,

1354
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,400
like LUP secrets or something like that.

1355
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,240
Oh, so secret.

1356
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,520
And you can choose your encryption.

1357
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,920
I'm gonna do inc fs.

1358
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,760
You could actually, I'll do cry fs.

1359
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,880
Cry fs, which is kinda neat when you hit next

1360
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,840
in their wizard, it comes up with a security notice.

1361
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,640
It says cry fs, C-R-Y-F-S, encrypts your files

1362
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,680
so you can safely store them anywhere.

1363
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,600
It works well together with cloud services

1364
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,240
like Dropbox or iCloud or OneDrive and others.

1365
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,880
Unlike some other file system overlay solutions,

1366
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,200
it does not expose a directory structure

1367
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,580
or the number of files nor the size

1368
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,560
through the encrypted data format.

1369
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,960
But one important thing to note is that

1370
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,400
while cry fs is considered safe,

1371
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,440
there has been no independent security audit

1372
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,280
which confirms this.

1373
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,320
So they give you that disclaim.

1374
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,160
Well, yeah, that's nice.

1375
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,920
I think they know what you're getting yourself into.

1376
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,880
You know, you put your super secret secure password

1377
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,160
in there, so farts, and then you confirm that, farts.

1378
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,160
Then next, and oh, I guess next is not a farts.

1379
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,640
Type it in again because that's what I do, farts.

1380
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,600
Hit next, and then you tell it where you actually want it

1381
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,880
to store the volume.

1382
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,720
Nice.

1383
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,320
In this case, the encrypted data location

1384
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,160
will be slash home slash chris f slash dot local,

1385
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,360
so it's a hidden directory,

1386
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,360
slash share slash plasma dash vault slash secrets dot enc.

1387
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,540
So that'll be the actual path of my encrypted volume.

1388
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,760
It'll be at a hidden directory in the dot local folder,

1389
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,000
which is, and then it's pretty nested down.

1390
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,120
You know, it's all the way,

1391
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,400
it's down to a plasma vault folder.

1392
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
And it mounts now to slash home slash chris f slash vaults.

1393
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,840
So it's gonna make a vaults folder in my home directory,

1394
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,360
and then in there, it will make a folder

1395
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
called lup secrets.

1396
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,240
And anything I put in that folder called lup secrets

1397
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,800
will actually go in this encrypted volume.

1398
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,640
Sweet.

1399
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,100
Yep, so I do next, and I say go ahead and create,

1400
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,180
oh, this is something else that's kinda cool.

1401
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,300
But it'll allow you to limit the activities,

1402
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,060
which is a plasma desktop function

1403
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,920
that this vault is even available to.

1404
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,080
I don't wanna do that, so I'm not gonna choose that option,

1405
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,740
so I just choose create.

1406
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,240
When I say open in my file manager,

1407
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,280
it asks for the password, I put it in,

1408
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,140
and it opens the vault.

1409
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,160
It's now mounted as a regular folder.

1410
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,240
I can use it, I could leave it mounted my entire session.

1411
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,520
I'm impressed with this, you know, a few extra steps,

1412
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,400
and it feels a lot more integrated

1413
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,200
than some hacky encrypted folder

1414
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,600
that I have a bash script somewhere for.

1415
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,840
Yeah, and I also like and appreciate the fact

1416
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,920
that they're not inventing their own encryption.

1417
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,360
Yeah, right, it's not all hand-rolled,

1418
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,720
it's using just reliable primitives,

1419
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,280
sticking it together in a reasonable way

1420
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,520
with a lot of disclaimers.

1421
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,840
Yes, I do appreciate that.

1422
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,640
That seems perfect, yeah.

1423
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,120
So plasma vaults is nice.

1424
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,600
You know, you could use incfs, you can use cryfs,

1425
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,400
but here's the other great thing about it.

1426
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,880
This is coming from Ivan's blog here.

1427
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,240
He's talking about adding a new functionality

1428
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,700
to plasma vaults that I think is great,

1429
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,300
and it's really in light of Meltdown Inspector.

1430
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,520
He says, we've recently seen that even CPUs

1431
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,360
can sometimes be used as attack vectors.

1432
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,620
It's common for the web browser to be,

1433
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,640
and obviously through social engineering,

1434
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,480
for a user to also be used

1435
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,640
to gain remote access to the system.

1436
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,920
For this reason, starting with the next plasma release,

1437
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,400
if you have extremely sensitive data,

1438
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,400
you can mark a vault as offline only.

1439
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,760
This means that networking will be shut down

1440
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,880
as soon as you open the offline only vault.

1441
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,360
Any potential remote access is inhibited.

1442
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,700
Nice, I mean, you know, not complete,

1443
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,300
but hey, one more step, that's real handy.

1444
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,140
I like that a lot.

1445
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,440
I mean, if you're using Network Manager

1446
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,120
to manage your network connections anyways,

1447
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,560
and this can interface with that

1448
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,040
and shut down your network connection,

1449
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,860
so you're essentially air-gapped for a limited time,

1450
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,320
you're right, it doesn't prevent things

1451
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,520
that have been loaded on your system

1452
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,240
while you've been connected to the network.

1453
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,760
It's more of an immediate solution,

1454
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,520
but it's a one more peace of mind solution.

1455
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,040
And I like that integration,

1456
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,400
and that's where the Plasma Desktop often comes in,

1457
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,300
is that total suite integration,

1458
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,000
where your vault mounting mechanism can actually stop

1459
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,040
the networking, and it's not through some sort of hack,

1460
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,960
but through some sort of elegant communication system.

1461
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,460
It feels like a cohesive designed desktop.

1462
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,640
Yeah, so anyways, that's what's coming down

1463
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,120
the pipe for vaults.

1464
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,440
I wanted to also mention this week, LatteDoc,

1465
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,640
which I have started using on one of my plasma systems.

1466
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,880
I had this other bug recently with the Plasma Desktop

1467
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,840
where my panel stopped updating.

1468
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,480
Is that, do you think a fair description, Wes?

1469
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,720
Yeah, definitely. You've seen it.

1470
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,200
And it's just, it like freezes in time.

1471
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,800
The individual like applets, like Dropbox,

1472
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,720
and TeamViewer, and whatnot still work.

1473
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,340
And I think even the Bitcoin price thing still worked.

1474
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,800
But the clock would stop,

1475
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,840
like the seconds wouldn't tick anymore.

1476
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,240
And more importantly, the task bar would just be frozen

1477
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,760
at whatever I was at when it locked up.

1478
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,680
So if I had say, console, and Kate, and Firefox open,

1479
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,960
they would always show as open regardless.

1480
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,440
And say that I opened Chrome,

1481
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,640
and that was the only app I had open,

1482
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,200
it would never be in the task manager.

1483
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,940
It was kind of a little challenging when I was live on air

1484
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,800
and trying to switch between applications.

1485
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,200
And so I heard that an update would come down the road

1486
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,280
and let me fix it.

1487
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,000
But I thought in the meantime, until that update arrives,

1488
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,080
maybe I'll try LatteDoc.

1489
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,520
I gotta say, I'm not Mr. Doc.

1490
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,340
I don't really appreciate docs.

1491
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,200
I think they're usually just trying to be a Mac ripoff.

1492
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,440
And I tend to askew from them.

1493
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,540
This, however, did it right.

1494
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,840
Because one of the default layouts is called Plasma.

1495
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,800
And it's essentially a Plasma bar,

1496
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,160
but implemented as a doc, and it's done well.

1497
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,660
And it has a lot of functionality

1498
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,080
that I do appreciate from docs,

1499
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,100
like intelligent hiding, being able to change it,

1500
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,980
being connected to the left side of my screen,

1501
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,600
or the right side of my screen, or the bottom of my screen.

1502
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,920
You know, just the one icon for applications

1503
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,240
that are running, or for the launcher.

1504
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
I don't need to have an icon for the launcher

1505
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,080
and the running task, you know, those kinds of things.

1506
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,180
It does what I like in a doc,

1507
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,680
while not feeling like it's ripping off the Mac.

1508
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,520
And it's native Plasma stuff here.

1509
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,360
Yeah, it looks clean, well integrated.

1510
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,840
It's using Plasma technology.

1511
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,640
Yeah, it's very well integrated.

1512
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,540
Smooth.

1513
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,380
It is.

1514
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,520
And I think I'm gonna put it

1515
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,440
on all of my Plasma desktops slowly.

1516
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,260
It's pretty much available, and in all of the repos too.

1517
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,000
This is not a new application.

1518
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,240
Producer Michael's come on the show

1519
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,300
and told us about this before.

1520
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,680
But it's all based on Plasma framework,

1521
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,880
so it provides an elegant and intuitive experience,

1522
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,680
and I completely agree with their description there.

1523
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
And you can add regular Plasmoids to it.

1524
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,640
It animates or doesn't animate, depending on what you want.

1525
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,380
It's got a really easy to understand configuration,

1526
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,880
and you can, I don't know, it's just nice.

1527
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,500
And after having some troubles with the standard Plasma panel,

1528
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,000
I thought it may be worth mentioning.

1529
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,840
This has been my favorite part of your Plasma journey.

1530
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,160
You're finding all the apps I didn't even know I needed

1531
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,600
and hadn't found in the KDE world, and now I know.

1532
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,740
So, thank you.

1533
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,500
And then one more before we just get out of here.

1534
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,440
I see though that Mr. Noah Chalaya has joined us.

1535
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,760
I may ask him about his Plasma experience here in a moment,

1536
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,000
but one more little plug skis before we get out of here.

1537
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,940
You might remember, I think it was like Quapzilla.

1538
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,320
Was that the name of it, Quapzilla?

1539
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,280
Oh, that sounds familiar.

1540
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,800
An old, cute web browser.

1541
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,720
Well, it was renamed back in 2017 to Falcon.

1542
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,520
Falcon.

1543
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,040
There you go, Falcon.

1544
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,480
And it's flying like an eagle now.

1545
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,720
It's a cross-platform, cute web browser,

1546
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,320
and it's now called Falcon.

1547
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,820
And it's my experimental, I want something that's not Firefox.

1548
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,200
Like, I want to be logged into a different Google account.

1549
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,640
I just want it on a different process or whatever.

1550
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,480
I want to be able to just Alt-Tab really easy

1551
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,520
to a different set of sessions.

1552
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,180
That's where I'm trying it out right now.

1553
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,760
And I've been looking for things that are

1554
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,280
Qt-based for the Plasma desktop.

1555
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,480
So if you have any Falcon tips, linuxunplug.com slash

1556
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,320
contact, let me know.

1557
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,800
But Mr. Noah Chalaya, are you there?

1558
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,560
Are you live, sir?

1559
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,960
And are you still on the Plasma desktop?

1560
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,840
I am, I am, and I am.

1561
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,980
Have you tried it out on any NVIDIA systems recently?

1562
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,720
I have, actually.

1563
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,960
Our brand new XPS Edit Bay.

1564
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,120
No.

1565
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,960
Yeah, it's running Plasma.

1566
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,460
Really?

1567
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,760
Do you want to tell people about that?

1568
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,320
Do you want to have you talk about that?

1569
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,360
Spill the beans.

1570
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,440
Yeah, we can spill it.

1571
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,320
Honestly, the only reason I didn't spill it earlier

1572
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,840
was I didn't know, you know, it's your popsicle stand.

1573
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,480
I didn't know how you wanted to tell the popsicles.

1574
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,360
That's a little LinuxFest Northwest tease,

1575
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,560
because behind this, this actually maybe gives people

1576
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,880
a better idea of what we go through behind the scenes

1577
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,560
to prepare for LinuxFest Northwest.

1578
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,840
You should tell people about this new machine.

1579
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,920
Well, yeah, so I think there's probably

1580
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,460
a public perception that all I do

1581
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,480
is complain about wireless on 16.04.

1582
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,520
That's not the truth.

1583
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,040
The truth is I actually do a lot of things.

1584
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,920
I actually fight for the Linux desktop a lot.

1585
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,840
And so one of the things that had came up

1586
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,360
was we were talking about what we're

1587
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,240
going to do for LinuxFest.

1588
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,420
And I was like, listen, we can do a lot of different things

1589
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,840
for LinuxFest, as long as we're all doing them on Linux.

1590
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,760
I said, well, here's the thing.

1591
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,180
We've had some issues, some production issues in the past.

1592
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,000
So how can we make sure that we have an absolute rock

1593
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,560
solid machine that's going to work perfectly

1594
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,640
the entire time, as if it was a broadcast grade device

1595
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,060
that you would buy from a company?

1596
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,080
So that's not a problem.

1597
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,560
What we have to do is we have to buy a brand new,

1598
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,760
top of the line Dell XPS performance

1599
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,400
system with the eight core i7 in it and dedicated graphics

1600
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,200
and a dedicated capture device.

1601
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,800
That's PCI.

1602
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,600
So it's on the bus.

1603
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,480
We have four individual 1080p, 60 frame per second capture

1604
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,860
device that's inside of this box.

1605
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,440
We built it.

1606
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,600
And I actually really like that system

1607
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,480
because a week before, I had started editing the AS NOAH

1608
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,060
show and actually purchased another one of these systems

1609
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,360
to do all of the editing on it.

1610
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,400
And so it's the Dell XPS desktop, not the laptop.

1611
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,160
It's a desktop version, but it's just

1612
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,880
a powerhouse of a machine.

1613
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,280
And that currently is loaded with KDE neon

1614
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,640
and of course has the dedicated Nvidia graphics card in it.

1615
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,880
So I am fascinated by the amount of hardware

1616
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,680
that is going into this year's Linux Fest Northwest.

1617
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,600
But I think it's also interesting that we're

1618
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,480
doing a full plasma deployment.

1619
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,400
It's one of these things, NOAH, where

1620
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,680
by the time Linux Fest lands, 1804 will have been released.

1621
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,240
You know what I mean?

1622
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,880
We have to do all of this pre 1804.

1623
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,880
The other thing is, and maybe this

1624
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,480
is a bad way to go about this, but my plan up until this point

1625
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,480
and continues to be really, I'm just hanging out on KDE neon

1626
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,680
until it burns me.

1627
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,320
And then once I get burned or when something happens,

1628
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,600
then maybe I'll re-evaluate that.

1629
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,920
But I was thinking about this.

1630
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,920
When 1804 comes out, as a responsible person in the media,

1631
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,200
I feel like it's our job to evaluate the stuff.

1632
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,720
Try it.

1633
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,800
All the flavors, really.

1634
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,480
I want to try as many as I can.

1635
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,400
But at the same time, I still have

1636
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,480
to be able to get work done.

1637
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,260
And neon has been so rock solid good to me.

1638
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,760
I've had zero, not a couple of things that I could work,

1639
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,960
zero problems whatsoever with it,

1640
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,400
that it's just going to be very difficult for me

1641
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,640
to wipe it off my computer.

1642
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,880
Maybe I can partition it out and live in the LTS

1643
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,200
for a little bit just to play with it and stuff.

1644
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,280
But at this point, my plan was to just blow it completely away

1645
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,400
and go back to 1804.

1646
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,440
No, I'm having a really hard time,

1647
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,480
if I'm being honest with myself and you,

1648
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,040
I'm having a hard time convincing myself to do that.

1649
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,640
We've never really had an experiment go like this before.

1650
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,920
I mean, not like this deep, right?

1651
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,200
I mean, we're like, hey, let's try this.

1652
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,800
And then it just changes the way we work now.

1653
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,200
I was just saying on the pre-show,

1654
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,400
I've had two out of six systems start

1655
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,140
to develop issues, which isn't a bad batting average.

1656
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,840
But it's enough where I'm at yellow alert right now,

1657
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,760
and I'm like, oh, what am I going to do?

1658
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,320
But other than that, it's not too bad.

1659
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,520
And those both are my two Nvidia rigs.

1660
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,760
So it's kind of interesting, those are the new systems

1661
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,560
having problems.

1662
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,320
That's why I was asking you if you tried it on Nvidia.

1663
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah, and to be fair, both of those systems, one,

1664
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,440
so one of those doesn't have, the Linux first rig

1665
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,160
actually just got here yesterday, the day before.

1666
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,920
And so it's sitting apart because we're

1667
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,040
putting hardware in it.

1668
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,280
The editing machine, it's been running two,

1669
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,280
whatever it has been, two, three weeks with Nvidia.

1670
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,240
However, I've only used that machine an hour or two a week.

1671
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,840
If I reboot or even just log out and log back in,

1672
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,560
the problem tends to go away, the locked panel problem.

1673
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,680
This time, I've lost my desktop and all of my widgets

1674
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,120
and the ability to add new widgets.

1675
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,040
But that tends to actually get resolved too.

1676
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,520
So let's change gears.

1677
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,440
Do you want to mention what you're doing in LA

1678
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,920
and why you're going to LA soon, or do you

1679
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,960
want to just keep that a behind the scenes thing?

1680
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,200
No, sure.

1681
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,040
No, I think it's cool.

1682
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,700
So one of the things that we had talked

1683
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,160
about for Linux Fest Northwest is when you guys come out

1684
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,200
to the conference, we want to change the dynamic that exists.

1685
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,840
Because a lot of times, we'll be in, quote unquote, show mode.

1686
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,720
And then people are either afraid to approach the booth

1687
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,080
or they approach the booth at the wrong time.

1688
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,640
We're trying to set something up.

1689
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,480
And it creates an unfriendly dynamic.

1690
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,640
And so we want to change that.

1691
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,240
And so what we're looking at doing

1692
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,800
is we're trying to create a cool exhibit.

1693
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,320
So it's not just the place that we're

1694
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,400
setting up and broadcasting.

1695
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,000
There's going to be cool things for you to look at,

1696
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,680
cool things for you to see, cool things for you to play with.

1697
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,440
And basically, we're going through,

1698
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,120
and we're like, how can we get the best of everything

1699
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,440
and make it something kind of cool to see?

1700
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,040
And one of the things that we wanted to do from the audio side

1701
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,960
is have all digital audio so that there is no buzz,

1702
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,800
there is no hum, there's nothing like that.

1703
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,600
It's all digital.

1704
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,360
So I started looking for a board that we could use

1705
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,040
that was all digital.

1706
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,120
Which is not cheap.

1707
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,840
Once you say those words, you're in a certain price category

1708
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,400
right there.

1709
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
Yeah, boy.

1710
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,160
Yeah, usually you're in a couple grand each.

1711
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,600
And if anybody is in the broadcast industry

1712
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,520
or in the voiceover industry, you guys

1713
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,760
may know the name Joe Cipriano.

1714
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,640
And Joe grew up on the air.

1715
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,480
He grew up, and he wrote a book about how

1716
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,880
from the time he was 12 years old,

1717
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,280
he was in a radio station doing on-air stuff

1718
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,560
and eventually turned it into a voiceover career.

1719
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,880
And he's one of the most, next to Don LaFontaine,

1720
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,360
probably one of the most successful voiceover actors

1721
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:54,840
out there.

1722
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,880
If you've listened to Fox News, or I'm sorry, Fox, The Simpsons

1723
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,320
or anything like that, he does all of the promos for CBS

1724
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,720
and Fox and stuff like that.

1725
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,960
And heard about what we were doing,

1726
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,440
heard about the budget constraint

1727
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,120
that I'm working under and stuff like that.

1728
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,320
And I just reached out to him.

1729
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,320
I said, I know you have this board.

1730
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,840
I know that you're looking to transition out of it.

1731
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,960
He's upgrading a system.

1732
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,040
And I said, could we work out a decent price?

1733
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,160
And I don't know if I want to go into the pricing,

1734
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,400
but he gave me an insane deal, so insane

1735
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,400
that I am flying out to LA at the end of this week

1736
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,320
to go pick the board up from his studio.

1737
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,600
And then I'm going to go straight from his studio,

1738
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,400
next flight the very next day, to Seattle.

1739
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,560
I'm going to bring it there.

1740
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,920
And then we have a week to set it up and try it and play

1741
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,280
with it and make sure everything's going to work.

1742
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,040
But we're going to be using Joe Cipriano's board.

1743
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,880
My thing was simple.

1744
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,200
If it's good enough for CBS, it's

1745
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,400
probably good enough for us.

1746
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,960
I hope so.

1747
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,040
Yeah, otherwise we're doing something wrong.

1748
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,520
If the Tiffany Network says it's good,

1749
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,320
then we should be able to do a live stream.

1750
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,840
I didn't really work on open source.

1751
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,360
Yeah.

1752
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:59,520
The whole thing, so it's a real process to do this.

1753
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:04,080
But it is, if you have a small budget

1754
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,560
or you have a large budget, I think

1755
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,840
this is what my takeaway is.

1756
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,560
And it's not really this show's legacy,

1757
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,760
but a big legacy of last was us struggling with,

1758
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,880
can we do our passion on Linux?

1759
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,480
And our passion was live production of shows.

1760
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,520
And now the question more is, what range

1761
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,040
do we want to do this at?

1762
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,600
What grade?

1763
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,760
If we wanted to spend $700, we could do this.

1764
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,640
And if we want to go full Noah, we

1765
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,000
could spend money that we probably

1766
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,240
shouldn't mention on this and do this.

1767
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,280
There's a range available to us now, Noah.

1768
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,840
You know what I mean?

1769
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,720
Really, the best two examples of that,

1770
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,480
or go-to examples of that I can think of

1771
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,320
are going to be this year at Linux Fest Northwest.

1772
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,840
I think is safe to say probably the most elaborate setup

1773
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,120
that we've ever done.

1774
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,080
In fact, I would go as far as to say this.

1775
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,160
I'll put my name on it and say that I challenge you

1776
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,480
to find another conference.

1777
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,800
Not just a Linux conference, but any conference

1778
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,320
that isn't exhibiting media stuff specifically.

1779
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,200
So NAB would be out, stuff like that.

1780
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,520
But anything that's a conference that's

1781
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,280
outside of the media industry that

1782
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,080
is going to have as elaborate of a setup

1783
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,920
as we're going to have.

1784
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,240
So we've got that this year.

1785
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,880
But then you compare that to what we did at System76

1786
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,160
a couple of years ago, where we literally didn't show up

1787
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,240
with a single piece of equipment.

1788
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,000
I mean, we showed up, and we just hodgepodged it together.

1789
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,440
People were bringing in parts from their house and stuff

1790
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,160
like that, and we made a production system out of it.

1791
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,800
And that just shows the flexibility,

1792
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,800
the scalability of Linux.

1793
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,640
The fact that I can just take a box,

1794
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
get all the software and necessary stuff up,

1795
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,800
open the Google Docs, put all the stream keys in,

1796
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
boom, we're on the air.

1797
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,160
Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty cool.

1798
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,600
I can't wait to start playing with this stuff.

1799
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,960
And if you follow the timeline there,

1800
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,400
no one's going to be out here damn near way

1801
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,560
before Linux Fest Northwest, because we're

1802
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,960
going to be testing this stuff.

1803
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,080
We're going to be working with this stuff.

1804
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,240
It's our passion, and it's so cool

1805
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,280
to be able to do this under Linux now.

1806
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,920
And to be able to go to a Linux event now for years.

1807
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,200
This isn't our first year.

1808
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,560
This is not our first rodeo anymore.

1809
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,040
We've been doing these events, covering them

1810
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:18,120
from beginning to end, full spectrum, using Linux.

1811
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,240
And now this is the most professional implementation.

1812
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,280
We're not going to be throwing together systems

1813
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:23,840
until the last minute.

1814
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,920
Finally getting good at it.

1815
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,120
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

1816
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,800
It's fun to be at this position, so I'm really excited.

1817
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,720
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1818
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,080
It's pretty cool and crazy, Noah,

1819
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,800
flying all over the place to do it.

1820
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,080
I don't even know what that guy's up to.

1821
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,520
That's just nuts.

1822
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,760
I actually think our setup at the Linux Fest Northwest booth

1823
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,320
might make me just want to do shows from there from now on.

1824
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,520
We'll just do it there all the time.

1825
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,920
That's it.

1826
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,720
I'm done.

1827
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,240
I don't need any of that.

1828
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,120
I'm sick of it.

1829
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,240
We'll just do all our shows from there from now on.

1830
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,400
Anyways, links to everything we talked about today,

1831
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,200
linuxunplugged.com slash, what is this, 2.44?

1832
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,320
Yep, 2.44.

1833
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:02,320
And if you come over on Tuesdays to the jblive.tv stream,

1834
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,600
you can catch this show.

1835
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,960
We start at 2 PM Pacific.

1836
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,960
Actually, really, the live show usually kicks off around 1.30

1837
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,880
Pacific.

1838
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,160
All of that is converted to your local time

1839
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,840
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1840
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,240
You come for the Unplugged program.

1841
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,200
You hang out with us.

1842
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,160
We have some pre-show.

1843
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,040
We have the main show.

1844
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,200
We have the post show.

1845
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,240
And then just a little bit after that,

1846
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,160
it's that crazy Ask Noah program.

1847
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,720
And he's taking your live calls.

1848
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,440
He's answering your questions.

1849
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,240
And he's talking about all that kind of stuff.

1850
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,320
Hang out with Noah.

1851
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,440
It's a Linux sandwich.

1852
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,040
I really think you'd probably like it.

1853
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,480
And plus, you've got the chat room going.

1854
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,040
There's the mumble room you can participate in.

1855
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,560
You can join our virtual lug.

1856
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,000
You see, any simple model of human nature

1857
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,400
is going to be wrong.

1858
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,360
And you can debate things like human nature, I guess,

1859
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,200
if you like.

1860
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,520
Anyways, all of that is happening at jblive.tv

1861
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,560
every single Tuesday.

1862
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,960
And we'd love to have you there.

1863
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,880
You can get links to everything we talked about

1864
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,960
at linuxunplugged.com slash 244.

1865
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,920
Email us at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1866
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,760
And that's all of the meat and potatoes.

1867
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,920
So much meat and potatoes.

1868
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,400
Meat and potatoes are everything we need to cover.

1869
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,160
But I think that'll pretty much bring us

1870
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,960
to an end for at least our portion

1871
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,620
the Ask Noah program will take over soon.

1872
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:09,160
But in the meantime, go check out the TechSnap program.

1873
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,880
TechSnap.systems, where Wes and I are breaking down stories

1874
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,800
that are really kind of focused on the whole IT

1875
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,940
and sysadmin market.

1876
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,560
So it's like, if you've got to live in that world,

1877
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,200
you need to know what's coming up.

1878
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,340
If you have systems you have to manage,

1879
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,840
or if you have systems you have to manage

1880
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,280
and that's not your primary day job,

1881
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,920
TechSnap program can be very valuable.

1882
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,720
TechSnap.systems, go get a little more.

1883
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,540
Me and Wes.

1884
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,380
Go join us.

1885
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,480
Or at Wes Payne for his Twitter.

1886
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,300
Do it.

1887
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,140
I'm at Chris Elias.

1888
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,320
The network is at Jupiter signal.

1889
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,040
We also have the subreddit, linuxunplugged.reddit.com

1890
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,520
and linuxunplugged.com.

1891
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,640
Thanks so much for being here.

1892
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,960
See you right back here.

1893
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,800
Next Tuesday!

1894
01:10:44,800 --> 01:11:13,800
Missing Artists.

1895
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:23,560
The Unplugged program, wrapping up 2.44.

1896
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,560
Feel it.

1897
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,560
Feeling good.

1898
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,560
That was a long one.

1899
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,560
That went a little bit longer than I expected.

1900
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,560
Out of control.

1901
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,560
It's really your fault, Wes.

1902
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,560
You just don't ever shut up.

1903
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,560
I know.

1904
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
I was egging you on all day.

1905
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
And Dan.

1906
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,760
Dan comes in here, you know, running his mouth.

1907
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,400
And hey, Citizen, I don't think he ever shut his mouth either.

1908
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
You guys.

1909
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Unbelievable.

1910
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Gotta get hyped.

1911
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,400
Linux hype.

1912
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,400
2018.

1913
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,400
Linux hype.

1914
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,400
So let's see here.

1915
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,400
Let's get some titles.

1916
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,400
We got titles thing.

1917
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
Noah, what's coming up on the Ask Noah program, bro-ham?

1918
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
Let's go.

1919
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,400
Holy cow.

1920
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:59,120
We are asking so many crazy flame click baity questions like, is Apple destroying the computer?

1921
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,680
We got a really cool guest that is starting a business, and so we're going to talk with

1922
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,320
him about what's coming up in his business and the challenges that you face when you

1923
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,720
start a small business and how you can do that on Linux.

1924
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,720
That's lovely.

1925
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,920
Hey, did you officially change the intro tagline?

1926
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
I did.

1927
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,920
Yeah.

1928
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,920
Well, yeah.

1929
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,920
Do you mind giving me a read again?

1930
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,920
Because I know it's new, but I forgot what it was.

1931
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,440
I mean, I know the music's not going.

1932
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,440
I know.

1933
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,440
It's a big ask, but.

1934
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,440
Hold on a second.

1935
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,440
You know what?

1936
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,120
It was like way simpler and less confusing.

1937
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,400
You know what's great about this new system here?

1938
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,400
What?

1939
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
I have this touch screen.

1940
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
As long as I turn it on, there we go.

1941
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,400
Yeah.

1942
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
Sure.

1943
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
Look at that.

1944
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,400
I just pushed the button and it happened.

1945
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,880
It's going to back forward right to the music.

1946
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
Oh my gosh.

1947
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
The show you've been asking for.

1948
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
It won't get a thing to start again.

1949
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
It will not start again.

1950
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,880
This is a false start.

1951
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,880
It's going to get me flagged.

1952
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,880
It's going to get me flagged.

1953
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
You're going to get me flagged, dude.

1954
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,280
It can't get flagged because it's custom written.

1955
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,280
Good.

1956
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
All right.

1957
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,280
Good.

1958
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,280
Okay.

1959
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,280
All right.

1960
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,280
Yeah.

1961
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Because I don't know.

1962
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,280
A lot of multi-speed technologies.

1963
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,280
The Ask Noah show starts right now.

1964
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,680
This is the show where we do all the things on Linux they said that couldn't be done and

1965
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,080
take your calls on how to do the same.

1966
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,080
Damn, that's good, dude.

1967
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,080
That is good.

1968
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,080
Much better, right?

1969
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,080
I like that.

1970
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,080
I like that.

1971
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,080
I like that music better.

1972
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,080
I like that slogan better.

1973
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,120
Because, you know, your tech and tech business tech questions didn't make any sense to me.

1974
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,120
I know.

1975
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,120
And you know what?

1976
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,120
Here's the problem, though.

1977
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,120
You didn't tell me that until New York.

1978
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,120
Do you remember?

1979
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,120
We were having dinner.

1980
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,120
Oh, really?

1981
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,120
Yeah.

1982
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,120
We were down eating.

1983
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,120
We were eating Indian food in the basement of the train station.

1984
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,120
I do remember.

1985
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,840
And you're like, what does that mean?

1986
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,340
I'm like, what does what mean?

1987
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,820
You said taking your tech questions and business in tech question.

1988
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,820
What does that mean?

1989
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,820
And then I explain it.

1990
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:36,820
And you're like, okay, well, once you explain it, it makes sense.

1991
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,280
But when you say it, it doesn't make any sense.

1992
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,860
And I'm like, well, we're 54 episodes in.

1993
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:41,860
Why am I just hearing about this now?

1994
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:42,860
I know.

1995
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,860
I'm too nice.

1996
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,860
I just didn't make it from episode one.

1997
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,860
I know.

1998
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,860
I am too nice.

1999
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,860
You got to be stern from the start.

2000
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,860
J-Bot is...

2001
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,860
By the way, nice new...

2002
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,860
By the way, nice new rock music.

2003
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:51,860
Yeah.

2004
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:52,860
Thanks to him.

2005
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,860
It only took four and a half months and a lot of money.

2006
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,860
But now you have it.

2007
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,860
It's perfect.

2008
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,860
Turn it up.

2009
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,860
Yeah.

2010
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,860
And 52 YouTube flags.

2011
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,880
Actually, no, it's double because there's a live stream.

2012
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:07,100
So JB Titles is not working because J-Bot is written in Ruby and not Rust.

2013
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,100
Oh, yeah.

2014
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,100
Should I...

2015
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,100
I guess I can...

2016
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,780
We ought to talk about maybe soliciting a community project to rewriting J-Bot because

2017
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:19,100
J-Bot doesn't handle people going to JBtitles.com super well, I'm noticing.

2018
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,100
It's just...

2019
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,100
It has a hard time.

2020
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:27,540
And I think it's just maybe because it's Ruby, but that's just maybe me being a Rust lover.

2021
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,580
I don't know.

2022
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,580
I'm all Rust.

2023
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,580
I'm all Rust.

2024
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,620
I go to bed at night watching Rust YouTube videos.

2025
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,620
Yeah.

2026
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,620
Anyways, what are we going to...

2027
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,620
What are we going to title this thing?

2028
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,620
Because I've got to get out of here so Noah can do a show.

2029
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,620
So we've got to come up with a title, guys.

2030
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,860
God, this is always harder than it should be.

2031
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,900
Too bad we don't have Popeye in here cursing and yelling at people to give us a title because

2032
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:46,900
that would be...

2033
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,900
Ha ha ha ha.

2034
01:14:47,900 --> 01:15:03,180
Ha ha ha.
