00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 42 for May 27th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still celebrating towel day.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And my name is Matt.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey Matt, you know it is episode 42 so it felt only appropriate to give a shout out

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and guess what?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's that?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Big show today.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Big show.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Big show today.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,880
So, Liam from gamingonlinux.com and also a writer for Linux Voice joins us to discuss

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,480
the Witcher 2 controversy.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,720
He took to the web, he wrote on gamingonlinux that we need to stand back and push against

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,840
these kind of ports because these could harm the long term viability and perception of

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Linux as a gaming platform.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,320
So he's going to come on and Liam will talk to us about his opinion on why maybe the Witcher

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,800
2 is a bigger problem than perhaps we were originally suspecting.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,920
And then if we get through all of that after our email and feedback as well and the follow

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,120
up on the poll from last week, I have a really big announcement to make.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Huge announcement.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Big, big announcement.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Biggest announcement ever.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Maybe.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Wow.

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
I don't know, that might be overselling it.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,240
But it's probably in the top three.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,800
For forever as of yet or whatever.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Yeah.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, I'd say it's in the top three.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Cool.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Yeah, we'll see.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
We'll see if we get to it.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I don't know.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I don't know.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
We got a lot to cover this week, Matt.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah, we just might not have time.

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
We'll see.

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
All right.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,560
So I wanted to start with our feedback this week.

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,080
And we got a whole bunch of emails.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,400
And some people have been complaining that the feedback segment's a little long.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
So I've trimmed it up a little bit.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,520
So I just wanted to start with a couple of follow up items just real quick.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,600
The first one is we had Jonathan Thomas from the OpenShot Project on Linux Action Show

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
on Sunday.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,560
And he mentioned in our interview with him that he would be doing an update on the development

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
status of OpenShot 2.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Well he has posted that update and you can find it over at OpenShotVideo.com.

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,200
We got it linked in the show notes.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,520
He also gave us a shout out for his interview on episode 314.

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
He loved our shirts.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
That was pretty cool.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
That's awesome.

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,480
We all had matching shirts.

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,880
So he also gives us a video preview of OpenShot 2.0.

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I'll play a little bit of it.

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,000
It's got quite a soundtrack to it.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,360
It's looking good.

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,800
So he's got about almost a two minute clip here of the new editor in action working,

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,760
moving clips around.

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,320
The timeline looks like it moves real slick.

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,980
And then later on in the video he'll show how the UI is fully customizable.

65
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,240
You can dock all the windows around and stuff like that.

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
So kind of exciting.

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,320
You can watch the full video over at OpenShotVideo.com and get a little preview taste of how it's

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
coming.

69
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
He says there's been 56 commits in the past 30 days.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,800
He says the OpenShot development is the most active it's been yet.

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Things are moving forward at a very fast pace.

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,240
And he included some recently completed tasks.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,640
So if you've been following this closely you can go check it out.

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,600
And one of the things that he mentioned is he was having some windows build issues.

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,920
Those look like they have been mostly nailed out.

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,000
And we got a comment on our YouTube page, somebody said, yeah, the reason why I use

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,280
OpenShot is because I've been planning on that cross-platform compatibility that's going

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
to make it work for me.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
So there you go.

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Good stuff.

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Good stuff.

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
All right.

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,160
I'm going to move into our mumble room here, our virtual lug.

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Hey guys.

85
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,560
So guys, we're going to read an email here from Tennessee Frank who kind of writes in

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,000
a little bit in the defense of Manjaro.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,280
I think we had like an after-show discussion where we're like, oh, Manjaro, hmm, hmm.

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,040
And so I think we kind of spurred some people to write in.

89
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,000
And Tennessee Frank says, hey, Chris and Matt, love the show and try to watch live when I

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
can.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,240
But he can't always watch live, of course.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
We understand.

93
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
He says he wants to-

94
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Right now.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah.

96
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Oh, well, hello, Tennessee Frank.

97
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
He says, I wanted to stand up for Manjaro.

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,480
He says, I know a lot of Arch users don't really like, they kind of hate on it.

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
They say it's not Arch.

100
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,600
And granted, they do have their own repos now.

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
And there aren't quite as cutting edge as a pure Arch install would be.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,160
But for those of us who don't have a PhD in Arch, it gives us a way to access all the

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,520
Arch goodness and the AUR without all the issues associated with doing a proper Arch

104
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
install.

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,460
I've tried just about every Arch-based KDE distro out there, including Entergos.

106
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,600
And thus far, Manjaro was the only one that worked well for me and gives me Bluetooth

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
support and Wi-Fi right out of the box.

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
I think that's a big one.

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,880
I really think that those who use pure Arch really need to get over it and accept those

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,720
of us who use Manjaro and the other offshoots as fellow Arch users, even if we didn't build

111
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
our own system from scratch.

112
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,200
We're using Pac-Man, same as Arch users, and we do appreciate the power of Pac-Man,

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,880
hopefully with the help of distros like Manjaro, we'll learn enough to move to pure Arch

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,920
install sooner or later.

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,680
Until then, let's try to play nice with each other and stop all of the hate.

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,960
Besides, there are plenty of Windows users for us to hate on, lol.

117
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Catch you on the show.

118
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
Keep up the great work, Tennessee Frank.

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,520
So there was one defensive Manjaro, and then we had a second emailer, just kind of in the

120
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,400
same vein, write in to say, this is Kerry, and Kerry said, about Arch, Manjaro, and Wi-Fi.

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,960
Hi Chris and Matt, loved the show.

122
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,640
I just had a small rebuttal about the comment that why would people use Manjaro instead

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
of pure Arch?

124
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,360
I wish I was on the Mumble channel that last Tuesday, because I could have said this.

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,640
But a good reason why, and I think many other people use Manjaro instead of pure Arch, is

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
because of the Wi-Fi drivers.

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Trying to figure out how to install Wi-Fi drivers is difficult enough, but I don't have

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
easy access to an Ethernet dongle.

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,880
In the new age of extremely thin laptops, I'm guessing, he says, this is in the age

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,200
of new extremely thin laptops where you almost always need an Ethernet dongle now, I'm guessing

131
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,320
that Debian, Arch, and many other Ethernet by default distros will start running into

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,840
this issue more and more as these laptops become more popular, although maybe this is

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,280
an issue of non-free software.

134
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
So that's an interesting angle, too, of the hardware support, don't you think, Matt?

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,920
Well, you know, I mean, so I've actually had one instance, was not with Wi-Fi, it was actually

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,320
with an Ethernet situation to where Integrus was not seeing it, you know, which is essentially

137
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,440
pure Arch for all intents and purposes.

138
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Manjaro did.

139
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,560
Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal except for the one little bit that if you want to

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,720
install the operating system, you kind of have to have internet.

141
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
So that was kind of a deal breaker for me.

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,740
So of course, on that machine, I went with Manjaro.

143
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,640
On most other machines, though, whether it be Integrus or Manjaro, I've never really

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,880
had a problem with wireless stuff, just personally, my own experience.

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,100
At the end of the day, you know, as far as like people that don't like Manjaro or do

146
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,280
like Manjaro, honestly, if you're a Manjaro fan, hey, that's awesome.

147
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,200
You know, don't worry about what other people think about it.

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
If it's working for you, stick with it.

149
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Don't sweat it.

150
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
And to that, Matt.

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
RodCorps, go ahead.

152
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
You wanted to make a point.

153
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,840
Yeah, but it was mainly to talk about the elitism of Arch people and it's not that Arch

154
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
users say you're not using real Arch.

155
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,980
It's that Arch users say specifically the people who are in the community helping people

156
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,320
is if you're not using Arch, you shouldn't be coming to Arch people for help.

157
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,880
So then people who are Manjaro have a completely different kernel.

158
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,860
They've modified their kernel and put extra pieces into it.

159
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,880
That means that there's many aspects where it's just going to create breakage when you

160
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,440
have Arch packages in a different distro and then claim that they're compatible when they're

161
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
actually not.

162
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,720
And then you go to the Arch packages and maintainers and ask them what's the problem and you're

163
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,640
like, they say the same thing that the Ubuntu people would say to Mint users, you're using

164
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,680
a different distro, stop expecting us to help you with a different distro.

165
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Go ahead, Popiah.

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,800
I think you're about to say exactly what I was just thinking.

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah, I think Rod hit the nail on the head.

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,860
We get exactly the same thing with Ubuntu in our IRC channels.

169
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:55,760
We get Mint people coming in or Mint users coming in and saying, my system's not working

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,280
and I'm using Ubuntu when in fact they're using an Ubuntu derivative Mint and it's not

171
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
just Mint.

172
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
It could be any derivative.

173
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,000
I think this is one of those growing pains of any derivative of another distro where

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,760
they don't have a wide variety of support that they often direct people to the upstream

175
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,400
support channels or people inadvertently go to the upstream support channels and they

176
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,440
find that upstream, some to get lost because it's not actually upstream that they're running.

177
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Riley, I wanted you to get your repo pointing about Manjaro.

178
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Go ahead.

179
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Yeah.

180
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,120
The main thing that really bugs me about Manjaro is how they manage the repos and how they

181
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,760
test the packages because I know there's no way on earth with a small team that they have

182
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,720
that they can test all those packages, hold them back for two weeks and call it stable.

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
There's no way.

184
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,360
I'm sure they test some of them, but to hold a package back just two weeks and call it

185
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,640
stable and call it a day, this doesn't make sense to me at all.

186
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,960
They'd have to have testing on a pretty large scale.

187
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah.

188
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,240
Nine people with about 10,000 packages.

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Yeah.

190
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Yes, exactly.

191
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
There's no way they can do that.

192
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,440
Wimpy, go ahead and give me the dev perspective on this.

193
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,800
Well, Rotten sort of hit it on the head there.

194
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,520
There has been some aggravation with the Arch developers and the Manjaro developers where

195
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,480
we change things because we're rolling release and then we get accused of deliberately breaking

196
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,800
Manjaro when packages roll into Manjaro at offset intervals because the way that things

197
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,720
trickle from Arch into Arch is controlled, and I don't know that's matched with Manjaro.

198
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,480
Also what Riley was saying is also true.

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,160
I got a lot of flack from some Manjaro users when I released Marte 1.8, and they were all

200
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,920
stating that in two weeks when it all trickled into Manjaro, it would be stable.

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,800
I was making the point, well, I wasn't going to do anything in two weeks, so what was going

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,880
to make these packages more stable in two weeks' time other than the passage of time?

203
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Exactly.

204
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
Then you just have to wait two weeks in order to get that next patch in.

205
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
This is the key question about Manjaro for me.

206
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,640
I have yet to have heard a great answer to it because to me it seems like one of the

207
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,680
few distributions that could pull off a successful testing branch like this would be distributions

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,520
with the size install base of Debian or Ubuntu because such a niche of your base is going

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,640
to be running on test, and then a niche of that niche will have all of the packages installed,

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,480
so even with 10,000 users running on a test version of a distribution, a small subset

211
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,360
of them are going to have the package installed that you have installed, so it could literally

212
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,480
come down to maybe 100 people use that same package, maybe those people issued the update

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,840
in that two weeks' time period and tested it, and if maybe they ran into a bug, maybe

214
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,140
they reported it, so now maybe you're down to a dozen possible people that would actually

215
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,200
do that, so to me, the only way to prove a system like that is with massive scale and

216
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,300
demonstrated ability to catch bugs before they ship, and I don't know if we've seen

217
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,720
either one of those in Manjaro's case yet.

218
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,080
I think that they just wait for packages to be in Arch on two weeks, so they see if there

219
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,120
are enough stable that nobody says there's something wrong with this.

220
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,280
I think that the two weeks help because there's a higher chance of Arch users to report the

221
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
problem.

222
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,000
Wimpeed, could you touch on the testing process for Arch there?

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah, so this doesn't apply necessarily to the community repositories, but the core and

224
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,440
extra repositories, there's a testing, so everything that goes into core and extra has

225
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,600
to go into testing first, and it requires a number of developers to then sign off on

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,520
those packages, meaning that you've actually used those packages out of the testing repositories

227
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,660
and agree that they work and they don't break things, so that's the testing that happens

228
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,720
within Arch, so when things land in Arch, they have already gone through a testing process,

229
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:20,120
so further delaying the packages with a derivative distribution doesn't actually add anything

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
to the testing.

231
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,560
So the real benefit would be to have a distribution that got maybe more people testing.

232
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,200
Well quite, and what I do is I'm putting most of my packages into community, and there's

233
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,600
no official testing sign off there unless there's a rebuild because of an underlying

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,720
library change, but what I do is I host some development repositories, and the users that

235
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm in contact with through Google Plus and other online forums, they actually run these

236
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,080
things for weeks or months in some cases before they actually make it into production releases,

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
so it's well tested.

238
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,960
But the other thing I wanted to touch on is that there has been occasion where there's

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,860
been security updates that we've applied in Arch that haven't trickled through immediately

240
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,520
into Manjaro, so you've got a bigger attack window.

241
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,680
Right, but still though, in relative to some other distributions turnaround times, a pretty

242
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
tight window.

243
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,040
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of security teams.

244
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,920
Oh yeah, that's a good point, as Matt points out, Manjaro is a desktop.

245
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,240
I always found that to be such a crap answer, I just, I can't, yeah, I mean, I'll give you

246
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
the other stuff, but that was, come on, you know.

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Yeah.

248
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,760
Well there's other flaws with Manjaro too, we can go through if you want.

249
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,560
Well I didn't want this to be a, I mean, because these guys are writing in in defense, and

250
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,040
I guess I wanted to say this is a, I mean, I think there's a place for hardware support

251
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,720
and like Matt says, for offline install, that's obviously, there's a need for that when it

252
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
comes to installing Arch.

253
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
I mean.

254
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,880
But the bug testing is not done by Manjaro.

255
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,360
Like most of my PCs are Arch, but there's one specifically that I don't want to screw

256
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,520
with, I leave it alone, I run Manjaro on that for a reason, because I'm not updating every

257
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,640
bloody day, because quite frankly, you really, to be proactive, you need to actually be in

258
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
front of that and paying attention.

259
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,440
Yeah, there is almost an inherent benefit in having slowed down updates just for that

260
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
purpose.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
But for myself, it's a distro that serves a purpose in that regard.

262
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
Do I want it on all my machines?

263
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Not necessarily.

264
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,840
I like different flavors of things for different tasks.

265
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,160
I guess the reason why, because I don't want to hate on Manjaro too much, and I was thinking

266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,040
maybe we should dedicate an episode where we kind of really get into this, and maybe.

267
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,160
There are some things that does better than other distributions, and I, you know.

268
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,440
And sounds like there's some legitimate concerns about the way they do testing, and so it sounds

269
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,320
like we could have a pretty good robust, we might be able to dedicate a whole episode

270
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
to that.

271
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
Should we do an episode on this?

272
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Maybe.

273
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
I think that's a good idea.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,920
An Arch-based conversation with Entergos and Chakra and stuff like that.

275
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah, maybe we'll let this topic air for a few weeks, so we think about it, because we've

276
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,200
got some stuff planned for the next few weeks, and then we'll come back to this, and we'll

277
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,400
dedicate a whole show to it, because I think that could be, because like the chairman's

278
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,280
pointing out, Chakaraka Raka Bing Bang is also, you know, they do something interesting

279
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,560
where they just support a subset of Arch packages, and so they have their own approach, right?

280
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,360
And then, of course, you've got Entergos, and then you've got straight up Arch.

281
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,440
Chris, actually Chakra, the Nijaro devs are actually former Chakra devs, who actually,

282
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,280
I think there was like some kind of in-house fighting that happened or something, and they

283
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,160
split off and just did their own thing.

284
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Yeah.

285
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Yeah, so maybe, alright.

286
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
They're not an Arch derivative anymore.

287
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,360
As they say, let's put a pin in it, and we'll come back to this in a couple of weeks, because

288
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,200
we do have Liam here, and I want to get to Liam to talk about Witherwitcher 2, and also

289
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,400
we got an email in, okay, it's a little weird, I'm not upset, it's just a little weird.

290
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,540
We got an email in, and this is the first time this has ever happened, it's not addressed

291
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,720
to me, it's not addressed to Matt, it's addressed to the Mumble Room.

292
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,520
So Mumble Room got an email this week, so we're going to read that here in a minute.

293
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,320
I was like, oh, they're not even writing to talk to Matt and I, that's cool, but before

294
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,720
we get to that, I want to thank our first sponsor this weekend, that is the great folks

295
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,200
over at DigitalOcean, and the month of May is almost wrapping up, so if you want to go

296
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,460
out there and use Unplugged May to give us a little boost for the month of May, I would

297
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,840
love it, and why would you do that?

298
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,640
Because you're going to get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean when you use Unplugged May.

299
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,240
So what is DigitalOcean, and why would you want a $10 credit?

300
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Man, I am so glad you asked me that question, it's like you knew exactly what to ask, dear

301
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
audience.

302
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,720
Well let me tell you, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider, dedicated to offering

303
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,560
the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

304
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,400
Now our audience is fast, but on average, users can create a cloud server in about 55

305
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,880
seconds, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

306
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:51,720
SSD drive, a fast CPU, and one terabyte of transfer for $5 a month, and DigitalOcean

307
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,040
has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, and Amsterdam, but I

308
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,860
think the thing I love the most about them is their interface is intuitive yet powerful,

309
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,800
and power users can replicate it on a larger scale with an API.

310
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,960
Now that's not me, I'll just take the easy to use control panel, but I am appreciative

311
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,120
of this API because there are some great apps that are propping up around it.

312
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,680
But I could also see back from my IT days, I could very easily see DigitalOcean as sort

313
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,480
of our remote data center for like maybe an offsite baculum machine, or an offsite own

314
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,360
cloud box, or an XMPP server, or whatever we would need where it would be really easy

315
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
for everybody to connect to.

316
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,200
I could easily see using DigitalOcean for that, and I love the fact that I could write

317
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,040
a series of scripts, and even integrate it in with my puppet setup to manage my DigitalOcean

318
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,300
droplet.

319
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,400
And because they have Docker so tightly integrated, you can actually use Dooku to publish applications

320
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
directly onto a DigitalOcean droplet.

321
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,360
They've got lots of Linux distribution choices.

322
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,360
I think Arch is still available right now, so if you want an Arch machine, go grab it

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,000
while you can, and use the promo code unpluggedmay, so you get that $10 credit.

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,520
You can try out that $5 rig for free for two months.

325
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,000
If you're not even sure what you would use it for, take advantage of that free two months

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,520
because their interface is so simple to use.

327
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,760
You're not going to get bamboozled into subscribing to something you don't want.

328
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,280
So try out that unpluggedmay promo code, and just experiment with a really fast VPS up

329
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,440
in the cloud that is connected to tier one bandwidth on data center hardware that really

330
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
performs.

331
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
Just so you get a sense of what that's like if you've never gotten to experience that,

332
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,560
and why not build yourself a little server to play with.

333
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,720
And then, if you're like Michael Dominic for Coder Radio or myself, you can actually deploy

334
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,240
some of your infrastructure on this.

335
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,560
There's a massive website that you've all heard about.

336
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm waiting for their permission to mention how they use DigitalOcean because it's such

337
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,080
a cool setup.

338
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,200
The great thing about DigitalOcean is they early on invested in SSDs.

339
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,760
Way, way, way, way long, from the very beginning they knew this is how we're going to have

340
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,840
to do this, and we're going to have to wrap it in a package that people can really grok

341
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,200
and really use.

342
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,640
The benefit of these SSD drives up on a DigitalOcean droplet is you can get such good performance,

343
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,920
and IO contention is a total non-issue.

344
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,160
And what I mean by that is back in the day, to get the kind of performance I get from

345
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,600
my DigitalOcean droplet now, I would have to have a rate array of at least three or

346
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,740
more disks to get the kind of performance I can get now off of one single SSD drive.

347
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,960
And DigitalOcean's pricing structure is so straightforward that if I need to expand that

348
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,120
SSD size, it's clear to me exactly what I'm going to be spending, and the value is absolutely

349
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
reasonable.

350
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,360
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code unpluggedmay when you check out, see

351
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,080
what we've been talking about, go check out what an awesome product can be built using

352
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,160
Linux technologies like KVM, of course the Linux kernel, all riding on top of amazing

353
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
hardware.

354
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,560
DigitalOcean.com, and a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

355
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay, so we got this question for the Mumble Room, not for us, comes in from James, and

356
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,000
James says, I have multiple machines, both for work and personal, all right, so get that

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Mumble Room in your head, and I use them on a daily basis.

358
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,280
My question is, how do you, the virtual lug, handle multiple systems with documents, config

359
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,200
files, projects, installed packages, et cetera?

360
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,080
I find myself sometimes freaking out that my laptop is not exactly configured like my

361
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,740
workstation and that sometimes I want to work on something from home.

362
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,520
So you, virtual lug, how do you stay organized between multiple machines?

363
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
You want to take this first?

364
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
BitTorrent Sync.

365
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Ick?

366
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
BitTorrent Sync, that's how I do it.

367
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
Yeah, that's a good tool.

368
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,560
I've been using a lot of BitTorrent Sync myself.

369
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Anybody else?

370
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,880
That, and you know, it just got to make sure that you're using the same thing on both machines,

371
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,280
you know, as far as secretizing like Google bookmarks or Firefox bookmarks or what have

372
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
you.

373
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,640
And then of course, password manager.

374
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,520
So Wimpy, are you syncing like your.config files with BitTorrent Sync?

375
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,320
All sorts of stuff, but yes.

376
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:03,560
So if you search on GitHub, there's a tool called Macup, M-A-C-K-U-P, which is a Python

377
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:11,260
script and it was originally designed to sync.files and.folders to Dropbox, but recently

378
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,920
they've changed the way it works so that you can actually back it up to other cloud backends

379
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,960
and also just to a random target directory.

380
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:27,080
So I have a BitSync folder called profiles and all of my.files get backed up in there

381
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,280
using Macup and Macup has a backup and restore facility.

382
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,800
So I have my main workstation, I back up all my stuff and it auto creates the symlinks

383
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,840
to all the necessary places and then when I go to a new machine, I just sync down the

384
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,680
profile and then run Macup restore and it sprays all of the symlinks back in the right

385
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,360
places and all of my stuff is configured and ready to go.

386
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,680
So I use that for the.files.

387
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Do you have any problems with mismatched versions of software and reading a config that is meant

388
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,880
for a different version of the package or something like that?

389
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,320
No, I mean I run Arch on all my machines and they're all, if not at the same version, very

390
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,600
close to the same version, so I've never encountered a problem with it, no.

391
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
That's pretty interesting.

392
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,840
You kind of have my interest peak, so that's, and that's, Rekai's got that linked in the

393
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,240
chat room it looks like right now, so I'll go grab a link to that and throw it in the

394
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
show notes.

395
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,400
All right, so anybody else?

396
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,720
I saw Dropbox mentioned a couple of times, Poby, you've been trying sync thing?

397
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, I, without wishing to get too aggressive, I find it incredulous that Linux and open

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,000
source people will accept BitTorrent sync into their life.

399
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,960
It's a proprietary closed platform and you have no idea what's going over the wire, so

400
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,600
I use sync thing and it's fully open source, free software, it's written in Go, it's on

401
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:03,680
GitHub and the developer is super active and very responsive to issues and bug reports.

402
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,320
It does pretty much the same kind of thing as BitTorrent sync in that you can sync a

403
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
folder between multiple machines.

404
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,640
They could all be behind a firewall, they could be opened up to other people, but the

405
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,320
key point is there's no third party that could control it or shut it down or monitor what's

406
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
going on.

407
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,440
Now Wimpy, you kind of had a response to sync thing versus BitTorrent sync, right?

408
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,240
Well only in as much that, because Poby was banging on about sync thing a few weeks ago,

409
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,200
I actually created the sync thing packages for Arch Linux in the AUR.

410
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,920
Oh, well thank you.

411
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
So I'm using your package then.

412
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,480
Yeah, and I am actually using sync thing, but at the moment it doesn't quite do everything

413
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,400
I need for me to move over to it, but I think in due course I will migrate to it, but BitTorrent

414
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,680
sync is the thing that got me away from Dropbox, so that's an improvement.

415
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,480
All right, well we're going to get to Liam here in just a sec, because I know he's been

417
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,680
patiently waiting while he eats a box of cookies because it's getting late where he's at.

418
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,560
Really quick though, and you still have time to vote, I'm just curious, this hit the last

419
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
subreddit this week.

420
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,000
I just really just thought maybe you guys would like to see the results so far of the

421
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,640
desktop environment straw poll that we launched last week.

422
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,320
Gnome, when we recorded the episode, was ahead.

423
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,000
It has now fallen to the second position with 20% of the votes.

424
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,800
KDE now dominates the poll with a solid lead at 23%, so 3% over Gnome.

425
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,680
And we've gotten a total of, wow, 1,469 votes so far.

426
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,480
And I'd say, so here's your top five, ladies and gentlemen, number one, actually I'll start

427
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,520
at the bottom, number five, Cinnamon, number four, XFCE, number three, Unity, number two,

428
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,320
Gnome Shell, and number one, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, KDE.

429
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Not too surprised by this.

430
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Of course.

431
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
A little surprised by KDE.

432
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Yeah.

433
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:04,200
There's only 8% between Unity and KDE, between the third and the first.

434
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,360
I don't want this to come across as offensive because I actually infrequently switch over

435
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,200
to KDE and enjoy it quite a bit.

436
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,120
So I think KDE is a fantastic desktop.

437
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I think it's cool.

438
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
You can customize it.

439
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,000
I think Qt's great.

440
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,600
However, that said, I kind of wonder if maybe the popularity of KDE is because KDE has been

441
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,520
so damn solid since the four dot one days that people have just kind of put their arms

442
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,620
up and been like, ah, I'm sick of everybody screwing around with me and changing everything

443
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
on me.

444
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm just going to get KDE figured out and I'm just going to make it work.

445
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,560
Now I'm not trying to say people are settling, but I am kind of saying maybe people are settling.

446
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
I don't know.

447
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I don't.

448
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Because I actually think KDE is great.

449
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
So maybe not.

450
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,520
Maybe people see what I see in it and they just love it.

451
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,980
But anyways, why don't, I'm going to grab Liam here who's been waiting very politely

452
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,640
and I'll pull him down to our little restricted casting room where we can hang out.

453
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,520
It's kind of like a green room.

454
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,080
And velvet padded walls, Liam.

455
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,040
So Liam, thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged at last minute notice.

456
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,000
I like literally pinged you two hours ago on Twitter.

457
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So you're a good sport.

458
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I really appreciate it.

459
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
Hey, no problem.

460
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
So gamingonlinux.com.

461
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I love it.

462
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,440
I read it at least every Saturday just to see.

463
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,480
You recently had a post like all the great games that came out that week in Linux.

464
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
I think you had that two weeks ago.

465
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
It was a great read.

466
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,400
I enjoyed that quite a bit.

467
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,600
And on, I want to see, let me pull this up.

468
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,920
You recently wrote a piece kind of covering this whole Witcher 2 fiasco.

469
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,480
Would you be a sport and kind of update our audience in your own words on what is the

470
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,760
big upset around Witcher 2 and what kind of started off this whole controversy?

471
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,160
Yeah, sure.

472
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Okay.

473
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:01,680
Well, it's a bit of a harsh stance to take really, but I think it is an important one.

474
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,320
The port basically was a lazy port.

475
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,220
There's no way to get around that.

476
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,640
The Witcher 2 is not an old game.

477
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
It's not like it's using old tech that the developers aren't familiar with.

478
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,680
It originally shipped for Windows in 2011.

479
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Is that right?

480
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah.

481
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Yeah.

482
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
You're talking a couple years.

483
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah.

484
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Nothing.

485
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,000
And then we had another game, System Shock 2.

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Now that was ported using Wine.

487
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,920
That's like 15 years old.

488
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
That is completely different.

489
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,120
Now Linux users are obviously very technically minded.

490
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,560
We know all the ins and outs of everything basically.

491
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,720
We are going to find out if something like this happens quite easily, as we did.

492
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,200
So what happened, right, if I have this correct, is it gets announced on Steam.

493
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
People start downloading.

494
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,520
They start noticing really odd performance issues, especially if they're on ATI and Intel.

495
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,400
They basically can't play the game, right?

496
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Yeah.

497
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,800
I mean, that's it.

498
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,380
When it first came out, it only worked, well, they said it only worked on Nvidia hardware.

499
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,800
That was the first iffy thing, really.

500
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Yes.

501
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Yeah.

502
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
That seemed a little strange.

503
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,600
And then people started investigating why the performance was so bad.

504
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,040
In fact, some have even claimed it ran better under Wine.

505
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,200
So people started doing a little digging, and then they discovered, wait a minute, there's

506
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,280
an actual Windows EXE in here.

507
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,960
And when you launch the game, this Eon wrapper is essentially performing the function that

508
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,160
Wine would perform and running a Windows executable in sort of a little cocoon environment,

509
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
correct?

510
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah.

511
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
It's pretty much that.

512
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,040
I mean, the virtual programming, the guys that did the port, they claim they do make

513
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,880
code changes and they specifically tune their software for every port.

514
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,320
But when something works vastly better in Wine than the port itself, something's not

515
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
right.

516
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,680
Now, I got to be honest with you.

517
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,680
On my system, I don't know if I would have known it wasn't a native port.

518
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,120
So I think if you have the right setup, if you have basically an Nvidia card with proprietary

519
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,000
Nvidia driver, I mean, I probably played it for two, two and a half hours without issue.

520
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
I haven't played it beyond that, so I don't know if it becomes unstable later on.

521
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,640
So for me, I was kind of like, oh, cool, a game I didn't have before is now available

522
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
on Linux.

523
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,960
And I kind of just stopped the thought process there.

524
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,840
But the point that you brought up in your article is this could set a bad perception

525
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,800
about Linux as a gaming platform, right?

526
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,160
You're worried that maybe Windows PC switchers will look at it and go, oh, Linux, you mean

527
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,560
that platform that has all the emulated ports that don't run as good as the native games?

528
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,040
If I ran Windows on the same box, you're worried about that kind of perception, right?

529
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,420
Well, yeah, for Linux to grow, for Linux gaming to grow, we have to have games.

530
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,160
And if developers keep coming along, pushing games out like this, then people that switch

531
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,960
from Windows or Mac to Linux are going to notice the difference.

532
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,520
They're going to start talking about it.

533
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,360
Well, isn't this already happening on the Mac?

534
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,400
Because when I think of a lot of Mac games, I think of crappy Windows ports.

535
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,520
To be honest with you, this seems to be an already problem that plagues the Mac platform.

536
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,720
And they're selling them through the Mac App Store.

537
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Yeah.

538
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,520
And it's a funny thing.

539
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,760
The guys who ported The Witcher actually do a fair few of the Mac ports, and they're also

540
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
not very good.

541
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
So let me ask you this.

542
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,200
Are you opposed to the idea if, let's just say we live in some sort of magical pony land

543
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,040
where happiness is abound, and they can just out of nowhere develop a really solid wrapper

544
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,660
where, I mean, really, it's actually a pretty good performing game, and they've really done

545
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,660
some magic there.

546
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,240
Are you okay with that kind of port?

547
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,520
Or is it a principle thing where it needs to be native code?

548
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,880
Because I've been sensing it's a bit about the technology, too.

549
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,840
It's not just about the functionality of the game.

550
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Is that right?

551
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,200
Originally, yeah.

552
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,320
My complaint originally was that they didn't port it natively at all.

553
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,920
It was using a wrapper.

554
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,340
But then so many people made comments about the performance and that it doesn't matter

555
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
as long as it works.

556
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
And that's true.

557
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
It works.

558
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
That's great.

559
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
That's what we need.

560
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,600
But the point about this is it doesn't work for a lot of people, and the wrapper is the

561
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,080
source of those problems.

562
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Right.

563
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Yeah.

564
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,560
And I could see that reputation thing becoming a big problem.

565
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,600
But don't you think in a way the overly verbose reaction from the Linux community will sort

566
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,680
of promote that image because we're drawing so much attention to it?

567
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,480
Oh, yeah, definitely.

568
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,440
I mean, some people have just gone way too overboard.

569
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,880
I mean, one of the developers came on and sort of tried to speak to people on the Steam

570
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,960
forum and he got destroyed by people.

571
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
It was horrible.

572
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Yeah, I saw that.

573
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,200
One of the Eon guys came on and he said, you know, we consider it to be a good middle ground

574
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,340
because these shops simply just don't have the budget to do a full native port.

575
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,480
And so this developer says, look, it was either this wrapper or no game at all.

576
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
What would you prefer?

577
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,800
What would Liam, writer for gaming on Linux.com, what would you prefer?

578
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
No game at all or a port like this?

579
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,080
Personally, for me, I mean, this is just speaking for myself.

580
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,560
I would have personally preferred no port to what I've got.

581
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,600
It's about the reputation for you.

582
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
Well, it's not just that.

583
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,000
I mean, I went out and actually bought it myself as a gamer to write about it, to video

584
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
it.

585
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I can't even run it.

586
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Wow.

587
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,880
Yeah, that would be very easy.

588
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Yeah.

589
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
See, I got lucky, right?

590
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
I bought it on sale at 80 percent off and I had an NVIDIA machine to try it on.

591
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,360
I didn't even try it on an Intel rig here at the studio.

592
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,480
I actually have an NVIDIA machine.

593
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,840
I mean, I'm using the proprietary drivers.

594
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,200
I get about nine to ten frames per second on the lowest settings.

595
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,720
You know, honestly, I would rather the developers just work with like wine and just say, here,

596
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,800
if Linux users want to play our game, use wine.

597
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I don't know.

598
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,960
Well, that was the stance of the guy behind ID Software.

599
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,760
That was what he said originally.

600
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,400
He said that for Linux gaming to succeed, something along these lines, that people need

601
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,880
to push wine, basically.

602
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Yeah.

603
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,640
I mean, no, I just mean in some circumstances.

604
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,920
I don't want to have a whole bunch of emulators, or whatever, not emulators, but you know what

605
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I mean.

606
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:27,640
I guess I kind of wanted to wrap on this question and ask you if you think this has set perhaps

607
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,180
a bad taste in developers' mouths now?

608
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,720
Probably has a bit, yeah.

609
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,080
The backlash of it has probably not made them very happy, I imagine.

610
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Yeah.

611
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Yeah.

612
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
All right.

613
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,440
Well, I'm going to drag you up to the Lion's Den, and we'll let the Virtual Lug toss some

614
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,600
questions at you and see if they have anything they want to ask you.

615
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
So Virtual Lug, Popey, why don't we start with you?

616
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,920
Is there any questions you wanted to ask before we jump to the next segment?

617
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Yeah.

618
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm not so fussed about having a wine port.

619
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I mean, as in, I don't mind.

620
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I like Limbo.

621
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,400
I don't really care that it runs under Wine, or Eon, or whatever any of these enabling

622
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,840
technologies are, in the same way that I don't care that Minecraft runs under Java.

623
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,080
I don't care what technology enables it, so long as it works.

624
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,800
It depresses me that the Linux community would be happy to file a bug about their keyboard

625
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,960
not working, or their mouse not working to their distro, but when a developer of a game

626
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,000
comes along and uses a third-party enabler to make their game work on Linux, rather than

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,960
file a bug and say, hey, in a friendly, respectful way, rather than saying, your game doesn't

628
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,400
work very well on my platform, they go full bore hassling the person on Steam.

629
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,480
And I think that's just the wrong way to approach it.

630
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
That was the wrong way.

631
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
I agree there.

632
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,680
I do see that.

633
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,040
That was the part that kind of went dirty that leaves the bad taste.

634
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,760
Daredevil, I wanted to get a chance, because you say maybe we're looking at this the wrong

635
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
way.

636
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
Yeah, I agree totally with Popi.

637
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
And also, it's like, this is not a matter of Linux.

638
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,280
We're talking about if the problem was that developers didn't acknowledge the platform.

639
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
They're starting to acknowledge.

640
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,000
When they started to develop for Windows, they also had quirks, and they had to deal

641
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
with it.

642
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,480
Same way when they go to consoles.

643
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
That's true.

644
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
If you look at it like old DOS games coming to Windows, man, what a wreck that was for

645
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
a while.

646
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,520
Yeah, it takes a while.

647
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,280
And it's just a matter of going and reporting bugs and saying, look, this doesn't work.

648
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,520
Maybe even if you buy the game and the game doesn't work, pay attention to the license

649
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,560
that you accepted.

650
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,320
Maybe the license is like Windows license, that if it doesn't work for you, you can actually

651
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
get a refund.

652
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Yeah.

653
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,200
Yeah, if you're going to use a wrapper, I think that should be SOP.

654
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,000
Now, Rotten, I think I like where you're going.

655
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,240
You're saying maybe developers could take advantage of that open source ecosystem.

656
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:56,560
Yeah, I was just saying, like, if the game developers decided to use Wine as the platform

657
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,800
instead of using something that's, you know, the Eon thing or making their own.

658
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,640
If they used Wine, they could actually be helping Wine in general.

659
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,080
So even other apps that are not gaming apps could be benefiting from the completion stuff

660
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,840
that they're fixing for their stuff on Wine.

661
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, that's kind of what I was saying.

662
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,160
Like a Photoshop or something could be at some point usable because Wine would be so

663
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:27,240
far, you know, expanded on, you know, DirectX or OpenGL or whatever.

664
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,040
So Riley, go ahead on, maybe you think they took the wrong approach, I'd like to hear

665
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
your thoughts on that.

666
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,400
Yeah, my main issue with all this is how people discovered it because they didn't, like, originally

667
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,160
say it was a wrapper and said, oh, hey, here's a bonus for it.

668
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,760
And by the way, it's going to be this amount of money, but it ran horrible and it took

669
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,120
people, like, having to, like, look at it to figure out it was a wrapper.

670
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,280
You gotta be upfront about those things at first and make the people be more accepting

671
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
about it.

672
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,120
That was the position I took on the Linux Action Show, but then I started thinking about

673
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,600
Liam's point about creating a bad reputation for Linux gaming and then I thought, you know,

674
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,400
geez, if you're putting it right there in bold letters in the description, this is a

675
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,140
wrapped game, it's almost like you're screaming attention to the fact that the games on Linux

676
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,520
are a bit of a second-class citizen in some cases.

677
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,120
So I do, as a buyer, I want the disclosure.

678
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,680
As somebody who wants to see Linux advance as a gaming platform, I'm not so sure I want

679
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,560
our games branded with their weaknesses necessarily.

680
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,720
Is that one screwed up thing or what?

681
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,240
It's the way they brand it.

682
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,720
Like if you branded it with, you know, it's a wrapped game or something like that, it

683
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
would be bad.

684
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,340
But what if you said, you know, wine enabled or powered by wine or something like that?

685
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,500
People who know what that means would recognize that, but it wouldn't have some kind of stigma

686
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
attached to it.

687
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:52,120
It would be nice if wine carried a cache that was like, powered by wine, oh wow, this game

688
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
is powered by wine.

689
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Oh, that's interesting.

690
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,560
It will probably work on my system.

691
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,400
Not powered by wine, oh crap, it's a nasty port that's just, you know, the women's version.

692
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,520
Right, it becomes a brand you almost want to be associated with.

693
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,960
And Colonel Linux, I think that's sort of what Colonel Linux is trying to get at is

694
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,040
he's, I'm not positive, but I suspect he thinks that rappers make games look like Linux was

695
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
an afterthought.

696
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,480
Well, so my thought, so here's the thing is let's not forget what wine is.

697
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,520
Wine exists so that we can run Windows software on Linux.

698
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,440
It's not, when you say something like powered by wine, it's not like it's some sort of,

699
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,880
you know, fancy game engine that was developed to give an advantage to gamers, even though,

700
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,360
like you were saying, in certain use case scenarios, that seems to be how it works out.

701
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
But the reality of it is it's a compromise.

702
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,120
It's developers use it because they don't actually want to commit to Linux and that

703
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
bothers them.

704
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Well, what about like...

705
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,160
No, that's not true.

706
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,240
Wine exactly is something that empowers Linux users to run software that wasn't written

707
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
for their platform.

708
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
It's a brilliant piece of software.

709
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
It's still a hack job, though.

710
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
It's still a hack job.

711
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,280
No, but it needs to be continued, that's why the more work we put into wine, the better

712
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
it gets.

713
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,480
And like, for example, the gaming thing, well, yeah, it's an afterthought, but it already

714
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,680
is an afterthought.

715
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,240
That's why wine makes it possible to make that afterthought a reality.

716
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,480
Yeah, and maybe you couldn't have wine be like this prestigious brand, but you might

717
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,560
be able to have a pretty good reputation, I mean, just look at DOSBox.

718
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,480
Like when you hear good old games are selling a game and it ships in DOSBox, your first

719
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,320
thought is, oh, well, I know that's probably just going to work flawlessly because DOSBox

720
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,680
just handles that for me.

721
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,480
And wine could get to that point, I think, where wine has a right, oh, it ships with

722
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
wine.

723
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,160
Well, I mean, I know that's not native, but I know because it ships with wine, it's just

724
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,600
going to work flawlessly, just like we think about DOSBox games now.

725
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,800
I'd rather have an afterthought than no thought.

726
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Go ahead.

727
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Exactly.

728
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Go ahead, Colonel.

729
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,880
And I don't disagree with...

730
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm glad.

731
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Don't get me wrong.

732
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm very happy that the wine project exists.

733
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,240
I think they do a lot of good and I think it works very, very well in a lot of cases.

734
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,160
What I'm getting at is that the mentality behind the reason wine exists is because,

735
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,640
I mean, at the end of the day, wouldn't it be better if...

736
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,920
And I'm not saying that this would happen, but wouldn't it be better if developers said,

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,320
we're going to develop for Linux because that's the open platform and that's where we see

738
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
our development.

739
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,440
And so I'm glad that wine exists, but I still feel like it's a compromise.

740
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,400
Right, I agree with you, Colonel, that that would be an amazing thing if we lived on that

741
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
planet, but we don't.

742
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,640
We live on planet Earth where developers don't see that as their primary goal.

743
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,760
Their primary goal is to get as many people buying their software as possible.

744
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,560
And if that means getting it onto people's machines via a shim, a layer that enables

745
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,800
them to do minimal effort in order to deliver it to as many people as possible, then well

746
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
done then.

747
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,760
Well, and that's how a lot of software development is done too.

748
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,940
I mean, let's look at a lot of platforms like Android, there's layers of it.

749
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,840
And I think too, I see it as a transitional thing because I think like Pope is saying,

750
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,840
we do live in the world right now where it's suicide if you only targeted Linux as a large

751
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
gaming shop.

752
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,560
It might work as an indie, but as a large gaming shop, you'd literally have to shut

753
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
the doors.

754
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,240
So you can understand their business perspective of it, but it doesn't mean that maybe that

755
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,600
will be the case in 10 years.

756
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,980
I mean, we're looking at this, we look at this in a very, maybe occasionally at a five

757
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,240
year perspective, but the reality is, is that unlike a commercial operating system like

758
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,640
Windows or Mac OS X, there is a much longer curve potential for Linux.

759
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,860
And five, 10 years could be short term for Linux desktop.

760
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,800
That could be, who knows?

761
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,300
So who knows what it's going to look like in five, 10 years, maybe it'll be the other

762
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
way around.

763
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,000
Maybe there'll be some sort of shim that people are using to run GL games on top of Windows

764
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
properly.

765
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,720
We'll just have to find out, but yeah, I don't like the precedent.

766
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,040
I don't want to set the reputation because I don't want Linux to get in the spot where

767
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,320
the Mac is right now, where the drivers aren't so hot, which is the fact that Linux drivers

768
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
are already better.

769
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
But it won't.

770
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,960
If you look at, if you look at Steam now, compared to Steam, Steam to where it was two

771
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,760
years ago, where there was Windows and Mac, right?

772
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,200
Then along came Linux and Valve made a big thing about being available on the Linux desktop.

773
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,000
And now it's pretty obvious that the whole reason for that was a stepping stone towards

774
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Steam OS.

775
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
In fact, if you look at, if you look at Steam now and you look at the categories of applications

776
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,920
available in Steam, there is Windows, Mac, and the last category is Steam OS plus Linux.

777
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:51,160
So it's quite clear that Linux is seen as a primary goal for Valve and they are pushing

778
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,280
it to developers as much as they can.

779
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,680
So I don't see OS X, Linux becoming anywhere near like OS X.

780
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
That's the difference.

781
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Yeah.

782
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Yeah.

783
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
You nailed it.

784
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
Exactly.

785
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
That's exactly it.

786
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
That's exactly how I see it too.

787
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,560
It's a much more serious platform for Valve.

788
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,720
And it's because of that long tail where, this sounds so corny, but it's literally the

789
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,400
advantage of basing your platform and product around Linux is in your, in a very real sense,

790
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,080
you get to dictate the future of your own product where when they're attached to Windows,

791
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,300
they're attached to whatever the crazy shenanigans Microsoft wants to pull off.

792
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,840
And that was just, that was long-term, it's not viable for them.

793
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
And it would make sense.

794
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,320
I mean, could you imagine?

795
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,240
If I was, if I was Gabe, man, I would be up at night worried about what's going to happen

796
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,920
to Microsoft and Windows because that's where all my money's coming from.

797
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,600
So of course I'd want to take that under my own control.

798
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,800
I think he wasn't.

799
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,000
That's why we're looking at Steam OS and Linux ports of all the games.

800
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Right.

801
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yep.

802
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, exactly.

803
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,040
And so I think that's why I'm not as worried about these kinds of shims now because I don't

804
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,840
think we're going to get stuck in Mac land for exactly the reasons Popey just said.

805
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
So that, our friends.

806
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
That's loud.

807
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,720
Woo, that's loud, woo, that's our Valve update.

808
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,640
Oh, oh, boy, did you feel that one, Matt?

809
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
Could you feel that Valve update?

810
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Oh, man.

811
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I felt that clear down here.

812
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
Well, okay.

814
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,240
So, Liam, thank you very much for joining us.

815
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,560
You, my friend, are welcome to not only stay for the rest of the show, but join us anytime.

816
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,280
I know it's a little late where you're at, but join us anytime.

817
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,340
The Mumble Room's open and we'd love to have your input.

818
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,160
And keep up the great work at Gaming on Linux and the writing for Linux Voice as well.

819
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,800
We'll have links to those Twitter feeds in the show notes if folks want to check out

820
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,440
Liam and Gaming on Linux.

821
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,000
So all right, I have a big announcement to make.

822
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,480
So everybody knows that we've been working on a show, another Linux show, How to Linux.

823
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,280
And so that is not what I'm going to talk about today.

824
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
That's very close though, too, so it's very, very close.

825
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,200
I check the site often next week, potentially, if everything goes as planned, but maybe the

826
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
week after.

827
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,320
Who knows?

828
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,800
How to Linux is very close though.

829
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,040
But I'm going to tell you about something else I'm doing.

830
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,520
Another show that has been, it's been on my mind since we canceled Jupiter at Night.

831
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,080
And Jupiter at Night, if you're not familiar, because it was a long time ago and not a lot

832
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
of people watched it.

833
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,920
One of the reasons why we canceled it.

834
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,280
It was a nightly show every night except for Fridays.

835
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,680
And man, oh man, is that a big commitment.

836
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,760
But I like the idea of it.

837
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,160
I've always liked the idea of doing a daily show.

838
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,480
And I like the idea of doing a daily tech show.

839
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,760
Because I think a lot of you guys know, especially if you've listened to the back catalog of

840
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,500
Linux Unplugged, I'm not super happy with the state of journalism, specifically in the

841
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,000
open source and Linux arenas.

842
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,200
I think it's pretty crap.

843
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,280
And I think the journalism that I do like, there's daily tech shows out there I respect

844
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,440
a lot like Tom Merritt's daily tech new show.

845
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,880
He's a really good show.

846
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,880
And he does it on his own.

847
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,840
He's funded through Patreon.

848
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,240
And I have a lot of respect for his work.

849
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:14,840
But even in that case, even in Tom's case where he has a really good show, I don't want

850
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,480
to offend people, but there's sometimes a valley bias when you're in the valley.

851
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,460
And there's a Google and Apple bias.

852
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,640
And all of these networks have tech shows, but they're looking at them from the perspective

853
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,040
of a Mac user or a Google advocate or a Windows user.

854
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,680
There's nobody that's looking at it that is thinking about things in terms of open source,

855
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
in terms of community.

856
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,500
And a lot of times, a lot of times what drives me so crazy is they'll be covering and talking

857
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,520
about a technology that's already existed in open source for years and they have no

858
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,600
idea it even exists.

859
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,240
Because it's just not on their radar.

860
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,720
And it's not giving it fair coverage.

861
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:59,680
So I was thinking about a daily show that would start next week called Tech Talk Today.

862
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,520
Monday through Thursday at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern, 7 p.m. GMT, we'll do a daily

863
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,600
show Monday through Thursday.

864
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,360
And that'll be just sort of kicking off the day, the broadcast day at J.B. one every single

865
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
day.

866
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,840
Release for download a little bit later.

867
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,200
We picked 9 a.m. because it gives you, there's sort of a lull between online streams at that

868
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
time of other morning shows.

869
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,600
It also means on the East Coast, it'll be lunchtime.

870
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,880
So people might be able to join us during their lunch break.

871
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,800
And I think we can also then get the show out in time for people's commute.

872
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,960
And it'll be 7 p.m. GMT so folks over there can maybe listen after dinner.

873
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,520
So I think that's going to be, it's really an experiment.

874
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,600
I mean, because a daily show is a lifestyle.

875
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,560
It's a huge commitment.

876
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,560
It really is.

877
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
It's crazy.

878
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,320
And what I want to do is I want to have a rotating cast of friends who join me.

879
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,120
I mean, sometimes I might just do it solo, but I want to have something where we get

880
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,340
to hear from different voices, from our hosts, from folks on Mumble.

881
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,280
And I would even love to have, yes, yes, yeah, I see you're starting to, now you see where

882
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
I was going earlier, aren't you?

883
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,280
Yeah.

884
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,080
Yes, because I was doing a little teasing on the pre-show.

885
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,520
And I know this one, this last one might be crazy, but gosh, it'd be fun to even sometimes

886
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,520
have people in studio.

887
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,880
I mean, obviously I'll have Ange and Chase in studio from time to time and those kinds

888
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
of things.

889
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,240
And, you know, obviously could call Matt on Skype.

890
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,080
So we'll do all our regulars.

891
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,400
I'd love to have some folks in studio.

892
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,880
And it's going to be, because it is daily, it's going to kind of allow for the show to

893
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,160
meander a bit.

894
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,400
And I want to kind of underscore something.

895
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,880
It's not going to be just the tech news headlines.

896
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,320
I mean, it's going to, a lot of times it'll be a topic and discussion derived from the

897
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,420
tech news of the day, looked at through the perspective of a Linux and open source user.

898
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,860
And not like it's going to be heavily biased in one direction, but it's going to at least

899
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,280
that perspective will at least be considered when these topics are discussed.

900
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,760
And I think sometimes that can provide a special kind of insight that gets missed in the daily

901
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,760
analysis.

902
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,600
So the show is going to be able to do that on a day to day basis.

903
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,320
I'm going to be honest with you guys though.

904
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,320
This is going to be my show.

905
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,320
Okay.

906
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,360
This is just going to be something I'm doing.

907
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,680
And sometimes when there's not a lot going on, I might talk about barbecue.

908
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,920
I mean, really, this is going to be, when you're doing a daily show, huh?

909
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Yum.

910
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah.

911
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
I know, right?

912
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Yeah.

913
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
I mean, that might be okay.

914
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Right.

915
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,120
I don't know if all the details totally worked out yet because you know, like one of the

916
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,480
things we're considering doing is maybe having a, I don't know, it might not be, well, I

917
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,760
don't know if it's going to be video yet.

918
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,080
I'm still working that out because we can do a lot quicker turnaround if it's audio only,

919
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,440
but I have a feeling we'll do video so that way we can put it up on YouTube and stuff

920
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
like that.

921
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,040
So it'll probably be video and audio.

922
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,040
It'll be audio focused though so that way we can do quick turnaround.

923
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,820
The daily format, you know, what I kind of am envisioning is we're going to do a discussion.

924
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,560
We'll have at the beginning talk about one or two big topics.

925
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,520
Essentially, instead of hitting you with all the stupid crap, we'll just talk about the

926
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,840
one or two stories that actually matter that day, have a little discussion around them,

927
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,280
and then take mumble, feedback, and calls towards the latter half of the show.

928
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,840
I've also got some plans I'll talk more about in the show for the days I can't make it so

929
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,080
that we will still have a broadcast.

930
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:10,280
I've got something kind of fun planned there that I, that longtime fans might recognize

931
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,320
that I've wanted to do for a while too.

932
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,800
So we've even got kind of a good filler for the days where maybe for some reason I can't

933
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,240
actually get in the studio and do a show that morning because, man, 9 a.m. is early.

934
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,640
I mean, let's just be honest.

935
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,520
I was actually, the first time I thought about it, I was like, should I do it at 6 a.m.?

936
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Nope, nope.

937
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Take that right off the table.

938
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
I can't do it at 6 a.m.

939
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,840
So here's kind of the second big shoe that drops on this.

940
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,440
There's going to be advertising maybe.

941
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,520
I'm thinking about maybe doing, I don't know, it depends on if advertisers are interested.

942
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,280
I was also considering making a community spot where maybe we could do a discounted

943
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,280
community ad for something going on out there or a distribution.

944
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,280
I don't know.

945
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
I don't know.

946
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,680
It will depend on sponsor interest because one of the other things I think I want to

947
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,080
do is I think I'm going to make this a Patreon funded show.

948
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,280
And it's more than just about the show on Patreon.

949
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,080
And we might base the funding on a certain level.

950
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
There won't be any sponsorship.

951
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,160
It will be ad free.

952
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,640
But what I want to do is I want to create a funding source for the network.

953
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,200
So essentially this Patreon that I'll be setting up will be a general fund that the revenue

954
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,660
from that fund will go into the JB1 Studio, upgrades, facility upgrades, hardware.

955
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,940
And it'll be a way for the community to use Patreon to fund the Jupiter Broadcasting Network,

956
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:33,240
help our growth because we are, you know, we have exceedingly new, higher new expenses.

957
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,920
I mean just from where we went from moving to JB1, recording out of my house to a dedicated

958
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,480
townhouse with staff and new equipment.

959
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,120
I mean it's just our expenses are beyond what they've ever been.

960
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,240
We knew that would happen.

961
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,840
But the question I have to ask myself is do I want to press more on the advertising side

962
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,000
or do I want to experiment with Patreon because like I said this show itself is a grand experiment.

963
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I mean a daily show.

964
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I don't know.

965
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Can I do it?

966
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,120
Can I fund future developments of the network through a Patreon model and as a thank you

967
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,920
we create a daily show and we create an exclusive club of folks who are supporting us through

968
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,520
Patreon and we'll set milestones up so you'll know what things we bring into the studio,

969
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,700
what the different milestones get us and I also want to see if we can do things like

970
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,360
potentially get the funding to a level where I could finally go on the road and do a road

971
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
show.

972
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,740
I've been talking about taking shows on the road for over a year now.

973
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:30,280
The problem is we need a good financial position to be able to stand on and right now I'm really

974
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,240
comfortable with our advertising model because we have a very small select of advertisers

975
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:41,000
that we genuinely all of the hosts really love and we're happy to talk about and I feel

976
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,960
like right now we have a good balance between content and ads and I don't, I'm not totally

977
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,800
opposed to adding more ads, adding more ads, but I think maybe the better route to go is

978
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,320
through the Patreon system because it has been a smashing success for Unfiltered.

979
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,800
People have switched over to love it because the financing is right up in front and center.

980
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,600
You know, just like a Kickstarter project.

981
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,600
It's right there.

982
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
You can see where we're at.

983
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,600
You see what our milestones are.

984
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,840
You see once we reach each milestone, what we get.

985
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,000
There's a content distribution system built in just for folks who are patrons so we can

986
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,720
have exclusive content through this portal for them.

987
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,720
It's a really cool system.

988
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,360
If you want to see it, how we do it for Unfiltered, just go to patreon.com slash Unfiltered and

989
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,820
right now through Patreon, let me see, you know, I'll pull it up on the screen right

990
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,320
now because I think we're over $2,000 now getting raised on Patreon for Unfiltered,

991
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,360
which to me, this is a huge, cause you know, this is, this is going to fundamentally change

992
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,800
independent media production because it really makes the show accountable to the audience.

993
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,960
When you have a crowdfunded show like this, it's no longer picking the content that gets

994
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,720
the most clicks that then generates the highest numbers for advertisers.

995
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,400
It's about generating content that makes that 181 people happy.

996
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,840
Think about the difference in content creation when you're trying to make 181 people happy

997
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,000
versus as many fricking clicks as you can get so that way you can charge advertisers.

998
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,340
That changes the fundamental recipe of a show and I want to apply that to a daily show where

999
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,440
we talk about tech, we talk about news from a Linux and open source perspective and that

1000
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,360
money is used to fund the future growth of Jupiter Broadcasting.

1001
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,000
I don't know if it's possible, like I said, it's an experiment and I want to start it

1002
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
on Monday.

1003
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,040
So that's really soon cause you know, it's something we've been thinking about for a

1004
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,760
long time but to actually pull the trigger on a daily show like that, I don't know if

1005
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,240
I can do it but I'm going to give it a go.

1006
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
I am excited about it.

1007
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Yeah.

1008
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,560
How long would this show be?

1009
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,240
About 15 to 30 minutes depending on the topic of the day.

1010
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,080
And would it be only working weekday or weekends as well?

1011
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Monday through Thursday.

1012
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,080
Ah, so the American definition of the day.

1013
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Well I hate working on it.

1014
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
The daily show.

1015
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
The daily show definition.

1016
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,040
Essentially what it is cause Fridays are all packed with like behind the scenes business

1017
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,960
stuff that I need to be off air for, you know, like phone calls and emails and stuff like

1018
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
that.

1019
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,480
I have to say this is the first I've heard of it and it sounds brilliant.

1020
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Thank you.

1021
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Yeah.

1022
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,480
Well I wanted to invite you on the Monday show as my co-host.

1023
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,240
Oh, oh hang on.

1024
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
I know, I know.

1025
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,240
I'm just bringing it to you on you on the air but that was my attention cause I want

1026
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,320
to, you know, we have great discussions in the mumble room and, and, and you'll be one

1027
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:22,240
of many that I want to pull in and just have a one off really casual, I mean this show

1028
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,480
is going to be extremely low key.

1029
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,640
It's something that you'll be able to pop in.

1030
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,420
You're not going to get hit in the face too hard.

1031
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,920
It's going to like, if you had a long day, you can drive home to it.

1032
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,000
If you're getting ready in the morning, you can listen to it.

1033
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,660
It's not actually, to be honest, it might be a tad offensive sometimes cause I was thinking

1034
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,880
about just being brutally honest about stuff, not holding anything back.

1035
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
But like, uh.

1036
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
I'd prefer it.

1037
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
I think that'd be the way to go.

1038
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

1039
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
You know.

1040
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Yeah.

1041
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,360
Like being more relaxed and just shooting the breeze, but being very tight and having

1042
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
a focus.

1043
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,360
I like the sound of that.

1044
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
Yeah.

1045
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,080
And it's also, it's going to be a great way for folks who like, you guys know, we have

1046
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,640
a bunch of shows on the network, but you know, you don't always have time to listen to every

1047
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,640
single one.

1048
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,840
So in a sense, it'll be a network show too, where I can say, Hey, you know, this week

1049
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,520
on BSD now, they interviewed one of the co-founders and co-creators of ZFS.

1050
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,520
So if you're interested in ZFS, you might want to tune in this week's like we can give

1051
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,640
mentions to that kind of stuff.

1052
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,240
So people who will have essentially a master Jupiter broadcasting feed to get updated on

1053
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,640
that kind of stuff.

1054
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,200
So I'm, I don't know.

1055
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,160
I mean, I told myself when I stopped doing Jupiter at night, if I ever started doing

1056
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,000
a daily show again, I'd have to like really commit to it.

1057
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,960
So we're calling it tech talk today, tech talk today, TTT.

1058
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,600
And I've already registered tech talk dot today.

1059
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,320
So I mean, that seems like a done deal because I got dot today.

1060
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,040
It's like, okay, that's the name.

1061
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
Dot today.

1062
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,040
Yeah.

1063
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Yeah.

1064
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,040
So anyways.

1065
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
Yeah.

1066
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,040
Hmm.

1067
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Marinade on that poppy.

1068
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,840
I'd love to have you join me and we'll set up times with folks in the mumble room and

1069
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,360
you guys can come on there at Colonel Linux.

1070
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,480
I'm looking at you as potentially another one and get Ick on there as well and rotten.

1071
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,600
And now of course, I'll, you know, a bunch of people, it's just as, as time goes on and

1072
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,360
we have good conversations in the mumble room, I might pull people aside and say, Hey, do

1073
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360
you have some time?

1074
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,500
The other thing that's cool about it is, uh, we might like, you know, like Liam right now,

1075
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
it's late where he's at.

1076
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,640
Like I could maybe do something with him earlier in the day to help people across the pond

1077
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,000
who are staying up really late to chat with us at a two PM on a Pacific at Pacific time.

1078
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,600
So I think it's going to give us an opportunity to also pull in folks from the other side

1079
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,040
to get another perspective on things.

1080
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,760
I'm looking really forward to that.

1081
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,560
Maybe get a few accents on the air from time to time instead of just my droll.

1082
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,480
I will warn you though, there's the times where I'd, you know, it's a daily show.

1083
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,000
I'd maybe just didn't have time to line somebody up.

1084
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,760
It might just be me complaining about something.

1085
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Yeah.

1086
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
If you can't have poppy, I'll do his accent for you.

1087
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
Okay.

1088
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,400
As long as, as long as we can get a day of trying to get to Southern accents.

1089
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah.

1090
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,200
Or we could do Southern accents too.

1091
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,600
So I wouldn't, um, every day show be overwhelming and people will just stop watching it because

1092
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,040
it's every day and then just can't wash it.

1093
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Yeah.

1094
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,040
No.

1095
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,720
I mean, that's going to happen for some people, but then for some people they won't be able

1096
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,720
to get enough.

1097
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,600
I think, I think it might be cool because he's talking about keeping it at, I don't

1098
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,360
think it'll be a problem because it's literally like you're doing it while you're washing

1099
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
dishes or something.

1100
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,080
I mean, it's really not a big time commitment.

1101
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
Yeah.

1102
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,080
So I don't think that'll be a problem.

1103
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,080
Yeah.

1104
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,080
You got another 20 minutes in your commute.

1105
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,960
You can round off your, your podcast listening with this show.

1106
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,440
I frequently find myself a loss to find, you know, interesting content to listen to.

1107
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,600
I'm not saying we'll fit that gap, but I hope it does.

1108
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,320
Actually that's literally what my goal with the show is just to have an interesting show

1109
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
every day.

1110
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,800
And there'll be some days where it's very tech focused, very Linux focused, and there'll

1111
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,920
be some days where maybe it's, you know, a little off the beaten path.

1112
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,920
But I think that's, what's kind of fun is to have a show where we have a little room

1113
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,480
to do that and see what comes of it and see who we meet in the community and all kinds

1114
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
of things.

1115
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,400
So I'm kind of looking forward to it.

1116
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,400
So it'll start on Monday.

1117
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,280
If I get all my ass together, which I better now that I've said something on the air tech

1118
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,340
talk today, starting next Monday, let's see.

1119
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:03,800
So if we're recording this on the 27th, that means June 2nd, first Monday of June.

1120
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,480
I'd love to have you guys join us live because I'm going to try to have the mumble room open

1121
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
too.

1122
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,560
So we can get a little bit of a morning call in effect going where I'll maybe set up a

1123
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,200
topic and then you guys can kick it around with me.

1124
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Cool.

1125
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Yeah.

1126
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
And eventually we'll go to 24-7 coverage.

1127
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
No.

1128
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
No.

1129
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
We'll see how far we get.

1130
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,440
Breaking news.

1131
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,080
I think I would be very happy and very proud if we could find a really cool way to fund

1132
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,680
the network, give you guys a new show, make something that's truly independent media while

1133
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
doing it.

1134
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,240
I mean, I'm loving the potential of it and I know Patreon is a new thing.

1135
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,360
It's going to be a new system.

1136
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,280
Some people have to go create accounts.

1137
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
Trust me.

1138
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
I've been doing it for a few months now.

1139
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
It's a really good system.

1140
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
I'm really excited.

1141
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:53,200
So join me on Monday, tech talk today live, 9 a.m. Pacific, 12 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m. GMT.

1142
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,880
Let's see how it goes and give it some time because it's going to be a new show.

1143
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,520
We'll see.

1144
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
But I want to hear your feedback too.

1145
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,680
And I'll set up email addresses and all that kind of stuff soon as well.

1146
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,680
All right.

1147
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,280
Well, that's all I had for this week on the Linux Unplugged show.

1148
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,160
Some announcements, some discussion, pretty good show overall.

1149
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,360
And we have some really good interviews coming up on both Unplugged and LAS.

1150
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,240
If all the timing works out, I'll talk about it a little bit in the post show just so that

1151
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,000
way I don't commit anybody to something they can't make on air.

1152
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,400
But join us on Sunday for a really good interview about an up and coming distribution that a

1153
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,240
few of you have written in about and asked about and we're going to talk with the developers

1154
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,840
and we'll have a follow-up interview of it.

1155
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
All the timing works out.

1156
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,480
We're still trying to get it scheduled in Tuesday's Unplugged.

1157
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,840
So we've got a couple of back-to-back interviews that I think you guys will particularly find

1158
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
fascinating.

1159
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
So join us for that.

1160
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,080
If you don't know, you can hang out live in our virtual lug or in our chat room over jblive.tv

1161
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,520
on Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1162
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,320
Just go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where we have robots and in the background

1163
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:58,640
they look it up on Wolfram Alpha and then they modify the HTML code in real time and

1164
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,800
post it on that Jupiter Broadcasting calendar site for you automatically.

1165
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,200
So you might as well go over there and take advantage of that because why else am I paying

1166
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,880
all that money for those robots?

1167
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,800
So jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get the show time in your local time zone

1168
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,440
and then you can always join us live for the Linux action show on Sunday at 10 a.m. Pacific.

1169
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,600
And don't forget we want your feedback.

1170
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,720
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

1171
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,120
Choose Linux Unplugged from the drop down.

1172
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,680
I know, I know.

1173
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,680
It's crazy.

1174
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
Send us your feedback.

1175
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,240
We'll read it on a future episode.

1176
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,760
Also hit up the subreddit linuxactionshow.reddit.com to integrate your links and feedback directly

1177
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,760
into the community.

1178
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,760
It's like the pork.

1179
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,760
All right, Matt.

1180
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,400
Well, I'll see you on Sunday for a good Linux action show, okay?

1181
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,400
All right.

1182
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
See you Sunday.

1183
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,400
All right, everyone.

1184
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,280
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1185
01:01:43,280 --> 01:02:10,400
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
