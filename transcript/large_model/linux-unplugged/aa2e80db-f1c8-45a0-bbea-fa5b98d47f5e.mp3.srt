1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Are you tired of your Raspberry Pi sounding like this?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,760
Well, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has got some good news for you.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,520
It seems like the thermal performance on the old Pi Fourski is way better these days.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,560
Yeah, they've got a great blog post detailing it with some really neat thermal imaging images

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,120
out there, so you can go take a look and see just where the hotspots are.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,020
And how they tested it, and what you could do to test it yourself.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,120
One thing I found humorous though is at the very end, despite all the great improvements

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,560
that the recent firmware updates have indeed provided, their best recommendation is still

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,360
to just turn the Raspberry Pi 4 on its side.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
You're stacking it wrong.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:48,980
Well, hello friends, and welcome in to the Unplugged program.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,220
This is episode 330.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,220
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,220
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,220
Almost forgot the number.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,220
There's too many.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,220
Too many to count.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,220
It's a lot of numbers, Wes.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,220
Hello to Cheese and Alex too, hey gentlemen.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,220
Hello, hello.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Hello.

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,220
Well, hello.

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,220
We have a really fun show.

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm excited to be joined by not just you, but also our virtual lug, time appropriate

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
greetings Mumble Room.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Hello.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Hello, hello.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Hello, hello.

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Hi there.

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Mumble Overload.

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
That's right.

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,540
Happy Linux Tuesday.

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,760
Happy Linux Tuesday to you too, Jill.

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,760
And Ace Nomad, Byte, Cassidy, Dan, DM, and I'm going to say Jensen Gruck.

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Wow.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay, so we have a lot coming up in the show today.

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,760
We have some community news, but this episode is the one we've been waiting to do all year.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,800
We get to celebrate Linux as an implementation detail with the family.

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
That's right.

40
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,120
I mean, we already know Linux is everywhere, but it can be a few more places, especially

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
in your family's home.

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,480
Now, if you're like me or Wes or Cheesy or Alex or pretty much anyone in the virtual

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,480
world, like you've likely got a small board computer of some type or you've thought about

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,200
getting one, well, how cool would it be if you could make some great holiday gifts out

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
of these suckers?

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,540
So we're going to talk about ways to do that, but also just some really good projects.

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,880
If you want to set up backup for yourself this year, if you want to build some mini

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,300
projects for people yourself or maybe strangers, there's a lot of good ideas in here.

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,520
This is basically all the things we love and what we're doing with them for the holidays.

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,780
Really some great projects we're going to get to.

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,640
Now, Mr. Payne, some really, really good news for the backers of the Librem 5 this week.

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:37,040
It seems that backers have begun receiving their Linux phones, some mostly working, but

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,080
exciting nonetheless to see this.

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,360
And we all expected when people actually started receiving their devices, it would be all over

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
the internet.

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
And it has.

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Of course.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I mean, who wouldn't be excited?

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah.

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
And these are geeks, right?

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
That are passionate about the mission.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
They want to process it and it's here and it's great.

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,400
And it mostly works.

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,320
For the most part, things are exactly what you would expect, a little rough around the

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,080
edges or completely rough around the edges.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Stability issues have been mentioned.

67
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,960
Charging issues doesn't charge when the device is powered up, essentially is a current problem.

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,360
And battery only lasts about an hour.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,660
But there is in almost all of these reviews being posted, a thread of what seems to be

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,520
genuine potential, like they see the potential here.

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,960
These people are not, they're not ripping it up.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
They're just setting expectations, I think.

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Right.

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,880
I mean, you have to view this as a work in progress and experiment, right?

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,000
When you're on the cutting edge of freezing open source hardware.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
You can't initiate a call.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,800
You can receive a call, I believe.

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,920
But I think there's something working where like they can't hear you, like the audio isn't

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
routing properly or something to that effect.

81
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,640
And of course, the phone app tends to crash.

82
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,140
It does seem like it's a pretty nice web browser.

83
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,160
And while it is thicker than most phones, so far, the reviewers seem to think that it's

84
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,920
actually quite comfortable to hold.

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,320
You can get around the actual Linux underpinnings, too.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,500
So if you know really what you want is a Linux box, I mean, it's there for that.

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,980
Pretty neat to see people receiving them.

88
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,480
It's early, early, early, like some of these are not fully functional.

89
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,920
Some of them are very much prototypes.

90
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,120
They seem to vary a lot in quality, more than I think we were led to believe.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,980
But it is nice to see it out there, and kind of along the same lines, while we're talking

92
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,820
about these phones, there's an early look at the PinePhone Developer Edition, which

93
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,320
is the one that I preordered.

94
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,860
Yeah, Lucas, who we've had on the show recently, did a video, which we'll have linked.

95
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,920
It's posted as well over at OMG Ubuntu.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,140
And I mean, you're only getting like a 10-minute look at this thing, so it's pretty hard to

97
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,080
really come away with a firm opinion.

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,380
But it feels a lot further along, and I think a big part of that is they're leveraging an

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,940
existing software stack.

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Yes.

101
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
Right.

102
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,140
I mean, from a purism perspective, there's a lot of stuff that needs to get invented,

103
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,860
and a lot of work they've done is things that aren't at that fit and finish layer, at least

104
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,900
not yet.

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,900
And something that I only recently come to appreciate, thanks to Cheese's conversations

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,320
with Pine, is that they have some genuine experience with smaller systems based around

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
these components.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,220
And the Popcorn Hour is a shipping commercial product that exists today and has existed

109
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
for a very long time.

110
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Right.

111
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,020
And that seems to be a lot of the challenges here, right?

112
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,340
It's a unique space with its own constraints and a lot of difficulty getting the right

113
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
components.

114
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Good video, though.

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,780
So we'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to see the status of the PinePhone.

116
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,260
For those that are still waiting, which I don't know if I consider myself anymore, but

117
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,340
for those of you that are still waiting for that free Linux phone, it's getting closer.

118
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
It's getting closer.

119
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,540
Yeah, really, wherever we're at, it's exciting to see progress.

120
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,020
And for all the folks that are interested in it, we're getting closer.

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,380
What'll be the threshold for you?

122
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,340
So you've got a Pixel 3, right?

123
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,380
Yeah, Pixel 3.

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
Pretty nice phone.

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
Yes.

126
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Pretty good camera.

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm honestly using my phone more and more as an appliance, so I think that angle is

128
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,260
a little easier to replace.

129
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,700
I need a few apps, mostly for work.

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,940
The camera's the kicker for me, though, because I just love having a decent camera in my pocket

131
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
all day long.

132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,820
Yeah, the camera's really good, too, on the Pixel line.

133
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,420
I wouldn't mind having a little full Linux device in my pocket, though, maybe not for

134
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,060
using as a traditional phone, but just for sitting on the couch or carrying with me as

135
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,500
a mobile workstation.

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,420
Would it be more appealing if it was a foldable device with an actual physical QWERTY keyboard?

137
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Yeah, probably.

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I know.

139
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Isn't that funny?

140
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
We've already built these.

141
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,820
You know that they're actually working on a keyboard for the PinePhone 2.

142
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Oh, buddy.

143
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Oh, buddy.

144
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
See, that's what I'm talking about.

145
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
They get me.

146
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
They get me.

147
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
All right.

148
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,420
Well, thanks if you guys want to read more about that, but we have some big news to talk

149
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
about.

150
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,020
A brand shiny, fancy, fantastic release of elementary OS.

151
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,900
Elementary OS 5.1, Cassidy and Dan, congratulations on the new release, gentlemen.

152
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Thank you.

153
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Thank you.

154
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,600
I have been kicking the tires on this one for the weekend, and I am so impressed with

155
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
what you guys have accomplished with this release.

156
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,700
You are truly crossing that uncanny valley that we have struggled to really fully cross

157
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,420
for so long with desktop Linux.

158
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,460
And now in some areas, I think you guys are exceeding the quality of experience that you

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,640
get on commercial platforms in multiple categories now.

160
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,300
So that's like a huge achievement on its own.

161
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,420
And there is so much in this release that I guess I'll start with you, Dan.

162
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,220
Why is this a.1 release?

163
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,060
This seems like this should be like 5.5, 5.8, maybe even 6.

164
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,980
Like there is new login screens.

165
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,240
There's a new greeter that's the best greeter.

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,220
The new onboarding app is the best onboarding app on any desktop.

167
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Incredible.

168
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
It's so good.

169
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
It's nice, clean.

170
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,700
The only thing I would add is maybe like a little boutique style couple of apps.

171
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,020
But other than that, it's so perfect.

172
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,100
The Flatpak integration, you nailed it.

173
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
It's great.

174
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,060
I love the dialogues I get when I'm installing Flatpaks.

175
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,220
So why is this not just a whole new version?

176
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,700
So Dan's internet is actually dropping out.

177
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,180
So it's just me right now.

178
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,300
Cassidy, answer why is this just not a whole new version?

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,080
So the big thing is that it's still based on the same solid core of Juno, which means

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,360
it's Ubuntu 18.04 LTS based with the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories under the hood.

181
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,540
So it didn't feel right to say that it's a whole new like 6.0 version.

182
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,220
But at the same time, we wanted to like give it a new name and point release because there

183
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,460
is just so much new stuff in this release.

184
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,140
There's also, if I'm understanding correctly, all of the hardware enablement stuff from

185
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,700
the underlying 18.04 updates that have come along.

186
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Exactly.

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,540
So it's basically the same core as Ubuntu 18.04.3 with Linux 5.

188
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,060
Whatever the latest is and all the hardware enablement stuff that comes along with that.

189
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,580
That's thanks to Canonical for all that awesome work.

190
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,420
And that's why we enjoy building off the LTS because we get this really solid foundational

191
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,620
platform, but we can have a more rolling release style on top of it.

192
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Right.

193
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,020
You know, things aren't going to change out from under you.

194
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Exactly.

195
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,140
This is starting to address what my experience as somebody who's just a Linux desktop enthusiast

196
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,580
and just enjoys all the different new things that are constantly being developed.

197
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,980
My experience with elementary in the past had been it's sort of a tease.

198
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,940
Like I see all these other great things like do not disturb mode and night color shifting

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,940
coming to other desktops.

200
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,460
And I think, oh, man, I really would love to have this on elementary.

201
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,100
In the past, I would have waited quite a bit longer.

202
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,900
But now these things are coming at a much faster clip.

203
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,340
And when they do land, they're like the best implementation period.

204
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,580
The recent, do you call it night light?

205
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,660
The recent tone shifting that people can turn on for nighttime color?

206
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Yeah.

207
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Night light.

208
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Yeah.

209
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,300
So it's just a great implementation where once you turn it on, there's a little icon

210
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,460
up in the beautiful toolbar that I don't know what you call that, the pantheon, that top

211
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
bar.

212
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,460
Top panel.

213
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
Top panel.

214
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,460
It's gorgeous.

215
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,460
Up there, a little sun icon shows up.

216
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
And you can click that.

217
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,540
And you can snooze it with one button.

218
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,100
There's a couple of quick options.

219
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,740
It's so slick.

220
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,540
It's so well done that when these features do land, they seem to be one of the best implementations

221
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,540
of them.

222
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Right.

223
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,580
It's like a microcosm maybe of the whole philosophy of elementary.

224
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,900
So what has been the enabler that's meant that, I feel like this is maybe the third

225
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,340
time we've had a version of this conversation with this release, like they're landing faster

226
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,780
and they're landing in the current releases.

227
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,900
What's been the big shift that's happened?

228
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,020
Is it a philosophical thing?

229
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,420
Is it a resources thing?

230
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,220
I think it's partially philosophical.

231
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,540
We've kind of always had this mentality, but I think we've really kind of hit our stride

232
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,620
with it now where we don't hold back features from the current release.

233
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,820
As much and often as we can, we push out updates to the current release.

234
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,420
It adds features, improves features.

235
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,920
Maybe even redesigns entire apps or parts of the settings because it gives our users

236
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
a better experience.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,260
So it's more of that rolling release mentality.

238
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,960
And we've had that for the last few releases, but what's enabled it for us now is that we

239
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,040
have so much automation going into our release process that it means somebody can report

240
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,900
a bug or somebody can design a new feature and then the next day that can be hitting

241
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
users.

242
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,460
So it's so fast now and it's really, really great.

243
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Wow.

244
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,220
And that has come online between the previous release and this release?

245
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Yeah.

246
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,260
So that's been a lot of our work over the last month or two probably for kind of preparing

247
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,620
for this 5.1 release to help enable that.

248
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,780
And so it's automating the app releases and automating the ISO building and that all kind

249
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,060
of came together for 5.1.

250
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,580
It's got to feel like almost a new superpower.

251
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
You've been upgraded.

252
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Yeah.

253
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
It's so awesome.

254
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,180
It's really just in the last couple of weeks we've been seeing like literally somebody

255
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,040
will report a bug and then it gets approved and merged and fixed and out the next day

256
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,100
and it's like, oh, that feels so good.

257
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,360
That's where software should be.

258
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,280
It's more continuous instead of waiting.

259
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,660
In some cases, in some operating systems, you'd be waiting months for that update.

260
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Sure.

261
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Yeah.

262
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,140
I think too, the overall experience I get is I use that uncanny valley analogy.

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:14,340
It's like there's so many little areas that have been smoothed out that make it a more

264
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,780
comprehensive product.

265
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,500
I really, really like Pantheon.

266
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,220
It is at first, not everything is super obvious, but it is pretty easy to discover.

267
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,300
Like if you hit the super key, a menu comes up and it's very clear on what you can do.

268
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,080
And within minutes I was, oh, so this is how I do multiple desktops.

269
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,960
This is how I move stuff around and it's slick, it's smooth.

270
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,460
Why is Pantheon so much smoother than some other projects that are based around similar

271
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
technologies?

272
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
What is it in there?

273
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,080
Is it the way you guys are hitting the GPU?

274
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,780
Is it magic?

275
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,980
I mean, maybe a little bit of magic, but no, I think we've been working at like a decade

276
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:03,100
now on UX focused development and all of our features are UX first.

277
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,200
We don't think about, oh, here's a new technology.

278
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,460
Now let's find a way to implement it in the UI.

279
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,800
We think what do we actually want the UI to do and how do we want it to feel and work

280
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
for the user?

281
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,940
And then we build the technology to support that.

282
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,340
So I think that's a big part of it.

283
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,660
I mean, honestly, another big part is that we are building off of really solid technologies.

284
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,000
A lot of stuff that's enabled from the gnome upstream projects.

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,400
So we're not using gnome shell, but we're using Mudder, which is the window manager.

286
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,500
So improvements there trickle down into elementary OS.

287
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,820
So we have these really solid technologies and can kind of mold them and shape them how

288
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,780
we want to create our own experience.

289
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
I see.

290
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
So that's great.

291
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,700
I didn't quite appreciate that upstream Mudder improvements benefited the Pantheon desktop

292
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,300
and that kind of maybe explained some of the performance improvements that I'm noticing.

293
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Okay.

294
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,340
So now I have a couple of questions for you that are more like, why aren't you doing this

295
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
questions?

296
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,140
You're sort of one of the leading voices of a desktop standard, like a free desktop standard

297
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
dark mode.

298
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,420
I note though that dark mode is notably absent from elementary 5.1.

299
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes, it's not perfect yet.

300
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,540
So we're doing a lot of work under the hood and behind the scenes and working with other

301
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,100
projects to help standardize this.

302
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,340
But it actually hasn't been standardized yet in GTK or a free desktop spec yet.

303
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,200
So while we could just throw in like a hammer to smash dark mode onto your desktop, it still

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,360
can cause breakage in certain areas.

305
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,620
So we don't feel comfortable enabling that because it's not as good of an experience

306
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,180
as it can be, but we are definitely working in that direction.

307
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
That makes sense.

308
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,580
I mean, it kind of hits on what you're talking about earlier, right?

309
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,700
Other distributions might not make that choice, but that's the way you guys are doing things.

310
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah.

311
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,340
It's part of the philosophical difference I think of elementary OS compared to other

312
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,580
projects is we really, really, really, and not to say other desktops don't care about

313
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,660
the UX, but we were kind of fanatical about it.

314
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,060
And so we'll be willing to not ship a feature early so that we can get it right and then

315
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
ship it to users when it feels really good.

316
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Yeah.

317
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,900
I mean, and at this point where we're sitting, I mean, that's clearly working.

318
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,420
You can't argue with like early on as I don't know, guys, who are you to decide?

319
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,300
But now I'm like, oh yeah, they've got this figured out.

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Okay.

321
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,620
So the second question is, and this kind of plays off what you were saying earlier about

322
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,420
how you don't just go and build something once the underlying tech is there.

323
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,700
I was surprised I installed one of the flat packs I decided to sideload just to experiment

324
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:39,120
with this flat pack and support was Nome firmware, which installs, but then complains excessively

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,180
that there's no LVFS support on the system, but that doesn't come from Ubuntu automatically.

326
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,780
Is there plans down the road to integrate that into app center?

327
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,460
Have you guys looked at LVFS firmware updates for like laptops and whatnot?

328
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,460
Yeah.

329
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,100
So that's a feature that we've looked at.

330
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I've prototyped some stuff actually related to that.

331
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,780
I think we plan to support FWEPT, you know, the firmware update Daemon and LVFS.

332
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,940
It's just, we haven't built that out quite yet.

333
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,720
There's still, I think, an open question too of do firmware updates belong in your app

334
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,080
store or in your system settings?

335
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,580
And so we kind of have to figure out what we want that experience to actually feel like

336
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,940
and look like before we start building it.

337
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Yeah, that makes sense.

338
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Yeah.

339
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,060
So the firmware is good, but I don't know if the display and the way it gives out information

340
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,460
is really up to standard.

341
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
Yeah.

342
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,700
And it feels pretty Nomi, which Nome and elementary, we share a lot of technologies, but we have

343
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,300
different human interface guidelines and styles.

344
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,220
So it feels a little weird to shove a Nome thing into elementary or an elementary thing

345
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,500
into Nome.

346
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,740
So I think, I mean, right today you can do it from the command line.

347
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,060
You can install FWEPT and use it from the command line.

348
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,820
Obviously that's not the best experience.

349
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,740
So we're looking at how we want to integrate it into the desktop itself.

350
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
But there's a means.

351
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,140
Should somebody need to, you know, update a thing bad or something like that that they've

352
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
recently got?

353
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Yeah.

354
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,780
I've got a Dell precision and I've run my updates from that and a eight bit dough controller

355
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,040
and gotten updates for that, my watch tech keyboard and stuff.

356
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,980
So it's, it's definitely there and working.

357
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,340
We just got to integrate it into the UI.

358
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,900
There's just a one other thing I thought we should touch on because you guys do such a

359
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
great job at it.

360
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,800
But I, I didn't really know when this started happening, but I definitely noticed it because

361
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,420
of the new onboarding process that in the background, elementary OS is doing a bit of

362
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,260
housekeeping and keeping temp files clean and logs.

363
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,900
Like it's, is that, is that a newish feature?

364
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Cause that seems pretty cool.

365
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah.

366
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,580
I think that launched with Juno with 5.0, but a lot of people didn't know about it.

367
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,700
And that's, that's a big reason.

368
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Onboarding is really nice.

369
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,100
We've had people tweeting at us like in the past couple of weeks leading up to 5.1 about

370
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,460
things are like, Oh, I got this new 5.1 feature.

371
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,580
It's like, well, it's actually been in elementary OS for a while, but now that you have onboarding,

372
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,020
you can say, Oh, a nightlight's a cool feature that I didn't know about or, you know, housekeeping

373
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,340
to clean up that stuff.

374
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,240
So I think that's been there since 5.0 and it's enabled by the gnome settings daemon,

375
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,900
but it's just, we've found a way to better expose it to users.

376
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,040
It makes all the difference.

377
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,640
And that's, what's so good about that new onboarding thing is you get, you expose really

378
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,340
good features in a totally non-obnoxious way.

379
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,660
So I really appreciate that.

380
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,620
But the one last thing I wanted to touch on is because I think you guys are doing kind

381
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,880
of a special job at this is constant iteration and improvements on accessibility features.

382
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,140
It's not something I personally follow, but I know that it matters a lot to certain people.

383
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,980
And I know there's been some improvements in 5.1 in that regard.

384
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Yeah.

385
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,640
So actually I recently gave a talk at the Linux app summit about this.

386
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,740
Our philosophy, we kind of shifted our philosophy in the last year or two that accessibility

387
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,740
features are just features rather than kind of putting these features away in a little

388
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,840
closet called universal access where only people who, you know, have severe physical

389
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,660
disabilities find them.

390
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,940
We've decided that it's better and it's, features get better tested and more well supported

391
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,140
if we actually just support them as a standard feature of the operating system and more people

392
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,540
who might not think they need an accessibility feature actually end up using and benefiting

393
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
from these.

394
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,420
So that's been the focus.

395
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,960
A lot of that has been in system settings.

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,500
So things like text scaling, instead of being under an accessibility setting, it's just

397
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,860
in the desktop settings now.

398
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Yeah.

399
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,740
I think that's a brilliant outlook on it because I'm one of those people, right?

400
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,060
And it fits with the sort of Linux world, right?

401
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,360
We want to be able to tinker with and modify these things.

402
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,260
I really liked the text size one specifically.

403
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,220
That was the one I played with on this latest install just to see how do I feel about it

404
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,940
because I'm on a 2K display and having slightly larger text size was nice.

405
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
You know me, Wes.

406
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
I love the 2K resolution.

407
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
You love those 2K.

408
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,100
So I really thought that was a great idea and I think that's a perfect outlook to have

409
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
on it.

410
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Yeah.

411
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
And the analogy I like to use is curb cuts.

412
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,060
It's like where a sidewalk meets a road and you have the curb that is like a little ramp

413
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
up to the sidewalk.

414
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
Uh-huh.

415
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,160
Those were designed for wheelchair users originally, but like those are, those are useful features

416
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,940
for anybody to take advantage of.

417
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,840
So we like to, we have this effort we call curb cuts around elementary OS of things that

418
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,140
help access accessibility, but actually can be useful to everybody.

419
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,880
And I think it's starting to show.

420
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,140
That's a good insight into the project.

421
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,300
And you know, I use those curb cuts when I'm rolling around in my blades.

422
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Cheese, I know.

423
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Exactly.

424
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
You had something too you wanted to touch on.

425
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Yeah.

426
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,940
So I have a question for you, Cassidy.

427
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,100
First of all, I, you know, I've been running the latest 5.1 here for, I don't know, a couple

428
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,940
of hours and just tinkering with it.

429
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,220
One thing that you guys do that's really different from anyone else with the App Center is that

430
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,220
you give people the opportunity to donate to these projects, to their favorite pieces

431
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,600
of software.

432
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:57,140
But one thing that I've noticed is across installs, there's no real say elementary account

433
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,540
based system like maybe you would have with Mac OS or something like that where you can

434
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
continue to log in.

435
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,860
And so if I reload my laptop, I can log back in and all the software that I've previously

436
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,180
purchased is available for me to download again.

437
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,460
Are there any plans to maybe put some sort of feature into the App Center like that so

438
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,940
that users who have purchased software can log back into the App Center and redownload

439
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,780
the software that they've already purchased?

440
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
Yeah, definitely.

441
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,980
Today, there's actually a way to do it from the terminal to like export your purchases

442
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,380
and then re-import them.

443
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,460
And it's kind of hidden, not super easy.

444
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,140
So we don't expose that for everybody to do because it's not the greatest experience,

445
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
but it's possible.

446
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:50,620
Kind of the hold up there today is we're very, very fanatic about not having a server where

447
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,220
we have user accounts and store user information.

448
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,740
But we do have a way we can do that in the future using actually our payment processor

449
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,220
Stripe has a customer's feature where we're not actually like storing any data about users

450
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,180
on our infrastructure, but we could have a restore purchases option.

451
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,240
So that's definitely something we're working on and looking into.

452
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,280
And alongside that, actually, we're working with the folks at Flatpak and FlatHub to enable

453
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,020
payments for Flatpaks themselves.

454
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,840
So Alexander Larson is doing some awesome work there.

455
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,420
There's a new release of Flatpak coming out soon that should support that.

456
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:34,740
And a lot of our work will be focused on enabling payments and payment restoration with Flatpaks.

457
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,300
Yeah, I'm looking forward to see where they go with that.

458
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,080
That is coming soon to Flatpaks.

459
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,700
And I think that's going to make a huge difference over at FlatHub, even if it's just for donations

460
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,660
initially, to just say thank you for making this.

461
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Right, having it built right in.

462
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Yeah.

463
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,300
Well, Cassidy, thank you for coming.

464
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,340
Sorry, Dan, that your internet connection was cutting out.

465
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,060
But Cassidy, you covered it great and really enjoying the new release.

466
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,020
I encourage everyone, check the link out in the show notes, read the release notes, because

467
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
they're the best.

468
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,760
And then grab an ISO, because it's the best.

469
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,300
Just such a solid release every time.

470
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,180
I can't remember the last time we've been like, boy, that new elementary OS sure is

471
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
crap.

472
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,740
I really blew it this time, didn't I?

473
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,220
You guys nail it every single time.

474
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Every single time.

475
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,660
So the wait is worth it.

476
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,100
I say congratulations.

477
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,420
Thank you.

478
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,160
Go get 5.1.

479
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
It's killer.

480
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,420
With that said, it's time for a little housekeeping.

481
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,140
First and foremost, gonna mention right here at the top of the housekeeping, Linux headlines

482
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,660
are daily, every weekday, Linux podcast in three minutes or less, everything is happening

483
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,220
in Linux and open source.

484
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,720
And this thing is packed full of information.

485
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,540
We've got a dedicated research person on there, plus our editors review the content, plus

486
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,320
often multiple hosts review every single episode before it gets published.

487
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,420
We're doing like our real best on this thing.

488
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,340
Every single episode is a team effort.

489
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,180
It's damn impressive.

490
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,660
And you can grab it at linuxheadlines.show slash subscribe.

491
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,260
While we're recording this here episode, another one's about to get posted.

492
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
I love it.

493
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,580
I mean, it just helps me stay up to date.

494
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,460
And that means less time I have to spend on Linux subreddit or Hacker News or any place

495
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,560
searching for news.

496
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,820
We took our news pipeline collection and just grew it and expanded it.

497
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,380
And it's really meant that everyone on the team is staying very up to date now.

498
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,420
And it's easy to listen to, right?

499
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,980
There's some support on a little smart speaker near you.

500
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Yeah, it's true.

501
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,420
You can get it in your daily briefing if you got one of them echo tubes.

502
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,080
And you can just subscribe at linuxheadlines.show slash subscribe, three minutes or less.

503
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,420
And we aim for your afternoon commute if you're a commuter too.

504
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,260
So you can just pop it on before you listen to anything else and get an update.

505
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
That's what I do.

506
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Just pop it on.

507
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
I pop it on.

508
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
That's what I do, Wes.

509
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
I pop it on.

510
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,460
There's something I'm thinking about doing this Friday.

511
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,060
This could be a really bad idea, especially since it's like the holidays and I already

512
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,780
do enough as it is and you all have enough going on as it is and nobody needs one more

513
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
thing.

514
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,980
But I thought if you're around this Friday afternoon, as of when this episode's airing,

515
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,740
maybe we do a little get together, some distros and drinks.

516
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Something I'm thinking about doing.

517
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
Are you supplying the drinks?

518
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Nope.

519
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Ah.

520
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
BYOD on that one.

521
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Got it.

522
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,340
I'll probably be sipping on a Red Bull myself, but maybe a beer ski.

523
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,940
We'll see if, if enough people take me up on this, I might go get some beer ski.

524
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,900
You will be providing some tips though, right?

525
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Yeah.

526
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
So here's the deal.

527
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,700
Uh, I don't know if this is something I want to do all the time, but I thought I'd give

528
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
it a try.

529
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,100
And so for this week I thought let's do a little live setting up plasma session.

530
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,260
How I configure my plasma desktop.

531
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,700
Now that I've been back on plasma for a few weeks, I got some things to share.

532
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,980
So tweak your plasma set up along with me from basic to brilliant.

533
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
I will back him up.

534
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,500
He tweaked my plasma install and I've been loving it.

535
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
You just left it.

536
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
It's great.

537
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,540
Um, and I'll have the mumble room going.

538
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,780
I'll have the IRC going, the live stream going.

539
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,500
You can just watch along as I go from zero to hero with my plasma set up and maybe take

540
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
a few of those suggestions yourself.

541
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,020
I'll do a screen cap of it.

542
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,060
I'll be on mic and walking you through it.

543
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,620
I also thought this would be a good time to try out some meetup alternatives because meetups

544
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,420
going in a bad direction.

545
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,180
Meetup.com has been a go to resource, but they're charging coming and going these days.

546
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,660
So I'm trying out get together.

547
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Dot community.

548
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,900
I'll have a link in the show notes.

549
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Get together.

550
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Dot community.

551
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,280
Distros and drinks with me on Friday at one PM Pacific to three 30 PM Pacific.

552
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,940
So translate that to your local time and then they just go to jblive.tv there.

553
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Find all the links.

554
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Yep.

555
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,800
We'll have the, we'll have all the streams up if you want to do, I don't, this might

556
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
be a dumb idea.

557
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,420
I know nobody uses get together dot community, so I'm probably not going to get people to

558
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,820
register so then I won't know if anybody's going to be there and because it's Friday

559
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,820
before the holidays, nobody's going to show up.

560
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,800
But if you do show up and it becomes a thing, I'll probably start doing like distro reviews

561
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
from time to time.

562
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,960
Try out different distros on the live stream cause I got the capture all set up.

563
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,420
So link for the get together page.

564
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,960
I know it means like you got to create another account somewhere.

565
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
It's easy though.

566
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I've tried it.

567
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Yeah.

568
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
They got single sign on too, so that's not so bad.

569
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,620
And go check out Jupiter extras extras dot show brunch with Brent episode 36 of Jupiter

570
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
extras.

571
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,620
Wow.

572
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
We've done 36 of these things, but this one's a special one.

573
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,620
He sat down with Rocco, big daddy Linux, great little chat brunch with Brent at extras dot

574
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,660
show and you know, rumor has it if you fiddle around with the categories on that their site,

575
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,800
there's a way you can get a feed just for brunch with Brent or some sort of magical

576
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
tags.

577
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Confirm that.

578
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
How would I know?

579
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,860
I can't confirm that, but check that out.

580
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Extras dot show.

581
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,340
Jupiter extras is, is up on YouTube and Hey look, after our call out, we got 76 subscribers.

582
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Thanks guys.

583
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Yeah.

584
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,860
If you'd like to be notified of new brunches or any other extra, that's probably the easiest

585
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
way.

586
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
We're gonna need more though.

587
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,820
Cause I think you need a hundred at least to get a name.

588
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,380
We believe in you community.

589
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
So I have a link to that.

590
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,320
We need you to go over to our extras YouTube channel and subscribe for us so we can name

591
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
our YouTube channel.

592
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
It's really a team effort.

593
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,620
It's so dumb the way YouTube works, but we would appreciate it.

594
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
We'll have a link to that.

595
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,420
And last but not least, you know what I'm going to mention West cause I can Jupiter

596
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,180
broadcasting.com slash telegram boom.

597
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,020
Our telegram group is going seven days a week, 24 hours.

598
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Amazing.

599
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,820
I try to stop in there several times a day, minimum.

600
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,160
A lot of us are in there.

601
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,960
So if you want to chat with us, get some in front of us or just talk about a show episode,

602
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,020
the community is always roaring at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram and um, big

603
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,820
shout out because I often will bounce things off of people in there to get their take on

604
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
it.

605
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,080
Uh, people will give me followup ideas to shows in there.

606
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,020
So just shout out to that room over a thousand strong and just a bunch of awesome individuals

607
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,080
at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

608
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,220
We don't mention it enough for how great it is.

609
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,680
So go check that out.

610
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,780
Anything else for the housekeeping there, mr.

611
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
Payne?

612
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
I think that does it.

613
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,040
Alrighty then.

614
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,660
So giving the gift of Linux this year, it really is true that for most of the world,

615
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,540
Linux is an implementation detail.

616
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
We don't like it.

617
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
It drives us crazy.

618
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Hey, that Android device.

619
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,100
Hey, that's got Linux on it.

620
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
You know, they don't.

621
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
They don't care.

622
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I mean, most they give you that.

623
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Oh yeah.

624
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Nice.

625
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Huh?

626
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Oh yeah.

627
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Isn't that the thing on the cloud?

628
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Yeah.

629
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
That's what the cloud's made of.

630
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,720
So I thought this time, let's just embrace it and let's give friends and family little

631
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,780
trinkets and gadgets and gifts.

632
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Right.

633
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,700
The gift to ourselves is we get to play with this stuff and then the gift to them is some

634
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,540
sort of working device that they don't have to know runs on it.

635
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,380
This is a little cheesy, but when you're, ha cheese.

636
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,020
But when you're giving gifts to friends and family that you've known for a while or acquaintances,

637
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,340
you know, work people, whatevs, there is something about getting a custom made gift.

638
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,220
I know that sounds sort of cliche, but it is true.

639
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,980
Like if somebody gave you something they made, I like, I did a thing where I gave out, I've

640
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,980
talked about this.

641
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,720
I gave out wifi access points and picture frames one year, the family loved it.

642
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,340
It really was like it was a little kid I put together.

643
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Everything was all set up.

644
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,860
The access ID, the WPA password, the photo frame was all good to go.

645
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Well that's just it, right?

646
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,980
I mean most of the time the gifts are just something to show that you're thinking and

647
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,420
have care for those people and what's better than spending some time working on a project.

648
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Well this really got kicked off into high gear when Michael wrote into the show.

649
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,040
This is what happens when we start reading the feedback more, Wes.

650
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,940
He wrote in and said, I recall back in episode 230 that Wes was setting up a NAS for his

651
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
family.

652
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,780
Well, fast forward and now I've decided that in 2020 it's my goal to do the same thing.

653
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,900
He's wondering also if you have any updates, but wants to know how would you do it today

654
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,580
if you're going to go about it and what would you build?

655
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,120
He also says thanks for the amazing podcast, Michael subscribing from Germany.

656
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,260
So he wants to know if we were going to do the same thing, give the family or a gift

657
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,360
of like a Linux box or something that solves a problem out of the box, what would our approach

658
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,340
be today?

659
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,460
And I think it's pretty different than it was a couple of years ago.

660
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,900
A couple of years ago, I wouldn't have had as nearly as many small board computer type

661
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
projects.

662
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
No.

663
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,860
They use raspberry pies or, or the pine 64, right?

664
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,220
I ended up deploying a NUC at my folks house kind of for that reason, but in those situations

665
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,620
it's several hundreds of dollars.

666
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,700
And now this year it's like, well, this is 35 bucks to do this.

667
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,540
This one's going to be 60 bucks to do that.

668
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,100
That's gift category right there.

669
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Exactly.

670
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,420
So I am not doing this one, but I almost pulled this one off from my mom this year.

671
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,980
It just didn't quite work out.

672
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,300
I'm really going to recommend people consider giving the gift of network backups and you

673
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,340
can make it really easy.

674
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,820
There is a piece of open source software that has saved my bacon a few times and it's called

675
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,500
backup PC.

676
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:44,260
It's a brilliant, brilliant backup software that works over SSH and Samba and NFS and

677
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,900
various other networking protocols.

678
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,460
You can support all operating systems.

679
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,020
It's easy to deploy as a Docker image.

680
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,160
It's a little challenging to deploy on your system itself, but you can.

681
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,260
And I think backup PC, even if it's just one or two computers and a USB hard drive plugged

682
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,020
into a PI would be a fantastic gift.

683
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,780
And if they already have a computer on the network that would be capable of this, you

684
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,100
can load backup PC on that for them.

685
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,340
And it's backup PC gives you a nice web UI to backup and restore files.

686
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,660
And one of the things that's really smart about is eliminating duplicate images by looking

687
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,260
at the block hash, I don't actually recall how it does it, but I'm going, I assume it

688
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,140
hashes the files, looks at each, it does a hash for all the files and then it compares

689
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
the hashes.

690
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,500
And when there's duplicate hashes, it sets up hard links instead of actually copying

691
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,960
the file a bunch of times.

692
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,540
And so you end up using a surprising little amount of disk space, having backed up.

693
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,300
So network servers and ZFS, we could have it all stored on ZFS.

694
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,960
And then one other is just don't do, I'm not doing, but I think you could do.

695
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,180
And I almost did for my dad this year, Pi-hole.

696
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
We talk about it a lot.

697
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,220
Pi-hole is a black hole for internet advertisements.

698
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,140
You throw it on a device, you set it up for the family members, you tweak their DHCP.

699
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,580
And now on every device they own forever, they've got ad blocking.

700
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,900
What I like about that is ad blocking is fairly easy if you know what you're doing, but that's

701
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,940
not always where your family members are, right?

702
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,080
So this is something you can put in place.

703
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,500
They don't have to think about it.

704
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,200
You should probably tell them about it, I suppose, otherwise you won't get credit.

705
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,180
But after that, it just works.

706
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,340
DM, you have a backup solution for people?

707
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,700
It's called Veeam Agent.

708
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,980
They have Veeam Agent for Linux, Veeam Agent for Windows.

709
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,020
It's not open source, but it's really good because you can backup the system and then

710
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,380
you can do bare metal restore.

711
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,500
So you can pretty much restore the whole system or restore a single file.

712
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
That's nice.

713
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,140
When you install the app, it lets you create like a recovery media.

714
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,380
And it's really good for, especially for people that, it's kind of like you backup everything

715
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,300
and then you pick whatever you want to restore after.

716
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,180
Which most of the time people even, they don't know what they want until it's too late.

717
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,500
And they don't know how valuable it is and how much they appreciate it until they need

718
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
it.

719
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,840
It really is a thing.

720
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:17,220
It also does deduplication on the backup level, so you also kind of like save a lot of space

721
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,740
on the backups and stuff.

722
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:26,020
So I've been using it on a large enterprise scale, but it's also free for home users and

723
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
stuff like that.

724
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
So it's open source, but it's great.

725
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,580
Veeam gets a plus one from me.

726
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,900
I use it all the time in my network.

727
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,980
Also worth an honorable mention in the PyHole category is the newer AdGuard Home, which

728
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,780
can also run on a Pi as well, which does much the same thing, but I find generally I prefer

729
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,100
the interface to AdGuard.

730
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,700
Yeah, I've been meaning to try that.

731
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,820
That does look really good.

732
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,100
That's a good mention.

733
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,020
And I thought maybe there's still a chance I might do one of these.

734
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,580
So I wanted to put them on this list.

735
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,500
Wes and I have two particular projects we are doing for our family this year, which

736
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
we'll tell you about.

737
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,540
But I want to take a moment to talk about the obvious elephant in the room.

738
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,440
It is so easy these days to build a tiny little retro arcade machine.

739
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,500
It's so easy that you could even gift it in a tiny retro NES case for 30 bucks.

740
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,760
I have it linked in the show notes.

741
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,780
You get an NES case built to hold the Raspberry Pi.

742
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,960
Look at that handsome thing.

743
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,300
You get a cooling fan.

744
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,200
You get two USB Super Nintendo ripoff controllers that plug into the ports in the front that

745
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
are USB.

746
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,820
It's not just mix and match, why that controller doesn't make sense with the case.

747
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,340
But that's fine.

748
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,580
If somebody were to open this and you tell them, yeah, it does HDMI out, you can plug

749
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,580
it into your current TV and play all your old favorite games, they would love this little

750
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
thing.

751
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
I mean, it is adorable.

752
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,740
Right, great for kids or just old farts who still love video games.

753
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,780
I'm going on a holiday shopping trip with my dad, I do it every year.

754
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,460
And I always try to drop a few hints to see like what he bites on.

755
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,820
And this is definitely on the possibilities list.

756
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:05,880
Because it's just a presentation of the whole thing where it's in a retro Nintendo case.

757
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:14,380
And you can load it with something called, I'm going to say, Laka, L-A-K-K-A, Laka.

758
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,260
It's a DIY open source retro gaming console distro that you can flash on a device or you

759
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,580
can load on even on an x86 machine.

760
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,280
And it's got a sort of a PlayStation inspired UI.

761
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,380
So if you like the PS3 UI style and the PS4.

762
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Oh, nice.

763
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
A little more PS3, PS2.

764
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
But it's nice.

765
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,220
It's a classic side scrolling UI.

766
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,820
Something very easy.

767
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Looks really good.

768
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,500
And of course, cheese, you love RetroArch.

769
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, RetroArch is fantastic.

770
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,460
And you can extend that, which is basically what Laka uses on the back end.

771
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,380
But you can extend that to all of the consoles that are out there right now.

772
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,160
Apparently, even it supports iOS and Apple TV.

773
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,220
So if you're really into retro gaming, that's probably a great solution for you as well

774
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
to look at.

775
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:10,980
Maybe, although you built me a little Odroid Go Game Boy like thing that is also one of

776
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,500
those like perfect kind of gifts at the holidays.

777
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,540
Tell me a little bit about this because I've got it in my hands right now and it looks

778
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
slick.

779
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,340
It's got a transparent case so you can see the board in there and you can see the battery,

780
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
which is super cool.

781
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,780
And it's shaped like an old Game Boy.

782
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,740
Yeah, so the Odroid Go is very similar to Adafruit's Pie Girl, which it's kind of a

783
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,340
Game Boy sort of handheld console, retro handheld console.

784
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:41,980
But what differs from the Pie Girl and Odroid Go, first off, Odroid makes single board computers

785
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,260
as well.

786
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,120
But this uses the ESP32 microcontroller instead of a Raspberry Pi.

787
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,560
So you're going to get a lot more battery, you're going to get a lot more playtime out

788
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
of it.

789
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,540
It also has a header on top so you can break out that header.

790
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,940
I think they have, there you go, I think that header will allow you to expand it and do

791
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
some other things.

792
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,900
They have some attachments for it, I'm not sure exactly what attachments are available

793
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
for it right now.

794
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,400
I think there's a microphone or something like that available for it.

795
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,480
And you can also just, since it's a microcontroller, you can play with it and you can have it do

796
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,680
just about anything you want.

797
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,900
So if you wanted to turn it into a portable weather station or a tricorder of sorts, you

798
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,980
could do that with this little device.

799
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,980
A tricorder?

800
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
I don't know.

801
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Pool holder?

802
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,900
It's really, it's super simple, right?

803
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,860
So instead of having to solder it all together, it comes as a kit and you can assemble it,

804
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,720
but it's really easy to assemble, really easy to put together.

805
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,580
So it's something that you could hand your kid and say, hey, you know, put this together,

806
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
build something.

807
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,260
And they would have this, you know, sense of accomplishment once they put it together

808
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,380
and fired it up and got their first games going on it, for sure.

809
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,900
Yeah, I love it.

810
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
It's one of my favorite little things.

811
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,020
And I love also just showing it to my kids and be like, here, this is what video games

812
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,380
was like when I was your age, you know, I do one of those moves with it, which is extremely

813
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,120
satisfying because I can be like, see if you can beat that kid.

814
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,940
It's a really nice little gift.

815
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,360
And I think anybody new or old gamer would be very, very happy with this thing.

816
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,920
So we have links to this stuff, the Odre Go and the kit in the show notes.

817
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,100
You got to check that out.

818
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,260
But I love some of the ideas that came in from the audience.

819
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Dennis sent me an idea.

820
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:31,380
He says, when you have a Raspberry Pi around a 3B plus somewhere level or better, if you

821
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,800
have endless options, you have all kinds of things you can do.

822
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,180
He built, we'll have a link to this to check this out in the show notes, a beautiful wood

823
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
case around this thing.

824
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Look at that.

825
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,980
I mean, I don't know if he hand built this or if he assembled it from various parts or

826
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,500
what he did, but he put an LCD screen inside a, like a maple stained case.

827
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,340
It's a gorgeous little computer right there.

828
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,380
Just got a little little wireless keyboard and mouse connected.

829
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,380
That's all you need.

830
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,540
And he can put it in photo frame mode if he wants when he's not using it.

831
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,100
So he's also got a little photo frame there.

832
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
That's so slick.

833
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,320
It's a great idea.

834
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,420
So you can get a little inspiration by checking out the pictures there.

835
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,980
But it's also worth mentioning, you could set somebody up a Kodi jellyfin setup on

836
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,460
a Raspberry Pi and give it to him and say, here, plug this into your television.

837
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,540
This is set up now to connect to my jellyfin library.

838
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,860
Yeah, I had that set up with MB for a while, but I'm going to try it out with jellyfin,

839
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,460
I think, over this holidays.

840
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,620
And I just like that it makes it easy to share anything I'm watching with my family.

841
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,100
And they don't have to learn any sort of new interface.

842
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,720
They've been using Kodi before.

843
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,700
So once the database backends plugged right in and you can do the same thing with Plex,

844
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,940
they just keep on going and magically new content appears.

845
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Yeah, it's nice to see.

846
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,620
I'd like figures that it would exist, but it's nice to see a jellyfin plugin for Kodi's

847
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:49,860
or jellyfin app in Kodi so you can keep using the Kodi player and all of that.

848
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,100
But you can get that jellyfin database.

849
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,780
What a great way to share family movies, too, even if it's just for that kind of stuff.

850
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,000
So that's an obvious one.

851
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,660
But Wes, you're going like a whole other level with this one.

852
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,260
For this year, you're building essentially Sonos in a box.

853
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,060
It's not Sonos speakers.

854
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,860
No, it's speakers powered by the Raspberry Pi.

855
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,100
It turns out there's a whole bunch of high-end audio file gear that's made for the Raspberry

856
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,180
Pi, all kinds of different hats and attachments and DACs that you can get so that if you want

857
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,420
to drive speakers of basically any kind, you can use a Pi properly configured to do that.

858
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,580
And there's a whole bunch, almost too many options for Linux of synchronizing audio to

859
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
multiple devices.

860
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,300
So if you can marry those two things, I think you're set.

861
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,780
I haven't decided quite on the stack I want.

862
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,340
A new one I saw was Strobe Audio, which if people remember from the Kodi radio days,

863
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,780
I'm a lover of things hipsters like Elm and Elixir, and both of those technologies are

864
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,140
in Strobe.

865
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,820
But there's also an old favorite, Snapcast, which will do the same sort of thing.

866
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Okay.

867
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,220
I really think Strobe Audio is worth a go.

868
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,660
It looks really solid.

869
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,740
And the thing that this does that I think is worth just wrapping your noodle around for

870
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,180
a second is it allows you to get synchronized audio from any speaker.

871
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,780
You got some old computer speakers sitting around or you've got great home entertainment

872
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,860
speakers.

873
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,340
You've got a whole range of options, which means you can fill audio in anywhere in your

874
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
home.

875
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,780
Like everybody probably has an old computer speaker somewhere and you want just a little

876
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,620
bit of mid somewhere, just add it to that.

877
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,660
So Strobe Audio, amongst the others, looks like a great option to handle all of that

878
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,060
math over the network, make sure everybody's talking the same lingo at the same time.

879
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Right.

880
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,740
I mean, you know, Sonos and similar products are definitely out there, but not only are

881
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,120
they expensive, they have their own way of operating.

882
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,300
And I don't, I just don't think that that's right for the people in my life and people

883
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,420
that they know and something that can integrate with their existing systems and maybe even

884
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,380
just take input from, say, a CD player, it's going to be a lot more flexible.

885
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,860
I like this a lot because I was gifted an old set of theater speakers by my dad when

886
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,220
he upgraded to like a Sonos sound bar, of course, he's like, here, you want all these

887
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
old speakers?

888
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,940
And I'm like, dad, these are great speakers, but he doesn't want to deal with all the hassle

889
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
of wiring them all up.

890
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,940
This I could easily use, especially with some of these DACs you link, that's really cool.

891
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,940
So strobe audio on a Raspberry Pi, and then audio out.

892
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,260
So what I was thinking you could do is just a really simple, cheap, just USB sound card.

893
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,260
Yeah, it doesn't have to be, you don't even have to go fancy DAC unless you're really

894
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,260
aiming at high end speakers.

895
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
But you're right.

896
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,760
Yeah, especially for things you just want something in the bathroom or a kitchen device

897
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
while you're cooking.

898
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,940
I mean, like 70% of what I would use this would be podcasts.

899
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,380
I just want, I want to walk around everywhere and hear the podcast.

900
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,740
So here's another project.

901
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,820
I didn't include it in the doc, I'd like to extend some Wi Fi from from the main house

902
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,740
that my folks have down to their sheds.

903
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,740
Yeah.

904
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,180
Oh, and then if I could get this going to write, you could have same music, both places.

905
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,180
Yeah.

906
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,420
Sonos, but not quite.

907
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I like that.

908
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
All right.

909
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
So here's what I'm doing.

910
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,060
This is kind of on theme for me in the last year, especially now that Alex is the devil

911
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,060
on my shoulder.

912
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,980
I'm giving the gift of self hosted automation for Christmas.

913
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,580
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

914
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Why?

915
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
I thought you'd love the idea.

916
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,220
I've got this picture of a little me, me, me, me, me, me in your shoulder.

917
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
Oh, that part.

918
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,220
Yeah, I know.

919
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,220
Tell me about it.

920
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,220
Right.

921
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,780
Hey, Chris, buy this.

922
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,940
No, I thought, you know what?

923
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,940
I've got two Raspberry Pi threes and I'm going to put has IO on those suckers, which we talk

924
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,100
more about in self-hosted.

925
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:27,900
So check out selfhosted.show and I'm going to buy it with a cost of smart plug because

926
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,980
home assistant has a built in integration to work over the land with the cost of smart

927
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,340
plugs, which are made by TP link and I like a one pack is I think $20 you can get it or

928
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
something like that.

929
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,820
You can get a two pack for 35 bucks.

930
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,180
Oh, we should talk.

931
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,180
We should talk.

932
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,260
We should get you a better plug than that.

933
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,260
I know.

934
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,260
But see, this isn't for me.

935
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
This is for the family.

936
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,420
So I, you know, I can get them this as a built in integration and I'm going to give them

937
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,900
the gift of an automated smart tree because we just want something that's running Tasmota.

938
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
That's what we want.

939
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
I know.

940
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,420
If you want to send me a plug to use, you got a couple of weeks.

941
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,620
I can do that.

942
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,300
But others, I'm going to link the TP link in there.

943
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,140
It's all explained in self-hosted, but I think automating the Christmas tree is a great way

944
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,700
to make it click for people and I'm just going to set it up for the smart plug to just have

945
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,020
a sunrise sunset automation.

946
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,260
So it's an hour before sunset, turn the tree on.

947
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,260
All right.

948
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,780
I'm stealing this because there's also great for like outside lights that you don't have

949
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,780
to go out in the cold.

950
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
Absolutely.

951
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,780
Absolutely.

952
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,380
Yes, if that's a, that'd be, that would be a killer angle.

953
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,700
I hadn't even considered the outside.

954
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,400
And if you combine it, I know I have got some, uh, some family members, a little skeptical

955
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,820
of all these smart devices and just what's happening with their data.

956
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,500
So you can also add in the gift of like, look, this is all offline.

957
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Yes.

958
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Yeah.

959
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,860
Uh, TP link also makes an outdoor smart plug that has been weatherized with like perfect

960
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,060
rubber covers and whatnot.

961
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,540
Um, and I just think that's such a great way to be like, look, this is that for me, it's

962
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,420
like, this is that thing I talk about all the time, you know, and I'm always talking

963
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,820
about this thing and you know, it is useful and here it is.

964
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,180
And when you put them and I have, I have an old flirt case for the raspberry PI three

965
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:13,020
that I never used and I've got a raspberry PI three in the box still, and I'm just going

966
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,940
to open them both up, put this together.

967
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,140
I think I'll do Raspbian and then I'll do has IO.

968
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,660
Well, I'm either going to do homocystin or has IO, I'm not sure which is has IO is like,

969
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,660
it's a whole distro itself.

970
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,660
So I could go that route.

971
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,380
I'm going to decide what, because I do like the idea of being able to put other things

972
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,380
on there.

973
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,060
Are you wanting to run this as an appliance?

974
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,820
Cause that's what it boils down to.

975
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,820
That's what I got.

976
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,820
That's the, do I want to run this as an appliance or do I also want to do other things for them?

977
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,380
And I think the appliance angle is the way to go.

978
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,260
Pitch it as a complete product.

979
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,740
It does this.

980
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,740
Yep.

981
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,700
And uh, I think that's, I think I'll go has IO.

982
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,620
And that's easier with all these small board computers, right?

983
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,980
Cause if you need another appliance, you don't have to combine them, you just get another

984
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,980
one.

985
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,540
Something we're going to touch on before we wrap up is a super crazy, dead, easy, Nat

986
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,940
busting way to remote support all of these things we're giving out.

987
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,120
I am setting up remote access on everything this year.

988
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,740
I am backdooring every box or I'm sorry, I'm setting up a service login on everything I

989
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,740
give away this year.

990
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,660
And we'll tell you how we're both West and I are doing that, but she's had a really great

991
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:23,460
idea for a possible another take on the backup solution outside of my kind of half baked

992
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
idea.

993
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:30,060
I've been running open media vault on, uh, orange pie zero now for a little bit.

994
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,300
Um, and it's, it's a great little easy to use backup solution.

995
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Um, so what I did is over black Friday, they had the Samsung Evo, uh, one terabyte SSDs

996
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,780
on sale for a hundred bucks.

997
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,780
Right.

998
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:49,140
So for my brother and his entire family, immediate family, um, I'm setting up an orange pie zero,

999
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:55,420
which is about a $10 single board computer paired with a little external, um, SSD case,

1000
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,780
uh, with that one terabyte drive set up in there and they have iPads and just some various

1001
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,980
little different, you know, laptops and odds and ends, um, that I wanted to be able for

1002
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:11,180
him to use to easily back up the whole household and still have access to, uh, in case they

1003
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
need it.

1004
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,580
So, you know, all in, I'm looking at about 120 bucks, but for me, this is going to cover

1005
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,940
a gift for four people.

1006
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,580
So, um, I felt it was a really reasonable, uh, amount of money to be spent for, you know,

1007
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,660
everyone to get their backup solution on.

1008
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,340
So that's, that's what I'm using.

1009
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,340
I like that.

1010
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,820
I like, see, the reason why I say mine's a half solution and yours is a complete solution

1011
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,460
is because you're going with open media vault.

1012
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,460
So it's an appliance, there's a web UI, you could even give them the URL and the login

1013
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,220
and they could, they could futz with it, whereas mine is like, I think I'd load Debbie in and

1014
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,900
then I harass me and then I think I'd do like, mine's a half baked idea, but that's a fully

1015
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,900
formed one.

1016
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,860
So I think that's really nice and good call on the orange pie zero.

1017
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,500
That's a nice little device for this.

1018
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,880
It's questionable if I'll give them the URL to log into, but I may just put a service

1019
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,900
door in there for myself as well.

1020
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,900
It's these white lies that keep families together.

1021
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
That's right.

1022
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,900
Everybody stays happy.

1023
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,780
So there is also a solution that's along all of these same lines that makes it really easy

1024
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,540
to one click install things like a wiki and mumble and next cloud, but it's not quite

1025
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,460
as DIY as everything we've been talking about.

1026
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,060
I've never tried the freedom box before, but it looks like a really cool project.

1027
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:31,860
Each freedom box includes a single board computer with an arm cortex, a seven processor running

1028
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,860
a gigahertz.

1029
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:39,500
It's got a gig of Ram, two USB, two ports, it's got gigabit, one native SATA drive and

1030
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
an HDMI port.

1031
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,260
And it comes with a 32 gigabyte micro SD card that has the freedom box software pre-installed.

1032
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:52,540
A couple of other neat things though, inside it's a little case, it has a built in battery.

1033
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,120
It sits inside the case.

1034
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,500
So the freedom box doesn't lose power if you lose electricity.

1035
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Nice.

1036
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,380
I really like that.

1037
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,860
And it's running Debian under the hood.

1038
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,840
It's all running on top of Debian.

1039
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:11,940
So it's kind of a, it's a darling project of Debian, worth checking out the freedom

1040
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
box.

1041
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:18,100
I think it ran for 80 something dollars, 85 something dollars.

1042
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,520
And it's, it's got a platform that lets you just choose these massive open source software

1043
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,080
stacks as like a one click deployment at like, like VPS is do only it's on this little tiny

1044
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,820
freedom box that you put in your own network.

1045
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,620
It seems like a great way to introduce people who are interested in playing with the software

1046
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,660
but maybe aren't the most technical to get some of those benefits.

1047
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,660
All right.

1048
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,820
So let's talk about giving the gift of remote support with SSH.

1049
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,700
This is something you and I decided to do just for our own convenience and it's working

1050
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,860
out really well.

1051
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,120
So we thought we'd share it with the audience.

1052
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,020
We may have mentioned it maybe even one episode before, but Wes and I love the self healing

1053
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,820
reverse SSH tunnels that you set up using systemd.

1054
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,320
Oh yeah, it's so easy.

1055
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,740
And it's great because systemd is aware of your network state and all of these things

1056
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,660
that make it an ideal way to keep a persistent reverse connection.

1057
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1058
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,340
In short, you create a systemd unit file.

1059
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,740
It just sort of spells out how to do this SSH connection using the right command line

1060
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,900
flags and the right user information.

1061
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,420
And then you enable it and start it.

1062
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:31,340
And then there is a persistent, always on SSH connection to whatever you tell it to.

1063
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,340
In my case, it's a VPS.

1064
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,940
You will need some sort of publicly accessible bastion host out there to make this work really

1065
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
well.

1066
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,740
But I mean, come on, a lot of us already have one of these running somewhere.

1067
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,780
You could also get by with something forwarded on your own network if you needed to.

1068
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,500
If you have a public IP and you want to open the port, you could even have it connect back

1069
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,980
to an SSH, I mean, I'm sorry, you could have it connect back to a DNS address.

1070
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,580
I've hardcoded IP and no, actually, I did use DNS.

1071
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,900
So yeah, even if my IP changes, it's fine.

1072
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
If you have dynamic DNS, you'd be fine.

1073
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,660
And the idea here, really, you're just going to forward the port of your local SSH connection

1074
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,540
up onto that easily accessible server.

1075
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,740
And then you can use SSH's great support for jump hosts to just immediately jump right

1076
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,380
on through the bastion and get to whatever system you need, no matter how many levels

1077
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,380
of NAT are involved.

1078
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,380
Okay.

1079
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,380
All right.

1080
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,380
All right.

1081
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,540
We got to explain this just a little bit more, because this is such a fricking cool thing

1082
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:31,100
that SSH does that it's worth just everybody understanding what a jump host is.

1083
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,100
Right.

1084
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,260
So you used to be able to do this in all kinds of ways, including super hacky ones involving

1085
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Netcat.

1086
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,020
But these days with modern SSH, the proxy jump feature is baked right in.

1087
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,860
And so you can just tell, you know, you tell SSH, hey, I want to go to this host.

1088
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,060
But you can tell it it needs a jump host.

1089
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,700
So it'll first establish an connection to the jump host.

1090
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,240
And then on that box using its DNS settings, whatever you need, it'll then go make the

1091
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,620
request to the host that you actually want to get to.

1092
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,620
So you can chain this.

1093
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,360
You can go many levels deep if you want to.

1094
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,180
But two is usually enough.

1095
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:07,220
My SSH config file is maybe 100 lines long because I just chain multiple boxes together.

1096
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,420
So I use proxy jump every day and it's wonderful.

1097
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,740
You can also specify nonstandard ports, users, all that kind of stuff in there.

1098
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,560
So, you know, the SSH config file is probably one of the most important, you know, second

1099
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,780
probably only to my SSH keys on my systems.

1100
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,780
Right.

1101
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,140
And that way, when, you know, when the person you're supporting gives you a call and says,

1102
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,820
hey, this isn't working, you don't have to worry about it.

1103
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,420
You can just type SSH, whatever name you've given it and you're in.

1104
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,380
And what I've done is I've made little notes to myself.

1105
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,660
So this computer is this jump address.

1106
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,140
This computer is this jump address.

1107
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,620
And when they say, hey, I need help, I'll just open up that text document, highlight,

1108
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,900
paste in my terminal and go.

1109
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,460
And I'll be on their system.

1110
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,940
I really set up the keys and everything.

1111
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,860
So I really, really strongly recommend either for yourself, if you need to get access to

1112
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:57,780
your machine, that's like even even my RV machines, which are behind double carrier

1113
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,780
grade gnats.

1114
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,580
Bob's your uncle, man.

1115
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,580
Works just fine.

1116
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,260
Richard is indeed my uncle now.

1117
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,260
We'll have links to that.

1118
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,460
We'll have links to explain the jump post.

1119
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,580
I've mentioned links a lot.

1120
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,260
So I realize I've been throwing that out there a ton this episode and I haven't said where

1121
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,260
you get those.

1122
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,260
And I apologize.

1123
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,260
It's just an old habit.

1124
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,740
Linux Unplugged dot com slash three three zero.

1125
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,660
And we'll have all of that stuff there.

1126
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,340
So you can you can get there, man.

1127
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,220
All of this really started because Michael sent in an email.

1128
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
So thank you, Michael.

1129
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,220
We would like more of that.

1130
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,620
If you're doing any of these or have similar projects in the works or know some great open

1131
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,260
source software we should be using to facilitate gift ideas, Linux Unplugged dot com slash

1132
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,260
contact.

1133
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,260
Yeah.

1134
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Yeah.

1135
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,420
There's a lot of fun stuff out there.

1136
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,620
And if you're just even making it a project for yourself, I think it's worth checking

1137
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,060
out some of that stuff.

1138
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,260
We had something sort of amazing happen in the community that they didn't even know what

1139
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,260
happened.

1140
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:59,660
In my Linux Unplugged inbox came an email asking a question and then not even an hour

1141
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,900
later another email came into my inbox answering the previous question.

1142
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,340
So this is amazing because I was like, OK, we'll answer this.

1143
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,260
And then the next email that came in just did it beautifully.

1144
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,060
So let's start with Malik from Germany.

1145
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,060
Malik.

1146
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Malik.

1147
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:20,540
We by the way, Germany has been representing hard working over there, Germany.

1148
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,540
I think we're proud of you.

1149
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,460
I think we got like four emails from Germany in this last week.

1150
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,720
And so Malik writes and he says, hey, Chris, happy listening and enjoy the Linux podcast

1151
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,380
quite a lot after listening to some interesting episodes on self hosted and also your episodes

1152
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,380
on VPNs.

1153
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,820
I came to the conclusion that you might have some ideas to solve my very specific networking

1154
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,820
problem.

1155
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,820
You see, I'm a web developer by trade and I like to tinker a bit in my home network

1156
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,020
from time to time.

1157
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
But there's one problem.

1158
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,020
I just can't get my head around yet when I'm out and about.

1159
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,180
I would like to VPN to all my machines, my Linux notebook, my Apple mobile devices back

1160
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,060
in my home from any of my devices.

1161
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,060
Why?

1162
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,780
Well, I love Pi-Hole, of course.

1163
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,660
And well, I'd like to access through Pi-Hole when I'm out on public Internet.

1164
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,420
And I'd also like to get access to my file servers and that kind of stuff.

1165
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,580
But what's the problem?

1166
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,580
You might ask.

1167
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:17,220
I've got no public IP for address since my Internet provider is using something called

1168
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,180
DS Lite.

1169
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:25,740
OK, I did quite a bit of research and I can't find a way to connect to my home, but it seems

1170
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:32,820
there may be a way to do it because I have an IP six address available.

1171
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,340
I don't know how to use this right.

1172
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,340
So here's my question.

1173
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:40,540
Do you know of a specific guide or tutorial that discusses a multi-platform approach to

1174
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:46,220
connecting home with only an IP V6 public address available?

1175
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,780
I say, yes, we do.

1176
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,780
But then Lucas writes and he says, hey, there, I heard you had problems with carrier grade

1177
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,140
now and I felt the urge to write in.

1178
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:01,460
I also sit behind a carrier grade at my German ISP and I took it took me a while to find

1179
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,820
a solution that works for me.

1180
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,140
See, we're bringing Germans together on this podcast.

1181
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,620
At least with my ISP, the carrier grade net is only active for IP for addresses.

1182
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:18,140
So what I did is I rented a super small VPS at I O N O S dot D E and I installed a tool

1183
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:28,020
called six tunnel, which allows you to tunnel IP for traffic through an IP six connection.

1184
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,260
And this has worked brilliantly for him.

1185
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,260
He's able to get back to his home network.

1186
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,540
I don't know if you really consider it a VPN, he says, but it sure has solved my problem.

1187
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:43,100
Wes, educate me a little bit about six tunnel, because I believe there's other solutions

1188
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,100
as well.

1189
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,340
But six tunnel looks pretty straightforward.

1190
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,340
Looks pretty nice.

1191
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,860
Yeah, I'd actually never used it before.

1192
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,860
It is kept up to date.

1193
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,620
You see project over on GitHub if you want to check it out.

1194
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:58,420
It'll be in the show notes and it allows you to use services provided by IP V6 hosts with

1195
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,860
IP V4 only applications and vice versa.

1196
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,920
So it's really just a little flexible little connector you can put in between things.

1197
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,780
If you're on one end and you can't talk quite what you need to stick six tunnel in the middle

1198
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,100
and it'll figure things out for you.

1199
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:18,300
Yeah, it can be used as a tunnel for all combinations IP for traffic so you could pretty much run

1200
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,780
anything through it.

1201
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,660
And it looks like it also has a lot of flexibility.

1202
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,580
I have a link to the man page in the notes and I'm reading through it right now.

1203
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,900
Okay, this is something I'm going to look into.

1204
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,340
I had also you and I at one point had talked about other solutions using IP V6.

1205
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,300
So it seems like the audience is sort of clicked into something that you and I were also kind

1206
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,980
of orbiting around.

1207
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:45,660
And I want to also mention that I had a follow up email from Ryan, the developer of Nebula.

1208
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:52,060
And he gave me the suggestion of configuring both of my Nebula clients behind that with

1209
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,060
ports of zero.

1210
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,500
So they randomly select ports when they're trying to break through the net.

1211
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,020
Sounds like we've got some more testing to do.

1212
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,860
Yep, so I will test that indeed.

1213
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,340
And hopefully that answered some questions if you've got some follow up or feedback or

1214
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,560
ideas for the show, like Wes mentioned earlier, Linux unpluged.com slash contact.

1215
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,480
That's how you get into the show.

1216
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,780
We're trying to do just a little bit more of that towards the end of the year just to

1217
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,260
hear from everybody.

1218
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,420
Get some different stuff on the air because we always read the emails, but we don't always

1219
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,540
feature them on air.

1220
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,300
But I thought something about this time of year feels like the right time.

1221
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Right.

1222
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,420
And that's one of the best ways we get to hear directly from you and we love that now.

1223
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,780
Check out user error.

1224
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,340
Dan wasn't able to make it on because of internet connections, but error.show.

1225
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
So good.

1226
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,340
User error.

1227
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,700
One of my favorite podcasts of all time.

1228
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,700
Go check it out.

1229
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,100
And if there's one of our podcasts to share with your friends and family over this upcoming

1230
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,580
holidays, it's user error.

1231
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,580
For sure.

1232
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
It is.

1233
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,060
It's the one I listened to with the lady and she loves it.

1234
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,900
It makes me laugh every time.

1235
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:54,820
Techsnap.systems for more Wes Payne with Jim Salter talking about things over there and

1236
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,060
check out Alex and I on self hosted self hosted dot show.

1237
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,260
New episode is coming out this week and it's packed.

1238
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,260
It's packed.

1239
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,260
It's packed.

1240
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,260
And don't forget about my Friday stream.

1241
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:09,220
I don't know if it's a good idea or not and I need you to like go to that get together

1242
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,460
thing so I know if I should even bother.

1243
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,580
I know I'm very needy.

1244
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,980
We listen to you, but I thought this would be a good thing.

1245
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,980
Distros and drinks.

1246
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,980
What could go wrong?

1247
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:42,860
See you back here next Tuesday.

1248
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:59,500
All right.

1249
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Now we need them titles.

1250
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
JBtitles.com.

1251
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,700
We all go vote something.

1252
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,700
Something fun.

1253
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,740
You know, I enjoyed this episode.

1254
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,860
I think it should be a fun one.

1255
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,860
The gift of Linux is not I think it's a little too on the nose.

1256
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,860
Have you looked to see what's trending?

1257
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,860
All right.

1258
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,860
Let's go check it out.

1259
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,860
JBtitles.com.

1260
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,860
Let's investigate, you know.

1261
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,860
Just the gift of Germans.

1262
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,700
I don't think we don't have enough votes.

1263
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,300
So everybody go vote.

1264
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,300
It's urgent.

1265
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,060
I've been keeping an eye on that Gnome Shell and Mudder development blog.

1266
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,060
Yes.

1267
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:31,780
They're working on something really cool that is going to make Mudder even better.

1268
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,580
So one of the areas they've tried to focus on is just the general improvements of Mudder

1269
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,620
like we touched on with Cassidy, right?

1270
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,100
Well now they're working on really, really specific update areas.

1271
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,300
So Mudder only has to update small little bits of the screen.

1272
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,100
Much quicker, less work, less overhead.

1273
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,100
Way better.

1274
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,100
Way, way better.

1275
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Right.

1276
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,140
And that's exactly the kind of change that will stumble I think very far downstream.

1277
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:59,820
So as the way they put it, Mudder has received the ability to update multiple regions independently

1278
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,820
without using bounding rectangles.

1279
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,580
I love developers.

1280
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:08,500
And they have some screenshots that actually make it a little more obvious.

1281
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,980
There's a lot of other highlights on there.

1282
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:14,420
But like I said, like I promised, I'm keeping an eye on this Gnome Shell and Mudder development

1283
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:20,040
blog because it's so inspiring to see what they're working on and have a better appreciation

1284
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,300
as to I can feel the desktop getting better, but why is it getting better?

1285
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,020
And what are the hard parts of this that otherwise we would have no idea about?

1286
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,140
I can't help but respect their work even more when they do this.

1287
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:36,860
And it's a really well done post with, like I said, screenshots, but also tons of links

1288
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,200
properly laid out.

1289
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,060
There's real thought to the organization of it.

1290
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,540
There's an embedded video of the app grid improvements.

1291
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,620
I think you really have to call out how much work that is, right?

1292
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,860
You've already done all the code change.

1293
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,260
That's a lot of work in and of itself.

1294
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,660
But then to go write up a blog post, that's also a significant amount of work.

1295
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,460
Yeah, it takes a long time and they're nailing it.

1296
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,460
They've really stuck to it.

1297
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,980
So really impressed with it.

1298
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,340
I'll have a link to that as well because it's worth following.

1299
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:13,220
I just put it in my feed reader and I'm just going to see what they're doing.
