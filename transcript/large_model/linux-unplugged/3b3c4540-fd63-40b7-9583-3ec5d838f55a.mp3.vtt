WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
I know he's the internet in there. Yeah, dude. They're right there. They are right there

00:05.280 --> 00:07.280
Yeah, yeah

00:07.440 --> 00:11.840
Ham did you want to say ham come see the internet ham ham come see the internet look it's right there look ham

00:11.840 --> 00:17.480
That's really right there. That's it. Wow that is amazing. That's where you came from really you came from in there

00:17.480 --> 00:20.600
That is amazing. I know that is amazing

00:20.640 --> 00:27.760
Yeah, lady Jupiter pulls you from the internet, and she transitions you to the real world. That is amazing whoo credible technology

00:27.760 --> 00:35.920
Incredible yeah, yeah the internet the internet beard exists in both reality and the internet check check is this thing on yeah

00:36.760 --> 00:41.320
Yeah, that's like the worst thing to possibly say professional professional

00:42.080 --> 00:45.960
This is Lennox unplugged episode 141 for April 19th

00:45.960 --> 00:58.280
two thousand and sixteen

00:58.280 --> 00:59.440
Oh

00:59.440 --> 01:05.920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's podcasting with a full house. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

01:05.920 --> 01:09.360
Hey there, Wes. Yeah, we have a bunch of the crew already here

01:09.360 --> 01:14.800
Not even everybody yet some of them are just about to hit the air as we record this here episode

01:14.800 --> 01:21.480
But the jb1 studios are packed and we have a packed show coming up in this week's episode of the unplugged program

01:22.320 --> 01:26.840
It's here some of the first Ubuntu tablets real have arrived

01:26.840 --> 01:30.560
We've got first impressions from our audience that we'll cover in the show later on

01:31.000 --> 01:35.320
We've had a bit of a Linux build disaster. I will tell you about that

01:35.320 --> 01:39.960
It's and of course it's leading up to our Linux fast Northwest coverage, so it has to be time sensitive

01:39.960 --> 01:44.840
We'll tell you all about all about that and some of the shenanigans going down this weekend

01:44.840 --> 01:49.020
And then later on in the show we'll do some follow-up on our 1604 review

01:49.200 --> 01:55.960
some interesting things that have already changed since we've done that review additional features that we didn't talk about in the Linux action show and

01:55.960 --> 01:59.880
Of course a chance for our virtual log to chime in with maybe some of the things

02:00.520 --> 02:04.160
That they have a different opinion on you know just a couple of things

02:04.160 --> 02:08.160
They might have a different opinion from our review. Did you get a chance to see the review us? Oh, yeah?

02:08.160 --> 02:14.840
Yeah, and you actually have 1604 we once again right here. We've got an excuse for you to wipe your machine this week

02:16.360 --> 02:18.360
Every week yeah

02:18.480 --> 02:25.440
It is a warm warm warm. I do here for the Linux unplugged show so thankfully

02:26.160 --> 02:30.240
Thankfully Wes has brought us a nice cool brusky

02:30.360 --> 02:35.840
This is this is great because Noah's been saying out of ten all week long that he's been here

02:35.840 --> 02:41.440
this is ten barrel brewing company from Portland, Oregon, I think or somewhere in that area from Oregon and

02:42.120 --> 02:44.280
We are drinking their sinister black ale

02:44.320 --> 02:49.040
You know what I love now Wes is people are stopping by the IRC chat room before I like the show like

02:49.280 --> 02:51.880
After tech talk and stuff, and they're saying hey Chris. I got my beer

02:51.880 --> 02:55.840
I got that today in the IRC chat room. I got my beer ready for our work everyone

02:55.840 --> 02:58.120
I know aren't you impressed makes us happy and proud

02:58.280 --> 03:02.780
It's pretty cool now just to give you an idea of what it's like here in the JB one studios

03:02.780 --> 03:08.260
So here is the ten barrel brewing company's website. Here's what it actually looks like in real life

03:08.980 --> 03:12.140
This is what the state of you get an idea here

03:12.220 --> 03:16.860
You can see there's a McDonald's cup off to the right there a beer box

03:17.140 --> 03:22.220
That's which is what was what the beer comes in some energy drinks and Chinese takeout

03:22.860 --> 03:24.860
And of course a roll of paper towels

03:24.900 --> 03:30.180
That's pretty much sums up with the JB studio is the condition of the JB studio right now in one photo

03:30.180 --> 03:34.780
It is a crazy time, so you know we need to do we need more people we got to bring in more voices

03:35.380 --> 03:38.640
More voices in my head time appropriate greetings virtual log

03:44.020 --> 03:46.020
Whoa what I

03:46.780 --> 03:51.300
Think I heard like a secret message in there like a Disney cartoon style secrets

03:51.900 --> 03:53.660
Yeah

03:53.660 --> 03:55.220
all right, so

03:55.220 --> 04:01.060
This this is pretty exciting those of you who jumped right on those pre-orders for your Ubuntu M

04:01.060 --> 04:08.100
Tablet may be receiving them in the states at least folks on the East Coast in the US seem to be receiving their BQ tablets

04:08.740 --> 04:13.020
OMG Ubuntu seems extremely excited about the news Joey writes it

04:13.380 --> 04:18.340
It's really here. This is the first device to offer PC convergence as BQ has noted

04:18.340 --> 04:21.700
That's the Spanish hardware company behind the Ubuntu tablet device

04:21.700 --> 04:26.780
Delivery is our plan to go underway the second week of April which means fingers crossed. You should have your tablet

04:27.580 --> 04:30.460
Really by the time that 1604 is released

04:31.700 --> 04:35.500
And it's just pretty cool. That's really cool. I really really want to get one

04:35.900 --> 04:42.180
Poppy if you had a chance to try one by now nope yeah, I haven't I have not had a chance to buy one yet

04:42.180 --> 04:46.780
I really want to try one soon. I'm hoping maybe someone at Linux fest will have one. Oh, that would be nice

04:46.780 --> 04:52.540
Yeah, I think so, but we do have a post in our subreddit from adjunct vent event

04:52.540 --> 04:58.720
And he writes he there's the pictures of it pretty neat. I like the artwork on the box there. That's cool. You know the whole like

04:59.620 --> 05:04.980
Production quality of the packaging looks pretty nice, which I think is you know you don't want to see that documentation there

05:04.980 --> 05:06.980
There's the charger

05:07.020 --> 05:14.020
Nice charge indicator powered by Ubuntu there on the first boot. That's super nice man at that convergence though

05:14.020 --> 05:19.260
Yeah, I see it. Yeah, so he didn't end up. He didn't really well

05:20.220 --> 05:26.040
So 23 hours 23 hours ago. Here's what he wrote in our subreddit, so he says so far. I pretty much hate it

05:26.660 --> 05:29.780
Can anyone find a guide for installing arch on this thing oh?

05:31.140 --> 05:33.140
No, that's oh

05:33.260 --> 05:34.580
No

05:34.580 --> 05:36.860
You want to hear he says the interface is awkward

05:36.860 --> 05:41.060
I can't seem to figure out how to manage apps there isn't a file browser the keyboard doesn't pop up when I need

05:41.060 --> 05:47.420
Regular desktop programs in LibreOffice or Firefox there are settings everywhere for syncing proprietary sites with social media

05:47.420 --> 05:50.140
But nothing for own cloud. I don't know. I'm sure I'll pay

05:50.140 --> 05:53.320
I'll play with it more and get used to it, but the first impressions are pretty disappointing

05:54.060 --> 05:56.060
He says he did manage to find the terminal

05:56.380 --> 05:59.220
He did expect to be a bit more functional and customizable

05:59.860 --> 06:02.780
He feels like maybe he's being tough on it though, and it's not all that bad

06:02.780 --> 06:08.340
He says for one thing the screen is beautiful and the touch apps that are on there are really slick. He says

06:08.340 --> 06:13.000
So and right now. He's browsing reddit and making these posts from the built-in browser you go

06:13.000 --> 06:15.100
He also says battery life seems to be pretty decent

06:16.040 --> 06:20.100
Put more than maybe he perhaps expected so maybe after some time with it

06:20.360 --> 06:22.980
You know and the tablet category is pretty broad

06:22.980 --> 06:25.800
You know from like very minimally functional for things like the surface

06:25.800 --> 06:30.100
So I think it's not legitimate if this is not necessarily targeting at the moment right out of the bat

06:30.760 --> 06:36.140
The full-on workflow that he has in mind, but obviously it's usable for like what 90% of tablet users

06:36.140 --> 06:39.620
Do which yeah browse reddit plus? I think we all sort of have I mean

06:39.620 --> 06:43.960
I'm not trying to be an apologist, so I hope it doesn't come across this way because I

06:44.520 --> 06:48.560
Guess here's my qualifier. It sounds like this might be a tablet that I'd be willing to buy for myself

06:48.880 --> 06:50.880
Probably not a tablet. I'm gonna buy for my kids

06:51.520 --> 06:57.120
Even though eventually that's exactly what I'd like the Ubuntu touch experience to be is the tablet my kids could use because that seems the

06:57.120 --> 07:01.040
safest option for them, but I need something you know I'm willing I

07:01.440 --> 07:05.440
Mean I you can now you can ask Noah. He's walking around the studio here. I'm a crazy art user

07:05.440 --> 07:08.040
I'm I'm willing to read an end will set it up

07:08.040 --> 07:10.600
I will read that wiki if I need to and so for me

07:10.600 --> 07:13.960
It's I sort of have a different level of expectations. I'm not trying to be an apologist

07:13.960 --> 07:16.080
I'm just trying to say as a technical user

07:16.080 --> 07:21.720
I don't mind a challenge a bit as long as I can get to a functional state where it offers some sort of functionality

07:22.160 --> 07:25.920
I don't know does anybody in the mumble room have thoughts on the new bq a tablet device

07:26.920 --> 07:28.640
Sure

07:28.640 --> 07:30.640
I'd love to hear it

07:30.640 --> 07:36.800
So I'm inclined to agree with you that I you know if I was if I was looking for a tablet for my kids

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
Today right now

07:38.000 --> 07:44.360
I wouldn't buy the bq Ubuntu tablet and that I'm speaking as a canonical employee as an Ubuntu user Ubuntu enthusiast

07:44.360 --> 07:48.800
I've been using Ubuntu for 10 10 plus years, and I wouldn't buy it for them because

07:50.000 --> 07:54.180
truth be told the apps that they want are not on there and so right they

07:54.240 --> 07:58.080
wouldn't be able to do the things they want and it would be a waste of my money because it'd be sat there the

07:58.080 --> 08:01.840
The kind of people who are likely to buy this thing are developers

08:02.080 --> 08:07.400
early adopters people who are going to write new apps or port existing apps or people who can

08:07.760 --> 08:13.120
Cope with you know the janky edges here and there that there might be janky edges

08:13.320 --> 08:15.700
That's a good title right there janky edges

08:18.600 --> 08:19.880
Yeah

08:19.880 --> 08:25.400
Yeah, and and isn't that sort of the isn't that sort of the phase it has to be and now now poppy does that?

08:25.400 --> 08:29.760
Disenfranchise you a bit when you think you know the other guys are maybe

08:30.320 --> 08:34.320
Five years into iterating their experience. They're not they're way past the janky edges

08:34.320 --> 08:37.960
Is that too late the other guys that have billions of dollars and thousands?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.860
No, I understand that they have a huge huge tactical advantage

08:40.860 --> 08:45.640
But my point is it doesn't alter the reality of it though right sure and and yeah

08:45.640 --> 08:49.220
I would love for us to be more advanced down the road than we are right now

08:49.220 --> 08:50.840
I would love for us to have more apps

08:50.840 --> 08:56.420
I would love to have the more popular apps that you and I both know or the games or you know the ability to

08:56.560 --> 09:02.700
Export from you know unity 3d or for vplay or all these other platforms to support us

09:02.700 --> 09:04.900
But we've got to start somewhere and right now

09:04.900 --> 09:11.840
We've got the the sum total of one tablet on the market or arguably two if you can if you count two

09:11.920 --> 09:13.680
resolutions of the same device

09:13.680 --> 09:16.560
one on the market so you know

09:16.560 --> 09:20.720
But nobody is going to target a market that has

09:21.260 --> 09:28.860
One device with you know some thousands of users, so we've got to be realistic, and so you know we're fine with it being

09:30.180 --> 09:34.260
developer mostly experience at the moment and people who are willing to accept

09:35.020 --> 09:39.860
Over-the-air updates every six weeks that give them new stuff new crack all the time

09:39.860 --> 09:45.460
And you know the fact that you can make the file system read-only and you know you could apt-get

09:45.460 --> 09:52.660
Install cow say or whatever you know emacs or whatever you want to if you're willing to accept the compromise that that gives you so

09:52.860 --> 09:56.860
There's you know this swings around amounts there. It's pretty neat like there's a lot of projects

09:56.860 --> 09:58.580
I could imagine where a tablet would work before

09:58.580 --> 10:02.820
But it would just be easier if I didn't have to deal with like an Android build chain or other like if I can just use

10:02.820 --> 10:04.820
the bantu system

10:05.220 --> 10:11.500
For a lot of that I could definitely say you know if some of these supporting software got there like in media production and

10:11.500 --> 10:17.500
You could have a device that was both the capture device say has a camera, right?

10:17.500 --> 10:21.300
And it has the editing software that you could maybe poke at

10:22.740 --> 10:24.740
in in touch mode or

10:25.000 --> 10:30.100
You could at least review clips in touch mode and then when you want to edit you sit down and you could you could you?

10:30.100 --> 10:33.120
Know get a full desktop experience, and you think well a tablet. That's crazy

10:33.120 --> 10:39.860
But you you actually look at like devices like the latest Nexus tablet the pixel or the iPad Pro

10:39.860 --> 10:44.740
They have extremely powerful processors, and you can actually edit video on these frickin tablets

10:44.780 --> 10:50.100
But they have a horrible desktop experience right so something they can have the real desktop. Yeah

10:50.580 --> 10:55.220
Mm-hmm. I do want an Ubuntu tablet soundboard as well, mr.. Devlin you have a

10:56.340 --> 10:58.340
developer appeal yeah, I

10:58.980 --> 11:03.740
The promise that it will be much simpler device

11:05.100 --> 11:07.100
deployment

11:07.100 --> 11:13.500
To do the construction of applications when you're going to the other platforms right now is just full of

11:14.340 --> 11:19.860
Frameworks and these and that and it's like vanilla experience that you used to have back in in Windows

11:19.860 --> 11:23.200
See Windows embedded it was simpler to deploy an app

11:24.220 --> 11:28.900
Back in the window see a day. This is a harsh criticism. I'm not sure how to take that

11:29.860 --> 11:35.980
No, no, no, I'm saying that this is what Ubuntu is bringing on the table that Android iOS kind of got away from yeah

11:35.980 --> 11:40.460
Yeah, and so it brings that appeal that you can make your application

11:40.460 --> 11:43.540
It's an easy iteration and because it's an easy iteration

11:43.540 --> 11:50.100
I I'm I'm betting that all of the applications that get built are iterating much faster

11:50.100 --> 11:55.140
We're going to iterate much faster. Just because the platform has the ease to the play faster. Yeah, yeah

11:55.140 --> 11:58.780
I don't know about get Google voice support. I

11:59.340 --> 12:03.700
Guess I could argue poppy. Are you aware of any Google voice tricks for Ubuntu touch devices?

12:03.700 --> 12:05.160
I

12:05.160 --> 12:07.980
the support for Google Hangouts

12:09.180 --> 12:17.040
Lands in the browser very soon, but Google voice. I don't know. I'm outside the UK. So Google voice is an irrelevance to me

12:17.740 --> 12:22.900
Fair enough. Yeah, I guess that's kind of a you know, you're not really you're probably better off you're better off

12:22.900 --> 12:25.500
It's I have never been super impressed with Google voice and I've been using it

12:25.500 --> 12:30.260
I've been a user since Grand Central so but I bet there's the SIP client you can get for Ubuntu touch

12:30.260 --> 12:34.780
Yeah, yeah, I bet there is and I you know, yeah

12:34.780 --> 12:38.920
I I actually I think that's probably the better way to go. Yeah, it just takes a little more setup

12:39.340 --> 12:42.100
You know, there's an there is an in-between step

12:42.100 --> 12:46.740
There is a step you could take that makes sense right now and that's our friends over at ting you guessed it

12:46.940 --> 12:51.820
Linux dot ting comm is where you go to support this show, you know, I noticed on the ting road trip

12:51.820 --> 12:58.980
I have the GSM service turned on going down us 90 except for when I was I think at sort of the top of the

12:58.980 --> 13:02.840
Pass, I think I had serviced the whole darn way. Oh dang. Yeah, we use the Nexus 5

13:03.340 --> 13:08.620
To do maps until the Nexus 5 started to freak out on me. I don't know what was up. So

13:09.700 --> 13:14.860
New egg had a had a fifty fifty dollar off sale on the Nexus 5x. I think it's such a steal

13:14.860 --> 13:19.380
Yeah, dude, so I ordered the Nexus 5x while I was leaving to go on the road trip

13:20.180 --> 13:22.180
don't know while I was on the road trip and

13:23.140 --> 13:28.620
And so my Nexus 5 ended up just the batteries totally shot, you know, it's it's just old and stuff

13:28.620 --> 13:30.500
So let this be the wake, right?

13:30.500 --> 13:35.660
So I just popped the ting out the ting sim out of the Nexus 5 and I went to go pop it into the Nexus

13:35.660 --> 13:37.820
5x pop that ting, right?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
It's like it's a

13:40.540 --> 13:46.840
Like they cannot get these SIM cards small enough anymore. Like the SIM card is tiny for the Nexus 5 that really is

13:46.840 --> 13:52.320
Yeah, and so I'm like, yeah, and I'm like, ah, what am I gonna do? My SIM cards too big

13:52.320 --> 13:59.060
I might I got I can't pop the thing. Oh, geez. Oh

14:00.260 --> 14:04.460
But you know what ting has thought of this stuff ting is an experienced

14:04.540 --> 14:09.740
Experienced mobile service provider. You can just you can just pop the SIM one more smaller. You just pop it

14:13.340 --> 14:17.660
This is all true, I don't understand why it's so funny because it's all true and

14:17.660 --> 14:20.620
So anyways

14:23.820 --> 14:26.300
Now my 5x is activated

14:39.860 --> 14:42.940
Okay, all right, so I hope I'll be the pro I'll pull it together

14:42.940 --> 14:48.620
Anyways, now I have my GSM ting sim in my 5x and it's on the ting network now

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
I'll tell you one thing. I've noticed right away

14:50.740 --> 14:55.740
It has two front-facing stereo speakers. I am very excited about that

14:55.740 --> 15:00.840
Also, it feels a little bit better and the fingerprint reader is nice. So that's my like, oh, it's real nice

15:00.840 --> 15:01.940
I've only very impressed

15:01.940 --> 15:04.180
I've only had I've only had the 5x literally for an hour

15:04.460 --> 15:09.340
Because I ordered it while I was on the road trip and just got unboxed it and it's been installing updates the entire time

15:09.340 --> 15:11.580
I have had it but they'd like that

15:11.580 --> 15:16.140
Well, so the fact that it's here's what I here's what I just love about it

15:16.140 --> 15:20.620
I went on Newegg because there was a sale and I ordered it. I

15:21.460 --> 15:28.460
Never called anyone at ting. I never logged into the website. I just pulled the SIM card out and I put it in a totally unlocked

15:29.200 --> 15:33.540
Totally straight Google experience 5x put it in there and now I have phone service

15:33.900 --> 15:37.660
It took I mean as long as it I thought carriers that would not work

15:37.660 --> 15:42.620
It is so nice and and now I just pay for what I use. It's six dollars for the line

15:42.620 --> 15:45.860
I just transferred it over to this device. I I love it

15:45.860 --> 15:48.500
I end up paying like 40 bucks a month for like three lines

15:48.780 --> 15:54.660
It's great minutes messages megabytes to add them up. You only pay for what you use ting is great. No contracts

15:54.700 --> 15:58.140
No early termination fees and they have a great control panel if you do need it

15:58.140 --> 16:00.140
Oh, I could tell you all about that

16:00.340 --> 16:02.340
But you know what? I think I'm gonna do

16:02.740 --> 16:06.580
I'm gonna say go to linux.com. That'll give you $25 off a device or

16:06.580 --> 16:12.580
Or go get $50 off of 5x if the new if new egg still has that sale going and I think actually even the play

16:12.580 --> 16:18.340
Store has the sale directly. Yep, you know about this. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so I've been considering you should do it

16:18.340 --> 16:21.380
You should do it because I think the 5x is a nice upgrade from the 5

16:21.380 --> 16:23.780
I think it's a really so I mean you can play with it when it's done here

16:23.780 --> 16:26.220
But I want to at least log into it once for goodness sake

16:26.940 --> 16:33.700
But as it won't bond with you USB see it now when you plug it in it says rapid charging

16:33.700 --> 16:35.980
Oh rapid charging. Yeah, that's sweet

16:36.580 --> 16:42.660
So I think this is I think you know with that with that sale and pay for what you use service from ting

16:42.660 --> 16:45.060
This is such a no-brainer, but they have all the great devices

16:45.060 --> 16:49.300
You can check it out from feature phone SIM cards all the way up and they have a wonderful blog. I

16:49.980 --> 16:55.860
Like this post about minimizing your mobile data usage in YouTube. I think they're like they're just like us

16:55.860 --> 17:00.340
They're they use the phone the same way. Do you need 1080p when you're you know?

17:00.340 --> 17:04.740
Like you probably don't need 1080p when you're on your mobile device and you're on you're on you're on LTE

17:05.100 --> 17:08.340
So they just it's a bunch of great tips. They have some good videos posted over there, too

17:08.340 --> 17:12.380
So just start by going to linux.ting.com that supports this show gets you the discount

17:13.060 --> 17:15.420
You can do that anywhere in the world support this show big

17:15.420 --> 17:18.540
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com

17:19.460 --> 17:24.260
alright, so the Linux fest Northwest mayhem is approaching and

17:24.700 --> 17:27.860
I think maybe if you're watching Linux action show this week

17:27.860 --> 17:32.700
You might have saw sort of the state of chaos this caused when we do a new Linux build

17:33.500 --> 17:39.380
Which we want to get done before Linux fest Northwest and it is a massive undertaking and of course

17:39.380 --> 17:45.420
Of course West things never quite go as you plan you can research the parts

17:46.100 --> 17:47.620
You do your best

17:47.620 --> 17:53.620
You can assign tasks to staff to do research for you and then buy what they recommend and then they blame you for buying it

17:53.620 --> 17:57.980
You can do all of those things and get blamed regardless, but

17:59.060 --> 18:02.500
You cannot accommodate for how they build things today now

18:02.500 --> 18:05.380
I could explain our woes and I could explain our trials

18:05.380 --> 18:09.940
But I thought maybe what we do is a little hot chicken dance swap first and maybe somebody else could tell you

18:09.940 --> 18:11.940
Oh

18:20.420 --> 18:23.340
Where they truly intro truly worthy

18:32.940 --> 18:37.020
So I got here and there was a bunch of parts that were ordered and

18:37.020 --> 18:43.980
we're working on building various things and trying to get various things working and so I

18:44.620 --> 18:51.260
Just I am I am like kind of like a whirlwind and then I and I get things done and I worry about the consequences

18:53.420 --> 18:54.340
Yeah, yeah

18:54.340 --> 18:54.540
I do

18:54.540 --> 18:59.380
I just you know like if I open a box and you know the thing is they could make this stuff a little easier to

18:59.380 --> 19:04.420
Do if you know when a video card just came like if the video card just came in like a simple box

19:04.420 --> 19:08.060
But no, they have to have all this plastic around and they've got a guy like, you know, it's fancy manuals

19:08.060 --> 19:13.220
So they've got discs and that's all stuff. I don't need I don't care about and so the first bit of it went pretty well

19:13.220 --> 19:19.020
I'm filming like every part and trying to give you guys a real good idea of exactly what's going on and then

19:19.940 --> 19:24.260
We went to turn on the computer now. I built a fair amount of computers myself and

19:24.820 --> 19:29.760
I have always built the computer and turn it on and it just works now Rekai tells me

19:29.760 --> 19:34.520
I know what you should do is test each individual component like outside of the case and I'm like

19:34.800 --> 19:40.600
That sounds like a waste of time. Like who's gonna sound like I just build the computer. I'll just pay attention to it

19:40.600 --> 19:44.960
Right, it'll be fine. So I built the computer bring it into the studio disconnect all of Chris's nonsense that he needs to do

19:44.960 --> 19:46.200
a little podcast

19:46.200 --> 19:50.240
Plug in the computer and turn it on no boot. So then I'm like, wow

19:51.760 --> 19:55.760
So I take all of his stuff that he needs to do his podcast out in living room where it's not so hot and I

19:55.760 --> 19:59.480
Can see what I'm doing and plug it in out there and still not working

19:59.480 --> 20:02.720
So then I start taking individual parts out as the video card was at the RAM

20:02.720 --> 20:07.080
Is it the so finally I get down to just the motherboard and I read on the motherboards website that

20:07.360 --> 20:14.260
Supposedly the motherboard is supposed to be able to update from the BIOS if you plug into a special secret super secret USB port

20:14.520 --> 20:18.640
Yes, I heard of such things. I download actually I didn't download it. It asked the beard to do it beard downloads

20:19.360 --> 20:21.360
Onto the US that's the same as I did

20:22.720 --> 20:25.280
By the way, I was not the one that picked this stuff out so I

20:25.280 --> 20:28.660
I we've done we download this stuff onto the USB port

20:28.740 --> 20:33.460
Under the USB flash drive and I stick it in the computer turns on for like three seconds and powers off then turns on for

20:33.460 --> 20:39.540
Three seconds and powers off then turns out three seconds and powers off. That is no good. Well, that's not updating well, so

20:40.300 --> 20:44.900
Then I'm like, well, let's just open the second motherboard because we got two of these and let's see if the second one is any

20:44.900 --> 20:48.780
Different right? Well, that's good troubleshooting. It's having the second one and by this time I'm like

20:49.740 --> 20:51.740
stinking

20:51.740 --> 20:53.740
I

20:54.140 --> 20:57.260
Hold on if you have easier phone in your pocket, no

20:58.940 --> 21:01.980
You could just play it but of course we'd have to beep it though a lot. Yeah

21:02.660 --> 21:04.860
Hmm, maybe we'll save it for another time

21:04.860 --> 21:07.380
There's a lot of swearing but it would be really great to play it. But okay

21:07.380 --> 21:07.700
All right

21:07.700 --> 21:13.460
So I was less than please because by now it's like so this is of course we always figured to do this stuff at like

21:13.460 --> 21:15.380
You know five in the morning

21:15.380 --> 21:20.540
That's the most productive time and Rekai's upset. I didn't I would I see upset about it

21:20.540 --> 21:22.660
What I didn't three under the bus

21:24.380 --> 21:28.060
Anyway, so anyway, so what I did home no, so what I did was I

21:29.900 --> 21:31.800
What I did was I

21:31.800 --> 21:36.260
Opened the second one up and realized that the second one is just as defective as the first one now

21:36.260 --> 21:42.300
I'm not very happy about this entire process and I just you're telling me we had

21:42.780 --> 21:45.380
We had two defective gigabyte motherboards

21:45.380 --> 21:50.140
Like I mean like the first little thought that Chris you're not gonna date. Here's what I here's what I here's the message

21:50.140 --> 21:52.140
I get Chris. You're not gonna be happy

21:52.380 --> 21:59.620
I'm like what both motherboards are dead. I'm like, I'm like no not both motherboards something wrong. No, not both motherboards

21:59.620 --> 22:04.740
He's like, yeah, trust us. We've tried it. So and you know, you got a feel for Noah here Noah

22:04.740 --> 22:10.020
Here, let's all right. So a disclaimer. This was never ended to enter. It was it was never intended to air

22:11.020 --> 22:14.180
It's all right. It's all right. I don't care Rekai can bleep, right?

22:15.060 --> 22:17.660
Or maybe for maybe we should just say for the next

22:17.660 --> 22:21.940
How long is this clip? That's about two minutes. So just if you have small children around

22:22.500 --> 22:25.420
Turn this up. I usually try to keep it pretty family-friendly

22:25.420 --> 22:27.980
No, you gotta understand this is like three in the morning five in the morning

22:27.980 --> 22:30.980
Okay, and I have to get up and do last the next day because of course we don't plan this

22:30.980 --> 22:34.300
This is Saturday night and so and this is all there's a lot there

22:34.360 --> 22:35.060
You know

22:35.060 --> 22:41.580
Basically if this Linux big build doesn't work out we might end up having to switch to a Mac for this work and that that

22:41.580 --> 22:45.620
Is really I think what is driving Noah's passion about right and so then I will climb a clock tower

22:45.620 --> 22:51.180
And I don't want to climb a clock tower. All right, so you've been warned. Okay for your ears earmuffs put on your

22:52.380 --> 22:56.640
Okay, let me show you why you should never buy a fucking gigabyte motherboard

22:57.540 --> 22:59.820
You're supposed to be able to update this son of a bitch

23:01.580 --> 23:06.360
By plugging a fucking flash drive into the white thing what you should just

23:10.340 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, I should but I'm too pissed to record it for the show

23:13.000 --> 23:15.700
Oh, you notice the fan spins up

23:17.020 --> 23:19.020
And then it stops

23:20.060 --> 23:21.700
And then it stops

23:21.700 --> 23:24.260
Then it spins up and then it stops

23:24.860 --> 23:29.420
So I have been stripping components because they're but we we're two of these goddamn things

23:29.820 --> 23:35.740
And I this one I got completely assembled because I'm used to using Asus that just fucking works

23:35.740 --> 23:43.420
And then we bought these two fucking things. I didn't buy them Chris bought them. Ooh about this but

23:45.580 --> 23:52.260
It just does this just they start up and stop and so we have researched the fuck out of them apparently

23:53.540 --> 23:59.640
They just fucking blow and so they just restart constantly even with all the components removed. I mean I put the RAM back in but

23:59.640 --> 24:04.980
Fucking blows. No, so don't buy gigabyte ever

24:06.240 --> 24:07.660
particularly the

24:07.660 --> 24:09.660
The hell's this goddamn piece of shit

24:10.260 --> 24:12.260
x99 SLI

24:12.700 --> 24:14.700
trash total trash

24:15.840 --> 24:17.840
Merry Christmas

24:18.500 --> 24:25.420
So that was my not never intended to be aired but like I was like, you know, you know people don't understand

24:25.420 --> 24:26.900
You know when you spend from you know

24:26.900 --> 24:33.180
9 10 p.m. Until 4 or 5 in the morning and then you know, and then constantly there's this there's this threat of

24:33.780 --> 24:36.940
The antithesis of your being being the only alternative

24:37.700 --> 24:42.420
that I that you get to a point you get really driven to get something done and then and then when you realize that you

24:42.420 --> 24:47.140
Are being cock-blocked not by not by the inability of your operating system

24:47.140 --> 24:52.360
which is supposed to be where the troubleshooting and problem is supposed to be no you are being cock-blocked by a

24:52.360 --> 24:59.700
a totally useless manufacturer that manufactures something that is better suited to adjusting the height of your monitor then functioning as an entire

25:00.100 --> 25:03.260
System board to connect all of your components not even very good at that

25:03.260 --> 25:08.020
It's no because it doesn't turn out it would the best thing I could do with it was it was it was a decent

25:08.940 --> 25:10.580
Nightlight, that's really what it was good for

25:10.580 --> 25:13.700
So basically then and really I like Chris is laughing

25:13.700 --> 25:18.580
But it honestly has caused him a lot of stress and trouble because now he has to the burdens on money to get new

25:18.580 --> 25:24.220
A replacements of that and of course those come and UPS is so incompetent that they managed to break one of those kind of sort

25:24.220 --> 25:26.500
of we're kind of in the process of dealing with that and so

25:27.180 --> 25:29.500
You know, it's very very well

25:29.500 --> 25:33.620
Maybe that I may end up ordering a third one because I think at this point it's Chris has tapped out

25:33.660 --> 25:39.000
So but to until we have a chance to return all of these things and of course if you've ever ordered anything with new egg

25:39.000 --> 25:42.820
You know that they're not as awesome as Amazon where I can just tell them that it didn't work and then they take it back

25:42.820 --> 25:45.300
No, there's got to be a process and I probably have to send it to gigabyte

25:45.300 --> 25:48.620
and they're gonna tell me that I did something wrong and try and update something and I'm gonna tell them that they can take their

25:49.900 --> 25:51.900
motherboard and

25:52.380 --> 25:55.180
Yeah, exactly or they can stick it in their ear and then

25:55.700 --> 25:58.800
They and then they can take that and then get rid of it cuz I don't really want to look at it anymore

25:59.300 --> 26:04.260
But I think when we get done we depend on a positive note when we get done

26:04.260 --> 26:06.780
I think what we're gonna find is that Chris is going to have

26:07.220 --> 26:12.620
Two amazing machines that are going to fundamentally change the way that we're able to do productions here in the studio

26:12.620 --> 26:15.340
But I think it will all be worth the headache and troubles. Uh,

26:15.340 --> 26:41.940
Yeah, I think that I think it's all content and at the end of the day it's all come on guys you're in my house

26:46.260 --> 26:52.260
It's been crazy it's been crazy. It's the Linux fest Northwest. You guys know it's coming up. We are preparing like another website

26:52.260 --> 26:57.260
I know it is just makes me happy. You know, we were I think it was hand that asked me on the way back from

26:57.260 --> 27:00.800
Picking him up in Idaho. He said why is it in Bellingham and not Seattle?

27:01.420 --> 27:06.580
And I think that might probably crosses a lot of people's mind because when you think of this area you think of you think of

27:06.580 --> 27:08.580
Seattle and the Space Needle and all that crap

27:08.780 --> 27:14.040
Well, first of all, it's I think the core reason is because it's put on by the Bellingham Linux users group

27:14.040 --> 27:16.580
you know, we have a virtual lug here and

27:17.380 --> 27:23.100
They have a real they have a have a real lug there and I think this is one of the things

27:23.100 --> 27:26.620
It's pretty unique about the Linux community and other open source

27:27.060 --> 27:29.380
communities now as well that have taken a page from this is

27:30.260 --> 27:35.300
They are capable of putting on events like Linux fest Northwest self scale and you know

27:35.300 --> 27:39.860
Of course a bunch of others that I I don't go to as well. Obviously, it's pretty impressive. Yeah

27:39.860 --> 27:45.340
Yeah, it really is. And so that's one of the reasons why it's in Bellingham, but it is genuinely one of the prettiest areas

27:45.340 --> 27:46.780
in the country

27:46.780 --> 27:48.300
It is really

27:48.300 --> 27:51.140
Yeah, it is great. You know, it is truly gorgeous there

27:51.140 --> 27:55.900
And if you have an opportunity to make it out, it is really worth it meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

27:55.900 --> 27:59.480
We have a meetup page. We're gonna be organizing the switch competition, which you guys know is coming up

28:00.180 --> 28:05.500
Even though Emma's been Emma hacked us last week during the Linux action show. It was rough. We got hacked art by team Emma

28:05.500 --> 28:10.220
And they've been out in Denver, Colorado good. They've been practicing Denver, Colorado teams

28:11.580 --> 28:15.700
You know, there's you know, as you know, there's betting taking place behind the scenes here in JB

28:16.860 --> 28:18.380
Yeah, yeah

28:18.380 --> 28:25.140
I am I I have a I I have a lot riding on this also we in today in tech talk today

28:25.860 --> 28:29.140
We decided that if we got to a certain level of patrons on

28:29.820 --> 28:33.540
Patreon.com slash today that no one I would wear he'd wear a window shirt and I'll wear an Apple shirt

28:33.540 --> 28:39.540
Yeah. Yeah, so that's in tech talk today. If you guys curious about that. Yeah, we're really we're looking fun

28:39.540 --> 28:45.780
And we have more crew showing up tomorrow, which is pretty exciting with so there is a project out there

28:46.020 --> 28:51.660
that promises to bring Libre office C file the KDE group and

28:52.540 --> 28:58.780
Maybe so I'm guessing some own cloud back-end code bring it all together to give you a Google Docs and Google apps like experience

28:58.780 --> 29:03.700
Using all Libre software, so we're going to talk about that because you and I were poking at this

29:04.660 --> 29:07.660
Noah's been poking at this and I want to talk about it for a little bit

29:07.660 --> 29:10.420
So and it's probably something you could run on a digital ocean droplet

29:10.420 --> 29:10.860
Oh, yeah

29:10.860 --> 29:13.500
Hey, oh if you think about anything if you think about it

29:13.500 --> 29:19.480
You probably could do unplugged as our promo code to use over digital ocean, you know as you're gearing up for Ubuntu 1604

29:19.480 --> 29:25.680
You'll notice that they have new guides coming out on Ubuntu 1604. It is a great hosting provider built on top of Linux

29:25.680 --> 29:29.740
They use KVM for the virtualizer SSDs for all the drives tier one bandwidth

29:29.740 --> 29:35.700
They have locations all over the world if you want to deploy images or entire application stacks or just docker containers. Oh

29:38.020 --> 29:42.940
Digital ocean has got that do unplugged is the promo code one word ten dollar credit now their basic rig

29:43.820 --> 29:45.380
$5 a month

29:45.380 --> 29:46.940
That's nothing

29:46.940 --> 29:49.420
$5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM

29:49.420 --> 29:55.580
I owe a terabyte a transfer 20 gigabyte SSD because they all SSDs and I love the fact that it is

29:55.820 --> 30:01.500
Blazing fast even though even the $5 rig is blazing fast like log in there and do a package update and just

30:01.740 --> 30:05.880
Just just update the package cache and witness the gorgeous speed that you get

30:05.880 --> 30:08.380
I love awesome, you know, I've been playing around with track car

30:08.380 --> 30:12.620
It was obvious to put that up on a digital ocean droplet when I wanted to convince know to use sync thing

30:12.620 --> 30:16.100
You know what? He does he puts it up on a digital ocean droplet natural and like an animal

30:16.100 --> 30:20.740
He just FTP's up to the digital ocean droplet and then let's it sync to me like some kind of animal

30:20.740 --> 30:22.820
I hope that's SFTP

30:24.540 --> 30:29.440
Me too Wes me too. Hey Wes, did you know that they have introduced now don't tell anybody

30:30.060 --> 30:35.980
But did you know they have introduced a sign up for the block storage program? Oh, yeah, I think that's gonna be really cool

30:36.060 --> 30:39.460
Yeah, and like I was sign up right now like I was mentioning earlier

30:39.460 --> 30:43.700
They do have great tutorials now like how to upgrade to a boon to 16 before how to take it engine X and let's a crypt

30:43.700 --> 30:48.940
I'm 1604 and go look at their new command-line client to manage your digital ocean. I'm so excited about that

30:48.940 --> 30:55.700
I know I know me too drop down terminal has never been happier digital ocean comm just use the promo code D

30:58.100 --> 31:00.100
Unplugged use it just like that

31:00.380 --> 31:06.260
Do you unplugged over a digital ocean comm one word and you can sing it when you type it in that also it doesn't give

31:06.260 --> 31:08.260
you a more like

31:08.380 --> 31:10.220
credit on the account

31:10.220 --> 31:13.500
But it makes you feel good. Oh, it really does make you feel deal

31:15.020 --> 31:16.220
Unplugged

31:16.220 --> 31:17.500
one word

31:17.500 --> 31:22.540
digital ocean comm all right, so this week on the Linux action show

31:23.780 --> 31:27.060
We had a candidate that we bumped

31:27.580 --> 31:30.940
We were gonna talk about this online libre office

31:31.500 --> 31:34.300
thing that exists it's called

31:34.300 --> 31:40.140
Open 365 dot IO obviously a take on office 365 create

31:40.140 --> 31:47.260
It says create the first open-source cloud with libre office online online libre office online plus C file plus KDE

31:48.060 --> 31:53.340
Yeah, yeah, it promises to bring like libre to the online web space

31:54.380 --> 31:55.860
Oh

31:55.860 --> 31:58.060
You know what I got to do. I got to hook up the audio so you get well

31:58.060 --> 32:00.820
You don't really need the audio you can hear the audio in the background

32:00.820 --> 32:06.780
I so tell me West though when you look at that does that does that remind you of own cloud a little bit it really does

32:06.780 --> 32:09.700
Yeah, I'm so I'm thinking they must be using some own cloud on the back end

32:09.700 --> 32:14.020
They're using C file for the file distribution now. I know no you and I had it

32:14.020 --> 32:17.940
We're looking at this too. What were your impressions of this sort of online libre office thing here?

32:17.980 --> 32:23.980
You know my thing is that I've actually I've been excited about office 365 simply because it runs perfectly fine on Linux and so those

32:23.980 --> 32:30.260
The dorks that insist on using office products that don't want to use a real office suite, then I have a solution for

32:30.860 --> 32:36.300
but the more that I use things like like giggly docs and the more I use things like

32:36.620 --> 32:42.780
Office 365 I find myself thinking you know for certain collaboration things and for certain you know I just need access to

32:42.900 --> 32:47.060
You know to compose a document a little bit note more than what you know a traditional note-taking

32:47.500 --> 32:52.820
Application offers that is the kind of time where I really want would like to have a cloud-based office suite

32:52.820 --> 32:59.340
And it's not something that would be a primary driver, but it's definitely something that I would be using to you know

32:59.620 --> 33:01.300
Maybe maybe even for showdocs

33:01.300 --> 33:03.700
I'm probably not because there's probably not markdown support

33:03.700 --> 33:08.500
But certainly if you know you could add that you and I were collaborating on a letter a couple days ago

33:08.500 --> 33:12.060
And that would have been really useful to be able to have this you know all this thing opposed

33:12.060 --> 33:14.380
And you can make edits, and I can make edits and stuff like that

33:14.380 --> 33:17.880
We can keep you know the you know the rich text formats and stuff like that. Yeah

33:17.880 --> 33:23.960
Yeah, and not having to have Google Drive would be nice. I think what what I find what I find sort of

33:24.200 --> 33:27.920
interesting about this and also sort of off-putting at the same time is

33:28.920 --> 33:32.640
It clearly seems like you're bringing a Qt application or something like this

33:33.560 --> 33:35.800
Into the web browser. Yeah, that's weird

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
Like it's got the full regular menu

33:38.400 --> 33:43.320
It's got a file menu and edit menu a view menu like it's LibreOffice embedded in the website

33:43.320 --> 33:46.120
and I guess what what strikes me about that is

33:46.120 --> 33:47.480
Hmm

33:47.480 --> 33:50.120
Look at that though. Yeah, it does seem very functional

33:50.200 --> 33:56.480
It does seem very functional, but what strikes me about it is it doesn't seem forward-facing. It seems like right

33:56.680 --> 33:58.680
It's sort of what we have now. It's not

33:59.320 --> 34:02.880
Trying new things that work. Yeah, and I mean not to be this guy

34:03.040 --> 34:09.000
But if I have my bqabuntu touch tablet this doesn't really look like it's gonna work in that

34:09.680 --> 34:11.480
I it

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
feels a little bit like

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
bringing a

34:16.480 --> 34:23.080
Another desktop environments application over to say your desktop environment just something's quite not quite there about it

34:23.800 --> 34:25.440
gigglydocs

34:25.440 --> 34:27.080
Zoho and

34:27.080 --> 34:29.920
Others they feel like they should be online

34:30.760 --> 34:34.760
document editors that feels like you've taken a web desktop application and

34:35.080 --> 34:41.120
Integrated it into own cloud and called it something that stuff looks like it's web, but you're right once you start editing. Yeah. Yeah

34:41.120 --> 34:45.480
Yeah, I'm curious. I'm curious if anyone in the Mamba room has had a chance to look at this at all

34:45.480 --> 34:49.800
And if you guys have any opinions on it because it's it's been getting some press coverage recently

34:49.800 --> 34:51.920
And we've been debating whether to cover it in the shows or not

34:54.360 --> 34:57.080
Yeah, I don't think anybody's really played within our community

34:57.800 --> 35:02.500
But Noah, and I were you know this one thing that really jumps out at me about it is if I could self-host it

35:03.360 --> 35:09.200
Hmm. I probably would prepare the show most the time on my desktop device anyways mm-hmm. Yep

35:09.200 --> 35:15.320
I mean, so if I can self-host it. Yeah, you know we switched over to pretty much using simple note no, and I have to prep

35:15.320 --> 35:16.960
last and

35:16.960 --> 35:21.000
It just gets a simpler cleaner faster environment

35:21.000 --> 35:25.560
And we both prefer having a dedicated desktop application to do this so nice

35:25.560 --> 35:27.560
That's one of the things is I I guess

35:27.880 --> 35:33.200
I'm I'm ready for us to move beyond cloud integration meaning. It's something that's embedded in your web browser

35:33.200 --> 35:35.880
I think okay. I think I'm getting to the core of what bothers me about this

35:35.880 --> 35:38.520
I think this is a great idea, and I'm really glad they're doing it

35:38.520 --> 35:45.080
but when I get to the core of what bothers me about it is I am I am I'm ready for all of the features of

35:45.080 --> 35:48.080
cloud integration and syncing to be just

35:49.320 --> 35:51.240
Part of a desktop experience. Yep

35:51.240 --> 35:57.280
I want something like simple note and Chrome web browser that seems to be fully in sync with a back-end cloud service

35:57.280 --> 36:01.840
But the front-end representation the way that that way that result is displayed to me is a native

36:02.160 --> 36:08.320
Application that looks right in my desktop environment, and I don't want to have to run a runtime of my browser

36:08.320 --> 36:10.800
I don't want my browser to become my runtime and

36:11.720 --> 36:16.400
If that's if that even means that things like electron projects sort of hide all of that from me

36:16.400 --> 36:21.480
Then they split they still accomplish that well, okay. I'm gonna try to build my next rig with more RAM

36:21.480 --> 36:23.480
I mean, I'm ready for that. Let's bring it

36:23.960 --> 36:24.880
But I want it

36:24.880 --> 36:27.400
I want it in a desktop experience not crammed into a web page

36:27.400 --> 36:33.560
And I think that's kind of what where this gets all the desktop integrations and full support for

36:33.560 --> 36:40.960
Dragon drop and native speed native speed it launches as fast as my SSD can feed the bits to the CPU and as fast as

36:40.960 --> 36:42.280
That can be blasted to my screen

36:42.280 --> 36:47.120
I don't want anything in between that and I want it to come as fast as possible because honestly

36:47.120 --> 36:49.720
That's why I buy a new computer. That's why I build new rigs

36:49.720 --> 36:52.160
That's why I consider playing with the Linux scheduler

36:52.160 --> 36:55.120
That's why I want to do a RAM disk for my Chrome browser, right?

36:55.120 --> 36:58.760
I want it to be as fast as possible all the time. You've worked to get done

36:58.760 --> 36:59.480
That's right

36:59.480 --> 37:03.760
And so if you could make it if you could make a local native application that

37:04.960 --> 37:11.440
Instantly launches but yet pulls in the latest data from the web. That's from like an API for a cloud service

37:11.680 --> 37:17.280
I'm all about that and that's the perfect sweet spot for me mumble room any thoughts before I let Noah jump in with his thoughts

37:19.360 --> 37:21.240
All right, Noah, they don't have any thoughts

37:21.240 --> 37:25.160
Do you have any kind of closing thoughts on unlike the way that because I know one of the things you and I talked about

37:25.160 --> 37:28.160
Is well, it kind of looks like they've just take LibreOffice and put in a web browser

37:28.160 --> 37:31.040
But I have a sense that that isn't that probably doesn't bother you

37:31.320 --> 37:35.520
It doesn't bother me because if you think about it, that's I mean really that's what we look for

37:35.520 --> 37:38.440
And that's the that's the that is the very essence of open source

37:38.440 --> 37:43.600
Somebody created a really good cloud based web browser system, which is own cloud. Somebody created a really great office suite

37:43.600 --> 37:51.080
That's LibreOffice and somebody took a and B and combined them together to make office 365 and made basically a patent infringement calling it

37:51.080 --> 37:53.040
Open 365 and they'll probably have to change

37:54.040 --> 37:56.400
The great news about report on it then yeah, right

37:56.400 --> 37:59.040
But the great news about that is that we have essentially

37:59.240 --> 38:03.720
We have we've taken two great open source projects and combine them if that's in fact what they're doing and really I don't really care

38:03.720 --> 38:04.240
How they're doing it

38:04.240 --> 38:08.480
But even if nothing else the fact that we have the option at least I can tell

38:08.640 --> 38:13.160
Clients when I tell them you should switch a LibreOffice and they go well, I'm really into the office

38:13.480 --> 38:19.300
365 because I like doing everything on the web and in the cloud and that's great and it's backed up and accessible from home

38:19.300 --> 38:21.300
I have an answer to that

38:21.600 --> 38:23.440
That's about what they sound like

38:23.440 --> 38:27.720
And and it's better than Google. I don't have to ask. I don't have to tell them, you know

38:27.720 --> 38:31.800
You know how unprofessional it sounds to me to walk in and say I have a great solution for you

38:31.800 --> 38:32.680
Let me show you how we're gonna do

38:32.680 --> 38:36.440
This is how I tell people to do it what I'm going to recommend to you is I think you should

38:36.880 --> 38:41.480
Go to gmail.com and sign up for a Google account and use the bill. That just doesn't sound like that is not

38:42.200 --> 38:46.840
That's not providing a solution. And the other problem is is I have zero control

38:46.840 --> 38:50.280
It's not like Google works with me to say these are the things that are upcoming

38:50.280 --> 38:54.020
So by the way, make sure your clients are aware that this menu is going away or that menu is great

38:54.600 --> 38:56.600
you know, that's a great point because

38:57.300 --> 39:03.620
Even when you're giving them Google Drive and Google Docs and a Google Apps account if you're through business what you're really saying is

39:04.440 --> 39:09.760
Even though it's easy. Here's another service. You need to manage. Here's another service. You need to pay

39:09.840 --> 39:15.400
Here's another thing. You need to keep track of users on so that way you're not paying too much. Here's another thing xyz and

39:15.400 --> 39:22.520
When you come at them with here's an implementation as a service provider that I can give you that is an entirely managed package

39:22.680 --> 39:28.940
You write me one check a month. I take care of all user management all features all security updates all integrations

39:29.080 --> 39:34.760
Where do I sign right? That's it. And you maybe if they hope if they allow you to host this you could do that on your

39:34.760 --> 39:35.480
own

39:35.480 --> 39:37.480
So that's that's a point well taken though

39:37.760 --> 39:43.280
be interesting to see if it sees deploys to wear something where like, you know, maybe paying too much for like the

39:43.280 --> 39:50.560
365 hosted in the secure data center where you have like really secure documents and you need you want the features of 365

39:50.560 --> 39:53.560
Yeah, you need it to be internal to your land, you know, I wonder

39:54.000 --> 39:59.280
North Ranger could this be something that local ISPs and different people in this space could come up and say hey

39:59.280 --> 40:03.520
Yeah, you've heard of Google, but what about this and they could sell it. Is that kind of what you're thinking North Ranger?

40:03.520 --> 40:08.800
Yeah from what you've just described. I think back in the day when you used to sign up for an ISP

40:08.800 --> 40:15.560
It was your local ISP. They offered you email. They maybe offered you a shell account, you know, so

40:16.120 --> 40:16.760
You know

40:16.760 --> 40:21.560
Maybe it's not the actual ISP that you have because apparently today's ISPs are more

40:21.880 --> 40:25.140
Interested in bundling a phone and a TV with you

40:25.280 --> 40:31.080
But let's move ISPs more to like a VPS provider where you not only have email

40:31.080 --> 40:34.200
but oh, by the way, we'll host your sync account or

40:35.120 --> 40:37.440
your calendar or your photos and

40:37.440 --> 40:42.040
You know use I'm not saying you have to use own cloud

40:42.040 --> 40:45.920
But something like that where you know, you can be you can host it yourself

40:46.720 --> 40:48.720
but when you go offline or

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
You know whatever like your ISP can you know have the canonical copy so to speak?

40:54.800 --> 40:58.520
That's it. That's actually an interesting idea and also maybe a great way

40:58.880 --> 41:02.640
What I what I would what I would love about that kind of business is

41:02.640 --> 41:08.560
It's a way for open source to get deployments. It's a way for a company to make money using open source software

41:08.560 --> 41:11.640
And then that means fixes or start going upstream bug reports start coming in

41:12.360 --> 41:15.960
Yeah, and it doesn't answer all your security, you know problems

41:15.960 --> 41:18.600
But at least in it like your ISP is someone you pay, you know

41:18.600 --> 41:19.880
Like that's in their interest to help you out

41:19.880 --> 41:21.440
So it should at least you know

41:21.440 --> 41:28.480
They're not necessarily doing all the kind of my data mining that someone else might be now shots were fired in native versus web apps rotten

41:28.480 --> 41:33.960
Do you want to close out the thought on just commenting on that a lot of the times?

41:34.720 --> 41:41.120
The web apps actually look really nice and I don't really care if it's native or not as long as it doesn't look like garbage

41:41.600 --> 41:45.960
So if it if it's if it's gonna run like an electron thing

41:45.960 --> 41:48.600
I'd prefer it not because it's not gonna be as fast

41:49.080 --> 41:54.040
But at least they look good and they run well, so I'm okay with it. What happens?

41:54.040 --> 41:55.840
What do you do rotten when you have two?

41:55.840 --> 42:00.240
Replications that are web apps and you need to move back and forth them and you're moving data back and forth now

42:00.240 --> 42:04.960
I've got if I like these I think that works if you're using one or maybe even two

42:04.960 --> 42:07.720
but when you start to get a plethora when I had

42:08.200 --> 42:13.240
When I had own cloud and I had Evernote and I had you know Google Docs and I had you know

42:13.240 --> 42:17.120
Whatever else you start to get like four or five different these web apps open wonder list for example

42:17.800 --> 42:24.000
Moving between them is almost like they're I start to eliminate the ability of the operating system to manage my window

42:24.000 --> 42:27.820
So I can't don't have you know along the side of unity. I can't switch between those applications now

42:27.820 --> 42:30.040
I have to rely on the tab switching inside of the web browser

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Well to be fair

42:33.040 --> 42:35.440
There are window managers that can do that

42:35.800 --> 42:42.760
But I would say that the art that that example is not very good because all of those essentially accomplish the same thing

42:43.260 --> 42:48.000
So I think the issue is that you are using multiple like you Evernote and Google Docs and stuff

42:48.000 --> 42:49.440
They're basically all the same

42:49.440 --> 42:55.440
So if you were using a to-do list editor or a to-do list web app and then a web app for like telegram

42:55.560 --> 43:00.300
Those would be completely different things. You wouldn't have to have that but I actually do kind of synthesize synthesize

43:00.300 --> 43:03.620
I do actually kind of connect with what Noah is saying because

43:04.040 --> 43:08.000
I have found myself like ripping tabs off all the time and all right

43:08.000 --> 43:08.480
Oh, yeah

43:08.480 --> 43:12.560
Me too this tab goes on this monitor now and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll put this tab over here

43:12.560 --> 43:15.240
I'll put that I'll shrink this tab and I'll float in them on top

43:15.240 --> 43:20.680
Yeah, it's getting to be the point now where and the other thing I find myself doing in all the time now is right now

43:20.680 --> 43:23.040
I have three tabs pinned. I always have at least three tabs up

43:23.040 --> 43:28.600
Yeah, it's getting to be right there and and and I started to feel like they're forcing me to live a Chrome OS existence

43:28.600 --> 43:30.120
a little bit

43:30.120 --> 43:34.680
Well, they kind of are but there's also solutions in Linux

43:35.320 --> 43:37.400
native applications that can provide a

43:37.960 --> 43:43.020
you know direct connection with a window manager for example instead of having like the tabs being splayed out and then you have like

43:43.020 --> 43:45.020
multiple different Chrome

43:47.660 --> 43:54.660
There's a couple different options too that I've used to basically give a dedicated process to each web app, right?

43:54.660 --> 43:59.100
We talked about that last year with the yeah, apricity and that's nice that works

44:00.380 --> 44:04.780
For one apricity is actually using something that's still using Chrome, right?

44:06.060 --> 44:11.980
Created by peppermint OS which is interesting. You should check that out. But the the reason I

44:11.980 --> 44:13.980
Was talking about is that?

44:14.340 --> 44:17.460
Chromium's web app solution is terrible

44:17.860 --> 44:24.100
You have one session that is still like every single web app you make with chromium or with ice

44:24.100 --> 44:29.500
It's still one session. So it's not organized at all. It's not separated. It's all just in math

44:29.500 --> 44:33.300
I've run into that problem connected with that group if you look at epiphany and

44:34.100 --> 44:36.100
Midori both of those have

44:36.100 --> 44:41.860
Web app built in so they're all separate individual sessions for each web app you create. There's an

44:42.500 --> 44:45.700
Web app manager for each one of those and there's also

44:46.260 --> 44:50.220
Ubuntu has their own browser that you can use that was created for the Ubuntu touch

44:50.220 --> 44:50.460
Yeah

44:50.460 --> 44:54.420
But also works on the desktop and you can do the same thing and create different sessions

44:54.420 --> 45:00.540
So they become like real processes as also it's also interesting to see like a lot of different open source

45:00.540 --> 45:08.540
Wrapper applications, like what's that? What's that slack one called scud or something, right? Yeah, there's different and then Noah and I were playing with a

45:08.540 --> 45:09.540
messenger

45:10.540 --> 45:12.540
Application that is just a web app

45:12.540 --> 45:19.820
And what it does is it uses one application and multiple tabs to integrate every messaging service from slack to telegram to what's-app

45:19.820 --> 45:24.860
Everything that has any kind of web Skype anything has any web app all in one application

45:24.860 --> 45:28.140
and that's kind of interesting because then it takes care of like

45:28.140 --> 45:34.540
Now notification badges and stuff like that for you for all those different services, but and brykes it off into its own process

45:34.540 --> 45:36.060
Which is kind of interesting

45:36.060 --> 45:41.540
There was one that was created a couple years ago for Linux. That was awesome. And then it was discontinued. It was called fogger

45:42.220 --> 45:46.140
Yeah, I know I did and you know, and and that's sort of why I've tried to recreate

45:47.060 --> 45:49.060
Just using the the built-in Chrome thing

45:49.740 --> 45:54.740
But yeah, you're right. It's not it's not the same. Yeah, and sometimes I'll use some stuff and yeah

45:54.740 --> 45:57.060
If they made the sessions properly, it would be great

45:57.060 --> 46:02.340
But like the fact that if you create a Netflix session if you open it in Chrome or you open it in the web app

46:02.340 --> 46:05.940
It's still the same thing. So you're still in the same sessions

46:05.940 --> 46:07.540
You can't have like for example

46:07.540 --> 46:11.140
If you have two different Twitter accounts that you want to open up Twitter

46:11.140 --> 46:15.140
You can't log into the separately with the chromium solution

46:15.140 --> 46:19.140
But if you did it with like epiphany or you did it with Midori you can do that

46:19.140 --> 46:24.540
And I think the Midori is probably one of the best options. Yeah, I

46:24.940 --> 46:29.740
Try I tried Midori for a little while in it. I was starting to get it eventually would run out of memory. Listen

46:30.740 --> 46:33.340
let's class it up in here for a second because I

46:34.740 --> 46:41.060
Want to open the floodgates I want to talk about our Ubuntu 1604 review. I've gotten

46:41.060 --> 46:46.940
Thanks, nice, I've already gotten like several like geez you and Noah really got into it kind of comments

46:46.940 --> 46:50.340
And they don't even know the half of it. We got into it again today just out in the living room

46:51.940 --> 46:55.140
So we got to talk about this so we got it we got to bring it up a notch

46:57.140 --> 47:02.740
Got a clear space for our discussion. So first I want to thank Linux Academy

47:02.740 --> 47:04.740
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

47:04.740 --> 47:11.460
Got a clear space for our discussion. So first I want to thank Linux Academy

47:11.460 --> 47:15.700
I want to welcome them into this episode of Linux unplugged episode 141

47:16.620 --> 47:20.940
why don't you welcome them to at linux academy.com slash unplugged go there and

47:22.180 --> 47:27.140
Celebrate their support of your unplugged program by visiting linux academy.com slash unplugged

47:27.140 --> 47:29.780
Not only will you get their new discount that they've just rolled out

47:30.420 --> 47:32.420
brand new pricing structure

47:32.420 --> 47:35.660
But you can learn more about their

47:37.100 --> 47:39.100
2369 self-paced courses

47:39.820 --> 47:47.020
Instructing married you're gonna learn something. I mean it rubs by accident accidentally learning at linuxacademy.com slash

47:53.060 --> 47:56.780
Scenario based labs are totally badass because they put you in the middle of something that's real

47:56.780 --> 48:00.660
God damn it. What is you just crew at least all of today?

48:04.780 --> 48:08.540
If that doesn't work they have instructor mentor which I think you're gonna need you

48:09.020 --> 48:15.220
For listening to this, but they'll set you right and you'll learn but remember it doesn't matter what we say because the music class

48:18.620 --> 48:22.220
Just want you to know while this music is on but I don't hate you I

48:22.220 --> 48:26.980
I think you're wrong about a bunch you but we can still be friends you can use arch

48:27.460 --> 48:33.760
Yeah, except for I did back you into agreeing with me earlier. Anyways, Linux academy.com slash unplug go there learn about their great and server exercises

48:34.260 --> 48:35.900
developing Linux

48:35.900 --> 48:40.500
Applications learning about Linux firewalls and fundamentals routing all those things

48:41.140 --> 48:45.880
Python development PHP opens that great chef tutorials up there. Thank you for mentioning that you're right

48:45.880 --> 48:52.420
They are really good ones Amazon Web Services and the server is included. Oh, man. I know right? It's great

48:52.660 --> 48:54.660
7-plus distros. It's

48:55.100 --> 48:58.740
It's a wonderland Linux Academy comm slash unplug go invest in yourself

48:58.740 --> 49:04.980
Learn more about Linux from the basics to the advanced topics and they are crushing the open stack courses right now. Check them out

49:05.820 --> 49:07.820
at Linux Academy comm

49:08.060 --> 49:14.520
Slash unplugged. All right, we're headed out of here. It is time for us to follow up on our Ubuntu 1604

49:14.520 --> 49:16.460
review

49:16.460 --> 49:22.480
Now there are many things to discuss in regards to this review and I want to cover all of them as much as we can

49:22.480 --> 49:28.480
If you have not had a chance, it's not a prerequisite, but I would invite you to listen to episode 413 or watch

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
episode 413 of the Linux action show

49:31.720 --> 49:36.400
Where we did our review and just as a background because I don't know if I really went into this in the show or not

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
but uh

49:39.000 --> 49:45.400
Basically every machine in my life except for that one right there that bonobo got reloaded to Ubuntu 1604 Wow

49:45.720 --> 49:51.420
Ubuntu edition was the one I ran with the longest and then I put the neon packages on there because I loves me the

49:51.420 --> 49:53.420
fresh neon and

49:53.520 --> 49:58.360
It I guessed actually going back for they really started the day. I got the Apollo. Yep. I

49:59.160 --> 50:05.800
Got I got really excited by what a good implementation of Ubuntu Mate 1510 on the Apollo was and then as soon as it felt

50:05.800 --> 50:12.280
Reasonable, I brought that up to 1604 and then I started bringing all my other machines to 1604 and yeah

50:13.240 --> 50:18.440
And so I spent you know, I spent a real solid month in Ubuntu

50:18.440 --> 50:21.560
which for me was a big transition again going back and

50:22.960 --> 50:26.640
But part of the reason I wanted to do it is because I really wanted to spend

50:26.960 --> 50:28.960
You know when you just do it for a couple of days

50:29.160 --> 50:33.240
You get totally overwhelmed by all the little rough edges that are just different, you know

50:33.240 --> 50:36.680
Just because it's not it's not comfortable and familiar. It just it feels abrasive

50:37.080 --> 50:42.360
But if you actually spend time with it you you learn. Oh, yeah, I do it this way this now and the true character

50:42.360 --> 50:46.160
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and so, you know, I really wanted to give it its due

50:46.160 --> 50:51.200
and so when we walked away I walked away with some some impressions that I had reflected on for that whole month and

50:52.000 --> 50:55.320
That would those definitely took the stage of the review

50:55.320 --> 50:58.600
I think that the bulk of the stage, but there's a lot of things covered in the

50:59.280 --> 51:01.520
1604 review and I was curious Wes

51:01.520 --> 51:05.000
If you why don't we do this if you be up for this?

51:06.480 --> 51:09.040
Let's get your impressions sort of at the top

51:09.960 --> 51:11.960
Then let's go to the mumble room

51:12.200 --> 51:17.120
Get some of their updates and follow-up and their impressions and then towards the end of this shenanigans

51:17.520 --> 51:19.520
Let's talk about some of the things that have changed

51:20.120 --> 51:25.400
Already or fixed already since Sunday's episode of the show so it like a full spectrum coverage

51:25.400 --> 51:33.320
So as follow-up to our 1604 review Wes, what are your sort of out of the first gate impressions of this brand new?

51:33.320 --> 51:37.200
LTS release. Okay, so first for context both in work and kind of at home

51:37.640 --> 51:43.720
I both skip to work the 1404 release and then that I use that at home, but I didn't use too much

51:43.720 --> 51:46.560
So I guess this is kind of a this is kind of like for

51:47.120 --> 51:52.280
For you a huge upgrade. Yeah, it really is a huge upgrade. That's an interesting perspective

51:52.280 --> 51:57.400
So you've been stuck at 1204 for years and a majority, you know, I use some 1404

51:57.400 --> 52:01.240
I do have like one system at 1510, but but yes, there's a lot of 1204 and so

52:01.760 --> 52:04.200
There there's so much new and so much I'm excited about

52:04.200 --> 52:08.640
I mean, I've used Ubuntu on system D before but I just I love doing you know

52:08.640 --> 52:12.680
System control status and just seeing that breakdown. It's I'm really excited to see it at servers on work

52:13.800 --> 52:18.080
Now did you play with the in-between ones? Yeah, I played with them a little bit. Okay, you just didn't use them wise

52:18.080 --> 52:20.760
I just yeah, I didn't really deploy them. Yeah, and I'm kind of in the same boat

52:20.760 --> 52:25.100
I mean, I didn't I traditionally just stick to the LTS, right, you know

52:25.100 --> 52:29.520
And so and and it seems like a good point right now where when once it's out

52:29.520 --> 52:32.160
It'll have it'll have fresh packages for quite some time

52:32.160 --> 52:37.480
And then you have the snap packages and you have CFS right there. Have you played with CFS on 1604?

52:37.480 --> 52:43.940
I haven't on 1604, but I've used it, you know building it myself or loading myself. Okay, it's on a third party

52:44.480 --> 52:49.680
On earlier version. So like I'm really excited also about like LXD 2.0, which just came out

52:49.680 --> 52:54.920
Uh-huh. I like LXD. I like I like that model and Ubuntu supports it very well

52:54.920 --> 52:59.440
Yeah, so do you use a lot of this? So do you use a lot of other desktop environments other than just unity?

52:59.680 --> 53:03.200
Yeah, I almost never use unity really. So I'm trying it out right now. It's not bad

53:03.720 --> 53:08.160
The animations are pretty slick and it's definitely I've seen the touch-ups from what I'm used to, you know

53:08.160 --> 53:10.600
Especially seen it work a lot of the deployments before so

53:13.220 --> 53:18.200
So, you know you news nice but you know, normally I use a cinnamon a lot for Linux man, or I use a tiling window manager

53:18.200 --> 53:22.680
But I'm really excited for just having like I feel like 1604 will be a release

53:22.680 --> 53:26.520
I can deploy in almost every part of my life the places where I don't need

53:26.880 --> 53:29.560
First-hand management or where arch doesn't make the most sense, you know

53:29.560 --> 53:30.900
Maybe for less minimal stuff

53:30.900 --> 53:35.480
But but anywhere where I just need a general Linux where I know that the packages will be what I need

53:35.480 --> 53:37.040
They'll be away, especially with snap packages

53:37.040 --> 53:40.200
There'll be a way to get the software that I want and I can figure it the way I need

53:41.120 --> 53:46.920
It'll just be I'm really excited. Yeah, I that's sort of my takeaway too, and I kind of wanted to I

53:46.920 --> 53:49.000
Tied I joked a lot during the live stream

53:49.000 --> 53:54.760
I actually am kind of curious on Popey's take for it because not just be not just because he worked with

53:55.400 --> 53:56.860
Ubuntu and works at canonical

53:56.860 --> 54:01.720
but honestly because he's obviously been following this for a long time and has good insight on this and I

54:02.080 --> 54:07.760
Wonder too if if maybe these are some of the elements that he's excited about and I know I've kind of asked him to dance

54:07.760 --> 54:09.760
it like a monkey before on this topic, but I

54:09.960 --> 54:15.160
I know that the snap packages are sort of the weakest area of coverage in our review and it's sort of I feel like the

54:15.160 --> 54:19.280
Biggest long-term ramifications of 1604 and so I don't know puppy

54:19.280 --> 54:24.040
Do you have any just sort of take on our review and thoughts on it and maybe thoughts on snap packages specifically?

54:25.200 --> 54:28.120
Can't talk Chris. I'm busy playing games on 1604

54:28.760 --> 54:36.220
Nice. Yeah. Okay. You know what? That's another thing is it is a great platform for steam game. Yeah, I kid I'm joking

54:36.720 --> 54:38.720
I was actually believe

54:41.680 --> 54:43.040
But

54:43.040 --> 54:47.640
Yeah, the snap stuff, you know when I first heard about this company years ago

54:48.200 --> 54:49.400
I

54:49.400 --> 54:53.920
Was kind of skeptical because the guy who was telling me about this was outside a hotel

54:54.760 --> 54:55.360
You know

54:55.360 --> 55:01.720
We'd all had an intro to what snappy was and only a few people have been involved in what it what it was going to

55:01.720 --> 55:05.120
Be and I I didn't quite get it and it's only now

55:05.600 --> 55:10.720
that I realize how many people depend on things like a you are in arch or

55:10.720 --> 55:15.200
Your self-updating applications like Chrome

55:16.000 --> 55:20.280
And other things that just like sort themselves out and nobody nobody has to worry about it

55:20.280 --> 55:26.240
Right, and you know, we used to think that PPAs were a marvelous way to get stuff to to users

55:26.280 --> 55:31.080
But actually it's quite abrasive to get from you know

55:31.080 --> 55:36.660
I want to have the latest version of whatever atom or you know sublime or whatever

55:36.660 --> 55:43.340
Whether it's free software or proprietary. It's it's quite abrasive to get from I want that thing to

55:43.780 --> 55:46.660
getting that thing and I think

55:47.420 --> 55:52.860
snap can make that a whole lot easier and also make it so that you can

55:52.980 --> 55:59.380
Have the latest version of stuff up to date all the time on your system and that that is compelling for a lot of people

55:59.380 --> 56:02.220
Yeah, extremely and I know every year

56:02.220 --> 56:07.420
I talked to Frank about this problem from own cloud and this I'm really curious this year to say

56:07.420 --> 56:09.540
What do you think about this? What are your thoughts on this?

56:09.540 --> 56:12.500
I know they're relying right now on the open source of build service

56:12.500 --> 56:15.540
And so one of the things that we kept going around and around about is

56:16.260 --> 56:18.260
This seems maybe like a little bit

56:18.860 --> 56:25.740
Too late. Oh, it seems like maybe this should have come about but if you look at the origins of where snap packages

56:26.020 --> 56:28.020
were originally created for

56:28.020 --> 56:33.540
There is almost no no route to here without having gone through the Ubuntu phone

56:34.020 --> 56:36.020
process, right

56:36.660 --> 56:42.860
Yeah, we learn a lot from click packages on the phone and click back. That's click packages. Thank you. Yeah

56:42.860 --> 56:47.820
Yeah, so, you know, it's like I'll give you a good example. There's a developer

56:48.980 --> 56:50.460
who

56:50.460 --> 56:54.380
created a game for Ubuntu phone called balls and

56:54.380 --> 56:58.980
Hits, it's an SD. It's written in SDL to it works on the phone and

57:00.380 --> 57:04.780
He cranks out a new version once maybe twice a day

57:04.780 --> 57:08.740
Wow, he can just push a new version to the store and

57:09.260 --> 57:11.260
It's on his

57:11.540 --> 57:16.420
Customers handsets or his users or whatever you want to call them that the people who play his game

57:16.420 --> 57:21.340
He can build a new level in 15 minutes that he has to work on his game

57:21.340 --> 57:25.300
He can build a new level crank out a click package shove it in the store

57:25.540 --> 57:31.380
Then thousands of people have it straight away, right and and so that works great on the phone

57:31.380 --> 57:34.740
But you know you and I both know I'll give you a little secret, right?

57:35.220 --> 57:38.460
We don't have millions and millions of phone users, right?

57:38.460 --> 57:43.580
But we do have millions and millions of Ubuntu desktop users. So

57:44.420 --> 57:47.540
Take that technology that we used on the phone to deliver

57:47.540 --> 57:53.020
Applications super fast to the users on the phone and bring that to the desktop

57:53.540 --> 57:58.980
Then all those millions of users can potentially have super up-to-date packages

57:59.300 --> 58:02.860
With all the lessons we've learned from the phone. Hmm. I do like that

58:02.860 --> 58:05.860
I feel like it's one of those things though. We won't see pay off for quite a while though

58:07.020 --> 58:13.020
Potentially, I mean we're working on tools to make it easier. So like, you know, we're all working on

58:13.020 --> 58:20.100
Snappifying we call it not formally. That's just like a stupid term not snapcrafting or

58:20.660 --> 58:21.700
Yeah

58:21.700 --> 58:24.500
There's not a verb for it really snapping

58:25.060 --> 58:28.580
Yeah, you don't want to snap. Yeah, so we're all working on

58:29.140 --> 58:32.060
Yeah, snapification sounds good. It sounds very George W. Bush

58:33.060 --> 58:38.060
And we're all doing a bit of that to iron out all the kinks and figure out you know

58:38.060 --> 58:44.700
Because every application is different and some things need have different requirements, right? And because of our security model to ensure that

58:45.020 --> 58:49.340
One application can't stomp on the files of another or you don't get one file

58:50.700 --> 58:52.100
You know

58:52.100 --> 58:56.820
Able to access the data from another application and like send your key presses elsewhere

58:56.820 --> 59:00.180
Yeah, there's the security side of things is

59:00.820 --> 59:02.820
super critical and

59:02.820 --> 59:09.460
We're just discovering the edge cases of you know, what each application needs in terms of security

59:09.460 --> 59:14.140
We're snappy and so we're pushing the boundaries of that trying to make sure that we're getting all that done

59:14.140 --> 59:18.220
So that when a developer comes along wants to snap if I they're crap

59:18.820 --> 59:21.980
It's already full. This is this is something that I want to talk to you about

59:22.780 --> 59:24.220
because I

59:24.220 --> 59:25.900
was just

59:25.900 --> 59:27.540
arguing with Noah that

59:27.540 --> 59:33.220
one of the emails we get all the time on quarter radio and one of the things that Mike has run into is

59:33.220 --> 59:37.260
He says right. Okay. I'm gonna develop for a boon to I'm gonna go

59:37.260 --> 59:42.580
I'm gonna release an app for the Ubuntu desktop for Ubuntu users, and I'm going to use

59:43.380 --> 59:51.300
Which SDK which tool kit which back-end language and I distribute it to my end users with reliable

59:51.300 --> 59:53.300
Secure updates how?

59:53.300 --> 59:57.780
Okay, so if I want to distribute for Ubuntu reliably via software update

59:58.580 --> 59:59.580
How do I do that?

59:59.580 --> 01:00:04.420
And if I'm just say just say I'm like salmon the developer of your favorite application that's available for another platform

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:09.500
That just has decided now's the time to target the Linux desktop. How do they how do they figure this out?

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.780
They either a somehow get it submitted to Debian

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:19.580
Downstream so it gets included in the Ubuntu repos and thus gets updated when they're set up

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:25.660
They figure out to how to create a launchpad account and create PPAs and publish their own repo

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:31.300
They figure out how to package a deb file or pay somebody

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:38.580
Which is a common thing that developers do is just hire some guy or gal to package a deb file for them and

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:44.020
Then they post it on their website, which then means you don't get to take advantage of any of the built-in package management

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.020
Nope

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:50.660
Check back. And so, you know what Mike and I have kicked around a ton on Coda radio is this is a shitty story to tell

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:57.180
Developers this is just this does doesn't work for them. They they can't they can't bank on that. They can't take that to the bank. And

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:04.540
And so I think that the snap packages is probably the best answer to this and I think it I think it answers a bigger

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:09.900
Question than we all realize is being asked. Do you agree with my sort of rough assessment poppy?

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:14.500
Right, and you know for for a slow-moving free software project

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:20.340
There's a good argument for you should put it in Debian or a you are or wherever sure that yeah

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.620
That hits the most number of free so that's not really practical for a lot of people

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.580
They're maybe bringing something over to the Linux desktop for the first time

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.340
Right and and and that's just one, you know method

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.100
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not a good idea

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.940
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not a not inherently a bad thing, right? There's nothing

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.900
There's nothing inherently if you could do it. It's great, right, but we've seen or if you can find a

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.460
Debian developer to sponsor your

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:54.540
Whatever the process is but we've seen recently friction in Debian where an upstream developer

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.540
wants

01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:01.020
more recent versions of their application in the distro and

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:07.820
The Debian policy doesn't allow that to happen. Right? You're referring to the extreme saver thing, right and and so

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.900
with with a system where the developer is put in control of how they distribute their code and

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.300
With automated reviews and sandboxing these three things put together

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.060
means that

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:25.420
Developers are happy because they can distribute the version of their software that they're happy with when they want to

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:31.740
Users are happy because they get the latest version of crack that they want and users are also happy and sys admins are happy

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.580
Because the system is secure because the apps are siloed from each other

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.180
So it seems like a win-win-win all the way around our brown

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.060
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because uh, uh, also

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.060
I mean, we've seen this play out in a lot of instances

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.860
But own clouds are probably one of the more prominent ones. Wouldn't you agree?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.580
Yeah, um, they're a pretty good example of of one of those

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:59.180
Yeah, um, they're a pretty good example of of one of those projects where yeah, they're they're really well in the case of the

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.900
The debian one. It wasn't just a case of not able to get the version in there

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:10.220
But also the debian developer putting in what own cloud considered was an unsafe upgrade path, right?

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:16.860
Now, uh richard, I just want your frank opinion not even as a representation of susa, uh, just as a representative

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.820
As a representative of the linux community

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.540
Do you bang your head against your desk? Do you facepalm a little bit when you go guys guys guys?

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.820
We've got the open busus a build service. It's working great projects like own cloud are using the hell out of it

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.420
Don't reinvent the wheel of snap packages. Just put it in the open build service

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:38.380
Does it is there is there a facepalm moment for you or or do you see it in a different light?

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:45.580
I I there there is to a large extent when you mix in the wouldn't you mobile thing?

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.740
There's maybe a case to be made there, but i'm i'm not sold on it though

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540
hmm, yeah, I

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.340
This is where our debate was going. I see uh in in the living room and and uh, no

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.100
No, I don't know when we talked about it. My my my take was

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:08.320
See, I guess it's i'm of two opinions because snap packages on their own right are are pretty slick technology

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.180
And a pretty great idea and something that I think

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:18.380
Pretty much anyone who's new to the scene? You can look at how to build these these things how to how to write the description file

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.420
And you're gonna get it. It's it's gonna be easy

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.940
I love that a lot and it might be familiar for how you're doing packaging things for other systems already. Yeah

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:32.540
Yeah, so that I I just I i'm pretty jazzed about it in in the big picture at the same time

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.940
um

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.940
I don't want to say this in a flamey way

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:42.300
but if if if ubuntu would have just if if we could have gone if it could have gone like this like what what if

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.180
It could have gone like this like canonical would have been like, all right, we're gonna go focus on mobile for a bit

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:51.020
So, uh, what we're gonna do is if you want to worry about getting desktop software on

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.580
uh on our desktop

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.980
We're just gonna hook in with the open open source to build service

01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:00.860
And we're just gonna we're gonna hook in with that and that's what that's gonna be our sort of our official avenue for getting software

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.060
on our desktop and I feel like that would have

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:11.180
Been a game changer for desktop linux because instead of now getting packages bundled for debian and ubuntu out of the goodwill of

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:18.140
The developer it would have been a standardized method to deliver tech software to the linux desktop

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.020
What guarantee would canonical have had that the open source?

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:26.060
So it opens his bill service would have kept their values and their priorities in mind

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.900
Besides the fact we've been doing it for 10 years now. Well, i'm so I guess what i'm trying to say is

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.060
You know canonical has canonical invented the you know, the ppa system and the

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:39.820
Better for better for worse. They have these devs that are available on on the download

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.060
But that was at the time that that came out

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.500
That was far and away better than anything else we had had on linux

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:50.220
And so I think it's a little unfair to say that because other competition has rose up around them

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:55.660
And they are now taking those steps to advance it. I think it's a little unfair to say well all of a sudden

01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:01.100
Canonical has just done it all wrong. And I guess no, I have that and I don't want to I don't want to come across to

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:07.020
Saying they've done it all wrong because I don't I don't agree. I think that ppas were a decent addition

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.580
And so here's where i'm coming from on this and and just just really quickly is uh,

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.300
Seuss martin in the uh, linux action show subreddit said sorry chris. No offense

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.980
Which is always it's like about to say something offensive. Yeah, I think it's a little unfair to say that

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:29.580
It's about to say something offensive. Yeah, I just I just pissed in your flower bed. No, not to upset you. Uh, anyways, uh,

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.100
but uh

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:36.780
That was not a review more like an hour-long monologue about how bad ppas are

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:42.940
And I want to stop right there. I I actually think as far as ppas go if they're not an awful system

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.620
I don't think it's that bad

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.300
I think it was a good addition when ppas were launched a long time ago

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.640
I'm trying to look at wikipedia to find out the date, but they don't have it 2009

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Thank you

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.040
It certainly filled the need right? Yeah, this was solid in 2009 great idea

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:08.640
2009 is too long ago now and it needed to be iterated on continuously since then and what happened in my estimation

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Is it just didn't become a priority?

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:19.600
And then the cloud took off and then rapid software development took off and people start creating entire applications that run on the web based on

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.240
node.js

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.760
And plugins that can be completely revoked. Yeah, you know what i'm talking about

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.640
And in days they have a new web application and then in months they have iterated three times and all of a sudden

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640
we now find ourselves in a world where

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.820
unarguably openSUSE were the leaders

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.180
Where fedora has a very competent solution where arch has a crushing lead with the user repository?

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.240
We now find ourselves in a world where ubuntu is behind in this regard. I'm not saying ppas are bad

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.640
I'm saying that if we could have switched over to another solution by now

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.640
I like the build service just as my personal one. Yeah works well

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:05.280
We would have fundamentally changed how software is distributed for linux the answer for developers that I talked about earlier

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920
Would have been target the build service

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:15.360
With clear documentation a large community and it would have made available to just about every damn distro on the planet

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.600
Now i'm very excited for snap packages

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.360
But at the same time I kind of feel like it's too little too well not too little but it's too late

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480
Go ahead rotten

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.360
Well, I just want to say that the the

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.200
The problem with the dev files is not necessarily

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:43.120
The devs is we we can't have like devs kind of suck. Like if you think about it, there's

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.720
You you unpackage a deb. You have three archives and then you have another archive and set up another archive

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.880
They're they're kind of annoying to do

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.160
And I think anybody who's ever packaged a deb would would agree with that

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.640
It is but the problem is that the dev files are also a locked down structure for the just the linux

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.520
Entirely the ecosystem of linux is either stale stable releases or rolling super fast releases

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.400
You really can't have this. You can't have rolling applications sitting on top of the stable

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400
stable core because

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.520
Those depend on new toolkits that are constantly being updated

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.040
So if your new application requires on a toolkit that this is not available

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Well still having to but snap packages

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.480
I know that's the point. That's what i'm saying snap packages

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:33.600
Like they're not too little too late because we still even though even the open super boost build service is awesome

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:40.080
But it still has the exact same problem of the of the core. Yeah, uh packages not being updated. All right

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.440
Okay, okay. Okay for that. Okay, you the snap is it's i'm excited for the snap because it

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.440
Let me okay. Okay. That's a great point rod. Let me punt this to richard. So richard, uh, you mentioned in the chat room

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.840
You know a build service been around longer than ppas

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:01.920
What is your sober estimation of why it just simply hasn't been adopted then because it's clearly a competent platform with solid technology

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Behind it yet. Here we are

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.680
Fedora has copper arch has aur

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.380
uh canonical is developing snap packages and and and

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.780
I guess I also you gotta you gotta admit the system they've developed is more modern. You know, it utilizes containers

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:24.740
It supports read-only file systems. It it pulls in directly from the project's upstream build services. It's very compelling

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:32.340
what is your sober estimation now of perhaps why this hasn't been adopted more widely and maybe if there is some sort of

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:36.100
perhaps modernization that now needs to take place with the build service or maybe

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.140
Not i'm curious now where you think this thing stand

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:46.260
Most of the features you stated have been in the build service for some time like for example refreshing the stuff direct from upstream

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.460
We've had that feature for so long. We've just rewritten it in 2.7, which we just released nice

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.620
So there's there's you know that that that's always ongoing that's always improving

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:01.080
Um, why wasn't it adopted? I I think that's typical not invented here syndrome. I mean if you look at most distributions

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:09.080
They're they're gonna trend towards their own tools and there there isn't many projects besides open suzer who kind of hits this approach of

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.120
We're going to build our tools for ourselves and everybody else as well. Why don't you come join us and

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.160
I I wish more distributions took us up on that offer. It's still open. It's still there

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.200
We're not going anywhere. The build service is still being developed. So

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.640
but but you know distributions have to get over this hump of

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.600
We know best how to how to build this stuff. It's it's not necessarily true

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.080
And even if it is true, I think we can do really exciting stuff when we do stuff together

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.080
And there's only yeah, there's not many projects that take that mindset

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.240
Popey how important is the ubuntu brand behind this idea?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:49.240
So I know one of the things that so my fair estimation of the emails I've gotten is if I told them

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.200
This is the canonical recommended path or the ubuntu recommended software distribution path

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.280
And this is the open source community solution

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.400
They actually would be more inclined to go with the ubuntu solution simply because of brand name recognition trust in the in

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.560
in sort of a long-term investment there and

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.600
It's simply more familiar with how they expect things to operate on proprietary platforms

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.680
And so we are sitting we're saying oh you could have done the build service. There's a ur out there

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.960
But in reality, how important was it? Do you think that it was actually a solution from within?

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:27.000
How do you mean a solution from within well, why not how do you think there is serious technical and and obviously

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.320
Tactical advantages to developing snap packages versus using somebody else's solution

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.640
So snap packages service a need that we've identified that developers need

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200
And that our customers want

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.680
And I i'm not sure

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.800
That other platforms do provide that I mean it's quite obvious that

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:55.800
other uh, non-linux platforms are trending towards that with the way android and uh chrome silo their things and the way

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.880
The windows, uh app store is going and the way the ios app store

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.900
Everyone else seems to have figured this out and is going in that direction

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080
We're doing the same thing

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:13.320
But in the linux environment i'm i'm not sure do you think it's so when we're looking at this

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
Do you think it's a fair perspective?

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.020
To say this is a solution for the ubuntu platform. And this is something for ubuntu platform customers

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.720
Well, it's for it's for our customers and for free software and proprietary developers

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.080
It's sure i'm not saying it's closed source. I'm just saying like it's it's developed for people that are in the ubuntu ecosystem

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.800
Which is based on linux. It's not saying that there's not linux involved

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.920
But it's simply there are people that simply they deploy ubuntu workstations. They deploy ubuntu servers

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.560
They have an ubuntu cloud and so they're looking for things

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.440
That are yeah, I see where you're going, but I I don't see I don't see how

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.360
you know as

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.560
as

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:59.880
Someone who's been an advocate of ubuntu for you know, 10 plus years. I don't see why I would think anything

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:07.400
Other than this is for our users and customers and developers. Well, you know, what what else would it be for?

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.480
So I actually see a bigger point in here. Okay

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.880
It's it's like for the last part that you mentioned is like

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:23.000
By that principle canonical wouldn't use software developed by other open source projects and they completely do so the name is not necessarily the thing

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.800
The fact that canonical uses for those that care about the branding would be enough like canonical says we're using obs

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.240
Then it will be enough for those that want the canonical support

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:40.440
on it because if canonical picked it is because it's in line and those that are trusting a brand name will just trust it anyways

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:48.840
I guess the problem of the lack of adoption has to do with the strategy on the outreach the open source has had

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.360
Over time versus the other distributions arch has a core users that they target

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.880
Open source that wants to be so impartial. So

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.920
So generic so to allow everyone that suddenly fails to capture in each group that will be uh, evangelist about it

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.600
So because there's no evangelism about it people just think it's oh, that's a nice thing and it doesn't get out of the nice thing

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:19.320
And someone that has evangelists and has people pushing forward the technology in terms of vocality about it

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.160
We'll get to have the perception even if not the usage at the time

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.800
Vocality about it. We'll get to have the perception even if not the usage at least the perception so that it's wider

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.320
uh

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.000
You know what? I hadn't thought of that wes. How much do you what do you think?

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.200
Do you think maybe the reason why the aur and things like that have more buzz is because it's the arch user

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:46.280
Repository and the build service is targeted more to just those practical developers that want to pump out builds. And so

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.680
There's no hype machine

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.680
That is probably a good point. I mean

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.920
Yeah, especially like with the with the aur, you know, the users are directly involved

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.720
They're picking people to maintain the packages not always the developer. There's there's the comment system

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.400
And you know, it is a little bit harder to get involved with the build service

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.440
So that's a good that's a good point. All right, no at the end of the day

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Here's the thing

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.920
The practical real world implementation is it's still if you wanted to play software on ubuntu

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.480
It's going to be your best bet. Don't you agree? I mean you still think

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:24.760
I I might I might say other services and other systems and other projects have better technology for developing and delivering and

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.080
updating software

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.920
But in terms of day-to-day practical use out in the real world deploying for clients

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.440
Where's ubuntu at? I think that and I think we hit on this

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.000
Maybe we should have clicked on it, you know on sunday

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.680
And I don't think we necessarily honed in on this

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.040
But one of the things that came up in a discussion today was that you know

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.040
I'm looking at this from a perspective of

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.240
I am a person that maybe was previously using windows or maybe i'm using macos and now i've come over to linux

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:56.040
And so I am going to cherry pick the applications that I was formerly comfortable with now if you had somebody

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.480
um

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.320
Like myself who will be available oddlinux, press northwest switching people to linux

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.080
Like I maybe have done

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.360
What would you say three or four times every place we've gone and had absolute 100 success rate if you have something buddy like that

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.760
Then that person is already switching you over to those linux applications while you're on windows

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.120
So your transition is easier. However, if you don't have that you boot into linux for the first time and you say

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.480
I need my friend to help me you download team viewer. You say I need to uh,

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.840
To you know to what was the other uh program I was talking about today is team viewer

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.720
And what was the other one that bit me? There's another one is proprietary and I hate mentioning it all the time

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.200
Virtual box for example, uh virtual box

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.960
Some of those applications

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.480
They work perfectly fine on ubuntu right out of the software center or right off of if you install from the command line

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.160
But it might take a little tweaking, you know, and another one comes to mind my ubiqui

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.560
Ubiqui works basically right out of the box

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.920
I just plug it into my computer and I can use a smart card reader right off of ubuntu

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.640
On arch I have to install a package and configure it now

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.440
That's not a hit on arch daemon and then configure it

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.440
Now that's not a hit on arch because arch is a configurable distro and you know that going into it

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.200
And so there's probably somebody out there that didn't want that smart card daemon running

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.120
and so they rightfully so don't have that installed and configured by default, but

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.920
I don't think it is fair to say that coming out of the gate ubuntu is the hardest distribution to install packages on

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120
unless we take it to the level of

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.800
Here's the entire app ecosystem and the majority of these applications are you know

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.520
Aren't going to be available on ubuntu for a couple of years

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.120
And they are going to be available on arch if you look at it from that lens, then I think you're right

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.880
but but I think for the practical lens of these are the software programs that that i'm using and I am cherry-picking a couple that

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.480
Come to mind because i've had problems

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.200
In a day-to-day basis what I found is oftentimes I find myself having to tinker with arch to get it to work

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.360
You know for a daily use case

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.560
I think I think my opinion about it is uh is sort of I actually agree with you in some levels

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.800
Ubuntu is going to be out of the mind when they package virtual box

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.080
For example, or maybe let's go with your team viewer example because that's a little more esoteric

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.600
uh

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
When you install team viewer on ubuntu

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.680
That package maintainer made the decision. He said hey, you know what while I still have root permission on your service

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.320
or while I have room while I still have root permission on your linux box because you

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.800
When you executed my install script here, you gave me root privilege

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.720
While I still have that root privilege i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to start

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:27.720
This remote listening service as root and i'm going to go ahead and tell that to start every time your system boots

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.380
I actually think that's probably the right decision to make on a user-friendly distribution

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840
And you want to install team viewer to get help

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:40.520
You probably want to receive remote connections. That's probably why you're installing team viewer, right? I could also

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:47.240
Very clearly understand why the arch package you're said, you know what maybe not i'm going to do the absolute minimum thing

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.040
I need to do while I have root privileges and i'm not going to touch your system any more than I have to and if

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.840
You want to start that daemon you can use system ctl enable team viewer dot service or whatever

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.640
Dot service or whatever it is and you can have added haas

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.120
And i'm going to be gentle while I have root i'm going to respect your security, right?

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.600
I can understand both perspectives

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.480
This is a wacky example. Actually, this is really a wacky example

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.920
You're implying your implication is that someone who's packaging a deb is somehow

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.080
potentially nefarious in in their

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.080
In no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.280
Somehow that a arch arch packaging

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.760
One is developing for end users one is packaging I should say for end users and they probably just figure i'm going to make it

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.360
A little bit easier and one is packaging for a linux enthusiast and you know what?

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.960
I'm not going to make it easier for the enthusiast. I can understand both perspectives

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:52.400
I don't I don't think that makes one easier to install than the other I think what makes one easier to install than the other

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:57.480
Would be software availability and what is availability in your repository?

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:04.280
tie and if I can do packer dash s install team viewer or packer dash s virtual box or packer dash s heru pad and

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:08.200
I know with absolute certainty that I'm getting the absolute latest version of that package

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:14.380
And it's going to continue to get updated by my package manager in my estimation that is easier than other

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:19.940
Well than Ubuntu so that one packet you you're saying packaging for the Linux enthusiast

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:26.700
You're aiming for a target that has like half a percent of worldwide PC sales

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.880
If that right is that is that where you want to target or do you want to target where?

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.820
Real people spend real money on computers that I have us on them

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.120
Don't don't understand

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.420
I completely agree if I'm gonna target if I were gonna release a desktop Linux

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.300
Application that I thought would be great for web developers or people that are developing Android

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:53.020
Applications or anybody that wants to get worked on on Linux my primary user base would be Ubuntu

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.020
And I would do a PPA if I could absolutely

01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:01.880
But my point is that doesn't the goodwill of developers and how they have assembled their packages does not

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:06.940
Excuse the fact that the platform itself does not provide a better means for sustainable software

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:14.060
But if it wasn't for the ease people wouldn't want a wart if it's exact a wart is just trusting

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:18.900
You know these can give people also packaging things that you are going to try to run exactly

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:25.220
You know what? You know what? I'm sorry my my my long time experience with the community is in whole

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:31.100
I I actually trust the community more than I trust any individual company and the AUR has a vote system

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.980
It has a comment system. It has a self vetting system

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:40.940
I I wish I could divorce the AUR from the distribution wars thing because I just want to talk about it in terms of a software

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.380
Delivery platform that's why I started this conversation with the build service

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:51.860
But the reality is I actually think the AUR provides a better example because it's user powered and then it's community vetted and it

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.100
Allows for me to go in with a certain level of confidence

01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:00.420
I'd like I like me able to come on to the show for Linux action show into a desktop app pick and say

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:08.260
You can install this package and I had to drop three really really really really great desktop app picks last week

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:14.660
Because I couldn't come on the air and say this is how you install it on Ubuntu. I think that's a major bummer

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:20.660
But how many of those three were because the person hadn't provided a 1604 version yet?

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:26.300
All of it none of none of it was version specific none of the issues were version specific at all

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:33.740
None of it was it all was a matter of packaging and availability and repos and and all of it in every single

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:39.700
circumstance was available in the AUR and it just it just struck me as this glaring and the thing was is

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:46.300
You know one of them was like a two-year-old drop-down terminal that just never made it into downstream Debian or upstream

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.540
However, you look at it, and I just kind of felt bad because you know they're creating something really great here

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:55.220
And one of them was a chat program that I just mentioned earlier that

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.140
And what was that program no I had to build from source

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.620
And I actually started to write up the instructions

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.260
And I was just gonna give people and here's the other problem is it was an Ubuntu review episode

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:09.420
So I wanted to make sure that the Ubuntu the desktop app pick could actually run on Ubuntu right because that'd be a pretty jackass

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.620
thing to do

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.380
And so the good news is that's the thing we're fixing

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:19.820
Exactly yeah, right. I love that. I think and I agree, and I think that's why even though

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:24.500
It's not something that's already existed. It's still a very valid solution. What do you think Noah?

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.060
I

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.060
Think my tummy hurts

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:32.820
As soon as you said that he asked me like I told you so I told you that's I've told you all morning

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:38.380
That's what they're fixed. That's why I'm doing this house. I keep saying I think that I mean you know really

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.340
I think we're kind of going in circles

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:43.740
That's what I think but I think that I think we've gotten to a point where we have addressed that there is a problem

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.220
I think we all agree that there is a problem and that there needs to be a new solution

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.420
I think we've also all agreed that canonical has addressed that solution and

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:57.380
has or has addressed the problem in is formulating a solution and that really I think really what it comes down to is you and

01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:02.860
I fundamentally disagree on if you think if if the software is available in the OR even if you have to tweak it

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.940
That's better than it

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:08.100
Just not being available and I would personally argue that it as far as easy

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:12.820
Installation even if I have to go to a website and download a deb that may not be as secure

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:19.260
And that's not a great overall system, and yes it may or may not screw other distros because it's occupying developers time on a specific

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:26.780
distribution, but I think that that provides a fundamentally easier way to get at you know linear in application running on a given distribution well

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:32.500
I definitely gives them more windows familiar feel I search for my installation thing I download it from the web, and I install it

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.180
I'll give you that I okay, so let's move on

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.340
Yes, that is true

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.220
But I want to move on because I don't want to bore people with this whole debate

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.900
I want to talk about some of the things that have actually already been sort of fixed up since our review, but

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:51.540
Honestly poppy. I'm really genuinely curious about your thoughts on 1604 it to me

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.820
It feels like one of the biggest releases for Ubuntu ever and I'm curious if you feel the same

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.140
Yes, I do

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.020
Honestly, that's it folks. You know no to you

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:06.660
I'm really what do you think that means in terms of long-term long-term impact of 1604?

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:12.500
And I'd also if you're willing to share with class why you think it is that it if it beyond snap packages

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:18.820
So we know that the vast majority of our users stick on LTS releases like significantly

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.460
like double-digit percentage higher

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.860
People stick on LTS is they don't

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:32.020
Generally our users don't want bleeding edge. They don't want the very latest

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:38.740
Colonel they don't necessarily want the very latest of like lib C or whatever wacky library

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:44.700
They just want something that's reliable and stable isn't going to change when they boot it up today from when they booted it up yesterday

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.420
So LTS is always important to us

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:53.460
But the flip side of that is app developers are changing things and chrome changes

01:26:53.980 --> 01:27:00.220
Frequently chromium changes frequently and other applications that people depend on change frequently. And so I think

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:07.040
1604 could be one of those quite long-lived versions of Ubuntu a bit like the

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.960
Maybe the Windows XP of Linux. Yeah, I was gonna say 10 around I was gonna say 10 of 4

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.260
I still run into some 10 of what there's oh I do do you run into 10 of 4 still? Yeah, I do

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.760
Doesn't make me happen

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:27.240
with with with snappy packages that have the very latest version of an application which can override whatever

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.240
Core library is on the system without jeopardizing an existing

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:37.240
Package that's already installed right and not interfering with any other application that's already installed

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.940
That seems like that that could have the potential to live for quite a long time

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:47.160
Either that's very well put even though I said not about snap packages

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.060
You managed to put in such a great way that I completely agree and I'm willing to take the snap package answer

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.080
also, I think it's a pretty solid release because

01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:03.000
Pretty soon a lot of S is gonna change in Ubuntu and if if people don't like the way things are going you can now

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.400
Say well just install 1604 and snap packages will keep you going while they

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.680
Right, isn't don't you think that's a guy so like, you know, you might say well

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.780
There's a unity 8 stuff is different and all these apps are different

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.380
Just install 1604 and shut your face

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.200
And it's gonna it's not gonna be in the past where you would say well, okay sure

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:30.000
But now I can't have X Y Z because I don't have GTK X or right that problem is gone

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I think it's a big deal for that

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.640
Richard I wanted to ask you though. Honestly just kind of tingling in the back of my head here

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.640
Do you feel like when?

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:43.480
When a new when a new Ubuntu release comes out is the oxygen sort of sucked out of the room for some of the other

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:50.400
Distros because I see a lot of people talking about switching to Ubuntu open to this 1604 upgrade that and it feels like nobody's

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.320
talking about

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.320
anybody else

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.360
You know, in fact, in fact, we've seen a bit of a spike of tumbleweed downloads

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:07.960
I mean the servers were slow even because of it. Wow, we got it. We got a backer right there. We got a second. I

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.920
think I mean I just I'm saying that I experienced them slow and

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.760
It happened to be in the same time. He said about the spike. So all right

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.680
Well, we can't be in a bit busier than usual

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.360
I you know, it's funny because a lot of people we said hey Chris

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.800
Why don't you shut up and install tumbleweed?

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.980
That's a lot of people said in the in the comments a couple of things

01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.440
No

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.280
I think you'll be glad to see fixed is the erase disk and install create and then create swap space bug that we ran into

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720
That s has been fixed

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.960
Also a couple other little naglers have been fixed including a few other things we ran into actually

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.160
So I'm you know, and I'm glad I'm pleased to say that overall it was a pretty quick turnaround

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.980
You were you were pretty disappointed in this bug. Yeah, I was well

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:56.920
I prefaced it and I'll restate this I cannot really hold canonical or Ubuntu responsible for that bug

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.200
Unless it made it past release date, right?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:03.160
Like absolutely tell you when you download it that you're downloading a pre-release software

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:08.680
It's not it is not fully baked yet. And so it would be wholly unfair. I mean

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:12.600
People start complaining about that pretty soon. They're just gonna stop letting you download it

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.560
Does it give you pause that it made it this far? No, not at all. As long as it's a liar

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.740
It doesn't it doesn't line hand to God. It gives me zero pause that it made it this far

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:26.840
As long as it doesn't make it past release I can hear you grouching just the other day about how you're really super

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.420
Disappointed that an LTS release like this has a bug that's gotten this far in the process and nobody noticed it

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:39.360
Hold on a second. Yeah, I was disappointed that it was an LTS release that had that that they that they would even consider shipping

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.800
With that book, but they didn't they fixed it and I don't think that that's I don't think that's at all fair like if

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.680
Especially it's coming from you like somebody who wants all these changes if you want companies to embrace

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.080
You want all the new stuff all the new crack

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.600
If you want all that you got to give them up until the very last day to fix

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:04.200
Just me that's that's not why rolling distributions are taking off like crazy. That's not why things like tumbleweed are blowing up

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.320
That's not why things like ours are continuing to see new users. That's not why things like it's just me

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.840
No, it's just you you're all your special snowflake

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:16.600
But but I just I don't know I can't hold them at all responsible if they fixed it before the release because here's the thing

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:20.720
If I would have downloaded out the day, then I would have just never even known. I'm not asking you that

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.760
Oh, what are you asking? I'm saying they did their job. They did a great job. They got the problem solved

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.820
Absolutely out of ten out of ten Noah, but what I am saying

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.920
And you just won't admit it on air is a little bit of you was disappointed that something like this existed and it and that it

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:43.160
Got this far and you won't admit that to you it felt like nobody was even trying to install this until we and other people

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.440
Started notice this problem, and you won't say it on air, but I know deep down you felt that way

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.160
I agree with part of that

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.200
I get I agree a part of me agrees with that when you when you phrase it like that

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.680
I guess I I'm a part of me agrees with it, but it's still it's just feels super

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:01.720
That didn't happen like it's I've installed it one two six nine four about six times. Yes

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.600
January and February all throughout the month. I didn't have that problem until I got here

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.320
Yeah, I got same here. Yeah, okay fair point. You know what fair pointer goes to rotten corpse. I didn't run it

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.320
I in fact we noticed

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.040
That I think about it

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.920
When we started to install I'm like I don't know I never ran into that problem man, and I've got it like on four rigs

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.880
Let's be you

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.800
He's told me he's like yeah, so you don't know how to install bunch. That's okay

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.440
Let the archers that come over here install a bunch you for you. I was that guy for a little bit

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.440
I will admit that I'm like always that

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.880
You can't help it because you're like I don't know wasn't me

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.640
I don't know what it's doing when I was in IT services. I was even the guy that said don't blame me

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.080
It's a hardware problem. I wore that shirt. I was I went all-in. That's why you're no longer in that

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.000
That is that's why I had to get out

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.600
So anyways yeah, it was funny to to sort of

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:59.280
One of the things that I enjoyed and I just want to wrap it up was I was all-in on Ubuntu Mate edition

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.520
During like my 1604 run that was my favorite spot to be so no one I basically swapped yeah

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.480
Yeah, yeah, I loved I loved me on desktop, but I mean in terms of

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.480
Well, I guess you know I had it here hooked up to the stream

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.000
I wanted a daily performer that was really sort of

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:18.400
Minimal that I didn't have to change a bunch of defaults

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.480
So that way stuff didn't pop up on the stream and Mate just nailed it

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.800
And it was a great experience

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:28.920
And I really like some of the changes that were made and so I was all about the Mate edition so and Noah

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.200
Traditionally because that's what he deploys for clients. I assume right is

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:39.560
Mostly a unity user plus. He and he'll sometimes he likes it because he can change the scaling etc etc right so we basically swapped

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:44.240
I said Noah you got to use Mate for the next day. I got to use unity for the next day and

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:51.720
No, I don't think you actually enjoyed it that much you you seemed like you were the feeling like it was sort of well

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:55.680
So in fairness to Ubuntu Mate I was running on on

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.920
Hardware that was giving me a lot of trouble and so that right off the bat created

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.000
I mean I spent the first 40 minutes, okay, actually hold on just a second this

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.360
This was your first hands-on with the Liebman 15

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.400
So I install a bungee Mate and I ran into the little swap here, and that was fine

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400
I got through that but the real problem was

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.800
You know I spent the first 40 minutes trying to figure out how to turn off tap to click because I kept selecting text

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.000
I can't even scroll in the web page you also ran into problems with USB ports being powered. Oh, yeah, okay?

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.040
Backup, I couldn't even get the operating system installed because the USB ports half the time

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.720
They're powered and half the time. They're not I don't mean different USB ports

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:37.040
I mean a single USB port and I guess the answer is just to cycle the laptop numerous times until

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:42.000
Thank God I had a flash drive with the light on it because if I didn't I don't know how I would know if it's

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:42.480
Gonna boot or not

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:48.240
This is legit because I was trying I was trying different distros having a thumb drive that lights up when you add when it gets

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.320
Powered is very valuable information when you're troubleshooting this kind of stuff so half the time

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.120
There's no power the other half the time there is I'd say it's about 5050 so finally

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.720
I just keep restarting the computer until I see the light come on then I'm like well don't screw up because we got a good

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.280
One now and I get into and then I hit that installer error

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.160
Which was kind of a pain and so again not Mateus fault USB port problem not Mateus fault

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.320
So I restart another five seven times and 40 minutes later. I'm finally in the installer. Thank God

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:19.080
And so I'm clicking through and I get finally get the operating installed like fine good all right now

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.720
It's on to easier waters right well turns out. There's no touchpad driver

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.900
It shows up as a ps2 mouse, so I can't I have no

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.500
Are you saying this built for Linux laptop doesn't have out-of-the-box touchpad support $1,800 built for Linux

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:38.060
Laptop support and my my $500 system 76 was washing the walls with it

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.360
So it is I I can't scroll

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.320
I can't even

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.840
Research how to fix the scroll because I can't scroll and I can't type because I type three letters and it erases all my

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.960
Text I have to start all over again

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.440
so eventually I I drove to Best Buy and bought a trackball and then come back and

01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:00.520
Seriously, and I'm working I'm working on this trackball trying trying to and I eventually research and find out not that they're this is

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.920
How I fix I I'm telegramming wimpy in the middle of his workday

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:09.160
Yeah to ask if they're why the touchpad support isn't in and of course he tells me what I knew he was gonna

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.780
Tell me which is it's perfectly in there if you have a touchpad well Ellis PCI showed me that the Libra um is

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.580
So I don't have touchpads, so I can't really size

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:20.900
So then the end of the night so I take it home with me back to the hotel

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.940
And I'm at the hotel and I start using it and that's when things kind of started to change

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:29.260
That's kind of when I started to see that like if I wanted a not changing desktop

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.180
Which I do like and I and I just wanted to get work done

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.940
And I didn't I and I didn't care for that doc which a lot of people don't

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:42.460
I can see Mate being a really really great alternative sure like that's that's just the desktop environment

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:45.980
What did you think about like the welcome stuff, and then they went to a tweak with me?

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.500
I am totally I didn't care about the mute that was not my thing. I mean if I was gonna have mutiny

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.500
I'd probably just have a

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:55.300
Traditional unity, but one thing I did care

01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:00.900
I mean that software center that software boutique is so good. I will put it on every Ubuntu machine

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:07.700
I install from now on every single client that gets an Ubuntu installation from me will have that that that installation package that

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.900
Welcome package that is far and away

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.060
They should make that its own app store, and they should port it to like every well

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:18.500
Here's what it's that good Wimby isn't here right now, but here's a telegram. He sent me yesterday

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.780
He said he just pushed an update to Ubuntu Mate welcome

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:27.700
If you installed on another desktop flavor now the software boutique will appear in the menus

01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:33.220
It was previously only in Mateia sessions. I got the idea while watching your review because we gave

01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.540
We got the we gave the command to use to just launch the software

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:42.940
This is a perfect example of how Martin Wimperis does everything right?

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.960
No, I'm serious now. No now you think about what just happened. Okay? He listened to

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.780
You and I are not involved with the Matei project

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:56.080
And so and he he's not involved with you broadcasting and yet

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:59.780
I mean I would say he's involved quite a bit, okay fine fine, but as a member

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.780
He's not you know we don't get a paycheck

01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:08.540
Yeah, so he is a community member and we because we are members of the same community and he saw on his own volition

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.720
Saw a problem that without we were having it really wasn't even a problem

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:16.740
He goes out of his way to make sure that it's going to be smoother from everyone if every

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.680
software distribution had somebody like Martin Wimperis on their team I

01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:24.520
Agree because it's not what he actually did that's not what's the big deal

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:30.100
It's the fact that he kind of recognizes a pre problem and solves it before it's even a problem

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:35.300
Or you even have to ask yeah, and that's what I think makes the Matei edition of Ubuntu 1604 kind of special

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:40.400
Yeah, is and and I'm sure Wimpy if he was here would say that credit goes to a lot of other people, too

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:46.400
But I just it's all right Chris, I'm telegramming everything you're saying

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.740
Thank you

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:54.860
So that's why I wanted to I think that's what we sort of wrapped the review on it

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.460
But we kind of you know we got some grief for not mentioning Zubuntu and Ubuntu gnome edition

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.460
But you know

01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.980
Talking about Matei talking about Zubuntu

01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:06.460
your buddy

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.980
Mr.. Michael Arbel over at for Onyx

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580
Did some benchmarking?

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:15.260
Let's see it. We've got some Ubuntu

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:19.980
1604 benchmarks, that's how you have to say it

01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.820
Yeah like that yeah like that

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:31.740
For nice I compared unity is XFCE KDE LXD gnome Matei and

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.420
Open box in a head-to-head comparison of some classic open source games

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.780
Wes

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.460
Before I tell you Wes before I reveal Wes

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:52.180
Do you have a guess of which desktop environment, and we're not talking by huge margins here

01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:54.180
Not big margins, but do you have a guess?

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.060
Which desktop environment perform the best?

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:00.780
for mr.. Lara bells

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.660
Benchmarks, I'm gonna guess open box. Oh, let's see here

01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.580
No, I am sorry Wes that is not at the house

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:18.460
That was not a correct answer

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:23.300
Mr.. Noah, do you have a guess as to which desktop perform the best about you, but say

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.060
That's what I would have guessed

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.360
Anybody the mumble room have a guess as the disk as a desktop environment. Yes, go ahead Poby

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.380
Was it by any chance?

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.980
What you know?

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.220
No, it was not. It was not only because

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:41.740
It was actually plasma 5 fared very very well

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.060
Ubuntu gnome did not fare well because

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:51.220
For whatever reason the Ubuntu gnome desktop detected that the apps were no longer responding even though they were

01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:55.180
Responding and kept coming up like the force quit prompt and just trashed performance

01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:02.300
Otherwise Ubuntu gnome would have fared better. No ladies and gentlemen the number one performance desktop

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:10.660
Is unity

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.420
Are you serious yeah

01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:19.420
Now this is only if you do not

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:26.200
Alter defaults if you go with a default install desktop and want to play games with the current 1604 flavors

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:29.940
Unity actually gets you that's a great job by a very thin margin

01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:33.980
By a very thin extra three frames a second

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.140
Supposedly I guess

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.620
Unity will give you the best performance so there you go as much as much tersh talk as we gave

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:48.580
Tossed towards unity you know what I'm gonna keep it right here on my this

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:54.220
This is my this is my unity desktop here plugged into the production stream. I'm gonna keep it as long as possible

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:58.180
I made it with Kubuntu for almost a month on the live stream. I

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.980
Think I could make it for unity for two months at least

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:05.940
1604 I'm gonna lock it in now the only thing I could see changing this is I

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.980
Really want to demo a piece of software. I want to do a how-to or something like that

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:12.300
And it's just not available for Ubuntu which happens all the time

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.860
So yeah, yeah there you go if you want absolute performance be like me run unity I

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.620
You know what I haven't had the flicker problems anymore either

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:28.420
I started having the flickering problems when I hooked up my HDMI external and poppy

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:29.420
I wonder did that happen to you, too

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:31.860
Did you not have flickering until you try to a second monitor?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.020
So I recently bought a new ThinkPad and yes

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.260
There's flickering and it's an upstream Intel video driver problem

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:45.580
Okay has been going for like four months see I had flickering once when I hooked up external HDMI

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.500
But I have not had a problem since then

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:52.720
So I consider myself lucky. I have a sky I did something that I promised myself

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:57.240
I would never do which is I rebuilt my own kernel, which I

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:03.940
Tried not to do that

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:04.460
Yeah

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:11.660
Patch one single line in the Intel video driver before and rebuild my own count before I was an Ubuntu user when I when

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:16.060
I was living the gen 2 life. I I was all about that. I was all about that

01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.620
I just all the time

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:23.580
But since I since I started switching over to it basically every other distro since then I'm like, I just it's not

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.420
It actually is kind of my friends could can tell me hey

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:34.180
This is the line you need to patch and I patch it and then I rebuild my candle and now I'm no

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.180
I'm never ever moving off of this

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.540
This machine now becomes precious

01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:46.980
Any any ideas of when that might actually get fixed ask Intel

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:51.540
Oh, okay. Doon. Oh, hold on. Who do I hold on? Hold on. Hold on. No, come on now. Come on

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.820
I wasn't ready for that. Who do I ask?

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.300
Intel I actually I'm still not ready. There we go

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:06.620
I'm so anyways, I'm just happy with my Ubuntu 6.04 install overall now that I have all my applications installed

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:11.220
I'm gonna keep it for a while. That's sort of my my ending thoughts on it. I'm gonna just yeah

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:13.260
I'm just gonna see how it feels. I'm gonna stretch it out

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:17.900
So Noah you you did a thing today you hosted tech talk today

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.700
What what? No? Yeah, it was it was great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was good

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:26.980
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're gonna fly over every Tuesday, right? Yeah, absolutely

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:35.220
And so we stepped in the thing you and I you started it actually what you do this every time what I don't know

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:37.220
I legitimately have no idea what you're talking about

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:39.980
You're upset with me about a lot of things today

01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:46.060
So it's kind of hard to pinpoint the exact thing that you're upset about in this specific. I actually think maybe I don't need to explain it

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:50.460
Maybe I should play it for the audience and then let them come to their own conclusion. You just tell me what you're talking about

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:54.580
Yeah, I could so I'm talking about the ending of this week's tech talk today, right?

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.220
You didn't you know, you started you started real strong

01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:03.260
Well, um, you know what I like about you Noah is you're a hell of an improviser

01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:08.580
Wow, there's that you you know, you like like if you're gonna be stuck at say like a Linux fest

01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:13.660
Yeah, and you were gonna say have to vamp for like six hours on a live stream

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:20.040
Yeah, or like maybe the entire weekend of self. There's almost nobody better to be with then Noah like

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:24.340
Yeah, like oh, I'm a blabbermouth. Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm just an expert in my own opinion

01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:28.020
If we were gonna storm a building and I like I really feel like you would have my back

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:33.020
It's like when we storm when we storm a stream. Yeah, you've always got my back. Yeah for sure

01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:38.740
So in in traditional Noah style you just you had my back you rolled into this patreon, but I'm gonna play

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:44.020
There's poppy so there's poppy holy smokes. Why is why is that?

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.900
That was way too much poppy that was and why is he in why is he in the tubes of the youth?

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:54.300
He was in tech talk today. He was in tech talk today. I'm coming. I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, okay

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.940
I listen to tech talk today when I did I did but I don't know if I know what you're talking

01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:03.300
I'm excited to see so basically hold on. I'm gonna play it. I want cuz I don't want I don't I don't know

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.060
Yeah, okay. I do. I figured it out. All right

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:08.460
like a day later a beer koozie shows up my front door and

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:15.120
You can get a beer koozie and random other gifts throughout the year. So Noah, you know, he's doing the tech talk today show

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.320
He's helping sort of direct attention to the patreon because it's critical to funding for the network

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:26.940
And so Noah mentions some of these things and I want you to just sort of understand how Noah is trying his best here

01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:29.660
He's gonna come at this and he wants to build this up

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:36.100
but then he gets sort of towards the precipice of the cliff and realizes he doesn't have an answer and he's just got to make

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:41.040
Something up and he eventually winds up putting him and I in something that is going to be utterly

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:47.380
Embarrassing and perhaps completely damaging to our brand if you were to support not only tech talk today

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:53.660
But the entire network and you can do that at patreon.com slash today now, this is a way for you to show

01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:59.020

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.460
The network and if you're the kind of person that says I want less ad spots, I don't like ads

01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.300
I don't want ads

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:10.220
I you guys are selling out to the ad

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.500
Advertisers because no all he talks about is is how many GSM ting cards he has and how many droplets he has on Digital Ocean

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.500
if that's you

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:21.500
Stop complaining and go put your money where your mouth is go to patreon.com slash today now

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:28.460
Here is a here is a special offer special special one-time offer and I know Ange, you know

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:30.460
I've known Ange for oh my god. He's gonna give something away

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.140
Totally totally sitting where West is sitting right now and she's just

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:44.260
Quietly panicking because what Angela and and she's completely right. She's thinking oh my god, whatever he's about to say

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:47.500
We have to stand by I actually I'm the one that's gonna have to do the work

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:53.660
And so she's thinking what what is he about to say this and I'm listening upstairs. I'm like, what is he about to say?

01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.060
If I'm making this up on the fly, I don't have a special

01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:07.180
If you if we if the current patron is at 562 so if people that people that's how many people are patrons right now

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.180
so if we can get to

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.340
570

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.780
570

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:20.020
Before we'll say you could tell he's totally making this legitimately trying to think how long could I realistically get it?

01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:23.020
It's short enough time to make sure that it's evident that it came from this episode

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.500
Eight more people eight more people we get eight people to sign up before

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:33.260
Linux fest will say and that would show Chris that even though Noah has like staggered his way through this entire show

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:39.700
We got a couple patrons. So he actually did a reasonable job if we can do that. I will and this is where I'm

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:46.180
I'm sure yeah, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna do something. I'll do something crazy. You think about that?

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:50.140
I'm just gonna say you know, this is and right. She's trying to cover for you right now

01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:54.740
So she did a great job pulling me through that episode. I appreciated having her here. I've been totally hosed

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.500
She's got good cover

01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.500
Go go tech talk today

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:06.380
Forward slash today supports the whole network. But also if you do watch and filter and that's more your bag

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:11.680
You can support us there as well patreon.com Ford shots. That's a good idea. Yeah, so good content

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:16.260
Yeah, because we do I mean people do want to support in both places, but we understand you can't do that

01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:20.740
But so as if you want to represent and support cheaper broadcasting you can do either one

01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:21.020
All right

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:25.660
Here's what I'll do if you guys go over and we get up to five. What did I say 570?

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.620
Yeah, if we get to 570, I will wear a window shirt to Linux fest Northwest. Oh

01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:34.100
Wow, I will wear a windows. You're gonna have to go find one, right? I

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:39.060
I will wear a Windows shirt to Linux fest Northwest if we can get the

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:44.620
570 well, so we could this is kind of where I start to crap kittens. I'm sitting upstairs and I'm like

01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.220
I'm thinking Saturday and Sunday. We're on the live stream

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.740
I'm thinking we meet a thousand plus listeners and Noah's wearing a window shirt

01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:01.520
I'm thinking all right, if we're gonna do this, we got to do this and salvage the I hope so

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:06.060
I hope that that chat room and the listeners come together and say we forgive you know for totally

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:12.660
botching this episode if you listen carefully in the background, you might hear me scrambling down the stairs and let me let me just clarify the

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:18.220
The can koozie that Noah received in the mail is for the swag level members. Oh, yeah, there's good patreon

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:23.220
Yeah, there's a there's a limited number of those. So just check out the different patreon levels on

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:28.900
patreon.com forward slash today and remember that you can submit your content for the shows at

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.420
And Angela hears me coming in the studio right here. She's doing good again. She's doing really good covering

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:36.740
She's gotten good at this show. So I'm at actually at this moment

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:39.820
I am bussing in the studio and I'm trying to figure out whose microphone I'm gonna take over

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:45.060
Talk today dot reddit.com. I was just thinking. Oh, no, if we I'm in trouble

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.540
We got to like 600 and then I'll wear a Microsoft shirt, too

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:56.060
Like both of us so eight for Noah and 40 for you

01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:01.100
Well, if I'm going otherwise, I'm there otherwise I'm there to promote my brand not Microsoft

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:06.140
Yeah, so that brand being Linux action show at the Linux fest Northwest. I mean it makes sense, right?

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:08.380
We want to let Linux users know check with you before

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:14.380
Okay, I just think that'd be great what if we did it I or I'll wear an Apple shirt

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:16.660
So you'll wear a window shirt. I'll wear an Apple shirt

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:18.380
Okay

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:20.380
Hi, I'm a Mac. I'm a PC

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:26.820
You know the thing is we're gonna be on the live stream. Yeah in front of the cameras

01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:33.460
What did I get myself into so I guess what was the number? All right, here's it's 560 right now 560 something

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.860
562 right now

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.380
562 so if we get to if we get to 600, which I feel like we should one up and just one more

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:46.940
Six oh what if you don't 601 601 we should do before doing this

01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:52.620
Oh, I'm really serious about 601 otherwise. We're marking. We're I mean we're marking Linux fest Northwest 2016 coverage forever

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:54.780
I'm like we go out to after parties. We gotta wear that stuff

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.540
Calvin you know pissing on the

01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:04.100
601

01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.420
You can you can contribute at any level so

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.700
Even if it's just three dollars a month three dollars a month is why not even a coffee a month

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.340
Because I know I gotta go buy an Apple shirt of this

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:18.460

We are trying to get to 601 patrons before a Linux fest Northwest

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:39.900
And we'll have some fun we can film Noah go into the Microsoft Store buying the Windows shirt. Oh, man

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:45.660
Oh, man, just to clarify just just to clarify before everyone freaks out because I see people freaking out in the chatroom

01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:49.580
I see people freaking out about to freak out in the mumble room. I don't run Windows. I don't have Windows install

01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:53.580
I'm not going to install Windows. I'm just gonna wear the shirt guys. I will be on I will testify to that

01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:58.620
I'm more concerned about you in a girly top

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.040
Yeah, me too. I'm not concerned about that at all. It's better than him. I've seen him without pants on

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:09.320
Yeah, I know trust me well, I guess

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:16.640
Yeah, it's gonna be fun, I'm really oh I'm getting a call right now should we take it well yeah sure yeah

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:21.440
No, I don't know. It's a private number. I know we could do the thing but yeah

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:25.560
I'm gonna dismiss call because I don't know although I think I just turned on it

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.680
I think I also just turned on NFC and Wi-Fi calling so

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.320
Boy, that was that was a mess

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:37.820
So this is sort of our last moment of tranquility as we wrap up this episode of the unplugged program

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.460
I we currently don't have a live on filter planned because we're gonna start tearing apart the studio and

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:49.600
So we needed to get out the studio. Yeah. Yeah, don't worry. It's gonna involve more Linux. Yeah

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.220
Potentially a lot more Linux, and we will be making content out of that as we can

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:59.660
And and so check out the calendar Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:05.220

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:09.180
I'm gonna be there Wes is gonna be there. No way the crowd is gonna be wild

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:12.900
I think it's gonna be the best Linux fest ever and the weather right now is ridiculous

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:18.940
Although if you're Noah, it's really hot. It's too hot and he's got allergies. Yeah. Yeah

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:23.540
Yeah, that's nice. That's nice. That's that's good context. That's good context

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:25.420
We'd love to hear your thoughts on anything

01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:30.500
We talked about today from Ubuntu 1604 all the way back up to the beginning of the show and did you know tomb raiders got?

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500
The specs out. I'm really excited about that

01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:37.020
Give us all your thoughts go over to Linux action show dot reddit.com and leave your feedback

01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.660
for episode

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:44.420
141 I would love to have some clips and good stuff are unplugged from Linux fest

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:49.380
So if you're gonna be at Linux fest Northwest and it can maybe even get a little video of some of the sessions or something

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.300
Like that come see us at the booth and let us know maybe we can incorporate into a future unplugged

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:55.540
We'll get some coverage from our virtual lug

01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:57.660
That'd be pretty cool

01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:03.360
Anyways, we'd love to see you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us feedback Linux action show dot reddit.com to give us

How to join the mumble room by getting that info from our chat room. Hmm, and then you can start participate

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:56.820
Thanks for joining us this week. See you right back here next Tuesday

01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.820

And

01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:40.940
There we go. We're in Noah's the yeah

01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:48.340
Windows has now bash on it. That's true. How did I know somebody who's gonna say no and make a great Windows user?

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:57.820
Hold on we've got our first submission for a Chris wears an Apple shirt now

01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.180
Here's the problem in order to get this in time

01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:03.820
I'd have to order it now and I don't know if we're actually get to 601 once you go back you never go back

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.820
Well, then it can just live on the studio wall

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.820
Mm-hmm

01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:10.860
JB titles calm

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:15.820
You have totals JP titles. I thought I'd get more schooled by mr. Popey. That's what I was expecting

01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:21.940
That's what I thought. All right. Look at that wimpy wasn't here, but he's got a title suggestion. I'll Pope. He's just a nice guy

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:25.220
Correct

01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:27.660
So no, what was your impression right in lady jupes?

01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.740
Why yeah your takeaway impressions

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:32.820
the

01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:36.000
The oh jeez, huh? Wow. Wow fail

01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.060
It's super nice. The thing I think that stood out to me most was

01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:45.460
The concept like the total nomadic concept right like so when I am at my house

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:48.880
I have all of you know, I go we go grocery shopping once a month

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.960
We have all the groceries in the house and you know, the kids have all their toys

01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:57.300
They'd have a bedspread that I really like on my bed. And when we go into our RV, it's

01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:01.500
We've got a stock the RV for you know food that is gonna be

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:06.620
You know easy to take along easy to pack isn't gonna go bad real fast that kind of thing and

01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:11.900
I we buy separate bedding that isn't terribly expensive because we know we're not gonna be in there a whole lot

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:13.100
and so

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:18.980
the ability to just you are living the entire week and I came and spent some time with you early last week and

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:25.540
Then all of a sudden. Oh, we're gonna leave and in you know, 30 minutes you push a couple buttons

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.580
You pull a couple hoses you unplug a couple things

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:34.220
and all of a sudden you take your house and bring it on to the interstate and now your house is rolling down the interstate and

01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:38.540
That's awesome. Well, and he gets he gets like we get partway there, right?

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.700
and

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:45.580
Chris goes I'm hungry and just like we just stop his house stops in the middle of the interstate not in the middle of the

01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:49.260
Interstate but you pulled off. There's actually it was like a historical pull-off area. It was actually kind of cool

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.260
No, no, no on the way down. Oh

01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:54.780
Yeah, so we stopped actually was in front of a tire change start. I think yeah

01:58:54.780 --> 01:59:00.700
You're kind of worried about it. But but so he pulls his house to the tires change store and pushes a couple buttons and his

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.540
House transforms. It's like transformers. He goes back from mobile

01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:08.220
traveling down the road back into a house and then he walks into his kitchen and

01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:13.960
His girlfriend starts making him a sandwich in the kitchen with the groceries that they I assume bought for the month

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:16.580
Is this some sort of paradise? Yeah

01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:20.940
He eats us he gets out of his driver's seat and

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:25.460
And walks he wasn't in his boxers, but he could have been because he does shows that way so I was barefoot

01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:28.860
Yeah in this version. He is in his boxers. Yeah. Okay. He's in his boxers

01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:32.440
And so he gets out of his seat if you weren't there I would have been oh really?

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.180
Okay

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:39.340
so he has he had picture this no shirt just boxers and gets gets out of his seat of his driver's seat and walks over and

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.660
eats a sandwich and

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.660
chats her a little bit and relaxes and

01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:48.220
Then he gets back up and goes well, I guess we better get on the road and goes back and sits down still with no

01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:53.060
Clothes on I took a leak too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you piddle a little and then sits back down in his chair

01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:59.160
What's back and drive and then we continue on we never once left the RV on the way down there and we?

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:06.300
Like we didn't even it wasn't even really like a full like let's stop and transition into we're no longer driving anymore

02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:08.920
We just basically stopped you push two buttons to like I don't know what you did

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.060
I suppose you put the jacks out and let the slides out

02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:16.620
But like it was it was it was just interesting to be able to be to go from

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:18.620
Mobile to stationary to mobile

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:21.980
In under minutes, you know mere minutes

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:22.140
Yeah

02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:25.280
And so and then we got to the our overnight spot

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:32.140
Which we just found happened to find on the internet on using all stays app and it was I mean like I would have paid

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:37.620
To stay here. Right? Yeah, so Chris was explaining that he has a trifecta. He likes it to be

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:43.420
Inexpensive he likes it to be close enough to the interstate so he doesn't have to spend a bunch of time effort gas

02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.980
Etc getting out to the place and the third thing is

02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:53.220
He likes it to be private and this place had all three plus it just happened to have like this little creek and it happened

02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:55.980
To have a wildlife. Yeah, it was just a beautiful place

02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:58.820
So we get there and then Chris of in his typical Chris fashion

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:03.060
Reaches under some storage bay and pulls out a grill and he's like this needs to be assembled

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.140
Where'd the brown man go brown man go to work and hands it to me and then I'm like but master I need to he's like

02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:10.780
We don't have tools assemble with your hands boy. I'm like, alright

02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:17.220
So I slave away outside putting the grill together and then we ignited it and you I had some of the best

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:21.740
Marinated grilled chicken this goes back to the fact that we just have our house with us

02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:24.820
You know, we'd gone grocery shopping and had he had just thrown some chicken

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:30.940
She made up a marinade of like some spicy sweet chili and sesame sauce and stuff and just had it in the fridge

02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.580
So we you know, we weren't sure if we're gonna get to cook anything

02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:36.000
But since we had it we just threw it in the on the barbecue

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:41.600
So we we get after after after I slaved away instead assembly the barbecue

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.800
Then Chris walked over and clicked the chicken a couple times and made it into I guess. Okay. No, no, it's really good

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.160
It was it was actually it was actually some of the best barbecue chicken. I'd ever have well

02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:52.520
I'm not really barbecued more of grilled, but you know, whatever

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.040
Excellent point no. Yeah. Yeah. Are you a believer?

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:00.920
I

02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:06.040
Fall somewhere in the middle. Okay. All right, that's fair. So after eating some of the best grilled chicken

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.840
I think I never had then we curl up for a night of watching

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:15.720
Netflix and YouTube because just because you live in an RV apparently doesn't mean that you give up normal internet life

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:21.040
So we did that for a little bit and then just crawled up and went to sleep and the great thing is here's how I woke

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:24.640
Up, I'm you might say I'm a heavy sleeper, right, dude

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:28.900
Well, we have learned is which is great actually for RV living

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:32.640
No, you're a really good RV guest because when Hadid and I just needed to get up

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.400
We just got up started walking around made our breakfast just walking moving around Noah and Noah just sleeps through it all

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.480
You have to intentionally try and wake me up

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.040
But so I'm sleeping and I don't even notice that they're out

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:47.240
I'm just passed out and then the way I woke up was I felt us moving and I'm like, oh

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.720
We're driving down the road and then I realized like my arm is getting pushed like slowly above my head and I'm like

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:55.000
What is happening?

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.760
So I kind of like open my eyes and look around and there's Hadid with like an ear-to-ear grin and she's bringing the slide in

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.680
I'm sleeping on the couch that's on the slide

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.640
And so the slide is like moving in it like my arm is slowly getting pushed up and I'm like, oh good morning

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:13.280
And you know they've been up for a while and then so basically I just got to lay there for a little bit like

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.800
a lazy son of a gun and

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.720
we got on the road and started moving and when I was darn good and ready then I got up all the way and

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.800
And leisurely made my way up to the cab and said hello and hung out for a little bit and then went and had my breakfast

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.720
And whatnot, but to be able to live like that is

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.920
I don't know. There is something super appealing and I think the first thing is I'd really like to see a

02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.920
Paradigm shift I would like to stop seeing people

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:42.960
You know demeaning those and looking down on people that live in smaller homes, you know

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.000
Like campers or trailers or tiny houses. There is a stigma

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.880
I think and I think that it's actually way more efficient and way more fun than people give a credit for yeah

02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.600
Yeah, I thank you, sir. That's a good that was good. That was that was a good fun story

02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:01.360
I loved I was so jazzed up about that boondocking spot that we found because it was

02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:07.880
It was like three minutes from the highway, which is a big deal when you have a really large vehicle and you need to go

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.040
You got to go park

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.960
but you have to be really careful about where you end up because you don't want to end up down a road that you end

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:19.320
Up having to turn around or back up because you might end up having to back down a road for a mile or two and that's

02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:25.600
Extremely challenging. So it's always kind of a stressful thing when you decide to go off in a town

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.420
You don't know and you just kind of go down a dark road because of course we decided to drive into the night

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.560
like we always do and

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.080
So when we found this place, it was so dark. I

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.000
Could tell there was a lot of space and there's a lot of gravel

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.400
There was some uneven ground and stuff like that, but it was so dark

02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.960
I couldn't really get a didn't know what you'd found. Yeah, I couldn't get a perception of how big it was

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.760
And then when the Sun when the Sun came up it was like movie picturesque because we have a wind we have a couple of

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.640
Windows in our bedroom, but we have one window that that faces what's what side does the Sun rise on?

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.520
I guess we were parked that direction

02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:05.280
So I guess we're our bedroom window is faced perfectly east and the Sun's the Sun literally came up and like rose in our window

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.280
In our bedroom, so we it was just this

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.720
Extremely yellow sunlight that came in and just blasted our bedroom with just gorgeous yellow sunlight

02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:19.480
And that's what I woke up to and then when I came outside and realized that we had parked around lakes and ponds

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:25.840
And there were bridges and they were like there were trails and it was just really something and it was it was gravel

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:27.800
And so it was nice and clean gravel

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:33.880
It was you know you could walk around you weren't bringing a bunch of dirt into them into the rig and just just a perfect spot

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:40.080
And absolutely free they just have a three night max and the thing is is lady dupes has about 12 hours of battery

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.600
give or take and

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:48.200
then then a generator to cover any of the gaps there and the way the way the generator works in lady dupes is

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.400
It kicks on until the batteries are charged back up

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:56.280
Or if you're doing something that's extremely demanding electric electrical wise right have more look

02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:00.960
Yeah, and then once you're done with either the batteries charged, or you're done with your demand the generator turns off

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:07.200
So you're not always running the generator. Yeah, so it's just basically a way to supplement the batteries, and so we're sitting there watching

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:10.840
Netflix and YouTube and it's all silent

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:16.080
It's it we're in the middle and like you got the windows open so you can hear like all the wildlife outside, and it was

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:22.880
Unbelievable it was it was kind of the perfect night to just start the road civilized adventure. Yeah, it was it was

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:30.280
Mm-hmm on the flagship of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network USS June
