WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
We should probably get started here in just a second, but I thought this was, this was

00:05.720 --> 00:06.720
really awesome.

00:06.720 --> 00:07.720
This was tweeted to me.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.120
It's the hybrid tube amp for the Raspberry Pi.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.280
It's on Kickstarter.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
They had a goal of $20,000.

00:12.280 --> 00:17.800
They've already raised $89,229 with 20 days left to go.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.200
648 backers.

00:19.200 --> 00:25.880
It is a monster tube amp that you slap onto the top like a hat to your Raspberry Pi.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
Look at that thing, Wes.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
That is neat.

00:27.880 --> 00:34.080
I'm, I know audio from production standpoints, you know, like through the regular interfaces

00:34.080 --> 00:37.520
or uses the GPIO pins to like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.580
So you bring that sweet tube sound to the Raspberry Pi, it says, and I'm not a really

00:42.580 --> 00:46.800
like super high-end audio guy, but I could kind of tell you a little bit about it.

00:46.800 --> 00:55.300
This crazy thing has a PCM5102A DAC that drives a single 12 AU7 tube gain stage with a solid

00:55.300 --> 00:56.820
state class A output.

00:56.820 --> 01:01.640
It's designed to drive headphones from 32 to 300 ohms quite easily.

01:01.640 --> 01:07.020
In other words to say, pretty nice piece of kit and the pricing, you know, is getting

01:07.020 --> 01:11.140
up there now because a lot of different slots, but right now you could get them for 150 bucks.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.160
I would never do something like this, but here's what I freaking love about this.

01:15.160 --> 01:20.320
First of all, super high-end crazy weird gear being built for the Raspberry Pi.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.000
That's next level stuff, man.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
That's next level stuff.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.920
I think this is super neat.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.120
I'm not going to back it though.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.480
I do like the idea that it's like almost the size of like the just little USB DAC, but

01:32.480 --> 01:35.800
it's also running Linux and you know, do whatever you want on it.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
Boom!

01:36.800 --> 01:40.120
Raspberry Pi not included.

01:40.120 --> 01:55.680
This is Linux Unplugged episode 145 for May 17th, 2016.

01:55.680 --> 02:00.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that's detecting more hops than it

02:00.560 --> 02:02.000
thinks it should.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
My name is Chris.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
My name is Wes.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Hey there, Wes.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.280
You know, I am really looking forward to today's episode.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.480
A couple of fun things happened on Sunday's show, and one of those things we're going

02:11.480 --> 02:14.520
to rip out and expand here in the show because we've got a lot of feedback on it.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.160
I love it when the community sort of like gives us a feedback loop that feeds right

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
into the next show.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
That's why we're here.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.640
We're right in that feedback loop right now, and we'll be covering that later on in the

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
show.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.920
First though, some interesting updates and tidbits from the Linus, actually some really

02:28.920 --> 02:32.440
good like serious nice insights from Linus about the security.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.440
It's like getting coffee with Linus.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
Right.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.080
Security in the Internet of Things, which he actually had some really sane thoughts

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
on.

02:41.080 --> 02:47.440
Later on though, Greg Kh, your buddy, he says you're insecure unless you're using his kernel

02:47.440 --> 02:49.120
and only his kernel.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.600
So it's a bold statement, Wes.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.600
It's a bold statement.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.240
We'll tell you which kernel that is and why he thinks that.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.200
And he's got both Red Hat and SUSE to point the finger at.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.120
He's wagging his finger.

03:00.120 --> 03:05.800
And then after all of that, we'll finish it up with a rather kind of urgent security thing

03:05.800 --> 03:07.680
going on, on two fronts.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.680
One with Mozilla and one with TeamViewer.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.600
So if you are considering remote administration on your computer or have TeamViewer in production

03:14.600 --> 03:18.360
like I know Noah does, you definitely want to stay tuned for that.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.280
So it's a big show, big, big show.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.680
Before we go any further though, we must bring in that virtual log.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.680
Time appropriate greetings, MumbleRu.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
Hello.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
Hello.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.680
Hello.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.680
Hello.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.200
That makes me smile.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
Wow.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
Wow.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.400
That was, that is a heck of a showing.

03:35.400 --> 03:40.640
And I'll tell you what, kind of a surprisingly good tone from all of you.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.800
We should consider doing a sing-along after the show.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.120
See, Linux users are nice, Chris.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
I told you.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.120
Yeah.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.640
Although one voice that will only be joining us from time to time.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.800
I secretly use Arch Linux.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.320
Poby is, he's not in there, I don't think, because he's down in Tejas for OSCON, which

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
is going on right now.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.040
Boy, OSCON, kind of a rough schedule timing, because they're scheduled right up against

04:00.040 --> 04:02.640
Google IO next week, or tomorrow, I should say.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
So that's a tough one.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
All right.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.000
So before we go any further, Wes, I did mention the hops.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.960
I got to talk about, I got to just say, I got to talk about this for a second.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.320
The 777 from Scuttlebutt.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.040
This is a Belgian-style ale that was literally brewed and bottled, hmm, 20 minutes from the

04:17.040 --> 04:19.200
studio right on the waterfront.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
It's gorgeous.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.800
This is a nice one.

04:21.800 --> 04:26.120
It's a dark gold, slight copper kind of color with an aroma that's got delicate cloves.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.160
Banana esters, whatever the hell that is.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.160
I do get the cloves, though.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.160
It's kind of spicy.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.440
And maybe, look at this.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.660
That's exactly what, yeah.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.400
And also, hints of white pear.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
Damn.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.400
I also did not realize it was 9% when I bought it.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.800
Yeah, it's a stronger one.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.560
It's got very smooth and delicate, and it finishes dry.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
That's true, though.

04:43.560 --> 04:48.240
With a hint of tartness, which I'm not going to lie, I'm definitely picking up on.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.000
And the first time I read that, I thought it said a hint of fartness.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It does not say that.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.940
And I have not even finished the first one.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.840
So it's going to be a good show, Wes.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.600
It's going to be a good show.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.920
One of the things that I was playing on the live stream, unless it's copywritten, because

05:01.920 --> 05:02.920
then I wasn't playing it.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.500
But if it's not copywritten, one of the things I was playing on the live stream before we

05:05.500 --> 05:10.680
started the show was a little sit down that Linus did at the Internet of Things conference,

05:10.680 --> 05:14.860
which is actually kind of a big deal on the front right there.

05:14.860 --> 05:19.320
The fact that Linus is even at an Internet of Things conference says something, right?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.320
Yeah, definitely.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
And so he's there.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.320
Oh, whoa, whoa.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
Hi there.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
Hi there.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.520
I'm just going to have my mouse up on the tabs.

05:26.520 --> 05:30.200
He's at this Internet of Things conference, and he had a whole range of things to say

05:30.200 --> 05:31.200
in the whole video.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.320
It is embedded right there in that link in the show notes.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.720
So if you want to get that, you can listen to the whole thing.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.080
It's like 30 minutes long.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.400
Pretty low key, but it's a good listen.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
Yeah, yeah.

05:40.400 --> 05:46.840
He said, so Internet of Things was obviously the main topic at this conference.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.000
And the top interview was Linus himself.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.800
And he said, maybe you won't see when asked about, I'll give a little context here since

05:53.800 --> 05:55.880
we're not going to play the clip.

05:55.880 --> 06:03.760
When asked about what's Linus' competitive advantage on those really far end sensor devices,

06:03.760 --> 06:06.960
the ones that are running other embedded OSs now, and he's like, I don't really know if

06:06.960 --> 06:09.600
there is a competitive advantage for Linus there.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.000
But he does think that Linus will be at the central hub that all those things connect

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
back to.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.840
Yeah, I think part of his point is that there will be small devices that don't need Linus,

06:18.840 --> 06:23.420
but they will all be talking to other smarter devices that you will need the kind of capability

06:23.420 --> 06:24.520
that Linux provides.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
OK.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.560
So then he got all Zen Master when talking about security.

06:30.560 --> 06:37.720
He was, you know, the problem was, and the interviewer brought up the fact that Bruce

06:37.720 --> 06:41.920
Schneier wrote an article saying, the Internet of Things is unpatchable.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
It's busted.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.240
It's busted by design.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
It is not patchable.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.880
We are screwed with the Internet of Things.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.560
And so Linus was asked, do you basically agree with Bruce Schneier?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
And he said, you know what?

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
I don't worry about it.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.400
I don't worry about it because there's not a lot we can do.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
It's unpatchable.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.240
It's just a fact of life.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.680
But that's why he thinks hubs running Linux will be even more important.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.680
Your thoughts, Wes.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.680
Your thoughts.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.380
Is it unpatchable, Wes?

07:06.380 --> 07:09.400
I don't know about unpatchable, but I think he's right.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.400
Yes, it is.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.400
Come on.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
It is pretty much unpatchable.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.260
There are ways to deal with it, but clearly no one is interested in pursuing them and

07:16.260 --> 07:17.600
there's no money being spent doing it.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.320
So the problem is you have two scenarios.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.200
First problem is you either have the up to the user, which then it never gets done.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.200
Yeah, absolutely.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.400
Or you force the update on the user and then you have a problem like we were chatting in

07:28.400 --> 07:30.840
our production chat this morning.

07:30.840 --> 07:36.440
Angela's grandmother has an old computer that had by default the express settings were turned

07:36.440 --> 07:39.680
on and recommended updates were turned on.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.820
And this morning her computer automatically installed Windows 10, rebooted, and then just

07:43.820 --> 07:44.820
fails to boot.

07:44.820 --> 07:47.040
Like it just fails at boot up.

07:47.040 --> 07:53.040
And now her computer for her, as a woman who I think is maybe in her 80s or near it, her

07:53.040 --> 07:54.720
computer is essentially ruined now.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Right.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
Just doesn't work.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.360
So automatic updates obviously is not a way to go either because a company with billions

08:00.360 --> 08:05.360
of dollars and literally tens of thousands of developers can't get it right.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.960
I would hope that these smaller platforms with more rigidly controlled hardware will

08:09.960 --> 08:14.560
be easier to target for automatic updates, especially if you don't allow any or very

08:14.560 --> 08:17.780
much user configuration to make it a more varied platform.

08:17.780 --> 08:21.620
But still, you have a very good point and it's no good if your product goes down forever.

08:21.620 --> 08:28.100
You like it, or I mean, I'm sorry North Ranger, you think corporate like device builders like

08:28.100 --> 08:31.320
your Hughes out there, they think what Linus is saying is music to their ears?

08:31.320 --> 08:33.120
To define what you're saying.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.120
Explain.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.120
Yeah.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.280
So I mean they love Linux because it makes their jobs easier to bring new devices to

08:39.280 --> 08:41.000
the market quickly.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.480
But ultimately they would rather you throw that device away in two years and buy a new

08:45.480 --> 08:46.480
one.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.640
So who cares if they get updates for a long, long time?

08:50.640 --> 08:58.560
So for the device makers out there that want to sell you a new device, Linus not caring

08:58.560 --> 09:06.520
about security or not caring about continuous updates plays right into their narrative.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.520
Hey DMC, I like your point too about perhaps this is where Ubuntu Snappy Core or whatever

09:12.520 --> 09:16.000
is could come in and maybe provide a solution that's actually manageable, right?

09:16.000 --> 09:21.160
Yeah, as far as I heard, this was the bright vision of Ubuntu to being able with Snappy

09:21.160 --> 09:24.880
to upgrade the operating system of these devices.

09:24.880 --> 09:31.080
And supposedly, excuse me, supposedly Canonical is working with Hawaii and a few other vendors

09:31.080 --> 09:37.040
out there and they're going to be demoing Snappy Core on a device at OSCON this week.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.040
Oh really?

09:38.040 --> 09:39.960
So we should probably have more news about it last I would think.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
That's awesome.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.520
So yeah, maybe they will save all of us.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.200
You sound so hopeful.

09:46.200 --> 09:50.400
Speaking of Linus, Linux 4.6 came out today, was it?

09:50.400 --> 09:51.400
Let's see, yesterday.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
No.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
No, two days ago.

09:53.400 --> 10:00.080
And it's got a couple of big things in it, USB 3.1 super speed is 10 gigabit support,

10:00.080 --> 10:06.560
out of memory task killer has been improved, Orange FS has been included, a distributed

10:06.560 --> 10:10.240
file system, and the Batman protocol got an update, which I'm always a fan of, tracking

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
Batman.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.800
It's actually, there's just actually a metric S ton of updates.

10:14.800 --> 10:19.520
I mean, we don't very often mention kernel versions when they get updated on the show,

10:19.520 --> 10:25.280
but every now and then there's a doozy, or as Linus puts it, a weasel, which is explained

10:25.280 --> 10:26.340
in that video.

10:26.340 --> 10:30.520
Every now and then there's a weasel that comes out that looks like a real good one.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.440
Unless you're Greg KH, and then he says if you're running anything but his.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.520
You know, also in here is like the USB 3.1 support, which that'll be important.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.100
So that's called the super speed plus protocol, which is the 10 gigabit speed for USB, which

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
is really great.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.640
Yeah, go ahead.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.080
So in here, actually, it's because Linus has mentioned many times before that he doesn't

10:50.080 --> 10:53.080
look at security like the security experts usually care.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.640
He thinks it's okay and good that people care about it, but he personally doesn't even see

10:56.640 --> 11:01.560
it as a big threat, as software will change and accommodate depending on the scenario.

11:01.560 --> 11:06.560
And security is usually much more about the work environment than necessarily the technical

11:06.560 --> 11:07.560
feet of the things.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.560
Mm hmm.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.560
Yeah.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.560
He says that he's concerned.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.760
While Greg, on the other hand, he tends to listen a little bit more on the security experts

11:14.760 --> 11:17.020
because he handles the stable kernel.

11:17.020 --> 11:21.760
So his concerns are also a little bit more in line with that vision of what's secure.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.720
Yes, in a way.

11:23.720 --> 11:29.040
He was actually just recently interviewed, and he kind of outlines his thoughts on it.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
So I'm actually...

11:30.040 --> 11:31.040
I have that story in here.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
We'll get to that in just a second.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
We'll cover that.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
In fact, why don't we...

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
Let's just talk about it right now.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.040
Wait, wait, wait.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.560
So before we do that, just really briefly, I will mention our friends over at Digital

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
Ocean.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.520
Head over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DO, unplugged, all one word, lower

11:45.520 --> 11:47.440
case, to get yourself a great deal.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.920
Digital Ocean is Linux rigs up in the cloud.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.360
Now we all know the cloud means somebody else's server.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
That's legit.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
Let's be honest.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.360
That's what it means.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
That's why you got to make sure they're damn good servers, like with data centers all over

11:58.360 --> 11:59.360
the world where you want them.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
Have you seen those pics?

12:00.360 --> 12:01.360
Oh, dude.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.360
Digital Ocean's data centers are beautiful.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.360
Yeah, they are.

12:03.360 --> 12:07.960
Seriously, as somebody who used to rack up servers, I look at that and I go, wow.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.960
They got...

12:08.960 --> 12:09.960
They're better than me.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.000
They got way better than me, dude.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.940
They have great infrastructure, Linux throughout the entire stack.

12:15.940 --> 12:19.680
It is SSDs for all of the disk IO.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.360
Eight CPUs, tier one bandwidth, $5 a month as a starting price.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

12:25.360 --> 12:32.160
You get 512 megabytes of RAM, 512 or a gigabyte of terabyte of transfer.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.160
There we go.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.160
Those are the units.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.160
I know.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.160
There's beer.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.160
There's so much.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.160
I mean, it's hard to account for.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.160
I can't believe this.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.160
I've had half this beer and I think it's already hitting my head.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.160
I tell you what.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.160
Because you know...

12:42.160 --> 12:43.800
I think Digital Ocean is just such an amazing deal.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.800
You're not ready for it.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.120
Well, let's be honest.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.600
I've upgraded recently to the $10 machine.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.480
Oh, I use the $10, too.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
It's nice.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.480
It is.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.480
In fact, the pricing structure...

12:53.480 --> 12:54.480
You can do whatever you want on a $10 rig.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.080
And really, what I have done is I started at $5 and I've gone to $10 and that's where

12:58.080 --> 13:00.520
you get the one gigabyte of memories at the $10 rig.

13:00.520 --> 13:05.320
And I love that because then I get 30 gigabytes of SSD, two terabytes of transfer.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.640
But they say their most popular plan is the one that has two cores.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.640
I don't know.

13:09.640 --> 13:14.160
You know, one of the things I really like about Digital Ocean is their super nice dashboard

13:14.160 --> 13:17.080
makes it very clear to monitor your CPU usage.

13:17.080 --> 13:23.440
And in the early days of my Digital Ocean usage, I think I was coming at this from a

13:23.440 --> 13:26.600
perspective of, I need way more RAM, I need way more CPU.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.920
And I was over-building my machines and then I would go look at the charts and go, well,

13:29.920 --> 13:31.860
these things are kind of just sitting here.

13:31.860 --> 13:36.200
And so I started to realize that when you have unbelievably fast bandwidth and when

13:36.200 --> 13:40.920
you have all SSDs for the entire stack and you're running a low, small install of Linux,

13:40.920 --> 13:44.680
it doesn't have the graphics tag, it doesn't have any of that crap, you can get away with...

13:44.680 --> 13:46.480
I mean, it feels like you're stealing it.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
It's so cheap.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
It's so great.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.320
And so for me, the $10 plan has really been the sweet spot.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.720
They say the $20 one is their most popular, the $20 one, the $20 plan is their most popular,

13:55.720 --> 13:58.080
but $5 and $10 has been solid for me.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.080
And you know what?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.760
We just, whenever we need a new rig...

14:00.760 --> 14:03.120
See like for me, I like the $40 for build machines.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.120
Really?

14:04.120 --> 14:07.080
Like you were talking about like, oh, DKMS, you got to compile the ZFS module.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.080
But then what?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.480
Are you doing it hourly or do you run them all the time?

14:10.480 --> 14:15.480
You just, with the API, spin up a new machine, run your script, grab the compiled module,

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
shut it down.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.480
Yeah.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.480
Yeah.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.480
That is something else we're doing more now.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
We are spinning...

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
It's so nice.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.280
We are spinning machines up and down for shows now that we don't need running when we're

14:23.280 --> 14:24.280
not live.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
It makes it very economical.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.600
It's only there when you need it.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.600
They're honey badger bad.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.520
That's why they created a really good API for all of that.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.360
They also have great documentation.

14:32.360 --> 14:37.240
They have one click installations of apps and all of the OSs.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.240
Like core OSs.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.280
We'll be talking more about the opinion of...

14:40.280 --> 14:42.640
What's that one on the bottom right right there, Chris?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Free... business?

14:43.640 --> 14:46.520
Is that how you say it?

14:46.520 --> 14:49.000
I think that's based on Slackware.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I'm not sure.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I think it's based on Slackware.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.600
They also have Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Ubuntu.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
You can check it all out.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.440
They have one click applications of just a single app or the entire stack.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.440
It is sweet.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.440
DigitalOcean.com.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
Check them out and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
Wow.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.480
I'm glad you brought more than one of these beers because I think I'm going to have another

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
one.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
You know what I should do?

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
Okay.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.960
I'll just, before the next ad, I'm going to finish this beer.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
And we'll just see how I do.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.960
We'll see how I do.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.760
We'll just see how we do.

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
Okay.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.400
So you heard Mr. Devlin begin the conversation.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.440
Let's pick that right back up.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.080
Linux can't keep you safe if you don't update it.

15:26.080 --> 15:30.920
Pretty, pretty obvious coming from Greg Cache, but it goes further than that.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.480
So there is a Core OS Fest in Berlin.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.600
Man, OSCON, guys, I've been going to OSCON for years.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
You guys are great.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
But I'll tell you what.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.480
You're up against Google I.O. and Core OS Fest in Berlin.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
That kind of sounds fun.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.960
And Greg's over at Core OS Fest because he's involved with that project, like I was just

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
saying.

15:46.960 --> 15:47.960
We'll be talking about it in a moment.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.080
And if you're not familiar, we have interviewed him in the past.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.040
He is the Linux kernel developer and maintainer of the stable branch, or sometimes called

15:54.040 --> 15:59.280
the LTS branch, as well as the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel and many other important

15:59.280 --> 16:01.560
subsystems that people just frankly didn't want to do.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.120
So good guy Greg picked him up.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.840
And he was saying, for the last 15 years in the Linux kernel community, they've been following

16:08.840 --> 16:11.200
a rule to fix things as soon as possible.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.800
The Linux community fixes bugs and then pushes them out so the vendors can then push them

16:14.800 --> 16:16.880
to their users.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.680
He talked about, for example, a bug that they fixed and then pushed the new release and

16:19.680 --> 16:21.200
got it out there.

16:21.200 --> 16:25.200
But then three years later, someone realized that there's a security bug.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.560
You could go to a local root user and you could go away.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.440
You could just go run around.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.120
Turns out Red Hat and Seuss had to go back and fix all of their old stuff.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.360
We had a very bad history of keeping bugs alive for a long time.

16:38.360 --> 16:43.360
Nobody did a check of it, and most known live bugs in the last five years in these systems,

16:43.360 --> 16:46.400
there are things that people know and they know how to exploit out there.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.560
They're not closed.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.960
And that's a problem for infrastructure.

16:48.960 --> 16:54.220
Now, it's kind of a bit of a ramble, but what he's saying is, if you're following a mainline

16:54.220 --> 16:58.120
secure patched kernel, you're going to be safe.

16:58.120 --> 17:03.120
But if you're using a Red Hat Enterprise kernel, they're not necessarily taking all of the

17:03.120 --> 17:04.120
fixes.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.540
Following all the hard work that Greg does to put those patches into there.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.880
And you assume they are, but he's saying they're not.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.840
In fact, a lot of the vulnerabilities in the last five years have been ones we already

17:11.840 --> 17:12.840
had patches for.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.840
They just haven't made it back.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.840
Oh, that's rough.

17:14.840 --> 17:15.840
He says Android is another example.

17:15.840 --> 17:16.840
What does he say?

17:16.840 --> 17:20.280
We have a very bad history of keeping bugs alive for a long time.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.280
Yeah.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.280
That's not what Linux should be known for.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.280
Yeah.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.720
So he points out Android also has issues.

17:25.720 --> 17:31.500
He says, basically, Greg quote, your machine is insecure unless you're running my kernel

17:31.500 --> 17:34.440
or based on my kernel or at least based on another one.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.640
If you're not taking these fixes, then it's insecure.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.800
He has a very clear message for companies and communities building products around Linux.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.220
You have to be able to update your machines.

17:43.220 --> 17:46.880
You have to be able to provide a system where your machines are updated and you constantly

17:46.880 --> 17:48.360
take advantage of it.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.120
Man, that is so true.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.800
That is so true.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.500
The LTSs and the Red Hat Enterprise Linuxes out there are great and super stable platforms

17:57.500 --> 17:59.960
for enterprises to target.

17:59.960 --> 18:04.600
But if they're not pulling in the fixes that Greg's putting in, then we are not taking

18:04.600 --> 18:09.560
advantage of one of the fundamental features of an open source operating system.

18:09.560 --> 18:13.200
It's like a commercial model applied to something that's a moving target.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.840
And he's building these LTS kernels that aren't updated as frequently as the main kernel.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
In fact, it's-

18:18.840 --> 18:19.840
Right.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.840
They should be a pretty easy target, hopefully.

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
Mm-hmm.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.840
And they're updated and they're maintained for years.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.720
Derek Delvin, I wanted to have you pick it back up.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
Go ahead.

18:25.720 --> 18:33.080
Yeah, basically, I think this is the equivalent of Greg's FU to NVIDIA, as Linus said, basically.

18:33.080 --> 18:39.640
And maybe spur attention to the issue from the distros by having the pressure.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
Now-

18:40.640 --> 18:41.640
I hope that that's the intention there.

18:41.640 --> 18:46.640
So you're saying this is his middle finger to the overall industry?

18:46.640 --> 18:49.480
Yeah, basically.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.240
In a way, what's the effect it's going to come out?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.920
He's not winning any more for people using his kernel.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.920
Basically he's just saying, start adopting the patches in my work.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.120
I've been working on this.

19:01.120 --> 19:07.560
Yeah, and I guess the thing about Greg's kernel, too, is it's not updated as frequently as

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
the main line kernel.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.480
So there is a lot less cycle there you have to follow.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.200
So you're on Appricity right now?

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
Yes.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.920
If you check for updates, do you have a kernel 4.6?

19:15.920 --> 19:17.760
It came out two days ago.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.480
I'm just curious about that.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.680
Because I think Arch got it pretty quick.

19:23.680 --> 19:32.040
Appricity, Wes, if I recall, it's Arch-based, pretty limited customization.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
Reminds us a lot of Antigros.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
It does, yeah.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.280
You've stuck with it for a couple of weeks now.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.280
How come?

19:36.280 --> 19:38.160
Well, it's been working well.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.320
I'm not seeing-

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
Maybe you already have it.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
Maybe I do.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
Nope.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.320
4.5.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.320
4-1.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.320
Okay.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
So you just checked-

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
You just did a package update?

19:48.320 --> 19:51.680
Yeah, and I have not yet looked what's- they give you one custom repo.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.360
I have not looked at everything that's installed there.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.720
I don't know if my kernel is from there or not.

19:54.720 --> 20:03.240
So I have Linux 4.5.4 now.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.160
So I'm just curious, overall, Appricity seems like- so you had something- you had what did

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
you say?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
Do you remember which kernel?

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
4.5.4.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.160
Okay, yeah.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
So it seems pretty up-to-date.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.160
Not quite 4.6 yet.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.160
Right.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
But what are your couple of weeks in thoughts now with Appricity?

20:15.160 --> 20:16.880
Just like as a super quick follow-up review.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
Yeah, I'm enjoying it.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.640
I've had Ubuntu 16.04 on here.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.320
There's Linux Mint on this laptop.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.000
Appricity Antigros has been on here in the past, and I've always enjoyed Antigros.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.480
So Appricity seems like a little bit of a competition.

20:27.480 --> 20:31.360
They have a kind of like stripped down, or at least so they say, version of GNOME.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
So it's pretty lightweight.

20:32.360 --> 20:36.120
They don't install all of the GNOME apps or all the dependencies.

20:36.120 --> 20:39.480
In fact, when you sat down the laptop at first, like, is that elementary OS?

20:39.480 --> 20:40.480
Yeah.

20:40.480 --> 20:45.000
You know, it's pretty clean style, seems to run well, and I have access to Arch.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.520
So it's familiar if I need to install things.

20:46.520 --> 20:52.160
All the configuration is the same as upstream, and they come with the TLP power saving tools

20:52.160 --> 20:55.520
by default, which in my experience have done a very good job.

20:55.520 --> 21:02.480
So oh, it also has the nice power line terminal for BI and Bash and ZSH.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.920
So Appricity gets the Westpane nod of approval.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.920
I don't know if I would install...

21:06.920 --> 21:07.920
You know, I'm building a nice new desktop.

21:07.920 --> 21:13.360
I don't know that I would install it as my be-all end-all, but as a laptop I use for

21:13.360 --> 21:16.680
the show and a few other things, it hasn't been bad.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.680
Nice.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.760
It might also be my, you know, it's nice to have an Arch graphical install just as

21:21.760 --> 21:25.260
like something where I can use Gparted if I need to or a rescue CD.

21:25.260 --> 21:27.400
So I can see Appricity being that as well.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
Yeah, cool.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.400
There you go.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.520
A little quick update on Appricity and if you guys are looking for something that does

21:31.520 --> 21:35.160
stay fairly current but is interesting, it might be worth a look.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.760
I kind of want to try it on a machine.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.980
I don't – I do not like this.

21:39.980 --> 21:44.520
We have been covering different iterations of the FBI and their attack on Tor and Tor

21:44.520 --> 21:48.920
developers now for a couple of weeks and this feels awful.

21:48.920 --> 21:55.240
So the FBI has a case where they used Tor, an exploit against Tor, which now appears

21:55.240 --> 22:02.240
to be potentially an exploit against Firefox to get this guy and Mozilla wants the FBI

22:02.240 --> 22:06.520
to reveal the details of the exploit ahead of the trial because if the FBI refuses to

22:06.520 --> 22:16.800
do so, which so far it has, then it would be revealed publicly in the case, which would

22:16.800 --> 22:21.280
mean that anyone could just jump on an actual in the wild exploit right now.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.320
That's bad, bad stuff.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.320
So –

22:24.320 --> 22:28.400
It's an interesting – it's an interesting argument and especially since, you know, if

22:28.400 --> 22:34.200
it is going to be in the public domain or the public record anyway, I wonder if they

22:34.200 --> 22:38.860
have – what their case even just internally is for not doing it.

22:38.860 --> 22:42.800
It also ties into like obviously the FBI knew about it before and is willfully deciding

22:42.800 --> 22:46.360
that it's better serves the public interest for them to keep it secret than to share it

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
with the public.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.360
So where does that fall now?

22:48.360 --> 22:51.800
So does anybody in the Mumba room have a good argument for why Mozilla needs access to this

22:51.800 --> 22:57.040
information before the trial since it's all open source anyways?

22:57.040 --> 22:58.120
Go ahead if anybody does.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.120
I have –

22:59.120 --> 23:00.120
Well –

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Yeah.

23:01.120 --> 23:08.560
So in the end, having more information will then – will be useful if not only to construct

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
a good case?

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
Well, I guess –

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
I guess.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.960
I – so why – but why hold it so close?

23:12.960 --> 23:16.440
Why – so is the FBI – I guess here's another way to ask the question.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.440
To me, it seems obvious.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.380
Mozilla wants this information so they can get a patch out there as fast as possible

23:20.380 --> 23:23.080
for its public information and it's in the public domain.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.160
The FBI though, why are they not revealing it to Mozilla privately?

23:27.160 --> 23:29.880
Couldn't they do it like with an NDA or something like that?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.720
Like why – what's the motivation there?

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
That I don't understand.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.640
Right, at least let them patch so that they can have something ready to ship when it is

23:35.640 --> 23:36.640
released publicly.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
Yeah.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.640
It seems like –

23:38.640 --> 23:42.480
Well, but then you are giving preferential treatment, right?

23:42.480 --> 23:48.880
As a public entity, in a way, this comes a lot as if you start being okay with private

23:48.880 --> 23:55.800
talks, the transparency that they've already been accused so much of will further damage

23:55.800 --> 23:56.800
their reputation.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
And so –

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
Yeah.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.520
To me, it seems like the FBI goes on and on all day long about how they want companies,

24:03.520 --> 24:06.960
private companies to work with them to save us all from terrorism, but then as soon as

24:06.960 --> 24:11.080
private companies want to protect citizens from cyber attacks, the FBI don't have time

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
for you.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.680
It's just kind of a little – it sucks.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.840
I'm glad Colonel Linux just made it here because I actually put this story in the updates

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
just for him.

24:18.840 --> 24:22.400
There's been a sudden increase in TeamViewer account compromises.

24:22.400 --> 24:27.280
Even TeamViewer accounts that have long, complicated passwords that have only been used on that

24:27.280 --> 24:34.320
TeamViewer account, I guess there has been a wave of TeamViewer hacks.

24:34.320 --> 24:38.280
Mr. Colonel Linux, are you aware that there's two-factor authentication for that TeamViewer?

24:38.280 --> 24:43.040
I was, although I don't use the account feature of TeamViewer.

24:43.040 --> 24:47.920
I think that is primarily reserved for companies that use it as their primary source of remote

24:47.920 --> 24:52.040
administration and the thing is, for me, it is just a – it's a way to help mom with

24:52.040 --> 24:53.040
their computer.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.840
It's a way to help dad when he needs something and I'm away or a couple of friends.

24:56.840 --> 25:01.860
So I don't – if I have a TeamViewer account, I certainly don't use it and if you sign

25:01.860 --> 25:04.280
in then you can save all the computers you connected to.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.360
I'm asking for one-time passwords every time I'm doing that, right?

25:07.360 --> 25:10.120
So I'm getting the team – I'm getting the partner ID and I'm getting the password.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.040
I'm fixing the problem and then I'm done with it.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.040
Problem solved.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.040
All right.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.400
Then my next story was also put in here for you.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.560
You really showed up just at the right time.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.560
It's kind of magical.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.160
I'm glad these things.

25:20.160 --> 25:27.200
So the question has been asked, has the Ubuntu 16.04 Network Manager been fixed?

25:27.200 --> 25:33.220
And I started digging around in the bug and it is super depressing.

25:33.220 --> 25:34.400
First of all, the answer is no.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.920
The bug has not been fixed.

25:35.920 --> 25:42.360
And second of all, the answer over the Launchpad bug was to go file a GNOME bug and then when

25:42.360 --> 25:47.420
you go read the GNOME bug, the GNOME bug completely misses the point.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.920
Everything is lost – they start thinking it's like some sort of DNS resolve issue.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.120
Everything is lost in translation.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.580
Kernel Linux, I know this has been sort of the number one, I think, I think the number

25:57.580 --> 26:01.240
one bug you've been struggling with in deployments.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.360
Have you found a workaround for this particular issue?

26:03.360 --> 26:05.960
This is the one where you wake up from sleep and all of a sudden Network Manager is just

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
gone.

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
Oh, I've had that problem too.

26:07.960 --> 26:08.960
Yeah.

26:08.960 --> 26:09.960
Yeah.

26:09.960 --> 26:10.960
So let's be clear.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.960
There is no deployments.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.760
NOAA has not done any deployments with 16.04 because that is a show-stopping issue.

26:14.760 --> 26:19.240
In fact, so much so that I don't even use it on my laptop, I can't because I need to

26:19.240 --> 26:23.880
be able to access a network when I bring my laptop out of sleep and restarting every three

26:23.880 --> 26:26.560
or four times just isn't an option.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.360
If it has been fixed or somebody has done anything about it, I haven't seen it.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.760
I might have a workaround for you.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
Okay, that would be good.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.760
I got that problem when I opened the laptop as well.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.600
I had to turn off and turn on the cards with fconfig to get it to work.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.600
I've had to reboot to get it to come back.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Yeah.

26:42.600 --> 26:49.320
So it looks like the command line utility nmtui-connect, you should be able to use that.

26:49.320 --> 26:53.160
You were also mentioning talking about using the systemd—what was it?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
Systemd networkd.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.480
Tell me about systemd networkd, Wes.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.880
You will need obviously then some other thing to manage the wireless side because it will

26:59.880 --> 27:02.160
just handle like the link side, not the wireless.

27:02.160 --> 27:07.400
But if maybe—okay, so what I was hoping you would say is, say you were just going

27:07.400 --> 27:10.520
to connect to Wi-Fi and it was the same network, nothing had changed, that you could just use

27:10.520 --> 27:13.120
that to bring the link up and maybe it would just connect to the same Wi-Fi network.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.640
Yeah, you probably need WK supplicant, but if you're doing the same network, then absolutely

27:17.640 --> 27:18.760
that's a good case.

27:18.760 --> 27:23.940
So systemd networkd, okay, that could be another way to get the interface to come up if you're

27:23.940 --> 27:24.940
just connecting to the same Wi-Fi.

27:24.940 --> 27:25.940
If you have simple needs, yeah.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.360
Or conman is another popular.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.640
This is a real bummer though.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.160
This is a major issue that we have gotten a lot of people that have written in about

27:32.160 --> 27:33.160
too.

27:33.160 --> 27:37.880
It's just—oh man, it really is unfortunate that this has sort of been punted around.

27:37.880 --> 27:38.880
Blaster, you had something you wanted to add.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.880
Yeah, go ahead.

27:39.880 --> 27:46.320
Yeah, so when we ran into this issue on the XPS at Linux Fest Northwest, actually, Page

27:46.320 --> 27:51.560
busted out network manager CLI and fixed it that way.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
Yeah, so there's another potential.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.560
That might be another workaround for you at ChronoLinux that isn't too painful to use.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.600
Yeah, so I'm just going to throw this out there.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.360
Another workaround is just use 14.04 because everything still works in it.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.000
Super, yeah.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Okay, sure.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
You can also distance yourself further from Greg's kernel.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Uh-huh.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Exactly.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.200
To me, that is just such not an answer.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.920
It's not even an option for me.

28:22.920 --> 28:28.440
I'm sure it is for some people, but in 2016, to be told to install 14.04, that's rough

28:28.440 --> 28:29.440
for me.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.440
That is rough.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.440
That is rough.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.440
Okay.

28:32.440 --> 28:36.840
Especially on something where wireless is relevant, where I probably want newer packages.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.840
Yeah.

28:37.840 --> 28:38.840
Okay.

28:38.840 --> 28:39.840
Preach it, Wes.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
Preach it, Wes.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
Preach it, Wes.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.840
Especially if you have yourself a brand new laptop.

28:42.840 --> 28:47.560
Quite literally, I don't know, but somebody could write in and go look at the Oryx prospects

28:47.560 --> 28:50.800
and see if there's features that aren't being lit up by that old kernel.

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
Oh, that would be fun.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
Yeah.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
I wonder if like the-

28:53.800 --> 28:54.800
They'll send it right to ChronoLinux.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.200
Those new later generation.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.440
What's that thing got in it, ChronoLinux, a sixth generation Intel?

28:59.440 --> 29:00.600
Which one now?

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
The Oryx.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
The Oryx is sixth generation.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
Yep.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
Yeah.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.440
Although they do do hardware enablement in 1404, so it's possible.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
Yeah.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
It's possible.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
That's true.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
All right.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
So the grand experiment continues.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.440
I am now on the second beer of the show.

29:15.440 --> 29:20.080
You know, I have not had a beer or any other drink since the last show, so I think maybe

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
that's why it's hitting me so hard.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
Oh, wow.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.080
Yeah.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.080
Because it's just...

29:24.080 --> 29:25.080
So anyways-

29:25.080 --> 29:27.620
I cannot claim that, folks.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.120
So let's see if we can make it through the ting spot.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.120
Are you ready?

29:30.120 --> 29:31.120
You want to see if we can do this?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
Let's do it.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.120
Let's just see if we make it.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.440
Now, everybody, everybody right now, stop what you're doing.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
Are you driving?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.440
Doesn't matter.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.520
Pull over to the side of the road or just do it while you're driving.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.520
That's totally fine.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.520
Wait, don't do that.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
Don't do that.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.520
Don't do that.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.520
Don't do that.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.520
Hold on.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.520
Hold on.

29:46.520 --> 29:47.520
Hold on.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.520
I lost my...

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
We need our ambiance.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
Yeah.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
I haven't said to keep playing with.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.520
I don't...

29:52.520 --> 29:53.520
When the loop stops...

29:53.520 --> 29:54.520
Oh, there we go.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.520
Here we go.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.520
Boom.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.520
There we go.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
Okay.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.520
As I was saying, don't actually do this while you're driving, but if you're doing anything

29:59.520 --> 30:02.280
but driving right now, do me a favor and go to linux.ting.com.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.840
Go over there to support the show and learn more about the Ting service.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.960
Not only will you get a discount, which is great, thing's going to give you some money

30:08.960 --> 30:12.880
if you sign up, either off your first device or just towards your account if you've got

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
a compatible device.

30:13.880 --> 30:18.000
Oh, and by the way, you might have a compatible device because you know what, Wes?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.560
They got GSM and CDMA.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.640
Pretty much everything works.

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
It's hard to find it.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.000
You have to go out of your way to buy a phone that won't work on me.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.040
You know what doesn't work on CDMA or GSM?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.040
This bell.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.640
There, I'm done with the loop.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.640
Analog only.

30:31.640 --> 30:35.560
There's no SIM slot for this bell, but just about every other device that does have a

30:35.560 --> 30:37.600
SIM slot will probably work over at Ting.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.600
Go there, check them out.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.760
They have no contracts, no other termination fee, and you only pay for what?

30:41.760 --> 30:46.600
You use flat $6 dollars for just your line, plus anything Uncle Sam's going to take, and

30:46.600 --> 30:47.920
then your usage.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.320
Way simpler, way more straightforward, no crazy gimmicks, plus they have really good

30:52.320 --> 30:53.320
customer service.

30:53.320 --> 30:58.160
When you call Ting, you actually talk to a real person, which not everybody believes,

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
Wes.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.160
Some people think it's not true.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.000
Hello, thanks for calling Ting.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
This is Isabel speaking.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
How can I help you?

31:05.000 --> 31:08.440
Hello, thanks for calling Ting.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.160
This is Isabel speaking.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.360
How can I...

31:12.360 --> 31:18.640
Hey, this is Isabel at Ting.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.240

31:37.280 --> 31:40.640
Please hold while we direct your call to the first available agent.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.560
Your time is important to us.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.160
Thank you for your patience.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
Amazing.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
Linux.ting.com.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.160
Go there.

31:47.160 --> 31:53.800
You can talk to real human beings.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.560
They've got great dashboards.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.640
They're also doing a giveaway of the Galaxy S7, which I have a feeling after tomorrow's

31:59.640 --> 32:04.280
IO keynote is going to be a VR powerhouse, but you can find out more about that at their

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
blog.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.840
Just start there by going to linux.ting.com.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
Linux.ting.com.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.240
I made it to that ad, too.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.960
Well, except for I burped at the end.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.960
Linux.ting.com.

32:12.960 --> 32:18.160
Well, see what happens when you bring in 9% whatever it is.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
A show happens.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
A show about Linux.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.880
This was supposed to be a Windows program.

32:21.880 --> 32:26.600
So there was a conversation that we had towards the end of last week's Linux action show about

32:26.600 --> 32:28.960
entitlement.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.480
And we took on the conversation of Parted Magic.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.560
And Colonel Linux, would you just super quickly recap sort of your position on that for people

32:36.560 --> 32:39.640
that didn't catch last, but assume most of them did?

32:39.640 --> 32:44.960
So essentially, software called Parted Magic, great piece of software, was available for

32:44.960 --> 32:46.520
free for a long, long time.

32:46.520 --> 32:50.460
Company decides that they're bringing significant value into the enterprise, and they could

32:50.460 --> 32:54.000
charge a couple bucks for it, and a bunch of people complained about it.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.840
So now they have dropped the price, and I'm upset.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.720
You're upset that they dropped the price?

33:00.720 --> 33:06.020
I'm upset that a company that works very hard and diligent and has a proven track record

33:06.020 --> 33:14.320
in the marketplace for making quality, valuable software cannot charge a small nominal fee

33:14.320 --> 33:19.340
without the internet erupting into constant whining and complaining about something they

33:19.340 --> 33:20.600
feel entitled to.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.360
And not only are they too cheap to pay for the software, then on top of that, they are

33:25.360 --> 33:28.760
too lazy to go torrent it, which is what they would do for proprietary software.

33:28.760 --> 33:33.000
And if that's not bad enough, then they have to go write blogs and complain and whine about

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
it.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.440
Ooh, there's a lot in there.

33:36.440 --> 33:41.280
I'm glad you're here on the Linux Unplugged couch this week, Noah, because when I hear

33:41.280 --> 33:45.200
entitlement, I'm not sure I'm hearing, I don't think of the same thing.

33:45.200 --> 33:51.080
When I hear entitlement, I think of people who believe they deserve something, even if

33:51.080 --> 33:54.840
that's not necessarily true, if the value exchange isn't necessarily there for that.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
You follow what I'm saying?

33:55.840 --> 33:56.920
Yes, I believe so.

33:56.920 --> 34:01.400
And I feel like the situation with PartMagic is more like you gave me something, then you

34:01.400 --> 34:03.760
changed it, and then I freaked the F out.

34:03.760 --> 34:09.840
It's also complicated by the nature of markets in that, I mean, you have to, if those are

34:09.840 --> 34:12.140
your people, user base, you have to, you know, maybe they lower the price because that's

34:12.140 --> 34:14.560
what the market's demanding of them.

34:14.560 --> 34:18.240
And morality into that can be tricky, whereas in the open source world, I think it's a different

34:18.240 --> 34:19.240
picture.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.640
All right, Kernel Linux, what do you think?

34:20.640 --> 34:25.840
I think that the project, when it started back as a free project, when they were giving

34:25.840 --> 34:32.320
it away for free, was a vastly different tool and had a vastly different place in the IT

34:32.320 --> 34:33.560
sphere as it does today.

34:33.560 --> 34:38.640
I don't, I could not, I fundamentally could not do certain aspects of my job without Part

34:38.640 --> 34:39.640
of Magic.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.800
And the thing that I was using it for the other week was, I had a client, had a laptop,

34:42.800 --> 34:47.200
they were sending it in to the manufacturer to get some work done, and they had sensitive

34:47.200 --> 34:49.160
information that had to be wiped off of it.

34:49.160 --> 34:54.080
Well, new SSDs, if you're not familiar with it, have a, are all encrypted by default.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.600
And you can simply change that encryption key on the hard disk, which essentially, for

34:58.600 --> 35:02.320
layman's terms, erases the SSD instantaneously.

35:02.320 --> 35:08.440
And I wanted to access that secure erase function, and the easiest way to do that is with the

35:08.440 --> 35:10.240
tools built into Part of Magic.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.040
And I, as a person who have used Part of Magic numerous times before, and am fully capable

35:14.040 --> 35:17.720
of torrenting it, and have actually paid for it in the past a couple of times, more than

35:17.720 --> 35:23.640
once, I still paid to download it again, because I want to continue supporting that project.

35:23.640 --> 35:27.320
Are you familiar with DBAN, and does that not meet your needs, necessarily?

35:27.320 --> 35:30.560
DBAN will write zeros to every block, right?

35:30.560 --> 35:34.360
But with a solid state, you actually have more space on the drive than the computer

35:34.360 --> 35:38.640
is aware of, and what will happen is wear leveling will kick in and it will start writing

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
to, yeah.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
That actually won't work.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.480
So what you need to do is, the hard drive is encrypted by default, even if you don't

35:43.480 --> 35:44.600
know what it is, it is.

35:44.600 --> 35:49.440
And so if you change that encryption key on the hard disk, then what happens is, essentially,

35:49.440 --> 35:54.000
the data might still be there, but it becomes useless, effectively, it's erased.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.680
And that's a feature built in at the hardware level of the SSD.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.880
Gerd, Devin, go ahead.

35:59.880 --> 36:04.280
So basically, I think there is actually a benefit of people using these routes versus

36:04.280 --> 36:05.280
the other route.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.280
What will be?

36:06.280 --> 36:11.520
You pick up the source code and basically just lower the cost and make it freely available.

36:11.520 --> 36:16.120
It actually is a good argument against those that usually say, if you put it under a free

36:16.120 --> 36:20.240
license, people will just take it out and make it freely available.

36:20.240 --> 36:24.160
People actually took the effort of saying, okay, we're thinking that you're going to

36:24.160 --> 36:26.680
want somewhat that they consider unreasonable.

36:26.680 --> 36:31.200
I don't know what the figures are, but if people that are consuming the product are

36:31.200 --> 36:36.600
looking at it and then saying, all right, you're increasing the cost, and now it's a

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
problem.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.160
It's apparently, if there was a cost before, it means that the problem is not with the

36:41.160 --> 36:43.560
existence of the cost, it's with the increase.

36:43.560 --> 36:46.640
You want to keep support, right?

36:46.640 --> 36:52.520
But Dar, if I pay for Part of Magic per the terms of open source, I can give you a copy

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
of it.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.280
I can upload it onto my site, let you download it for free.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.680
I can upload it to Torrents.

36:56.680 --> 37:02.400
So the only thing you're paying for is A, to support the company and the product that

37:02.400 --> 37:06.760
they have, but B, to use the convenient little download link that they have on their site.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
Sure.

37:07.760 --> 37:08.760
Okay.

37:08.760 --> 37:15.360
So I want to give Wimby a chance to jump in here, because I want to talk to him specifically

37:15.360 --> 37:19.160
from the standpoint, and I'd actually like to hear from, actually, maybe I'll start with

37:19.160 --> 37:20.160
Richard.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
Richard, are you on mic right now?

37:21.160 --> 37:23.240
Because I'd like to actually get your perspective too, if you're...

37:23.240 --> 37:25.200
I am indeed.

37:25.200 --> 37:32.000
When you hear entitlement, is this matching up with what your mental model of entitlement

37:32.000 --> 37:33.180
in the open source community is?

37:33.180 --> 37:38.040
Because I have one, two, three, four, something like that, links in the show notes.

37:38.040 --> 37:43.200
People who have blogged over the years now about how entitled the open source community

37:43.200 --> 37:49.240
is, and I actually have started to feel some of it myself as somebody who creates something

37:49.240 --> 37:55.940
free and puts it out there, and at times there are, at times, things that feel like they

37:55.940 --> 38:02.400
cross the line of what is expected of me as a content producer, and sometimes that's just

38:02.400 --> 38:05.240
me being grumpy, and sometimes it does feel like it's crossing the line.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.240
So Richard, when you hear entitlement, what does it mean to you and the state of entitlement

38:09.240 --> 38:10.240
in the open source community?

38:10.240 --> 38:11.240
Yeah.

38:11.240 --> 38:16.560
I mean, I think you've pretty much covered what it is.

38:16.560 --> 38:26.360
I would simply define it as, well, users demanding without being prepared to actually help fix

38:26.360 --> 38:27.360
the issue.

38:27.360 --> 38:33.760
I'm not saying they need to do it themselves, but there's plenty of people who want lots

38:33.760 --> 38:38.600
of things for nothing and are not willing to give back anything for it.

38:38.600 --> 38:44.560
Now, my perspective on entitlement is with my open SUSE hat firmly on, and this is open

38:44.560 --> 38:52.840
SUSE and not SUSE because it's a very different dynamic, is I run a project where, for example,

38:52.840 --> 38:57.200
we don't take money and we're anti-interested in it.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.960
I mean, it's more hassle than it's worth, and it doesn't actually solve any problems.

39:01.960 --> 39:07.280
I'd much rather take a contribution from somebody than any cash, and so with the whole parted

39:07.280 --> 39:14.240
magic thing, which is a totally different project, but I struggle with some of these

39:14.240 --> 39:20.520
projects where money is thrown around like it's the magical solver and supporter of everything

39:20.520 --> 39:25.760
because I don't believe that.

39:25.760 --> 39:31.720
I've seen far too many open source projects where a simple contribution, be it code or

39:31.720 --> 39:38.560
advocacy or something, is worth millions more than my 10 bucks.

39:38.560 --> 39:43.960
Wimpy, do you ever struggle with a sense of entitlement in the community, especially since

39:43.960 --> 39:48.200
there is people that are contributing on Patreon and things like that?

39:48.200 --> 39:53.560
So I've got a tangent, gentle point about entitlement, which I'll come back to later.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
Sure.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
Okay, perfect.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.360
But here's a kind of entitlement.

39:58.360 --> 40:02.960
Talking about a bug that affects you and saying it's widespread and it's affecting lots of

40:02.960 --> 40:08.440
people and you have lots of feedback to say this is a big issue, and then 10 minutes later

40:08.440 --> 40:15.000
I go off and find the bug reports for that bug, and I find three bug reports about Wi-Fi

40:15.000 --> 40:18.200
not working after suspend.

40:18.200 --> 40:23.200
And in one bug report, eight people have said this bug affects them.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.800
In the other bug report, one person has reported it, no one else has said it affects them.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.840
And in the third bug report, one person has reported it, nobody else says it affects them.

40:32.840 --> 40:37.800
Yet, this is apparently a widespread issue, and I agree it's a widespread issue because

40:37.800 --> 40:40.540
I've also heard about this anecdotally as well.

40:40.540 --> 40:45.840
This is, so far, my exact observation of this particular network manager issue.

40:45.840 --> 40:46.840
Yeah.

40:46.840 --> 40:51.520
Now, the entitlement that people feel here is that this bug should be fixed, but the

40:51.520 --> 40:58.080
very least you can do is just go and click on the bit that says this bug affects me just

40:58.080 --> 41:01.840
to add to the count because this is what brings it to the attention of the people that are

41:01.840 --> 41:03.840
going to resolve these issues.

41:03.840 --> 41:09.000
If you're prepared to invest a little bit more, then actually provide some details,

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
a reproducible test case, for example, which some people have done in this bug report.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.040
And I was reading another blog earlier where somebody was whining about how they've had

41:20.040 --> 41:25.960
this bug with a particular Ethernet controller not working, and it hasn't worked since 13.0

41:25.960 --> 41:27.280
something or other.

41:27.280 --> 41:32.780
And they cite their own blog going back over five years, but at no point in any of their

41:32.780 --> 41:38.820
blog posts is there a link to a bug that they filed or contributed to.

41:38.820 --> 41:44.800
So this is a kind of entitlement that really rubs me up the wrong way because somehow by

41:44.800 --> 41:49.880
yelling into the void of the Internet, you are somehow alerting people to the fact that

41:49.880 --> 41:55.240
you're unhappy that something needs fixing, but you're doing absolutely nothing to solve

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
the problem.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.240
Right.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.240
Yelling into the void.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.240
That frustrates me.

41:59.240 --> 42:06.240
I'm also sort of not taking advantage of a huge feature of using an open source product

42:06.240 --> 42:09.360
where the bug tracker is actually out in the open.

42:09.360 --> 42:14.540
Just as an example, when we rolled out the new OBS production rig that we covered in

42:14.540 --> 42:20.520
Sunday's Linux Action Show, when we booted up and realized that Ander Gross wasn't building

42:20.520 --> 42:26.700
the ZFS module before it created the init image, yeah, the nice thing we could do there

42:26.700 --> 42:31.880
is we could file a bug about that and so that way down the road when we do updates, hopefully

42:31.880 --> 42:33.240
we don't have an issue.

42:33.240 --> 42:38.400
But you're right, it seems like even the most basic, not even having to create the bug,

42:38.400 --> 42:41.660
just saying it even impacts you is too much to ask.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.280
Maybe it's because you have to create an account or something stupid like that.

42:44.280 --> 42:48.960
I know, but it's like the least you can do and also we've got these open bug trackers

42:48.960 --> 42:51.760
in all of the distribution projects.

42:51.760 --> 42:58.640
Everyone has them and try and do that with Microsoft or Apple or Android even because

42:58.640 --> 43:03.400
frankly if you look at issues on Android, you're just, again, lots of people with the

43:03.400 --> 43:07.200
same issue talking on a Google group somewhere and nothing ever getting done about it.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.960
Yeah, Colonel Linux, you hear this all the time, what are your thoughts?

43:10.960 --> 43:16.240
I try to be a good community member, file bug reports when they come up and certainly

43:16.240 --> 43:22.000
I'm not saying that everyone is like this, but there are times when I have had an issue

43:22.000 --> 43:28.400
and I go to file a bug report and I provide the best information that I know how to provide

43:28.400 --> 43:33.000
and the assumption is that if that is incorrect or further information is needed that people

43:33.000 --> 43:38.600
could just politely ask for it and more than once I've had a very negative experience with

43:38.600 --> 43:44.320
the people that respond to bugs being upset about a bug being opened by something for

43:44.320 --> 43:48.440
various different reasons and I think that part of it is an attitude problem that needs

43:48.440 --> 43:49.440
to change.

43:49.440 --> 43:55.920
When people are taking their time to give you feedback about a project or about software,

43:55.920 --> 43:58.960
be respectful and appreciative that somebody is volunteering their time.

43:58.960 --> 44:03.040
Yes, you volunteered your time to write that code to begin with, but somebody is essentially

44:03.040 --> 44:07.600
doing troubleshooting for you and so if you have to work with them a little bit, come

44:07.600 --> 44:12.100
alongside them and walk with them and say this is how I need the information to be provided

44:12.100 --> 44:15.560
to me or this is more information I need, they need to be open and receptive to doing

44:15.560 --> 44:20.080
that and not just bite people's head off because they didn't get exactly how they wanted to

44:20.080 --> 44:21.080
hear it.

44:21.080 --> 44:24.000
That is true as well, that does happen.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
That is true.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Yeah, but they're really busy too.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
I mean, you can see why, right?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
They just don't have time.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
They just want you to get it right.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.240
But you do have to hit on that good, like as a developer, you don't want something where

44:32.240 --> 44:35.560
it's like, yeah, hey, sometimes I get this thing, fix please, but you...

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
Well, it's...

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
No, go on.

44:37.560 --> 44:41.360
No, I didn't mean to cut you off, but just responding to Chris's point of they're busy,

44:41.360 --> 44:46.200
that's fine, but the reality is if that happens and you continue to become frustrated with

44:46.200 --> 44:50.120
people then the natural reaction is, and this actually just happened, I had a bug with the

44:50.120 --> 44:54.440
Bluetooth keyboard and I went back just because I don't really care what other people think

44:54.440 --> 44:58.620
and I went and posted in the bug report and said, this is how I fixed it, but then I went

44:58.620 --> 45:03.160
back and posted on a forum, which is where the rest of the discussion had been occurring

45:03.160 --> 45:05.400
because nobody wanted to participate in the bug report.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
Yeah, yeah.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.280
That's what you're going to get is you're going to get people that will just go somewhere

45:09.280 --> 45:11.280
else and talk about it then.

45:11.280 --> 45:17.120
That's an interesting point in itself because I think a lot of people have the misconception

45:17.120 --> 45:25.960
that discussing bugs in the forum is tantamount to raising a bug report and that somehow developers

45:25.960 --> 45:30.720
are going to see discussions in forums.

45:30.720 --> 45:35.160
With the exception of the Ubuntu Marte community forums, which I'm active in, I can tell you

45:35.160 --> 45:41.080
for a fact, Ubuntu developers and the Flavor developers are not looking through the forums

45:41.080 --> 45:42.520
for bug reports.

45:42.520 --> 45:47.440
There is only one place that developers are looking for bug reports and that's Launchpad.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.200
So if it's not in Launchpad, it never happened.

45:50.200 --> 45:53.320
And from the developer's perspective, you need that workflow, like you'd go insane trying

45:53.320 --> 45:56.400
to find bugs, like you need one place for your bugs so you can just go down and solve

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
them.

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
Yeah, absolutely.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.520
Wim, but you had a second point you wanted to make though.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.260
Yes.

46:03.260 --> 46:11.800
This is more about Linux-compatible hardware and companies like System76 and Entroware.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.640
And it's a different type of entitlement.

46:14.640 --> 46:24.520
And I feel that people go and buy whatever computer it is they get, usually a cost-based

46:24.520 --> 46:25.520
purchase.

46:25.520 --> 46:32.280
You know, everyone's got a finite amount of spare cash, so they're choosing a laptop that

46:32.280 --> 46:34.880
they can afford at a price point.

46:34.880 --> 46:41.000
But then they feel entitled that Linux should run on this computer that they thought that

46:41.000 --> 46:43.400
was designed to run Windows.

46:43.400 --> 46:49.880
And then some of those people get pissy and shitty when it doesn't work and they have

46:49.880 --> 46:50.880
a sense of entitlement.

46:50.880 --> 46:55.200
They don't appreciate how much work has gone into getting the support that we do have.

46:55.200 --> 46:59.780
I have a lot of thoughts about that too, because also one of the things that fills our inbox

46:59.780 --> 47:05.000
is, in fact, I was just kind of going back through the history of LAS just to see when

47:05.000 --> 47:07.720
our anniversary is, which is June 10th.

47:07.720 --> 47:11.360
And I was looking, you know what our first episode was about?

47:11.360 --> 47:16.440
And this is an issue that has literally plagued our show from episode one now for a decade.

47:16.440 --> 47:19.440
Do you know what episode one, I mean it was about a lot of things.

47:19.440 --> 47:22.160
It was about the new Ubuntu release, it was about a lot of things.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.960
But like the headline topic?

47:23.960 --> 47:24.960
Wireless support?

47:24.960 --> 47:25.960
Nope.

47:25.960 --> 47:26.960
Although that was a big issue back then.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.360
That's a damn good guess, Wes.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.960
That's really close.

47:29.960 --> 47:35.200
No, installing Linux on, oh go ahead, Colonel Linux, you can say it.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.200
The Macbook.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
Ooh.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.200
Yeah, the Macbook.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.200
The Macbook.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.360
Which is a big one, which is, so I want to talk about that just for a second, so let's

47:42.360 --> 47:44.600
actually dedicate a little bit of time to talking about that.

47:44.600 --> 47:52.840
So first, that means we go to Linux Academy, go to LinuxAcademy.com slash, unplugged, LinuxAcademy.com

47:52.840 --> 47:56.240
slash unplugged where you can get their new discount, which is awesome because this service

47:56.240 --> 47:57.240
is super valuable.

47:57.240 --> 48:02.520
It is an entire learning platform which is built on top of Linux to teach you all of

48:02.520 --> 48:05.760
the ins and outs about Linux and all of the really cool technologies that you can make

48:05.760 --> 48:10.540
money off of using Linux.

48:10.540 --> 48:14.560
And I'm talking everything, including even all the way out there to Android development,

48:14.560 --> 48:18.840
PHP, Python, Ruby, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

48:18.840 --> 48:22.600
They now have 2,391 self-paced courses.

48:22.600 --> 48:27.600
I think for me the scenario-based lab is one of the best things they've ever done, but

48:27.600 --> 48:33.920
if I wasn't such a loner and anti-social, I would say probably it's instructor mentoring.

48:33.920 --> 48:37.520
I mean in terms of value in the service, instructor mentoring is incredible, especially for this

48:37.520 --> 48:42.260
kind of course where they have graded server exercises which is dope, automatically grades

48:42.260 --> 48:43.260
your actions.

48:43.260 --> 48:44.260
Why not?

48:44.260 --> 48:46.600
Why do you have to wait around?

48:46.600 --> 48:51.880
Check them out, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, and I don't normally mention it, but Mr. Radio,

48:51.880 --> 48:55.760
there in the mumbles, pointed it out, and he's absolutely right.

48:55.760 --> 49:00.840
If you go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, just go there, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged,

49:00.840 --> 49:06.880
look around, and then if you're looking for a gig, they are hiring two telecommute positions.

49:06.880 --> 49:07.880
Hmm.

49:07.880 --> 49:08.880
Oh, really?

49:08.880 --> 49:13.440
Yeah, you know, this is the great thing is LinuxAcademy isn't just a great learning resource,

49:13.440 --> 49:14.760
they're managed really well.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.400
They're part of the community that they service.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.840
They have been really, really smart about the way they've structured their company.

49:21.840 --> 49:26.080
And, they've grown like crazy to make sure their content stays relevant, and even their

49:26.080 --> 49:27.080
old stuff.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.760
Plus, I bet if you worked there, they got some good training there.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.400
I would just guess.

49:32.400 --> 49:39.160
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, that's a double ding plug, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

49:39.160 --> 49:43.240
Okay, Mr. Colonel Linux, I'm going to open the floor to you.

49:43.240 --> 49:48.600
As far as folks that are going out there and grabbing hardware, NOAA kind of has mastered

49:48.600 --> 49:53.840
the art of going into Best Buy and purchasing the Linux machine, but it doesn't always work

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
out.

49:54.840 --> 49:55.840
And, you've got to have thoughts on this topic.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.000
So, I open the floor to you.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Okay.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.120
So, I, are you looking for just general advice, or are you looking for past experience?

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
Both.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.120
Okay.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.120
So, you're right.

50:07.120 --> 50:14.160
There is no, I can say with almost full authority that there isn't a computer manufacturer out

50:14.160 --> 50:18.360
there that I have not owned and installed Linux on at some point.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.080
There are some that tend to be better than others.

50:21.080 --> 50:27.320
These days, you'd be surprised at how many companies are using the same ODM, and so really,

50:27.320 --> 50:30.040
you're buying a different brand, but it's the same thing on the inside.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.240
Maybe the chassis is a little bit different.

50:32.240 --> 50:37.680
Most computers these days are coming with Intel insides, and, you know, Skylake issues

50:37.680 --> 50:41.560
aside, if it says Intel on it, it probably will work right out of the box with Linux.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.000
Wireless, sound, video, all that good stuff.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.520
Yeah, you know, I got to disagree.

50:46.520 --> 50:51.320
I've bought two ThinkPads in a row over the last few years that came with wireless cards

50:51.320 --> 50:55.200
and a Dell that had to have their wireless cards replaced to an Intel.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.280
I've never had to replace the wireless card in a ThinkPad.

50:57.280 --> 51:01.800
In fact, it would be difficult to do so because the Think, they actually whitelist their wireless

51:01.800 --> 51:02.800
cards.

51:02.800 --> 51:03.800
Wait, wait, wait.

51:03.800 --> 51:04.800
Don't you, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.800
Don't you remember?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.920
Didn't we have some issues with that idea, with that ThinkPad?

51:07.920 --> 51:09.560
Well, that's not a ThinkPad.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.560
That's an IdeaPad.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.560
They are.

51:11.560 --> 51:12.560
Okay.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.560
Totally different, Chris.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.560
No, they are.

51:14.560 --> 51:15.560
They are.

51:15.560 --> 51:16.560
They are different.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.560
All right.

51:17.560 --> 51:18.560
Well, so, okay.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.560
So the IdeaPad, yes.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.840
And the IdeaPad is, it came with Broadcoms.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.880
So that's going to be the one exception, right?

51:23.880 --> 51:29.040
The one thing that, not the IdeaPad, but Broadcom in general is going to be the one exception

51:29.040 --> 51:31.520
you're going to find when you go into a store.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.440
But that's easy enough to do, right?

51:33.440 --> 51:36.360
From Windows, you can right click, look on the device manager and just kind of take a

51:36.360 --> 51:39.600
gander at what's inside that machine before you buy.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.560
And if it has a Broadcom chip, just stay away from it.

51:42.560 --> 51:46.840
The second thing I look at is, if it has a Broadcom chip, maybe it's a super good price.

51:46.840 --> 51:51.740
And I'll tell you, actually, they have actually gotten, in 1604, Broadcom is actually much

51:51.740 --> 51:53.080
easier to deal with.

51:53.080 --> 51:56.960
In the installer, it recognizes you have a Broadcom chip and will just say, plug me into

51:56.960 --> 52:00.460
the internet and tell me that you want me to use this driver, and it does everything

52:00.460 --> 52:01.900
for you.

52:01.900 --> 52:05.480
And I just dealt with that with one of those little HPs.

52:05.480 --> 52:11.740
But if it has a Broadcom chip and I want it to be a super smooth experience, I'll flip

52:11.740 --> 52:14.120
the computer over and see if there are screws on the bottom.

52:14.120 --> 52:18.880
If there are screws on the bottom, the high probability is you can take that bottom panel

52:18.880 --> 52:20.780
off and just swap that Wi-Fi card.

52:20.780 --> 52:23.080
And as long as you're gentle, you won't break any of the pins.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.080
Then you won't have a problem.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.080
Yeah, Wi-Fi is pretty easy.

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
Some people like to mess with computers.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.480
Damn it, Leo.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.480
Really.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.480
You're right.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.480
Those are good tips.

52:31.480 --> 52:36.760
So Wimpy, I want to hear your thoughts in regards to the ThinkPads.

52:36.760 --> 52:43.040
With regards to ThinkPads, I've had to change Wi-Fi cards in ThinkPads, and in many cases,

52:43.040 --> 52:49.960
I've had to actually flash a modified BIOS in order for it to accept the Wi-Fi card I

52:49.960 --> 52:58.840
want to put in it rather than the select few cards that Lenovo have allowed to be used.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.360
And the same goes for hard disks as well.

53:00.360 --> 53:03.320
I've even had to do that for hard disks.

53:03.320 --> 53:09.160
Now that said, I think I can see one, two, three, four, five, six ThinkPads from where

53:09.160 --> 53:12.800
I'm sitting at the moment, and that's not all of them in the house.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.400
But I am a changed man, and I'm going to tell you about this.

53:17.400 --> 53:23.600
When people buy computers that were designed to run Windows or Mac OS 10, but predominantly

53:23.600 --> 53:30.000
Windows, and then try to install Linux on it and have issues, that's unfortunate.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.520
And yes, people have to get into this business of do they potentially replace the Wi-Fi chip

53:34.520 --> 53:38.960
and all the rest of it, because these days, it's generally the Wi-Fi chip.

53:38.960 --> 53:45.680
A lot of the reasons why people say they have bought a particular laptop is because it's

53:45.680 --> 53:52.400
significantly cheaper than a laptop designed to run Linux from the likes of Entroware,

53:52.400 --> 53:58.800
System76, Zaris, and ThinkPenguin, and the many others that are out there.

53:58.800 --> 54:07.260
And I think because open source Linux distributions are free of cost, there is an assumption that

54:07.260 --> 54:13.520
it should be a cheaper laptop because it comes pre-installed with a Linux distribution.

54:13.520 --> 54:20.360
And the reason why it is not is because the likes of System76 and Entroware and the others

54:20.360 --> 54:26.760
don't have the volume of sales for economies of scale to come into effect.

54:26.760 --> 54:33.680
So they cannot compete on price with the likes of Dell and Lenovo and HP and so on.

54:33.680 --> 54:41.560
So if you want to buy a computer and you intend to run Linux on it, save up a little bit longer.

54:41.560 --> 54:46.240
Buy your computer from one of those companies that are supporting Linux as a first class

54:46.240 --> 54:51.240
citizen because the more people that vote with their money, what will happen is they

54:51.240 --> 54:56.360
will be able to improve their margins and the costs of those computers from those Linux

54:56.360 --> 55:00.600
supporting companies will come down as their sales volumes increase.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
There's that.

55:01.600 --> 55:07.800
And you legitimately will probably have a less challenging Linux experience.

55:07.800 --> 55:16.360
You will not be having a conversation on an online user group saying, what Wi-Fi chipset

55:16.360 --> 55:21.080
card do I need to get to go in a Lenovo Yoga 3 or whatever it was.

55:21.080 --> 55:28.000
Now Kern Linux, though, I know you and I agree with Wimpy like just totally.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I don't know.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.960
I may have been System76's first or second public customer.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.960
I am a diehard.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.280
You've been repping that brand for years.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.280
Yeah.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.400
So it's over a decade.

55:39.400 --> 55:44.120
But even yet, you and I still on occasion either build the PCs or we go out and grab

55:44.120 --> 55:45.120
a ThinkPad.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.820
What are your thoughts on that?

55:47.820 --> 55:49.480
So it's never a first choice, right?

55:49.480 --> 55:50.480
Like you're right.

55:50.480 --> 55:54.640
I 100% agree with everything Wimpy just said about supporting manufacturers that produce

55:54.640 --> 55:55.640
computers.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.720
And if there was a System76 store in every single city...

55:57.720 --> 56:00.720
You just went away?

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
You're good?

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
You're good?

56:02.720 --> 56:04.440
Oh, because you like to go into the store.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.240
Well, I think he found a System76 store.

56:06.240 --> 56:07.920
He's distracted now.

56:07.920 --> 56:08.920
We can forgive him.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.960
You should have seen the sales they had.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.920
And what Wimpy is talking about, if and when people support them enough that they get their

56:14.920 --> 56:20.400
margins down or margins up, rather, and we get to the point where they can offer a more

56:20.400 --> 56:24.800
cost-competitive product, that'll make this argument even less relevant.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.960
But at the moment, there are times when, for example, you have three days to switch somebody

56:28.960 --> 56:33.480
to Linux and that person is there and we need to have them a laptop and we have to get it

56:33.480 --> 56:36.680
here, installed, and rolled out in 48 hours.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.120
You don't have a choice but to go into the store.

56:38.120 --> 56:42.800
And I think there is an advantage, an unspoken advantage rather, of buying from a company

56:42.800 --> 56:45.520
that isn't totally invested in the operating system.

56:45.520 --> 56:49.840
When you buy a MacBook, Apple needs you to use Mac OS because that's where the longevity

56:49.840 --> 56:54.560
of their product is, right, is really in the whole experience, not just the hardware.

56:54.560 --> 56:58.840
Whereas HP, really at the end of the day, HP, Dell, Lenovo, they don't really care about

56:58.840 --> 56:59.840
Windows.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.360
They care about Windows to the point that it makes them a profit on selling their hardware

57:02.360 --> 57:04.100
and past that, they don't really give a rip.

57:04.100 --> 57:08.640
If tomorrow everyone wanted to install Linux, you better believe Dell and HP and Lenovo

57:08.640 --> 57:12.600
and all those other companies would be making the most Linux-friendly computers possible

57:12.600 --> 57:14.000
because they want their hardware to sell.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.160
And I think there is an advantage, however small.

57:16.160 --> 57:18.120
I'd say that's like 2% of the overall battle.

57:18.120 --> 57:22.820
The rest of the 90%, 98%, I completely agree with Wimpy on just trying to avoid them altogether

57:22.820 --> 57:25.440
if you can.

57:25.440 --> 57:32.480
So there is also an undeniable fact that there is a huge, huge price point at $300 that is

57:32.480 --> 57:36.680
extremely attractive to people that are looking at Chromebooks and stuff like that.

57:36.680 --> 57:38.680
Acer's and like, yeah, right.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.640
So Wimpy, you mentioned there's other options out there.

57:41.640 --> 57:45.320
What are your thoughts as far as that price point goes and yeah, maybe you could call

57:45.320 --> 57:50.760
them having sort of certain sets of expectations or entitlements, but at the same time, wouldn't

57:50.760 --> 57:56.640
we love to welcome these Chromebook buyers or these $300 HP Stream buyers with open arms

57:56.640 --> 57:57.640
in the Linux community?

57:57.640 --> 57:58.640
Your thoughts?

57:58.640 --> 57:59.640
Yeah.

57:59.640 --> 58:06.880
Well, so the other options, I've talked about the Linux-specific manufacturers, but if somebody

58:06.880 --> 58:14.200
wants a laptop from a mainstream vendor in two days to convert somebody to Linux, Hewlett-Packard

58:14.200 --> 58:19.460
have a range of, and I'm talking about in Europe and North America now, rather than

58:19.460 --> 58:25.680
the floods and floods of Ubuntu laptops that are available in the Far East because they

58:25.680 --> 58:28.520
are awash with Ubuntu laptops out there.

58:28.520 --> 58:33.340
It's about 40% of PC sales are pre-installs with Ubuntu.

58:33.340 --> 58:39.160
So we're not seeing all of that in Europe and the US, but Hewlett-Packard have a range

58:39.160 --> 58:44.480
of low-cost laptops, all pre-installed running Ubuntu.

58:44.480 --> 58:51.480
They in the UK are under £300, I think some of them are just a touch under £200.

58:51.480 --> 58:56.600
So they're entry-level Chromebook pricing running Ubuntu.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.480
And then Dell, of course, have a range of machines and they don't just have the high-end

59:00.480 --> 59:06.160
developer stuff, you know, the Sputnik and the XPS 13, they also have a line of precision

59:06.160 --> 59:10.280
laptops now and their entry-level costs are reasonable.

59:10.280 --> 59:16.960
And again, if you buy those computers from those manufacturers pre-installed with Ubuntu

59:16.960 --> 59:22.720
or whatever distribution they may have, you are adding a count on the chalkboard to say

59:22.720 --> 59:28.720
there is a demand for people to buy computers pre-installed with Linux rather than buy one

59:28.720 --> 59:32.480
of their Windows computers and then try and install Linux on it after the fact.

59:32.480 --> 59:34.800
I completely, completely agree.

59:34.800 --> 59:38.440
But I think that's also maybe worth part of the cost increase for those people who

59:38.440 --> 59:39.920
can make it work.

59:39.920 --> 59:43.640
I wanted to just – now that we've talked about the hardware entitlement aspect, which

59:43.640 --> 59:47.240
I think was a fascinating point, Wimpy, I wanted to now go back if we could just for

59:47.240 --> 59:52.720
a little bit longer to the issue that you brought up rather brilliantly is – and it

59:52.720 --> 59:57.780
just so perfectly underscores what is kind of an entitlement issue here.

59:57.780 --> 01:00:02.640
This 1604 network manager problem is – it's big enough that we hear about it all the time

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.080
here on the show.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.440
And so that to me is my barometer, been around for a few of these releases, and I can tell

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.160
you what kind of things I get feedback on and what kind of things I don't per release.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.680
And this is one that's showing up on the radar.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.480
I can tell you from my metrics, it's an issue.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.280
So with that said, like Wimpy brilliantly just said, it's – nobody's doing nothing.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.280
It's sitting there.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.280
And in fact, on the known bug tracker, it's gone off in the completely wrong direction.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:33.560
And it – what could we do better, Wimpy, as far as an infrastructure to make this work?

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.000
Rekai in the chat room is saying we need some sort of distributed API that interconnects

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.280
all the bug tracking systems and allows them to share.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.720
Maybe something that uses the blockchain, and there could be coin rewards for bugs.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.200
What do you think, Wimpy?

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200
What are our options?

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200
Yeah.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:56.720
Rekai put in the chat earlier about creating a better bug tracking, bug logging system.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.200
And he's right, because even the good ones that exist in some of the open source projects

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.400
aren't really that great by modern standards in terms of web applications.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.240
And with the work that I do in Debian, filing and closing bugs in Debian is – it's like

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240
pulling teeth.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240
It's all done with email.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:21.240
It's just – I mean, I absolutely hate having to involve myself with the Debian bug tracking

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240
system.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.240
It's truly awful.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.000
I'm sure that everyone that knows how to use it with email thinks that great, but I so

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
rarely use email these days for anything.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.600
It's not an encouraging way to get volunteers to spend their free time.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600
No.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.560
And it gets more complex when you have a bug raised at, say, a distribution level, say,

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.680
in Ubuntu, and then, as you've pointed out, that bug then actually is referenced in an

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:49.640
upstream bug, and the conversations get lost between the two chains.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.840
I don't know what the solution is, but I agree there's probably a better way out there

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.520
for somebody cleverer than I am to invent, create, and improve open source bug tracking

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520
for everybody.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.280
It does seem like we should have a better system.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280
Yeah, go ahead.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:10.840
I've actually brought this before, this issue before, and I think the solution will be better

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.120
lied in something like the Linux Foundation to set the common bug tracker type thing,

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.200
so that you have one account.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200
It's also –

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200
Yeah.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200
Yeah, you're right about that.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.760
The kernel is tracking, because the usual problem is you are dealing with multiple entities,

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.440
and the distributions deal differently, but what they have in common is the foundation.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:41.960
So I have bug tracker accounts on probably 15 or 20 different open source projects, and

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.040
I'm going to be honest, and I probably almost will regret saying this on air, but –

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.880
Listen close, Phil.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.600
It just gets to the point now when I go to a bug tracker where I don't have an account,

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600
I bail.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.320
I just – like here's what happens is like sometimes something crashes, and then like

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.560
something comes up and says, would you like to submit a bug?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.760
I say yes, and then I –

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.320
You're like a little high of like, yes, I'm going to do it.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320
I'm just going to submit the bug.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
I'll get an open web.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
Yeah, I wasn't planning on this, but –

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320
It's like five minutes.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320
It's fine.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320
It'll move on.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320
And then I go, and then it's like, oh, I don't –

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320
Bum, bum, bum.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320
Yeah.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.960
In fact, as a matter of fact, what happens – you know what I hear in my head at that

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.440
very moment, I feel like I hear the fail horn on prices right in the back of my – yeah.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.960
And then I just move on.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.920
And I feel so bad for doing that, but I'm just –

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920
But I think everyone's been there at times.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920
I'm tapped out.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.760
Like when I go into LastPass, it's ridiculous how many accounts I have for bug trackers.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.080
This is – I hate this crap.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.080
So –

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.080
I mean that –

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.080
I know.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080
I should have said that.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080
Debian does have one tool, report bug.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.080
Yeah.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.640
To say maybe this should adopt something like it.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640
I don't know.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.640
Yeah.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.760
And you know, like Rekai points out, this was why I created a GitHub account like a

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.200
couple of years ago, because like just more and more now is on there.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.440
And that's nice, but I don't really want to encourage open source projects to have

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.540
their bug tracker tied to GitHub.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.540
So I just –

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.400
I mean it'd be better on GitLab or something.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400
Yeah.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400
Yeah.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400
That's cool.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.400
More open.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.400
Yeah.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.400
That's fine.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400
Distributed.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.400
Yeah.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400
Yeah.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400
Even then.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400
Mm-hmm.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400
GitHub versus GitLab is a conversation for another day.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400
Yeah.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400
Yeah.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400
So Mr. Brown had a chance to make it here.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.080
I didn't have anything in the feedback or follow-up because we didn't have much discussion.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:28.360
I thought – I sort of threw out the bait out there for a ZFS versus ButterFS conversation

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360
on this –

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360
You really did.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360
More baiting than you usually do.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360
Thank you.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360
You noticed.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.360
You know what?

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.360
I like you.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360
And I'll tell you what.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.360
Not many bites.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360
Like at least so far.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.860
Now I've only checked – that was the feedback as of about 9 a.m.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:46.080
So Mr. Brown, I would love to hear your feedback if you had a chance to see what we talked

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.080
about in the news segment.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.080
Oh, yeah.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080
I saw.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080
I'm – yeah.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.200
I didn't put anything on your subreddit because, you know, not safe for children.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Oh, I love it.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200
I love it.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Okay.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200
Okay.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.200
Let me have it.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200
Let's see what you think.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.420
Well, I've got issues at multiple levels.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.640
So let's start with the simple one.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.640
Just get it out the way.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640
Licensing.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.400
The ZFS licensing gray area is solved.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:17.000
No business that doesn't want to take a gamble, you know, can be using it.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
But can I stop you?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So let me stop you there.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I want to break this down.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.120
So – but at the same time, at the same time, there is a competitive – there must be a

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.400
competitive pressure since now Debian, Debian of all distributions –

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400
No.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400
Because Debian didn't.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400
Okay.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.520
Debian didn't put it in their distribution any more than OpenSUSE has had it in our distribution

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520
for years.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Well, that's –

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
It's in a contrib repo.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
It's not in the distribution.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.760
But they are the ones doing the groundwork around the quote-unquote workaround.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.760
That's what I'm referring to.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.700
Not even necessarily them shipping the code.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.720
Then that moves me on to the next funky thing.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.920
So okay, let's forget about the philosophical stuff and the licensing because, you know,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.040
that's another debate anyway.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.400
Let's stick to nice pragmatic technical grounds.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.120
The Debian workaround is a DKMS, you know, compile on your machine solution.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.320
Do you really want to be doing that for a file system?

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320
I mean, you had it –

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320
No.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320
I hate it.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.320
It's already been me once.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320
But I will say, anyone in production, you would precompile that module.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320
Yeah.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.500
You would have your own repo where that module is compiled and shipped.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.720
You would only update the kernel in conjunction with that module.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720
Yeah.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.720
So I don't know if that's an enterprise.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.040
Like, desktop, yes, but in enterprise, I don't know if that's a problem.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040
But then that brings me to another thing.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.200
Okay, who do you phone – who's going to deal with those bugs when you have them?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.160
I mean, just look at the bug statistics on ZFS on Linux.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.880
If you're nice and generous and only look at the same period as the current open upstream

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:44.080
bugs in BTRFS, there is still more than twice as many bugs upstream in ZFS for Linux open

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.000
right now than there is on BTRFS.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Okay.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.100
So one thing I want to just touch on really quick before we go too much further.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:57.840
When you mentioned the gray area around the licensing, I totally agree with you.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.600
It is a gray area.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:11.680
And I was shocked that Canonical had the Hutzpah to ship it.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.440
I tell you what, Richard, I never thought – I thought it would be another year from

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440
now.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440
If that.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440
And I feel like it's a strategy tax a bit, perhaps, on them down the road.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.480
But nonetheless, they did it.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:31.220
So once they started doing this, it started to have certain flavors of the codec discussions.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.460
The same thing around licensing of codecs or licensing of the DVD playback.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.960
This feels like sort of a worry of yesteryear that never really panned out.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.480
There never really was any major repercussions for shipping codecs.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.240
There never really was a problem for using DVD CSS.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:55.000
In the enthusiast space, which of course is a valid area, yes, there wasn't.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.920
And even Debian reviewed the patent stuff because basically boiling down to we're not

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.760
making any money, so it's no problem for us.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.760
That's fine.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.480
But then your whole argument with ZFS during LAS was the market demands.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.960
Well, the market is money.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.200
The market is businesses.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.720
The market is enterprises.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.320
Those guys can't afford to do that.

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.280
I mean, take, for example, even OpenSUSE.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.960
We're not exactly the most enterprise-friendly distribution.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.640
We have organizations using us embedded stuff and on their devices because we have no gray

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.640
area.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.080
Because if you're redistributing that stuff, if you're taking and putting OEM on your hardware,

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.520
which of course is a problem Mint had, the OEM is suddenly then responsible for that

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520
gray area.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.240
So no one is going to touch that stuff with a barge pole.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240
I think you're right.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.360
This is the area where you and I probably disagree the strongest.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.500
So here's how I see what you're saying is you're essentially making the Internet of

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.600
Things or small embedded devices or shippable devices argument, which is a pretty solid

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600
one.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.920
The issue is not only is there a wash of non-Linux OSs already in that space, but there's already

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.200
a bunch of great Linuxes in that space that already have a great bunch of momentum behind

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.200
them.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.120
At the same time, I would imagine it must be important to the project to gain ground

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.300
on the desktop, in the DevOps space, in the engineer space, and on the cloud primarily.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:25.120
And when we talk about the market demands and we talk about the larger market at whole,

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:32.240
my main point that I was trying to make really there is ButterFS is screwed as far as a brand.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.040
Now I'm not saying RLinux is the measure of anything.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.800
But if you just look at the thread that was posted four hours ago on RLinux about ButterFS

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.680
versus ZFS on the desktop, there are 19 comments and literally, Richard, every single one of

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.480
them is shitting on ButterFS.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.800
And I'm not saying they're right.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.880
I'm saying the brand ship on ButterFS has sailed and nobody is going to hitch their

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
way into that.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.480
I'm interrupting you for a change because this is fun.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.400
File barriers, 2008.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.360
Every single distribution had file barriers disabled because of performance issues, apart

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.320
from SUSE because we care about this stuff.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:21.900
That totally negated the protections of journaling on EXT3, EXT4, and XFS.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:26.760
Every single one of those file systems was royally screwed with people losing data.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.160
And everybody was screaming about it.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160
And it was a big issue.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.800
And LWN did articles about it of how the world is falling apart.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.480
And then LVM made it worse because even when they fixed it on the file systems, LVM didn't

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480
enable that.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.880
So LVM was screwing up everyone's file systems.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.080
And yet everybody loves EXT3 and 4 now.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.480
And everybody likes LVM now.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:52.120
Because those were fundamentally flawed issues that every distribution, apart from one, was

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120
shipping.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.400
Now, BTRFS, yes, has some marketing issues.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.600
They are fundamentally flawed.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.760
BTRFS, when done properly, like you see in OpenSUSE, is a damn good file system.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.120
And if you want a root copy-on-write file system, it's your only choice on Linux.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.080
And if you want to boot to Snapshot, it's your only choice on Linux.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080
You've got to try it.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.080
You've got to learn it.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.080
You've got to understand it.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.400
If people aren't ready yet, fine.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:27.920
But running to ZFS is like some savior when the license is a complete mess, ZFS on Linux

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.800
is a complete joke right now when you look at the bugs and who's actually fixing them.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.800
You can't put your face in that.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.760
ZFS is a great file system, but not on Linux.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.760
Not yet.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.520
So let me, I want to address a couple of points.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.120
The first one is, I think in terms of enterprise storage deployments, I don't think you see

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.000
a lot of extended for as the main core file system on like NASes and large storage.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.800
You'll see a lot of different file systems, and some of them are extended for.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.360
But a lot of times, if they are, there's a very, very large and robust virtual management

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.560
suite that sits on top of that.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.760
Or they're on like large proprietary appliances providing like a SAN.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.480
I think in the enterprise, I think that's sort of a gray area where ButterFS has basically

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.800
no foothold.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.420
But I agree with your core fundamental point in that ButterFS is worth our time and worth

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.320
our energy, and we shouldn't be running to ZFS.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.200
Just using ButterFS on your route just to get snapshots alone, like that will work fine,

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.080
and you get a lot for just doing that.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.880
But I think if we zoom out a bit and we go to the meta level of what our conversations

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:39.860
are, what I'm saying is what you are presenting to me is a technical argument on the valid

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:46.040
reasons why long term ButterFS is a better investment of our collective resources from

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.200
a legal standpoint, from a technology standpoint, from an owning standpoint, from an integration

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200
standpoint.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.920
So even from a feature set standpoint, ButterFS is a better file system for us to invest in.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:04.020
But at the same time, what I feel like you're not hearing is my argument that people are

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:08.720
choosing Ubuntu or they're going to choose Debian over OpenSUSE because it simply doesn't

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.040
have ZFS.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.360
And that's where the decision tree is at.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.600
They're not going beyond that decision point.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.400
It doesn't have ZFS support.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:26.540
Well, yeah, people are weird, but the ZFS on Debian thing is a joke because ZFS is in

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.340
OpenSUSE as much as ZFS is in Debian.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.840
So fine, there we go.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840
If you want to have-

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.200
I agree from like a software availability standpoint, but we're talking about they're

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.800
the ones that did the legal groundwork to make it possible.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.360
They didn't do any more legal groundwork than we have, which is basically you don't ship

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.580
it as a core part of your distribution, which is simple, fine.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.040
The user can then choose what the hell they do with their licenses, which is a concept

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.120
that every distribution follows.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.880
And Debian have only just done it now.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.320
And yeah, okay, OpenSUSE should have done an announcement, what, two, three years ago

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.320
when we did it.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.080
Well, I'm not saying that OpenSUSE doesn't have a repo where I can get ZFS and then install

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.620
the user-land utilities.

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.480
That's not the defining thing here.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480
What seems to be the defining-

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480
Debian put it in contrib.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480
It's not in main.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.520
It's not in their distribution.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.520
It's not a core part of their distro.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
Now, the-

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520
Can't go in main.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520
It can't go in main.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520
Right.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.440
And just like ZFS can't go in the main OpenSUSE repos.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.560
But that's the thing.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.240
If you're saying ZFS is in Debian, then ZFS has been in OpenSUSE for just as long.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:35.680
So you don't give any credence to- what they claim to be is three years of legal work to

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.920
analyze the licenses and have a legal decision that they feel makes it safe.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.320
You're not giving any credibility to that work there?

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320
We did the same work.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.580
We came to the same conclusion.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.920
We kind of made similar steps.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.120
We don't like the KMS as much, so, you know, we build it differently, but, you know-

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.720
Does it seem like- does it seem like- does it seem like picking on Debian is almost irrelevant

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.840
when the real cloud dominator is Ubuntu?

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.800
And I guess what I'm trying to get to is, honestly, it seems like an anti-growth strategy

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.840
not to have ZFS support.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.400
Okay.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.800
Data is sacred.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.680
You really think it would be a good thing if OpenSUSE-

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.160
I'm not making a technical argument.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160
No, no, no.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.960
Yeah, but, you know, they- yeah, but this is the thing, you know, we have a responsibility

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.400
as distribution maintainers to make informed decisions for the benefit of our users.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.480
ZFS right now on Linux has way too many gray areas.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480
Ignore the licensing ones.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:37.800
I'm just nervous about the fact that it's basically two guys, LLL and LLNL, maintaining

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.960
it with a massive bug backlog, some of which include data loss stuff.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.120
It's not in the kernel.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.040
It's not keeping up with kernel development that well.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.520
I wouldn't want to offer that- if the licensing issues totally went away tomorrow, if Oracle

01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:00.600
relicensed it, I would still be nervous now saying, okay, this is a fully supported distribution

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.720
which you can trust- fully supported file system on my distribution that you can trust

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.120
because I can't trust it yet.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.160
If this was ZFS on FreeBSD or Solaris, totally different story, but this is ZFS on Linux

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.680
and it's been less tried and tested and it is less trustworthy at this point.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.520
And there's way too many scary bugs I see in that bug tracker and I don't see it being

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.920
fixed fast enough because it's only a couple of guys because you have the licensing issues,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920
but then we're back in this cycle.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.920
So just to be clear on my position there, the only place where I have production data

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.120
that I deem valuable on ZFS is on a FreeNAS server.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.280
And I think you would be very risky to run ZFS in a large-scale production unless you're

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.480
doing like Wes mentioned, pre-building your module and you have safe update process.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480
Now here-

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480
So will this all change?

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.080
I mean, should we really come back to this in a year or two years or the next LTS module

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.080
now that we have that?

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.080
Perhaps.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.080
I don't think so.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.480
I think the licensing is always going to make it this weird DKMS workaround, but I guess-

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:05.200
On 16.04 where you have it pre-compiled, I guess we'll have to change this discussion.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.200
And will that make ZL-

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200
What do you say, Richard?

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200
What do you think?

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200
Better tested?

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200
I'm not saying it has now.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200
I'm just curious.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.860
I mean, if this was a different company doing this move, I'd have a totally different opinion,

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.440
but file systems are traditionally kernel-y kind of stuff.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.120
I mean, they live in the kernel, they play with the kernel, they do all of that.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.480
This is canonical we're talking about.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.680
They're not exactly the biggest contributors to the kernel by any measure.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.480
So yes, they've taken some package.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.480
They've packaged it up.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.760
They've put it in their distribution.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.960
Great for them.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.880
But if something goes wrong, who are you going to call?

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.160
Who's going to fix those bugs?

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.160
Where's the skills?

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160
Where's the knowledge?

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160
Where's the trust?

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.920
So I will claim that Canonical is as a company that is selling a product as well and trying

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.360
to put this product out there and take responsibility if it comes down to it.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.880
They've done it in the past.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.560
They've also decided not to do it in certain circumstances, but as it's their choice and

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.400
they understand that they have to support their decisions, will probably take the responsibility.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.560
This is the first thing.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.440
So if we separate out the legal issues and the technical issues, which I think the legal

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.360
issues we just had like West is saying, we have to stay tuned and see where it goes.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.960
But with the technical issues, Richard, it reminds me fundamentally of people who are

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:24.280
very intimate with container technology say a lot of these same things about Docker.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.760
But Docker is the big brand that everybody wants.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.000
I mean, you saw Red Hat.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.640
They slammed it into 7.0.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.560
So that way they could claim Red Hat Enterprise 7.0 had Docker support, even though it was

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.840
nowhere near enterprise grade ready.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840
We have it in sleep.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.840
Yes.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.100
I mean, yes, there's decisions like that you can make.

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:47.040
But there has to be a line where you say, OK, we're not going to cross this.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.360
We can't do this in a stable and sane way.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:56.880
And I'd say right now, you know, if it was just down to me just looking at ZFS on a purely

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.560
technical level, ZFS Linux has not proven itself yet.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.760
And this is this is file system data we're talking about.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:03.760
Yeah, I agree.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760
I agree.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.320
Something in some container, which is going to explode anyway because it's a container.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.840
I mean, it's meant to be.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.320
It's meant to die at some point.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320
Right.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.720
It is a totally different scenario than this is my data, which I want to keep forever.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:20.280
But seriously, if we want to concern about legal issues, we have to be paying more attention

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.840
at Google versus Oracle as it goes to APIs.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840
And guess what?

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Linux copied Linux API.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Well, yeah, we'll see.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.360
We've been talking about that on the Coda radio program, if you guys do want some some

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.120
discussion on that.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:42.120
So I guess, Richard, I feel like you are right from a plain and safe standpoint in regards

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.960
to legal risk and you're right from a technical standpoint.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:52.040
And I don't discourage OpenSUSE from taking this stance because if anything, it just adds

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.520
more pressure to make ButterFS continue to get better and better and better.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.320
So from like a pure Linux user standpoint, I sit here and I go, sweet, I'm really glad

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.860
that there is a well-established distribution that is taking this position that is going

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.560
to forward our locally grown file system.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.120
Like that that person inside is value to our value ecosystem.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.660
I'm like, yeah, tip of the hat to you.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:19.840
But then like the market analyst side of me that looks at the market positions that OpenSUSE

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.200
is hopefully going to grow into and I think, oh, geez, this could be a barrier.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.680
So I'm really torn on the issue.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680
I don't think you are.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.120
No, I'm not.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.280
I'm seeing too many.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.780
When it comes to evolving storage trends, the tech that everybody's got to be talking

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.440
about isn't ZFS, it's Ceph.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.080
And that's a completely different kettle of fish with a completely different use case.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.580
But that's where the low, mid-range storage market's moving.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.880
That's where the money's going.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.240
That's where, trust me, SUSE is seeing that.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:01.440
Our storage product was funded before we even started building it.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.920
That's where the disruption is really going to be, not in ZFS.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.560
Especially even if you look at the cool things in ZFS, like RAIDZ, which isn't RAID.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.920
And everyone goes on about that, oh, yes, it's finally solved the RAID hole that everybody

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.720
worries about and everything.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.120
Yeah, then you can never read your data quickly because it only reads at the speed of one

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120
disk.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.520
I mean, ZFS has lots of cool things.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.000
In theory, it's like tech porn.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.240
But in the real world, the world's moving on.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.120
There's more interesting things on the horizon.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.680
I'd much rather look at that than...

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.680
You may be right.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.960
You may be wrong, but you may be very right.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.560
And I hope you are right about that.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.920
And thank you for having such a strong viewpoint for this.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.240
Wimpy, I wanted to give you sort of the follow-up word before we wrap up this segment.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.000
I've got nothing new to say to this.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.840
Richard has summarized it all very well, but this hasn't been a recent development within

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.840
Debian.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.000
It was something they've been working on for years, and they actually announced that ZFS

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.040
was coming to Debian just over a year ago, when the last Debian project leader, Neil

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.480
McGovern was in.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:15.720
So that was last April that they announced this was coming, and then a year later, it's

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720
landed.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720
So it's not been...

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:25.400
And also, they've had discussions with all of the legal experts that they can talk to,

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:28.840
and they're confident that they are right to do this.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.760
Would that sort of be the green light, Richard, is if some legal trials happen, and this thing

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:37.600
actually gets tested, and things sort of look like they're shaping up in favor of shipping,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.840
you guys would probably reevaluate the position if there was a need to, right?

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.560
If Oracle relicenses ZFS tomorrow, everything I just said changes.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.160
Yeah, I suppose so, because if they really...

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.720
Which I doubt it, but that is also the position of the Free Software Foundation, too, and

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.880
the Software Conservancy.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.560
So maybe, there are some big foundations out there that are at least calling for it.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.400
I don't know if Oracle's very motivated to do it, though.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.280
I've checked the weather forecast in hell, but tomorrow, it's still looking toasty.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.280
Yes, exactly.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.040
But, Richard, I really do appreciate you stopping by to chat about it, and of course, we can

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.800
always pick it back up in the post-show.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.840
You know, the Unplugged program is live on the Tuesdays.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.200
You gotta be here live.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.720
Over at jblive.tv, jupitabroadcasting.com, slash, calendar, to get it converted to your

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.720
local time zone.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:26.740
You can also join us in that virtual lug, and hang out with your local virtual Linux

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:27.740
users group.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.120
We'll see if Wes's laptop makes it another week without getting reloaded.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120
Probably not.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120
Probably not.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.120
But be here next week.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.360
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com for feedback, or just leave a comment wherever you watch this.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.980
We really do appreciate that.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.400
And don't forget, you can catch us next week, or grab our RSS feed.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:24:03.560
See you then!

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:12.880
Get it out of here.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:19.160
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:27.640
Richard, you're a good sport, and nice to have somebody who's willing to come in here

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.560
and voice a well-stated and well-informed opinion, too.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.360
So I really do appreciate it.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360
Yeah.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360
Excellent.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360
Alright, jbtitles.com.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360
Now we vote!

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:51.360
By the way, while I'm on a roll, you do know that SUSE Linux Enterprise only uses the LTS

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360
kernels now, right?

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360
That's nice.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360
That is nice.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360
Good point to make.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360
Good point to make.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360
Absolutely.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Well said.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360
Well said.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360
Greg's kernel of truth isn't bad.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360
The price of freedom.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.360
The file system, a bug report page.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.360
Alright, you guys go over there and go vote.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360
Shake them out.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.640
I do have a little post-show thing I wanted to share with you guys.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.240
Oh, drop it down.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240
You know what?

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240
Look at this thread over there.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.320
Speaking of cheap laptops and stuff, there is this huge thread submitted 10 hours ago

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.760
by Reed Harder.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760
Blog slash rant.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.920
Oh, let's get in.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:24.160
Yeah, about taking a serious look at Chromebooks as the Linux desktop and talking about loving

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160
Chromebooks, et cetera, et cetera.

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:30.680
But then, of course, after 17 comments, it devolves into using Crouton or other things

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.640
to get Linux on Chromebooks.

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.320
This is a hot, hot area.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320
That's a hot market.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320
It really is.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320
I mean, they're so cheap.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
So cheap.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.320
Hot market.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.520
Colonel Linux, you had some good success recently with picking up a cheap laptop and throwing

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520
Linux on there.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.440
I have, but basically what I found is that Microsoft is subsidizing hardware just like

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.520
Google is.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.960
The nice thing about that is they don't lock the... Chromebooks do this thing, which a

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.440
lot of people are aware of, but some people don't know exactly how much of a pain it can

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440
be.

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:06.600
They lock the bootloader so that there is a signed key for Google, and if the battery

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:12.840
dies on certain models of Chromebooks, what happens is it defaults back to that read-only

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:19.160
state with the secure boot enabled, and you can't actually boot back into Linux because

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.560
it doesn't have the Chrome key, and because Chrome OS is no longer installed, you can't

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.980
boot into Chrome OS to turn secure boot back off, and so you're just kind of in this limbo

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:32.520
that forces you to reinstall Chrome OS and then reinstall your Linux distro.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.840
You can fix it on certain models by taking a write screw out, but what I found is that

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.480
basically, these ODMs have made cheap little computers, like HP makes a cheap little computer

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.040
and they sell some of them to... Google subsidizes some of them, puts their little goofy write

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.920
protection in there, and sells it with Chrome OS, and Microsoft does the same thing with

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.240
Windows 10 except when you wipe Windows 10 off, then you're just left with a normal bootloader.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.800
This is why I'm going with Wimpy.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.600
My position on this, if ever possible, is skip a computer, save up, and get one that

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.000
runs Linux, that's built to run Linux, because that stuff doesn't sound too bad, but just

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.600
having to worry about that would drive me crazy.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Let's be clear, though.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.440
There are certain times, though, where you're not skipping one computer, you're skipping

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440
two or three, right?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.440
Yeah.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:21.400
If you're looking at those HP Streams are $179, now what's the cheapest computer I can

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400
buy with Linux on it?

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.200
Yeah, and what they were saying in that thread was, my computer died, I needed a quick replacement.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.720
I hadn't budgeted for a new computer, I totally understand that, too.

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.240
Well, how much computer can you buy for $179 on eBay?

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.840
That's going to have a decent keyboard, it may be a little bit older, but hey, you can

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.800
take the backplate off and replace the Wi-Fi card, or add more RAM, or change the hard

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.800
drive.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800
Go used.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800
You could never do with a Chromebook.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800
In a pinch.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:50.600
I feel like we didn't mention the Wi-Fi USB 3 dongles you can get, the Linux support.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.440
You can just buy a better Linux computer, you know, everything else.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.520
I just go USB wireless, Colonel Linux even gave me this tiny little dongle that's the

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.520
size of a mouse receiver, just like the little tiny ones.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:20.560
Colonel Linux and his tiny dongles.
