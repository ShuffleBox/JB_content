1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
I'm very excited about today's show.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,800
We have something very cool in studio today.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
You can tell I'm excited about it because I'm flashing a USB drive right now, and I

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,080
only do it when it's for something really important, and it is important.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
It is very important.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Did you use Etcher?

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,080
You know what?

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
I just like it.

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
You know what?

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
The only thing I appreciate about Etcher is you can plug in a thumb drive after you've

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
launched it, and it still detects it.

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Yeah.

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Because sometimes, oh, stupid me.

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Did you get a chance to talk to the resin guys at the fest?

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,040
No, I don't think so.

17
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,560
Because they're the ones who make Etcher.

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,240
Oh, well, I would have loved to.

19
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,280
I did not.

20
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,720
That would have been great.

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,520
But somebody from the fest did drop something off on their way out of town.

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Oh?

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Oh?

24
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
Yeah.

25
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Yeah.

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
In studio today for the show, I'm doing a first hands-on with the new System76 Galagopro.

27
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
Look at that thing.

28
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Yeah.

29
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
So we'll be talking a little bit about it, and we're going to be using that flash drive

30
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
to put a proper Arch install on this.

31
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,160
I'll be testing under Ubuntu, too.

32
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
I mean, because you have to.

33
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
Yeah.

34
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,200
Well, I mean, you've got to check it out as shipped.

35
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
You've got to check it out as shipped.

36
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Yeah, absolutely.

37
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,960
So let's get the System76 here in a little bit into the show.

38
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,880
But first, you've got to get that flash drive.

39
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,040
First we've got to get that flash drive taken care of.

40
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Then we can move on.

41
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Then we can move on.

42
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Then we can move on.

43
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:27,720
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 196 for May 9, 2017.

44
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, Jupyter Broadcasting's longest-running Linux talk show.

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
My name is Chris.

46
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
My name is Wes.

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Hello, Wes.

48
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,200
Welcome to the flagship Linux program on the Jupyter Broadcasting network.

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
That's right.

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Mwa ha!

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Mwa ha!

52
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I didn't mean to get it away there.

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
With the power, you see.

56
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Yeah.

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Well, welcome to the show.

58
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,960
I even managed to override the mic a little bit.

59
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,160
I got so excited.

60
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,400
We have a great show on the program, despite this clipping.

61
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Coming up, Wes, I'm thrilled to say in studio we have the System76 Galago Pro, which we

62
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,840
will be giving our first hands-on impressions on in just a moment.

63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,200
We have some awesome news from the community.

64
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,920
We have big news for the show itself.

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Which next level stuff.

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
You know, I don't know if you noticed.

67
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Next level.

68
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
I don't know if you noticed.

69
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,160
We're getting close to episode 200.

70
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Yes, we are.

71
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
I know.

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Isn't that wild?

73
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
It's shocking, Wes.

74
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
But we have a little celebration coming up, and we'll tell you about our first bits of

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
those plans.

76
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,920
Our friends over at Mozilla have some big news.

77
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:40,320
Ubuntu is safe on the desktop, kinda, kinda, kinda, sorta.

78
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
It's really confusing.

79
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll play Mark Shuttleworth's words directly, and then we'll discuss what it means.

80
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,080
Server and IoT though, totally safe.

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Totally safe.

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
You're locked in.

83
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Good to go.

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,360
We have a lot of stuff coming up in the show, as well as some news, some open source projects,

85
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,160
and new things that we want to talk about, including the first one, a tool to dump your

86
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,640
login password for the current Linux users.

87
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
We'll talk about all that stuff.

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,360
But first, you know what we gotta do.

89
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
You know what the appropriate thing is.

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
You know what happens next.

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
We bring in that virtual lug.

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Time appropriate.

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Greetings, Mumble Room.

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Hello.

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Hey.

96
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Hey.

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Give me a hug.

98
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Whoa.

99
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Dang.

100
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
You know, that moved me a little bit.

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm gonna be honest.

102
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
You moved me to belching.

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
I appreciate it.

104
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Hello, guys.

105
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
It's good to see you.

106
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I've missed you.

107
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
I feel like it's been three weeks, even though I realize we haven't missed a beat.

108
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,520
I wanted to prepare you though, because we all are now at risk.

109
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,600
A great threat has fallen upon the Linux...

110
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
What?

111
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
What?

112
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Oh.

113
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I thought I was on cable news.

115
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
No, we have a cool new plugin to talk about, or application.

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's called MiniPenguin.

117
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,280
MiniPenguin, not mini, mini.

118
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,600
And it's a tool to dump the login password from the current Linux desktop user.

119
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,240
It's adapted from the idea behind a popular Windows tool called Mimikatz.

120
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
And it's just what you think it is.

121
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,440
You run it, and it takes advantage of the clear text credentials that are in memory

122
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,100
by dumping the process and extracting lines that have the highly probable area that's

123
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,920
containing the clear text passwords.

124
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Yeah.

125
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,240
And so in this example, you can see he's able to pull down the Apache user and password.

126
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,180
He's able to pull down the user that's running the GNOME process and the user that's running

127
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,320
the VSFTPD process.

128
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
So it's not necessarily limited to just the current user.

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, that's wild, actually.

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,480
Now, he's doing this with root credentials on this particular machine.

131
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,620
So you have to have root credentials.

132
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,800
But I think it's worth mentioning just this is possible.

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
Because when you think about someone getting remote access to your machine, this helps

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
kind of frame what they are capable of doing once they have access.

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
And this is a good way to also audit and test, too.

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
So it's also worth mentioning for legitimate uses.

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
So you can go find it.

138
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,480
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

139
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Meme program?

140
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Meme?

141
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Meme?

142
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
I don't know.

143
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
I don't know.

144
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
So there you have it.

145
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,680
We have C Sharp.

146
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
You had a question on the top here.

147
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Go ahead.

148
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Yeah.

149
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,440
Essentially, is this something that would be closed by GRSec or Pax, which have recently,

150
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,280
as pointed out on the latest Linus Action news, they've kind of removed themselves from

151
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,760
the process, the development process, or at least the patching process for the current.

152
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,760
You mean sort of like the isolating processes from each other and not letting them snoop

153
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,240
into areas of memory they're not supposed to?

154
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Yeah, I think that is-

155
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Yeah, exactly.

156
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Yeah.

157
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I think you're right.

158
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,680
That's probably a great example of why things like that are pretty important.

159
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,440
It's also a great example to remind us that this stuff sometimes is just running in memory

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
somewhere.

161
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,760
You can have the best encryption on your file system, and you can make sure that you keep

162
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
all your applications up to date.

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
But if someone's locally on your box and the stuff's in memory, well, there's not much

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,640
you're going to be able to do about it.

165
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
That's a lost cause.

166
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,080
Yeah, unless you do something, like C Sharp's saying there, C's Harp, no, it's C Sharp.

167
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Like C Sharp.

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
I get it, but it's with C.

169
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
You got it.

170
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
You're a clever one, Chris.

171
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,820
Are you a C Sharp developer?

172
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,640
It's more of a music pun than anything.

173
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh, really?

174
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,640
But also a DSP pun, because I'm into DSP as well.

175
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Oh, nice.

176
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,600
I actually went musical first, and then I thought, no, no, this is a geek crowd.

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
It's probably heens.

178
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Yeah, I can tell.

179
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,480
You guys have the best compression of pretty much every Linux podcast.

180
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Well, thank you.

181
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Aww.

182
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,840
That's the nicest thing anybody has said to me all week.

183
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Dang it.

184
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
Those are the things no one else will notice.

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah, we also have the best-

186
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Oh, man.

187
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
It's so appreciated.

188
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Anyways-

189
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
We also have the best mic clipping.

190
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Nobody has our mic clipping.

191
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
That's right.

192
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
20 dB over, baby.

193
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Guaranteed.

194
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
All right.

195
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Well, we've been following the saga of Thunderbird, and we have finally some resolution.

196
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Nothing's going to change.

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Pretty much the weird, awkward relationship continues.

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,640
But you know what?

199
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
That's my interpretation.

200
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,620
I won't put words in Mozilla's mouth.

201
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,760
On the mozilla.org blog, it says, the investigations on Thunderbird's future have concluded.

202
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,000
The Mozilla Foundation has agreed to serve as the legal and fiscal home for the Thunderbird

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,400
project, but Thunderbird will migrate off Mozilla Corporation's infrastructure, separating

204
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,120
the operational aspects of the project.

205
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,640
So this means just sort of like even less of what we had before?

206
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, I guess so.

207
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,200
Not a strong change here.

208
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,440
They write, legally, our existence is still under the Mozilla Foundation through their

209
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,280
ownership of the trademark and their control of the update path and websites that we use.

210
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,480
This arrangement has been working well from the Thunderbird point of view.

211
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,640
But there are still pain points and build release, localization, and divergent plans

212
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,080
with respect to add-ons, to name a few.

213
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,400
These are pain points for both Thunderbird and Firefox, and we want them resolved.

214
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,920
However, the council feels these pain points would not be addressed by moving somewhere

215
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
else.

216
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,640
Thus, not much is really changing.

217
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,640
What's next is Thunderbird Council and the Mozilla Foundation executive team will maintain

218
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,040
a good working relationship and talk and make decisions in a timely manner, they say.

219
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,840
The Thunderbird Council and team will make meaningful progress, they say, and they're

220
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,660
going to give either side six months notice if things get shitty and they want to separate.

221
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,520
So this is what we get.

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
This is what we get.

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Now, not addressed in here is the very fact that Thunderbird is really sort of up a creek

224
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,200
because Firefox is moving away from Zool and they're implementing new process technologies

225
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,280
that essentially break all the add-ons and hacks that Thunderbird uses to exist.

226
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,800
And none of that really seems to be addressed in this post.

227
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Nothing really seems to be changing other than now that these guys are going to be responsible

228
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,080
for running their own infrastructure.

229
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Also the section at the end titled, A Bright Future, that didn't sell to you.

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
You're not optimistic.

231
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,440
No, it just didn't grab me.

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Didn't really sell it to me.

233
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,000
I think the real reason why is it feels like exactly what happened to Firefox, only way

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
more dramatically worse because solutions like Nullius are really starting to gain traction.

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,720
I talked to a dozen people at Linux Fest that are using Nullius.

236
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Noah is using Nullius now, you use Nullius.

237
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,640
I know that there's several people in companies that we're familiar with now that are switching

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,400
over to Linux on the desktop and Nullius for their mail client.

239
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,880
And there's plenty of other really good ones too.

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,120
We're going to talk about System76 in a little bit and they're eyeballing Geary.

241
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Is that right?

242
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Sure.

243
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,160
Oh, future is not bright.

244
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Not bright.

245
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
Mumble room any thoughts on Thunderbird before we move on?

246
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,520
I hate to be a downer, but I know it's a topic that people actually seem to care about

247
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,320
because we get lots of people submitting links to Thunderbird stories.

248
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I was trying to find this last time when we were talking about it and I couldn't find

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
anything.

250
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,480
So I found this blog now, but I really have no thoughts at this point outside of I'm still

251
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,000
going to be using Thunderbird while I read this and then decide what it means to me.

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I think that's fair because it's not like the world is crumbling around you.

253
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,280
You still have Thunderbird if it's working for you and you're perfectly fine for a while.

254
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Yeah.

255
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Okay.

256
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I think that's a fair assessment.

257
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Anybody else?

258
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Okay.

259
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,560
I think the harder part is like what would you recommend to a new user if they're starting

260
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
today?

261
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Yeah.

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Probably Noleus.

263
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah.

264
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I wanted to also just mention really quick.

265
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,040
This has come in across our radar a few times throughout the week.

266
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,920
There's a – I'm going to say – I'm just going to call it a lap book.

267
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,000
There's a 12.3-inch lap book for $329 pre-running Ubuntu, but it has something unique.

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,560
It has a 2K screen.

269
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Oh.

270
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Which I really think is a sweet spot.

271
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
That's interesting.

272
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
I love a 2K screen.

273
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh, $329.

274
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
That's a pretty nice price.

275
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah.

276
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,720
It's going to have an Intel N3450.

277
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,600
So that's the Apollo Lake quad-core with 2.2 gigahertz burst, and it has an integrated

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Intel graphics 500.

279
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,760
So not a workhorse, but hey, it'll open your Chrome.

280
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Yeah.

281
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,800
And you get almost all of the perks of a high-resolution screen without the baggage of high DPI.

282
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,680
You can get 6 gigs of RAM in it.

283
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,600
It has a storage slot where you can add more storage through M.2.

284
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Not bad.

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Is that right?

286
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Not bad.

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,840
It has a 36-hour battery, which is actually the same that the Galago Pro there has.

288
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Nice.

289
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,960
This seems like it might be a really handy little travel laptop.

290
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Not your main thing, but throw it in your bag and go.

291
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah.

292
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,160
I mean, for $330, US greenbacks there.

293
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
That is pretty good.

294
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,640
And you can also, I think, get it with some Windows.

295
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm not familiar with it.

296
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Now there's a bad taste in my mouth.

297
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Yeah.

298
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,920
It's got some sort of digital assistant that will read the weather to you or something.

299
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Some people like it.

300
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Yeah.

301
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah.

302
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
So there you go.

303
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
Listen, Wes, I got a secret for you.

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,120
If you want to dig into all things Linux, you want to get a little bit further.

305
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
I really do.

306
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
If you want to go further, go to Linux Academy.

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Just go there.

308
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
LinuxAcademy.com.

309
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
You go there.

310
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
You can get a seven-day free trial.

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Learn.

312
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm not even going to say try it out.

313
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
To learn.

314
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,680
To learn passionately about things like Linux and things around Linux.

315
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,160
AWS, for me, when I first had to go hands-on for a client, was a nightmare.

316
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,400
There was no resource like Linux Academy back then.

317
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720
I just tried to go in and learn it myself.

318
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
And it's doable.

319
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
But, man, could I have gotten so much further and really, really used my time better if

320
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,640
I had something like Linux Academy.

321
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,520
Also now, same is true for Azure.

322
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,200
OpenStack conference is going on right now.

323
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,880
A lot of buzz around OpenStack.

324
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,680
You've probably seen a lot of news this last week.

325
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,440
If you follow the news closely about OpenStack, it's because they've got a big conference

326
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
going on.

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
That's right.

328
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,560
We're going to be playing quotes from Mark Shuttleworth when he was interviewed there

329
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,800
here in just a little bit.

330
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,840
And it's a huge topic.

331
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,920
And it's a huge industry trend.

332
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,360
Especially for folks that want to build their own local cloud.

333
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
They don't necessarily want to be on another provider, but they want to have some of the

334
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
benefits.

335
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,200
OpenStack is essential to, and really, Linux is essential to all of this.

336
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,080
And so Linux Academy is the perfect blend, because it's all things Linux, put together

337
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,840
by Linux enthusiasts, people that are passionate about this stuff.

338
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,720
And then as they have grown, they've met the market demand.

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
And now Linux Academy stands alone in this category.

340
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,560
From containers to DevOps, big data, and all things nitty-bitty Linux, go to linuxacademy.com

341
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,280
slash unplugged and sign up for a free seven-day trial at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

342
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,840
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

343
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,680
I just had to do a little dance there.

344
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Did you see me?

345
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,440
That was only for you too, because it's not like it's a video show.

346
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
Nobody else got to see my dance, Wes.

347
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
That was just you.

348
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
Unplugged program.

349
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It was lovely.

350
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
You should all be very jealous.

351
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,920
If you're lucky, it'll show up somewhere.

352
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Apricity OS.

353
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Oh, Wes.

354
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
Apricity OS.

355
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,280
It comes to an end.

356
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,560
Like all good things, it too comes to an end.

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,840
They say it's been their privilege to develop the operating system and to be part of the

358
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
community.

359
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,520
But unfortunately, they no longer have the time required for the upkeep.

360
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,440
I think they're shutting it all down too, like updates and all that kind of stuff.

361
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Boom.

362
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
This was an Arch-based distro.

363
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,520
I thought these were the big up-and-coming thing, like Arch-based distros were the new

364
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
hits.

365
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
The new hits.

366
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah.

367
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Is the Arch bubble popped, Wes?

368
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Maybe.

369
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Boy.

370
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Dun-dun-dun.

371
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,720
I mean, we've got Antigros.

372
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,120
Sanjaro is like almost weirdly popular, it seems like.

373
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,960
I did run Apricity for like the better part of six months.

374
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,920
It was really just Arch.

375
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,120
That's why I like to put it in here, because you actually rocked this as your daily driver.

376
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Good old Apricity.

377
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,600
And it was a good out-of-the-box Arch experience, right?

378
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Yeah.

379
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,720
Little did you know, they were struggling to keep it afloat.

380
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Right.

381
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,680
And that's always the risk with these niche, smaller distros.

382
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
It can be really hard.

383
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,320
Like, okay, is this something they're dedicated to?

384
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,120
How much, you know, I know like there's some questions like when Solus first appeared,

385
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,360
how you decide, you know, the marketplace of ideas, which things are worthy of support,

386
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,080
which things will actually get that support can be really hard to figure out.

387
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,280
I don't know if Apricity was unique enough or had enough of its own thing or, you know,

388
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,840
just not enough support.

389
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Yeah.

390
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,400
I mean, I don't want to piss on its gravestone.

391
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,840
I would say that I think when you were running it, I generally, you know, would have a reaction

392
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,440
of, oh, I got to try that out.

393
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
I never really had that draw.

394
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,600
I was like, oh, okay, so it looks like I could get that with Antigros and I just changed

395
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
the theme.

396
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,200
And I never really could connect with what it, and I'm sure it was more than that, but

397
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,920
it failed to connect with me to what it actually was.

398
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,560
And so in that aspect, I'm more inclined to go with one of the larger Arch variants or

399
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,400
Arch itself, if I want that experience.

400
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I think good on them.

401
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,760
They decided they didn't have the time for it, better to move on.

402
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,720
Yeah, there's a lot of trade-offs both ways.

403
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
And yeah, exactly.

404
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah.

405
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
There you have it.

406
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
Apricity, we barely knew ye.

407
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
But thank you.

408
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
It was fun.

409
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
And it was great for Wes for a little while.

410
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,200
I mean, if there's anyone who was using Apricity and hasn't tried Antigros, they certainly

411
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
should.

412
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Yeah.

413
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Yeah.

414
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Go give it a look.

415
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Give it a look.

416
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Speaking of Antigros, ours just finished.

417
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Oh, did it?

418
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Oh, very nice.

419
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Thanks, Wes.

420
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Thanks for keeping an eye on that.

421
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,680
You know who else is bailing out of Linux?

422
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Google.

423
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
What?

424
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Google sort of.

425
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,480
So do you have any familiarity with the Fuchsia smartphone OS project they have?

426
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
A little bit.

427
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,960
I hear it mentioned from time to time.

428
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,360
Yeah, it's like their Skunk Works kind of like in the back room project.

429
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,920
Oh, that's what that smell is.

430
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Yeah.

431
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,400
And unlike Chrome OS or Android, no Linux.

432
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,600
It uses a new Google-developed microkernel called Magenta.

433
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,120
And Fuchsia is running on top of Magenta.

434
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,720
And in this case, Google will not only be dumping the Linux kernel, but also the GPL.

435
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Oh, who?

436
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah.

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
What's the license here?

438
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,400
It's BSD, Clause 3, MIT, and Apache 2.0.

439
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,120
And dumping the Linux kernel might come as a bit of a shock to maybe some of you listening.

440
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,760
But if you look at Android itself, they really haven't been keeping up with upstream Linux

441
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,960
kernel releases for a while.

442
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,280
Android is maybe a little better off.

443
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,720
But like the Google Pixel, you know, the...

444
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,040
I had that thing right in my pocket.

445
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Which I think is...

446
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,440
I mean, I think they have a current newer build in development that runs off a newer

447
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
kernel.

448
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,080
And this new one, kernel 3.18, I believe.

449
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Hmm.

450
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Yeah.

451
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Sorry.

452
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
That's rough.

453
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,120
You should have seen...

454
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh, man.

455
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,280
The only reason this should be a video show right now is so people could have seen your

456
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
face when you...

457
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Ooh, he says.

458
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Oh.

459
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,400
That's just no good.

460
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
That was good, Wes.

461
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
I mean, I'm a kernel hipster, but still.

462
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
That was good.

463
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah.

464
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Google's documentation describes Magenta as targeting modern phones and modern personal

465
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,680
computers with fast processor and non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals

466
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,760
doing open-ended computation.

467
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,480
Now this is also neat because the apps, they're written in another one of Google's background

468
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,600
projects called Flutter, a project written in Dart, which is Google's reboot of JavaScript,

469
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,160
which on mobile has a focus on high performance, like 120 frames per second type app performance.

470
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,920
It's also Vulkan-based and their renderer is called Escher, and it promises to have

471
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,920
volumetric soft shadow capabilities in its UI.

472
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah.

473
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,560
It's designed to run the design-heavy material design from Google.

474
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,440
So their whole thing here is maybe a mobile phone OS that would free them away from the

475
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,240
GPL, and if you look at it, the basic design elements just kind of look like Android.

476
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,120
They are getting this to a point where this is going to be a one-to-one UI swap.

477
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,400
If your stuff uses material design, like all of Google's stuff does, it's just going to

478
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
look better.

479
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
You wouldn't even know.

480
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Look at these design mock-ups and these early prototypes.

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,540
It really does just look, yeah.

482
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Looks like Android.

483
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,640
It's those shadows, man.

484
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,200
So even before we ever really get to good Android apps on the Linux desktop, that whole

485
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,800
hope is just going to go right away.

486
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Well, the problem is I have is I love that everybody here has got a Linux in their pocket

487
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
line.

488
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
You know, they've got the Linux in the pocket.

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Yeah, that is a good one, isn't it?

490
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,480
We're all fucking around running with Linux.

491
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,400
You know, I love that go-to because it's like so poignant, like how Android is Linux-powered

492
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
and ergo Linux is everywhere.

493
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,920
And then you get into the cloud and you get into networking and all, and then of course

494
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
huge.

495
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,360
It's just that whole line of, they're in our pocket, if they do this, they're going to

496
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,520
exclude that.

497
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,640
And that, Google would wrong me.

498
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
That's all I care about.

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
I really, I actually, in some regards, hope that they do drop Linux.

500
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,240
I wonder if this will be worse for small players, you know, like with less hope of, you know,

501
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,920
if there's less upstream development, they don't have the, you know, the crazy momentum

502
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,880
that the Linux project has, what's the kind of, what's the hardware enablement story going

503
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
to be like, right?

504
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,160
I mean, it's no problem for Samsung to make sure their latest system on a chip works with

505
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
it because they want to sell this, you know, use this platform.

506
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,720
But what about like, you know, third-party retailers, are you trying to use, you know,

507
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,040
more generally sourced components?

508
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,640
I wonder if this will be worse.

509
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
C-Sharp, you feel like it would be a bad development.

510
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
I actually kind of feel like it could be a good development if they moved away from Linux.

511
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know.

512
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,040
I feel like if the NSA, which is so at odds with the citizenry, especially of the US,

513
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, I'm in Canada, but is he constantly in contention with a government body, then

514
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,800
I don't see how Google is really going to steamroll anything more than the NSA could,

515
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
you know what I mean?

516
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Okay.

517
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Fair point.

518
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,160
Well, Mini-Mech, you actually make a strong point.

519
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,680
One of the best things that's happened to Linux is manufacturers have to support Android,

520
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
huh?

521
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Well, the problem is, you see, that if manufacturers start to develop drivers only for that foxy

522
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,080
system, Linux is out of the, yeah, you can't use it anymore.

523
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:35,120
So these devices will become some kind of wallet garden controlled by Google.

524
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,240
I've always felt like Linux is a bit like time travel and that you can use it for powers

525
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,600
of absolute good, like Captain Kirk does to save the world from aliens that want to communicate

526
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,240
with whales.

527
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,120
Or you can use it to go back and save Hitler.

528
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,820
And I feel like what Google does is they use Linux to surveil and monitor the people on

529
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,020
a mass scale and then privatize that and sell it back to carriers, they use it for advertising,

530
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,200
the government gets access to it through information requests, and they do all of it with the assistance

531
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
of Linux.

532
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,320
It's like using the ultimate tool for good for the ultimate suppression of the people,

533
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:26,240
privatized domestic spying is a huge problem and they use Android to do it.

534
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,520
And to me, I just, I can't get over it.

535
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,080
It's like they took something great and they used it for evil, it feels like.

536
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,760
And part of me hates the fact that Linux is complicit in this.

537
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,920
And so if they stopped using Linux on Android, this mass surveillance operating system that

538
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,440
we all happily buy and then pay carriers to track us even further and sell that information,

539
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,760
at least they won't be using Linux to pull it all off, at least in the devices themselves.

540
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,560
So that's worth it in your eyes?

541
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I don't know.

542
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,680
Like relevance drop that Linux may have?

543
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I don't know.

544
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,680
I mean, I feel like, I mean, I guess if this thing is awesome and gets a really good upstream

545
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,280
community, but what will the governance look like, right, and will this ever be targeted

546
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
for other devices?

547
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,780
Will there be third party ROM?

548
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,320
If they could do something that would make application or I'm sorry, operating system

549
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,840
updates more deliverable to more devices and get more security patches out to consumers,

550
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
this could be a net benefit for consumers too.

551
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
That's true.

552
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,560
I doubt that it's Linux that's preventing them from doing that.

553
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,640
So in fact, all of the issues I think that I have with Android, it's none of its Linux.

554
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,240
It's all performance stuff, which is on the Android layer.

555
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,400
It's all the other things around Android and none of it's because of Linux.

556
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
It's not the kernel that's stopping you.

557
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
Yeah, it feels like if they wanted to solve some of their problems, dropping Linux isn't

558
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
what they need to do.

559
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,300
But at the same time, maybe it's, I don't know, maybe there could be some good for it.

560
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:53,020
Although Minimac makes a really great point, I really think that Linux has benefited greatly

561
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,960
from device manufacturers having to work with Android, especially at the embedded level.

562
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,100
I think it's been huge.

563
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,880
So that would be definitely a step back.

564
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Yeah, we'll see.

565
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
We'll see.

566
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
We'll see what happens.

567
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Project Fuchsia looks like it's going to be interesting, and we're seeing more screenshots.

568
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,080
We're seeing more stuff about it.

569
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah, becoming real.

570
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Yeah, exactly.

571
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,440
I have something really, really cool to talk about.

572
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,080
So last week we mentioned the caster soundboard, and this week, holy crap, Wes, I can say it

573
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,220
has really gotten a life of its own.

574
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,560
So thank you to everybody who's been taking a look at trying to make this thing better.

575
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,480
We've been getting a lot of submissions and our poll requests.

576
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
And it's also...

577
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Oh, that's awesome.

578
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,400
We have the AUR, too, so now you can rebuild it from the AUR if you want to install it

579
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
really easily.

580
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,440
We have eight contributors, 31 commits, two branches already.

581
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,040
And if you don't remember from last week, this is a soundboard for Hot Keen and Playing

582
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,680
Back, all the little like sound bites and music intros and stuff like that we have on

583
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
our shows.

584
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,760
And look at this, Wes.

585
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
You can...

586
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Here's how to build it from source.

587
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,640
Here's how to install all the requirements on Fedora, Debian, even some Mac OS X thing.

588
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Oh, it's in brew.

589
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Look at that.

590
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Yeah, it's in brew.

591
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

592
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It's so cute.

593
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
And then you can pull it down.

594
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,320
The whole thing is in the AUR, though.

595
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,680
Gosh, that's cool.

596
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,840
It's really neat to see the community come together like this because people are now

597
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,600
pulling it down and playing with it.

598
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
And like producer Michael before the show was saying, you know, I just have it down

599
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
on my machine.

600
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I've been playing around with it.

601
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
That's awesome.

602
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
It's starting to look really cool.

603
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
It's starting to really come together.

604
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Yeah.

605
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
So if you want to check out, it's an open source soundboard that we're working on right

606
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
now with the community.

607
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,680
And we're adding in features that there really hasn't been something like this on Linux.

608
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,520
There's a few on the Mac that are pretty good, but we're trying to do this on Linux.

609
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,160
And Caster Soundboard is pretty much there.

610
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
It's so awesome.

611
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
And it's not even an Electron app.

612
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
No.

613
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,840
It's a C++ in the Qt 5 app, as they say.

614
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,600
Caster Soundboard, an awesome community effort, originally created a couple of years by a

615
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
community member.

616
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
He's back, too.

617
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
He's in there working.

618
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Oh, awesome.

619
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Yeah.

620
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
That is so cool.

621
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah.

622
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I really appreciate it.

623
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Yeah.

624
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Covariant sensor or covariant tensor.

625
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I can't remember.

626
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
It's something like that.

627
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah.

628
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Yeah.

629
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Michael's in there.

630
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Maelstrom's in there.

631
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Chasing Logic.

632
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Of course, the Beard's in there.

633
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
ASC is in there.

634
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
GDogg is in there.

635
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Freq Labs is in there.

636
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
Freq Labs, whatever he goes by.

637
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,700
So thank you guys for working on it.

638
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,800
You can see the little spike right there in the activity.

639
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
It's really cool.

640
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
So it's Caster Soundboard.

641
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,500
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to play around with our free open source

642
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,640
soundboard that we're developing for production purposes here at Jupiter Broadcasting, but

643
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,440
really creating it so the entire community has something they can mess around with.

644
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,720
And it's like caster soundboard-git if you want to install it from the AUR.

645
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,960
Now, oh, I wish I, speaking of the soundboard, I wish I had my soundboard set up right now

646
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,920
because I would totally do a breaking news clip because this is breaking news right here

647
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
on the Unplugged show.

648
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah, that's right.

649
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
It is.

650
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,840
So Linux Unplugged is at an interesting point.

651
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,120
It's the last big Linux show that we have right now.

652
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
User Air is about to start back up.

653
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,560
Linux Action News is about to start.

654
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Ask NOAA is brand new.

655
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Brand new.

656
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Growing.

657
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Growing.

658
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:01,400
And so really the now Linux powerhouse in the Jupiter Broadcasting lineup is Linux Unplugged.

659
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,680
So let's take a moment and talk about something we're doing as episode 200 closely approaches.

660
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,320
This is just between you and me and the audience and the community listening.

661
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:18,320
So nobody tell anyone we're going to go into the Cone of Silence.

662
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
I am deeply concerned.

663
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
All right.

664
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
So the Cone of Silence here.

665
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I just love that clip.

666
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,200
I should have a reason to use it because I actually want you to tell everybody.

667
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,120
We are launching a Linux Unplugged subreddit to replace the Linux Action Show subreddit.

668
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,280
It always felt like Linux Unplugged was kind of like the younger sibling that was tagging

669
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,160
along Linux Action Show and being like, I want to have fun too.

670
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I want to have a subreddit.

671
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
We like Linux.

672
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Yeah.

673
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
And so now, no, no.

674
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
We're grown up.

675
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
We graduated.

676
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,200
And our Linux Unplugged is officially a thing and we're hoping it can be used to input content,

677
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,560
give us feedback for the show, really kind of let's take another shot at this and make

678
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,440
something that could be possibly known as one of the cool places to get really good

679
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,000
conversation and discussion around a story and links around Linux.

680
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
One of the things that I am really thankful for for the community of our Linux Action

681
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,280
Show is what an awesome collection of just good Linux news resources it is.

682
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Absolutely.

683
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,560
Other Linux subreddits, but we always had the best stuff and sometimes first.

684
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,920
And I love that about our Linux Action Show.

685
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,280
I'd love to see that continued at Linux Unplugged.

686
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,360
And it was like an organic, like, this is exciting to me.

687
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
I want people to, you know, talk about this.

688
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Yeah.

689
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,320
And I would love to also, speaking of things, I just really love to see for like our goals

690
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
and our intentions for this.

691
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,240
I like this is like my high point items is the conversation around these stories, insights,

692
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,360
people's opinions, but like a good level discussion that is really kind of valuable and helps

693
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,760
give people a better idea or thought or see a different perspective on a story.

694
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,040
Doesn't have nothing that gets like all like flame worry, but just good discussion and

695
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,640
context around stories can be so valuable and also help weigh how the community is interpreting

696
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
the story.

697
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,600
So I know if I doesn't always necessarily decide if you go on a show, but man, it helps

698
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
our discussion in the show a whole bunch.

699
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,600
So if you want to participate, reddit.com slash r slash Linux Unplugged.

700
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,300
We also don't forget we have the other subreddits.

701
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,260
We have our Jupiter Broadcasting, our Ask Noah, Koda Radio, Techsnap on Filter.

702
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,320
They're all rocking and rolling too.

703
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Yeah.

704
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,820
I'm really thinking it could be neat and maybe like in the next 200 episodes, this place

705
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,160
will blow up too.

706
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Yeah.

707
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
What do you think, Wes?

708
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,800
You think it's crazy to launch a subreddit in 2017?

709
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Are we nuts?

710
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,040
No, I think it makes sense.

711
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Does it?

712
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm a little worried we might have lost it.

713
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Maybe we've gone crazy.

714
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Maybe.

715
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
I mean, we'll see.

716
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Right.

717
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
We're taking a risk.

718
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
We're going to try it again.

719
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Yeah.

720
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Yeah.

721
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Yeah.

722
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I suppose so.

723
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I suppose.

724
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I mean, the Mumble Room is always good.

725
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
It's like a direct place to talk to us.

726
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,520
If you want to be live, go to jblive.tv on Tuesdays.

727
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,360
We're almost always live at 2 p.m. Pacific and we just kind of lock it there so that

728
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,960
way you know when to join the Mumble Room.

729
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,440
You can get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

730
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,480
and you can get in our chat room and if you do bang mumble, you'll get the server information

731
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
and then you connect.

732
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,880
We do mic checks and we ask that you have headphones on, you have like a headset or

733
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,160
a good microphone or some kind that we can at least hear you clearly and then you get

734
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,200
in and you can chat with us one-on-one.

735
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah all right.

736
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
So anyways, I made a post up on the, I don't really have much more to add, I guess that's

737
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
kind of it.

738
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,080
I made a post up on the Linux Action Show subreddit if you guys want to read more and

739
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,840
I have the details in there.

740
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,160
That is linked in the show notes.

741
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Yeah.

742
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,120
So thank you everyone to our Linux Action Show.

743
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,920
That has been such an awesome resource for not just Linux Action Show but also the Unplugged

744
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
program.

745
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,200
The discussions there have been helpful, the stories have been helpful and I ask that we

746
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
take the best of all of it and we move to Linux Unplugged subreddit.

747
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,480
We take the best and we do it all over again.

748
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm not afraid to start to build all over.

749
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,640
Just bring it up from the beginning again Wes.

750
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:57,160
Also be sure to check out linuxactionnews.com, no ww right now, just linuxactionnews.com.

751
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,620
Subscribe to the RSS feed there because episode one will be landing very soon.

752
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,240
There is a prototype beta episode over there, skip it.

753
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
It's fine.

754
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,360
But you know, it's Joe and I sitting down for the first time trying out a show and it

755
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
went good.

756
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
And so we're like, all right, we'll publish it.

757
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,520
We have something to create the RSS feed around and we can start working with us.

758
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,600
But it's not intended as the first episode.

759
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,560
It's more like a concept pilot episode.

760
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Practice.

761
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,900
It's over there but the RSS feeds are live now.

762
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,400
The episode page is up at linuxactionnews.com so check that out.

763
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,600
Also Wimpy, who couldn't join us today, he's traveling, but did get a chance to stop by

764
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,200
Ask Noah live at Linux Fest Northwest.

765
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
Did they have a good conversation?

766
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Oh yeah.

767
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Oh yeah.

768
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,360
So that's in the latest episode of Ask Noah.

769
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,160
I would also suggest you check that out if you haven't listened to Ask Noah yet because

770
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,360
a really thought provoking conversation and if you are an Electron lover or hater, I would

771
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
really encourage you to listen to Ask Noah.

772
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,560
Here's another thing that's really nice about Ask Noah.

773
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,360
You always know exactly how long it is because he's also broadcasting on the radio so it's

774
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,840
always exactly the same length so it's easy to fit into your schedule.

775
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,320
Ask Noah 6 live from Linux Fest Northwest.

776
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,920
If you miss Wimpy on the Unplugged program, check that out.

777
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,160
They had a great conversation and of course you can find him on the Ubuntu podcast too.

778
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,960
It was so great to get to meet Wimpy in person.

779
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Yeah.

780
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,120
That was one of my highlights of the Fest this year.

781
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,400
And he really made the best out of the Fest.

782
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,920
Turns out he's even more fun in person.

783
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah.

784
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,240
You know what's great about Wimpy is this is what I really appreciated about him.

785
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,840
If you got an inclination that he's a pretty cool guy online, it's like that but way more

786
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
in person.

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
And that's what's so great.

788
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,920
It's like when you meet somebody in person and they're even cooler than they seem online.

789
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,740
Just a genuinely really great guy and a gentleman.

790
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,840
So it was great to get to meet Wimpy in person and hang out with him for the weekend.

791
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,480
Odyssey, you made it back too, huh?

792
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,080
So you survived the long drive?

793
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Good job, man.

794
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Yes, indeed.

795
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
That's great.

796
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,400
You made it back just in time for the Hanford site to start to have an emergency so that's

797
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
got to feel good.

798
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Yeah.

799
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,840
Yeah, Albert made it out here too as well as a whole bunch of other people but we had

800
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,440
a good time and it was a pretty cool Fest.

801
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,160
We had a little bit of coverage of it in the Linux action show on last Sunday if you want

802
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
to check that out.

803
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
All right.

804
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,120
So I want to cover what's going on at Canonical and I want to talk about what Mark Shallower

805
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,760
said today and then I want to do our first hands on with Gallego Pro.

806
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,120
So we have much more to come so I want to thank Ting for setting us up for the next

807
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:37,760
bit of the show and you can go to linux.ting.com to sign up and get $25 off your Ting plan

808
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,480
in credit or if you bring a device or if you need a device, you can get $25 off a device.

809
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,520
Now consider my friends, this could also be an opportunity to get a very reasonable usable

810
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,160
smartphone that maybe gets updates for a little bit, things like that because one of the great

811
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,520
things about Ting is they don't stand in the way of security updates, they don't have any

812
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,680
games to play, they don't have some image they have to lay on there or some sort of

813
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,080
weird ass services that the OS has to support.

814
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,720
They don't care how you use Ting, it's just use what you want and then you pay for it.

815
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,920
Your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, whatever you use and that's what you pay.

816
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,640
It's $6 for the line and that includes their awesome great customer service, their fantastic

817
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,200
dashboard to manage it all.

818
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,720
That includes all of the great perks of Ting like anything you would expect from a standard

819
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,000
phone line because it is like your voicemail, your text messaging, picture messaging, hotspot,

820
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,400
tethering, it's all in there for $6 a month plus your usage.

821
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,320
It's so fantastic, the average monthly bill per device for Ting customers is $23.

822
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,560
I've been a Ting customer for over two years, linux.ting.com, you go there, you sign up,

823
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,320
you try them out and you see what I've been talking about.

824
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,920
Also, really great, they have CDMA and GSM network.

825
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,400
So whatever works better in your neck of the woods, you can use on Ting and if you go to

826
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,440
another neck, you can use a different network if you need to.

827
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,760
It's for somebody like myself who likes to go on road trips, killer freaking feature.

828
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,840
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this here unplugged program.

829
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,460
Linux.ting.com.

830
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:19,160
So Canonical is on the path to IPO which is the initial public offering for those of you

831
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,800
who might not be familiar with the term and that means they become a public company with

832
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,440
all of the responsibilities and duties therein, i.e.

833
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,320
Obligations to make profits and things like that.

834
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,200
This is confirmed by Mark Shalloworth at the OpenStack Summit.

835
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:41,160
He said that they are pushing on, so this is in the shadow of course of the recent announcement

836
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,400
that they're dropping investments in Unity 8, the phone and convergence and that Mark

837
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,680
would be coming, would be regaining the CEO title, stepping in for Jane.

838
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,300
This is big and this is going to be a fundamental shift in the gearing of Canonical.

839
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,460
Do not misunderstand.

840
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,920
This is a huge development.

841
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,840
It's going to mean a realigning of the company's priorities, refocusing and Mark seems pretty

842
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,480
fired up about this.

843
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,400
Putting the company on the path to IPO, he said we must figure out what steps we need

844
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,160
to take moving forward, focusing Canonical on its most profitable business lines.

845
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Ubuntu is not going to die.

846
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,560
Ubuntu is the default platform on cloud computing in Juju and storage and OpenStack and on

847
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
the edge.

848
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,880
He says it's nearly unstoppable.

849
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,940
We need to work out our IoT path and at the same time we had to cut out those parts that

850
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,680
couldn't meet investors' needs.

851
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,680
The immediate work is to get all of the parts of the company profitable.

852
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,440
I mean that sounds like what they'll need to do in the future.

853
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,240
So it's within that context that Mark was at OpenStack and The Cube, welcome to The

854
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,640
Cube live from the OpenStack Summit conference, asked him this question here.

855
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,760
The three legs of computing, personal computing, data center computing or cloud computing and

856
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,400
the edge, the IoT world, which is neither data center nor personal, of those I had dreamed

857
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,720
of Ubuntu as sort of going mainstream in all three, clearly Ubuntu is the de facto standard

858
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,360
now for cloud computing and the data center and also I think arguably for the edge.

859
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,400
Where we failed and I feel responsible for miscalculating effectively is our push into

860
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,800
personal computing, phones, tablets, PCs.

861
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,200
Where we failed was our push into personal computing, phones, tablets and PCs.

862
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,840
And PCs.

863
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,420
And PCs.

864
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:44,200
Where we failed, our past tense, past tense, which I think is also pretty important there.

865
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,000
And yikes, you know that to me sounds like a man who had a bit of a dream and that dream

866
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,080
got crushed and now he's dealing with a new reality and he's just done with it.

867
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,360
And you know he's like really, he calls it my miscalculation I think is what he said.

868
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,160
Ubuntu is sort of going mainstream in all three, clearly Ubuntu is the de facto standard

869
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,800
now for cloud computing and the data center and also I think arguably for the edge.

870
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,840
Where we failed and I feel responsible for miscalculating effectively is our push into

871
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,920
personal computing, phones, tablets, PCs.

872
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,240
Wow.

873
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,840
That's a strong statement and I think that is a statement that if you take it into its

874
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,760
full entirety it obviously represents a lot of reflecting on Mark on this particular issue.

875
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,980
And so the question is in this context in which he now views the landscape, where does

876
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,480
desktop Linux fit in?

877
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,320
Where does Ubuntu on desktop fit in?

878
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,800
And so I think the desktop remains really important to us in support of developers who

879
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,920
are really the lifeblood of free software and open source and IT innovation.

880
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,040
But as a business we chose to focus on these two, the cloud where we are very strong and

881
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,680
IOT where I think the story is only just beginning but again we're at the center of everything.

882
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,120
So they're going to focus on the desktop for developers essentially, which means it sounds

883
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,880
like a narrow focus like this is going to be our market.

884
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,920
You know what's interesting about that statement?

885
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Sounds like Fedora workstation.

886
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
No you meant something else.

887
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,320
Hey, you made me clip again Wes, you made me clip again, you are getting me this week,

888
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
you are getting me.

889
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,720
I apologize guys, it's all Wes' fault.

890
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
It's my fault.

891
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
It's all Wes' fault.

892
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:35,680
It was good Wes, no, now you made me forget because I was so good.

893
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,760
No it reflects exactly what Dell told us when we were down there Dell said you know we kept

894
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,200
trying Linux and we thought it was going to be like this low cost desktop, we thought

895
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,120
it was going to be the cheap way to maybe take a hundred bucks off of a PC.

896
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,920
So that's how we initially positioned it and it wasn't selling.

897
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
We didn't understand.

898
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,440
We didn't want these Celeron machines and these Atom machines.

899
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,240
What they wanted was they wanted to develop on Linux and so once we started creating the

900
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,880
Project Sputnik and we focused on developers specifically with Project Sputnik, we started

901
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
selling like crazy.

902
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,840
Now we have a hundred percent year-over-year growth.

903
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,640
They're selling numbers that are just intense right?

904
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:19,560
Now the reason why that I think it's interesting that Mark's sentiment and Dell sentiment lines

905
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,940
up is because it must be reflected in sales numbers.

906
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,960
The part that's disconnected from all of this for me is the thing that we hear over and

907
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,680
over again is that Ubuntu is selling like crazy in India and China and that it's almost

908
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,040
half of the PC sales over there or that you go into the stores and the half of the store

909
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,900
are Ubuntu machines and half the store are Windows machines and that Ubuntu is extremely

910
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,400
successful in India and in China and are all of those developers?

911
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,560
No because then you're told that the story is well these are people that don't have a

912
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,000
market bias so they're able to go in and you know assess the computer not based on Windows

913
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,360
or Mac or Linux but just is it a computer and they're buying these Ubuntu machines and

914
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,400
it's successful there.

915
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,680
So it would seem like they also are getting quite a bit of successful in the totally new

916
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,880
user market but and I hear that a lot but then when we talk about it now we're just

917
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
going to focus on developers.

918
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,240
Hang on Chris, aren't a lot of those installations just getting wiped for a pirate version of

919
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Windows straight away?

920
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,280
Perhaps, Dell would say no but I don't know.

921
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I don't know.

922
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,480
Of course they would.

923
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,560
Maybe and so you think that's why they're so easily ready to just jettison that type

924
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
of user?

925
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,960
They're not real Ubuntu users?

926
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,200
Well yeah and as for the developers well what's the whole subsystem for Linux on Windows all

927
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
about?

928
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Isn't that about developers?

929
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,360
Yeah seemingly so.

930
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,080
Yeah that or yeah let's not go down that path because that leads to a dark path because

931
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,120
there's so many other solutions for that.

932
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm getting a mixed message.

933
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,800
I'll tell you what I'm getting a mixed message because it's while it's consistent from what

934
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,760
Dell would tell you Project Sputnik is only representative of their success in the US

935
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
market.

936
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,840
Outside of the US they're just selling to average users and I think Canonical is saying

937
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,000
we're not going to be targeting those users anymore.

938
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,840
I mean it doesn't seem like there's a lot of glamour there.

939
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't know about the profitability or the business incentives but like does it seemingly

940
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,400
they're placing the bet that it matters more to become you know completely adopted and

941
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,100
ingrained in these IoT and cloud markets than it does to be the low-end desktop for a lot

942
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,220
of the world.

943
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,800
Or just that like is the return not that great like they already have you know they'll continue

944
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,120
making an open source desktop that you can install if people want to use it if hardware

945
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,100
retailers they are already using it you know what does it get them to continue to invest

946
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
in it?

947
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,000
And I think the thing that we will just have to wait and see in this whole story is and

948
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,800
it's almost it's getting to the point now where it's starting to I think pass its prime

949
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,560
and we can move on until things develop but how much of a desktop experience do they end

950
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
up creating?

951
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,520
Like we will see the priority that the desktop has inside Canonical will be represented in

952
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,360
what we get as a product in 1710 and 1804 if there is a significant amount of tweaks

953
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,880
or theming or you know you can define significant however you like but if there is an amount

954
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,820
of tweaks or customizations or changes to make it more palatable in some some way out

955
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:31,660
of the box that would seem to imply resources testing personnel i.e. effort.

956
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,460
If it is stock Ubuntu GNOME with no changes really just hardly any you know we've just

957
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,600
repackaged things up we put it in our repo and now we're going to give you security fixes

958
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,600
that to me would suggest a low amount of effort and energy putting and personnel etc. put

959
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,880
into the desktop and that's just the proof will just be as your buddy Bill says in the

960
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,960
puddin it'll just be in the puddin right there in that puddin yeah under the skin yeah just

961
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,600
just right there skin deep.

962
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Mini Mac I will give you one more chance to chime in go ahead yeah thanks.

963
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,280
So I guess Ubuntu will stay the base for a lot of distributions and they will continue

964
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,600
to publish a somehow default configuration for that system but it's not their primary

965
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,120
goal remember China has its own Ubuntu distribution called Kalin right I don't know if I spell

966
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,460
it right but it will stay the base for a lot of distributions we all love.

967
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,060
That is a great point and I'm surprised I forgot about that because that's exactly that's

968
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,120
exactly solves that problem doesn't it of course it makes much that that actually that

969
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:38,200
fills in the gap Kailin or Kalin Kailin of course that's why that's okay.

970
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
What is it?

971
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,640
Chillin yeah chillin right chillin right thanks Joe it's chillin that is of course that fills

972
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,280
in that gap so that's why there's something stepping up to fill that need of that makes

973
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,800
sense so that that really you know what geez the more I think about this the more sense

974
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,920
this makes I think Canonical is going to knock it out of the park I think I think I've never

975
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,800
been tempted to invest in a company I don't know if I should or not but man I would be

976
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,720
tempted to buy a few shares in Canonical because what has been the criticism of Canonical all

977
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,300
along why can't they just focus like they have these things that make money but they

978
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,440
just keep going off and doing this stuff and now that's exactly what Mark is doing he's

979
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,300
narrowing things down he's going to go with what works and they these are profitable aspects

980
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,600
of the business it's not like they have to figure out a way to make they're not Twitter

981
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,020
they already make money they just were spending it on stuff that wasn't making money they're

982
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,160
already going to make money there if you were an investor that wanted to get in on this

983
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,340
market how could you not be interested in investing in the company behind the thing

984
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,280
that runs the most on AWS and Azure and Rackspace and on private clouds like how could you not

985
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,120
want to invest in that company that has a very solid IOT offering that's pretty much

986
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,480
ready to go and already being used by companies like Dell I would be pretty much in on that

987
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,960
if I if so it seems like a slam dunk and if they're going to let some of their other projects

988
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,580
like Chillin or Ubuntu Mate or the Plasma you know Kubuntu slash Neon groups they can

989
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,120
continue to serve those markets they can then now focus on the very thing that seems to

990
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,520
be selling XPSs and HPs and system 76 machines and make a great desktop there if they put

991
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,580
energy into it so they could be lined up for like a super home run like if they do this

992
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,440
right this could be they could be the next Red Hat don't you think and only I think in

993
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,120
some ways they're better positioned I don't know about revenue wise but they're better

994
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,460
positioned in terms of deployment in all of these markets that are making all of the money

995
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,440
right now seems like investors are going to go nuts go ahead but is it not the case they've

996
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,720
invested all this money into the community stuff and the flavors and now it's kind of

997
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,800
like they can just almost abandon the desktop to them and they've put enough investment

998
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,320
in and they'll keep helping them but they don't need to pay developers so much anymore

999
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,040
because they've got a bun to go home which is fine and they're basically saying we're

1000
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,080
just going to ship stock that as far as I understand it yeah I think that is smart it's

1001
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,400
what they can make a difference on what they make money yeah exactly and they probably

1002
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,120
only need to support the desktop as much as it helps their own dog food in an internal

1003
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,640
uses right it's going to be great I was I've been everybody coming up at Linux we've been

1004
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,920
talking about this stuff talking about it's been a really big pot I don't think anybody's

1005
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,620
ever talked about Ubuntu as much as they did this year it in fact in years past I've actually

1006
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,960
been like where's Ubuntu this year there was a booth this year people were talking about

1007
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,600
it was a big topic of conversation and what I realized was is damn did Joe and I pick

1008
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,600
a good time to launch Linux action news yeah no kidding it's like nailed that and user

1009
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,520
error we're gonna have a bunch of discussions and this show where the mumble room and you

1010
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,120
and I can chew on this stuff like we've it's never been better time to have shows to be

1011
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,320
launching shows right now around Linux to where we can actually talk about this stuff

1012
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,960
in a way that's really appropriate for the size of the topic and all that just I think

1013
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,120
it's going to be an ongoing interesting point and we're going to be watching a massive transition

1014
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,880
by a big player and I don't think I've ever felt better about their potential I think

1015
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,100
if you step back and look what they're doing here it's going to be the most sustainable

1016
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,960
long term for that company we all were sitting here waiting for them to pull the plug on

1017
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,480
the is and it really is sad that it means it's a lot of people are losing their jobs

1018
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:28,400
and I think we'll be hearing more about that pretty soon and it's you know it is a very

1019
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,480
unfortunate aspect of this story and I don't want to underplay it because some of those

1020
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,800
folks some of us probably know and you know so there really are some ambitious things

1021
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,800
that they were trying to do that would have been awesome if they could have if they could

1022
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,440
have super like I was just talking about how awful Android is imagine if Ubuntu Touch

1023
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,560
had come along and saved us from that like there was I know I know so I don't mean to

1024
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,080
underplay that aspect of it but at the same time we were all holding our breath hoping

1025
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,240
that this thing didn't run the company into the ground because it seemed to us on the

1026
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,520
outside like it was an intractable force to to defeat right so well we can be sad or

1027
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,400
miss some of these elements it's certainly better than a world that didn't have a bunch

1028
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,800
of it all mm-hmm yeah yeah so there you go the Ubuntu desktop will remain important but

1029
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,520
it sounds like it's gonna be more developer focused if I follow with Mark's Mark who had

1030
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,520
to say I OBG Ubuntu also had a write-up on that particular aspect of the interview and

1031
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,920
I have the entire interview where Mark also talks about taking over CEO roles again and

1032
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,280
some of the products are doing specifically for OpenStack that is also available in the

1033
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,920
show notes and you can read Joey's write-up at OMG Ubuntu hey Wes you know what I do from

1034
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,000
time to time in fact I was just doing it this morning creating droplets what creating droplets

1035
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,800
Wes I'd be creating droplets like other people be creating problems I got you're not using

1036
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,120
that API that mm-hmm Wes I'm all about that API I'll tell you what to I'm all about that

1037
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,800
dashboard yeah I like that dashboard what I love about digital ocean is somebody came

1038
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,120
to me today and they're like I need to do something like you know what we could spin

1039
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,840
that up on a droplet in no time it's so nice to know that you can get started within seconds

1040
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:07,440
you can do a full support totally like installed stack with Ubuntu LTS Docker and an application

1041
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,360
ready to go or you can deploy a base system and set it up yourself beginner expert you're

1042
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,680
gonna have no problems if you're messing around in the container space and you know quote

1043
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,300
unquote messing as in probably running your entire infrastructure on it now at this point

1044
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:26,960
hey oh you got you got it you got it you got guys it's no problemo at digital ocean digital

1045
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,160
ocean honey badger about containers in a way that's epic you ever done anything like that

1046
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,440
anything anything like that craziness like oh I don't know Wes Docker LXD containers

1047
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,560
on that they're digital ocean infrastructure with the SSDs and the bandwidths and the CPUs

1048
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,200
yeah it's amazing I know it's it's amazing yeah I got next cloud going I've even got

1066
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,800
I did a little dramatic there at the end he did just for you speaking of things that are

1067
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,360
dramatic holy smokes am I excited about this Gallego Pro this thing is dramatic a dramatic

1068
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,640
design a dramatic flair look at where the power buttons that isn't that cool right on

1069
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,180
the side interesting I like it a lot so yeah I have a I've had the opportunity here at

1070
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:40,880
Linux fest Northwest to steal a Gallego Pro and get my hot grabby little hands on it so

1071
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,200
I've been trying it out for about 24 hours at this point so I'm not doing a review I'm

1072
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,360
just giving you first on first impression hands on and be an unboxing but it's already

1073
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,800
out of the box it never was in a box never was you know it's true what's true it does

1074
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,160
have quite a bit of ports which is really a crazy number of ports and I've been reliably

1075
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,500
informed that the USB-C port on this is a four PCI lane Thunderbolt USB-C port which

1076
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,320
is what you would need for for a full external GPU that would be slick yeah wouldn't that

1077
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:12,320
be interesting if that developed later on so this Gallego Pro here is I think a pre-production

1078
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,880
so I'm sort of doing like a like a like a like a early review kind of look at it and

1079
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,480
right now I've just kind of got the in bag in hand experience carrying it around for

1080
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,280
about 24 hours it's really nice because it goes right in the bag a little bit of extra

1081
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,360
room because it's you know it's like 13 not huge yeah screens really nice and vibrant

1082
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,460
I like I like the availability of the ports I'm I'm still trying to work out what the

1083
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,720
battery life is like because like I said I've just been messing around with it a little

1084
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,320
bit and I'm get I get different readings at different times so there's there's all that

1085
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,320
we just tried putting an arch on this thing so that'll be you know that looks like it

1086
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,520
woke up from suspension yeah yeah and we're gonna be of course putting Ubuntu back on

1087
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,880
this thing and putting the system 76 PPA on there and all that it's got an NVMe hard drive

1088
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,560
in there yeah yeah in fact I think it actually has capacity for a 2.5 inch as well oh that's

1089
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,440
kind of awesome two hard drives on this little thing which I think is really nice if you've

1090
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:10,940
got a bunch of clips you're editing or whatever HDMI display port USB 3.0 a and of course

1091
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:16,080
is that Ethernet uh-huh that's Ethernet right there's got a little door and they say it's

1092
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,760
their best latch yet on those you know those Ethernet ports that have the little latch

1093
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,160
on them they say it's their best their best latch you know that's not one of those features

1094
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,000
that's big for me but I you know talk about it I understand you know I understand that

1095
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,680
for some people that really is important oh my gosh I mean for me it's it's like fundamentals

1096
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,720
here because every day I'm copying gigabytes and gigabytes of footage around I think just

1097
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,400
for me like I'm okay with the like USB C or USB dock just because if I need to use it

1098
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,600
then like I'm gonna set it I don't like I'm not going to a data center where I have to

1099
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,560
go plug in some Ethernet thing but I get that people do yeah I mean that makes sense yeah

1100
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,960
if yeah if you were if you could just like if your workflow was like I'll just sit down

1101
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,240
the dock and you know but it does say a lot about system 76 that they've thought and put

1102
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,680
in the care to put that there because they understand their user base and that people

1103
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,400
really do want it yeah I mean this is essentially what I like about it is you get the advantages

1104
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,240
of a thin and light machine but no dongles required right ww you had a question is this

1105
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:20,160
part of the new systems 76 they're going to design it and make it themselves or not yet

1106
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,600
no not yet they're so they're going to do desktops first and I bet I would bet we would

1107
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:31,260
see that around the beginning of 2018 and then we will see laptops shortly or maybe

1108
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,600
depending on how it goes a little bit after that because you think about it it's two problems

1109
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,280
you have to solve right first you have to get the manufacturing plant up and going and

1110
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,400
get all the robotics and any personnel staffing that's needed things like that then you got

1111
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,840
to get once you get the supply pipeline you you kind of have to work out some of the kinks

1112
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,720
and to do your own custom laptop you then are also custom designing the motherboard

1113
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,240
and things like that and so I think they've got a they've got to work through all of those

1114
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,760
stages so this is this is from an upstream provider that they've heavily customized in

1115
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,840
fact they are the only OEM offering it in this specific configuration too so they do

1116
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,400
have an exclusive on their hands but they didn't design the all of the internal motherboard

1117
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,880
components and stuff like that yet but they do work with the with them like right now

1118
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,240
they're working on refining some of the firmware firmware cooling functionality and stuff like

1119
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:23,440
that you got to keep it cool you do yeah what'd you think of the keyboard when you were messing

1120
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,040
around with it so far it was pretty good yeah it would felt comfortable yeah I nice to type

1121
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,520
on yeah I really didn't mind it yeah I'd say the key travels actually pretty decent really

1122
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,560
especially for a laptop this thin it's got a core i7 in the thing too which is nice for

1123
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,720
a laptop of this size yeah I'm looking forward to trying this thing out and coming back with

1124
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,960
a with a full review yeah I think I'll really be curious to see especially since you've

1125
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,200
spent so much time with with X various XPS models and yeah Dell offerings and previous

1126
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,160
system 76 right yeah yeah I had a chance to play with it some to add Linux fast where

1127
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,640
they have their new theme and stuff on there yeah and so they had known three installed

1128
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,600
with their system 76 pop theme and whatnot I don't know if this is a consequence of the

1129
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,040
high dpi and the beautiful screen but the one they had at their booth at least for a

1130
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,360
little while the trackpad it was just not I think the acceleration wasn't turned up

1131
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,880
or what hadn't been tuned at all so that was a little bit like that was not the best experience

1132
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,240
that I had there so I'll be really curious what you think of it after after some time

1133
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,440
yeah wonder if they had it with a wonder if their system there had lib input or not that's

1134
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,920
yeah I'm not sure a big difference so speaking of system 76 and their gnome intentions Carl

1135
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,920
the man behind system 76 has posted essentially like a gnome manifesto if you will over on

1136
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,760
the system 76 blog and he writes home sweet gnome it's been a while but we're excited

1137
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,000
to be back and we've been playing with our new toy for the last few weeks he says they're

1138
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,280
gonna make a consistent theme that was born to desire when the desire to provide customers

1139
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,560
with a consistent experience all the way through the OS pop is bright and beautiful and very

1140
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,080
system 76 they're gonna have pop ship on their computers with a boon to in 1710 this October

1141
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,800
and they're already testing it obviously there's different things in here like they talk a

1142
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,400
little bit maybe about working with Katie connect the integrating Katie connect with

1143
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,320
gnome and potentially it sounds like he implies maybe some iOS support because he says in

1144
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,880
this post Katie connect only works with Android friends so I have to buy a new phone maybe

1145
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,800
we can do something about that kind of like hey yeah I don't know what that awesome yeah

1146
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:29,280
this though this one we got to talk about this one I'm really you know I'm not so sure

1147
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,280
about PPAs anymore I feel like the world is moving on anybody writes in here specifically

1148
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,840
a portion about PPAs you say system 76 delivers fixes themes and drivers via the system 76

1149
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,680
PPA which is a boon to his personal package archive when a book to upgrades from one distribute

1150
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,360
version from one distribution version to the next it disables PPAs the stopping customers

1151
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:58,200
from receiving updates to their products disabling makes sense for unmaintained PPAs but for

1152
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:05,640
maintained PPAs there should be a mechanism to keep them active we will submit patches

1153
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:12,460
for update manager that adds a config file to allow listed PPAs to remain active during

1154
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:18,080
a release upgrade he says that we think other OEMs partners and projects will appreciate

1155
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,600
this functionality as well the only thing is that I'm reading there which kind of sets

1156
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,640
off like a worry for me here is it sounds like they're gonna fork update manager and

1157
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,560
even if it's a small fork like but they're gonna they're gonna have their own version

1158
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,720
of update manager that checks a config file and then they will submit that upstream and

1159
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:43,000
if OEMs or Ubuntu want to take that on they can the the the issue I would have with that

1160
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:52,560
is what at what point does it stop becoming Ubuntu so if you have a PPA a persistent PPA

1161
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:59,520
that persists through upgrades and you're applying fixes and patches to it between upgrades

1162
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,160
is that still Ubuntu then is that or is that more like system 76 to which might be a good

1163
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,280
idea as well maybe that's a good idea system 76 because I I I have found that the you know

1164
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,160
in total the disabling of PPAs is a better practice than keeping them enabled between

1165
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,000
upgrades in in whole now the idea here of course the system 76 could test and fix things

1166
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,600
before they ever ship it right but it seems like you could still end up with a window

1167
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,880
where customers are jumping on board they're upgrading before the PPA is ready then they

1168
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,440
and it doesn't get properly disabled and things get broken I mean it seems like this so this

1169
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,360
is the one part of all of this strategy I'm like this seems like there could be a little

1170
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:45,380
derivative of Ubuntu happening here there could be some upgrade shenanigans but if they

1171
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,700
manage it correctly and they test it which they do a lot of testing they should be able

1172
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,440
to hammer out I'd say 90% of the issues so it should be doable but it does sort of red

1173
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,520
raise a little bit of red flag and I do understand why they why they would want that right like

1174
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,440
especially for users like yeah I'm gonna update and but don't know enough to go you know check

1175
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,940
out their PPA list or their sources list or anything like that to be like oh well why

1176
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,940
don't why don't I get the new themes or the you know whatever yeah I would wonder too

1177
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,880
I would if it would become less of a problem so it sounds like they're gonna upstream a

1178
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,880
lot of stuff mm-hmm and so if folks upstream just accepted some of these patches in then

1179
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,060
they could reduce the amount of stuff they have to shove in the PPA over time to sort

1180
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,440
of sort of negating the issue over time maybe yeah but that would depend on upstream

1181
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,520
picking them up but anyways if you're curious about what they're going with gnome this is

1182
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,200
really interesting and they they toss in some details about the pop theme which I think

1183
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,840
this is gonna be really cool to see system 76 get behind their own theme here and really

1184
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,140
do something different because it it obviously could be used by other folks that aren't using

1185
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,360
system 76 machine so you could just end up having a well-known hardware OEM that's that's

1186
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,440
keeping a theme alive that just ends up being a really well like theme on the gnome desktop

1187
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,360
which could be pretty cool too we'll see because people are liking it the pop theme

1188
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:03,400
is pretty it's pretty good it's forked from a couple of other themes from I think both

1189
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,000
a main gnome theme and also an icon theme and all that stuff I think I think we think

1190
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,200
we had details about that in a previous show but we say goodbye to unity 8 and the and

1191
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,000
the dreams of what that had and we say hello to different folks's take now on the Ubuntu

1192
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,360
gnome desktop system 76 is definitely taking a leap here because we don't we don't really

1193
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,800
even know what canonical is gonna do with their gnome yet so there we've heard more

1194
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,420
from system 76 than just about anyone else yeah they're really they're really they're

1195
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,600
really going at it full speed and you know it's more than just words because they had

1196
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,960
a gal go pro like I said at Linux fest running this stuff they're talking about right here

1197
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:45,940
so they're testing and dogfooding it at system 76 right now and I was asking folks at the

1198
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,560
booth at system 76 as they walked up like what do you think what do you think what do

1199
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,840
you think and you know different people had different takes on it obviously because it's

1200
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,880
always a taste thing it's always you know people have different opinions on that but

1201
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,760
it's definitely a very eye-catching theme and on high dpi it really looks sharp yeah

1202
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:07,080
you get a good monitor so what do you think ww interesting times ahead oh yeah I mean

1203
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:13,800
like like canonicals doing their move system 76 is kind of like going hey we're gonna up

1204
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:21,120
our game and be you know evolving how we make these things and this could be an interesting

1205
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,840
time to see how these two different companies have worked so close together either go step

1206
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,360
separately or they still work or you know things like that it'll be interesting to see

1207
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:37,880
sure yeah because what happens say if in 1804 it comes out that well we have this new Ubuntu

1208
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,840
human theme for gnome and we're really happy with it and it's got all of our energy and

1209
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,120
effort into this and this is what we think the Ubuntu desktop should look like then what

1210
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,680
system 76 gonna do I would imagine they'll probably stick with their look because now

1211
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,840
this is gonna be part of their branding switch to KDE yeah actually I think this is clever

1212
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,920
on their part is I think what their plan is if I remember right now I suppose all this

1213
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,280
is subject to change but I think they're gonna have like a login menu entry item on like

1214
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:11,160
light DM or GDM that says system 76 gnome session or stock gnome session so if you don't

1215
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,240
want any of this stuff yeah you just choose that and then you just get the whatever the

1216
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,160
stock Ubuntu gnome session is which is kind of like a kind of like a best of both worlds

1217
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,880
yeah that's a good way yeah as long as it's not confusing for people that sounds pretty

1218
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,600
nice yeah so if you have questions about the galago pro tweet me at Chris LAS and let me

1219
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,440
know what they are and I'll try to work them into see if you can get him to run a fork

1220
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,400
bomb yeah yeah maybe that's probably not what I'm gonna do but yeah I think probably I'll

1221
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,800
have it I'll probably have my review ready by the next Linux unplugged oh cool yeah I'm

1222
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,040
gonna just only gonna run arch on it for a couple of days and then I'm gonna load Ubuntu

1223
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,280
with the system 76 PPA on there and give and that'll really what the majority of the review

1224
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,240
is and I would imagine by that I'll have a better idea of laptop battery life and the

1225
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,800
other thing I want to test is what's laptop battery life before I put things like TLP

1226
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,920
on there and what's blacktop battery what kind of improvement are you able to get here

1227
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,100
and I'm not gonna I probably won't come back with like exact numbers because it's always

1228
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,760
it's so varied based on workload and it's not like I have some sort of stringent regime

1229
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,280
for battery testing so I'll just give you my impressions on it but I'll try to do my

1230
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,680
best job so we'll probably have that question for you yeah yeah sure I've got a question

1231
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,960
for you about the Gallego Pro could you please do me a favor and try and spin up the latest

1232
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,360
alpha of Trisco I think it's Trisco 8 and see what works and what doesn't because look

1233
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,400
I'm not going to use Trisco you're not going to use Trisco but if you spin it up and everything

1234
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,760
works then that's a nice warm feeling isn't it that okay it's running Libre software the

1235
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,280
graphics doesn't work if the Wi-Fi doesn't work then it tells you okay it's working in

1236
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:47,080
Ubuntu Fedora arch but it's using some binaries and then at least we'll know that a blob informal

1237
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,560
blob count yeah so put the latest Trisco on there and see what happens I can do I'll give

1238
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,120
it a spin yeah that's a good idea thanks Joe if you and of course of course if you are

1239
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,960
particularly interested join us in the mumble room next week and answer your question directly

1240
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,440
otherwise tweet me at Chris Elias I'll try to get some of them in there and if you want

1241
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:12,040
to get the pop theme I suspect there's if you're on Ubuntu on 1704 or 1604 you can get

1242
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:19,440
the pop theme in unity or known by adding their PPA now this PPA I think this PPA I

1243
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,800
think is just the pop theme but I'm not sure so just double check on all of that it's all

1244
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,640
they have all the information in the blog post as well as links to the github repo which

1245
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:34,560
I think so adaptia or adapt a was the original theme and paprias and Fira if I'm getting

1246
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,600
those names right where the upstream projects that they've sort of forked from and I think

1247
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,600
they're contributing back up to those projects also yeah so check it out we have the post

1248
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,400
in the show notes and congrats to some 76 for getting that out there and getting the

1249
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,920
galago pro close to shipping it seems like there's a lot of excitement around there there

1250
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,040
was also a lot of discussions there you know one of the other things I don't know if I

1251
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,360
mentioned it's just one more Linux fest this is like littered with throughout the show

1252
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:07,240
one more Linux fest observation was a lot of new users at Linux fest this year yeah

1253
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:13,520
wasn't that wild yeah folks it didn't yet run Linux and so as a consequence the Linux

1254
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,640
like 101 courses where the standout hit I was right as I was going out the door I talked

1255
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,280
to the Linux fest organizers and I said so what were the big you know what were the big

1256
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,120
talks what was everybody what was all the feedback and he said the 101 courses you know

1257
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:30,240
those Linux newbie courses were great and in fact while we were at the booth during

1258
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,800
those courses we had people stopping by the booth going yeah well I went to the 101 class

1259
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,240
but it's standing and people are out the door in a line and there's just there's too many

1260
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,840
people in there it's hot so I had to leave so I think they'll probably expand that next

1261
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,040
year so do you have to lay some Linux 101 on something yeah we just quizzed him real

1262
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,200
quick I said call it Linux Academy I think it's a good sign that people that were just

1263
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,560
genuinely just interested in technology but weren't yet Linux users were there there were

1264
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,760
more of everyone there was there was kids there yeah my kids include but there were

1265
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,960
more kids there this year than normal I think in my impression of course I don't have hard

1266
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,520
numbers but it seems like I've never seen as many women there as I saw which is it was

1267
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,600
a great sign and like I said new users which is a great sign and of course Brad which was

1268
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:19,200
great yeah the diverse crowd great great great presenters good booths just just a great fest

1269
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,200
overall and he said I didn't have official numbers by the time I was leaving but he said

1270
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,760
it's probably their biggest one yeah that's awesome yeah yeah and boy did it show in that

1271
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,880
Expo Hall and what oh my gosh I have to tell this story and maybe I'll try to get it in

1272
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:37,340
my vlog because it was it was so cool and I did have my vlogging camera with me but

1273
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:44,280
they had a gaming den yeah and it was the most badass gaming den I had ever seen so

1274
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,620
they they were all playing when I went up there Rocket League and so all of the machines

1275
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,800
were running Ubuntu all had Steam with Rocket League and then they had in this on the projector

1276
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,040
because it's like a big college classroom on the projector they had spectator view where

1277
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:02,640
you could see everyone playing so you could see the entire court awesome they had an elimination

1278
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,400
hierarchy scoreboard where you could see who won and who was getting eliminated and who

1279
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,240
was still the champion they had prizes they had great prizes they were giving away I mean

1280
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,320
I couldn't find the gaming den at first and I started hearing all the hooting and hollering

1281
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:20,760
I just went that direction and it was high-energy a ton of fun super well organized and you

1282
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,160
know you really go in there and you see all these folks that are new to Linux and they're

1283
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,080
just sitting down playing video games like it's no big deal like of course it that's

1284
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,540
awesome of course Steam is on here and they just sit down there's there's like you didn't

1285
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:34,640
see people going like oh what do I do they just like click the Steam icon okay Rocket

1286
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,840
League play right and they're on you know and my son Dylan sat down he just started

1287
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,400
playing he's never used Unity before he just sits downstairs playing launches Steam like

1288
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:47,880
this is so cool it was really the face we want to put up for new users like good effort

1289
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,320
look a fun spirited they also had a robotics area where school kids have been building

1290
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:58,840
robots and they have this robot that shot balls and ran a Raspberry Pi that was running

1291
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:04,000
Linux that did the optical image recognition so we could recognize objects in real time

1292
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,080
and so it was a remote-controlled robot that would go and have some autonomy for a short

1293
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,280
period of time while it recognized objects and then return control back to the remote

1294
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,080
user built by freaking students and up there up there own in one of the rooms up at Linux

1295
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,320
Fest on the second floor so there was really cool stuff tucked around too it was neat and

1296
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,160
Sunday was way busier than any past Sunday and yeah it was like a whole other Saturday

1297
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,240
we had we had a ton of people watch Linux action show live it was a good experience

1298
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,960
you know I went to one of the last talks in the day and there were still like you know

1299
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,440
they're starting to take down the booths and stuff but there were still tons of people

1300
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,240

1305
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,240

1318
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:49,480
so did you did you hear the big news the big news with Amazon echo and Alexa you can use

1319
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,400
your voice to play music control smart home devices and get news and information yeah

1320
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:01,600
and now introducing the newest member of the family Amazon echo show hi there this is Doug

1321
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,040
first time dad yeah we'll stop there because it's just starts getting patronizing after

1322
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:11,120
that but did you see the news the yeah what do you think of the echo show Wes it looks

1323
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,440
kind of I can see why they're doing it I don't know that I'm interested in it yeah they really

1324
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,880
push the video calling really really pushing that and I'm like okay is there a time where

1325
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,080
video calling is ever actually gonna become like a thing that people do a lot I don't

1326
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,600
know I mean ever I actually think I think FaceTime actually is pretty it's pretty successful

1327
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,200
you know if you're gonna go for that but yeah I know it's like I can see it for a long you

1328
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:36,000
know family people you see infrequently yeah meetings yeah sure but like for day to day

1329
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,920
I don't know they also introduced something else kind of new which I actually am excited

1330
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:46,440
about because I've got a couple of these devices and this is supposedly rolling out today Alexa

1331
01:12:46,440 --> 01:13:08,440
call dad again calling dad oh boy what did you do Alexa answer Alexa hang up calling

1332
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,480
through the echo devices is actually kind of useful because I've got some here in the

1333
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,600
studio I've got some and they also have a messaging feature so you know it doesn't have

1334
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,960
to be a call you can leave a message for specific individuals and it'll play that's actually

1335
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,340
not a bad feature I think so people that are people and the thing is is again Amazon builds

1336
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,800
this lady in a tube once and sells it to you and then they just keep piling these services

1337
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:34,400
that is their way isn't it whoo welcome to the future West what actually other Alexa

1338
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,160
devices right for the yeah oh yeah yeah of course yeah but they're Alexa send message

1339
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:47,200
to link to map for like what I can't find it products for gorilla masks yeah I mean

1340
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:54,760
there's gonna be weirdness about it but the the thing about the whole echo strategies

1341
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:59,920
the echo themselves are Amazon's versions of the Alexa enabled product but there are

1342
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,880
many other products like GE just launched a lamp a really cool looking expensive lamp

1343
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:10,280
that but so cool like you kind of would want it that also oh by the way has Alexa built

1344
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:37,080
into it right cancel
