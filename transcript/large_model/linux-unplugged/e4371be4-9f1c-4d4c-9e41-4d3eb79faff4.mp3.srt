1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Okay, here's my question before you go on a trip

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,520
Do you have like a gadget regime that you follow like you gotta charge the laptop gotta charge the tablet gotta charge the phone

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,960
Gotta charge the watch now like there's this whole series of crap gotta sync over

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,920
My audiobooks and my podcast any files I want to watch like there's this process you have to go the prospect of being unplugged

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,000
From the internet for more than you know an accidental 10 minutes. It's just foreign now, right?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,480
Well, like, you know, I like flew to Hawaii reasons like okay six hours. No internet. What do I do for this?

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,340
I can't read the blogs. I read I can't listen to podcasts unless I plan ahead. Yeah, I feel like an animal exactly

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,840
Yeah, now I know poppy. I know you just made the the trip though a road trip

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,880
Did you do any pre road trip gadget planning? Did you like go through and charge all the devices?

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,040
Did you sync up podcast? What what was your pre road trip in resume regime? I I did

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,400
Yeah, say Martin trumped any preparation I did because when I got into his car

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,800
There was a wireless access point in his

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
And there were like USB cables all over the place

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
There were sweets in every door pocket and drinks for every passenger

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,360
So it doesn't matter what I say. He's done ten times more than I did

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,220
Now now, okay wimpy, please now

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,320
Is this normally how your vehicle is set up?

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
Or did you know there's gonna be a bunch of nerds sitting in my vehicle. I better give them some connections

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,360
I made I made two changes to the usual regime. So there is always Wi-Fi in the car

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
So it is a mobile hotspot

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,160
But the change I did make is and there's always a thinkpad

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Power adapter in the car as well

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,800
Of course, hope he did hope he did contact me beforehand and say is your power adapter compatible with my laptop?

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Which it was it was kind of fun watching Popey SSH ing into things as we were bombing up and down the motor

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,440
One of those cars that when you get to a junction that the engine cuts and then starts itself when you put away no

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,320
Every time it did that because the power right?

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
So my laptop's going dude

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Every time he pulls away like yes thinkpad. I'm charging. No, I'm not yes

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
I am noise. Yeah, that was fun

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,600
So yeah, the only changes I made is I added extra USB charging points

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:29,940
So the passengers in the back had I think three USB charging points and us in the front we had

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,280
Five and a laptop charger and that was different from usual and then luxury drinks the sweets and drinks

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
That was that was new but that's because we were doing a five-hour journey

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,600
And I knew that will get cranky if I didn't you know fill them up with chocolate. This is very true

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,960
This is very true the console of my vehicle from the road trip still has chocolate in there

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,680
Steak bites like it's an emergency go-to bag and you know one of the vehicle one of the reasons

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
I got the current vehicle was because it has a C plugs in it. Oh nice

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,240
Yeah, so actual power plugs is fair as well

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,620
Yeah, there was there was a point during the road trip where Noah and I were working on the power in the rover

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,280
So we have the power off in the rover

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,780
And I literally pulled the truck up next to the rover turned it on and plugged in his soldering iron to the truck

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,060
With the AC plug, so it's very valuable. Yeah, it's a mess though of cables

43
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,100
It just makes for a mess of cables when you're traveling around

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Your US power sockets, they're not

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Real not not man-sized

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,360
No, they're definitely not there no plug with plugs

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,680
You would definitely not want to stay no and then and do you now do you over there?

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,640
Do you have like did you have plugs that are called like cute things like pigtail and things like that?

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,920
Cuz we have pigtails over here when we need like 30 amps and things like that

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,440
And so we have really cute names for all of our plugs. Do you guys have those?

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,520
I think that's very much an American thing. We do we do have names. We do have names for the plug

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Shapes, but not for the capacities. So we've got the cloverleaf connectors all plugs. Yeah, yeah

53
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,800
They don't carry a different capacity they're all 13 amp plugs, yeah, they're all man-sized

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
13 amps

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,800
I need 30, please. I need 30. I got I got stuff to plug in here

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,000
I got oh, well, you can you can get big ones the standard is 13 amps and 240 volts. Oh, okay

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah that 240 volts. That's no joke. That's legit. No, it's not that's legit

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,180
This is Linux unplugged episode 118 for November 10th 2015

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:05:02,180
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's hoping to avoid that hands-on TSA experience. My name is Chris. And my name is Wes. Don't touch me, Chris. Don't touch me. There are rules.

60
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,380
You know, the only reason I say that really is because I'm about to jump on a plane

61
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,780
I'm about to fly over and see system 76 in Denver. Oh boy, is that exciting? Colorado

62
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,540
I know we don't know exactly yet about like meetup details, but I'm hoping we have a meetup

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,540
But the thing is I have like weird things like I have like stabilizer poles in my bag. I have cameras

64
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,260
I have wires. So we should expect a lot out of this trip. That's what you're telling us. No, I'm telling you

65
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,180
I think I'm gonna get groped by the security. Yeah, that's what I'm telling you

66
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,700
All right. Well coming up on this week's episode of the Linux action show. Oh, but who's that?

67
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,620
42.1 is out. We're gonna talk about the new leap release and of course Wes and I have had a chance to use Ubuntu

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,500
Mate 15.10 in the real world. We'll give you our follow-ups on that. We're gonna wrap up on Fedora 23 this week

69
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,340
There's been some interesting things developing there and then later on in the show

70
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,500
We'll talk about new ransomware that targets Linux systems

71
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,060
It's kind of ridiculous, but there's already a fix out in the works. We got details on that and then

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
There's some drama in

73
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,740
In the Debian world again. I know it's not about systemd this time

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,860
Okay, and actually this one is maybe it matters more to end-users than even the systemd debate did

75
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,700
We'll talk about that coming up on this week's episode of Linux unplugged Wes

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,060
We have so much to cover. We have so much to get into

77
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,280
So why don't we immediately without any further delay bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greens mumble room

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,760
All right, well, I'm I am really pumped about episode 118 today because we have a ton of topics to cover a lot of

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Distro things to discuss so let's kick off the distro things with one Richard Brown

80
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:41,080
Open Susa's or I believe Sousa's chairman. I forget it was a very it was a very very cool title the chairman of open Sousa

81
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,520
Mr. Richard Brown, which are tell us more our Brown welcome to the show

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,760
Thank you very much. Yeah, and it's it's chairman of open Sousa

83
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:56,240
But Sousa paid for me my salary, so okay, okay, so technically the Sousa company pays your paycheck

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,720
But you're the chairman of the open Sousa distribution, which honestly is way cooler than the CEO or any other

85
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,440
Definitely chairman is awesome. So I

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Richard welcome to Linux unplugged and today is a pretty cool week because open Sousa 42.1

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Leap shipped and it's like Linux, but not like we've seen it before

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Are you guys totally pumped over there at open Sousa right now?

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, and the the feedback's been amazing. I mean we were trying something really different here for people who don't know

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,560
you know, we've got the effectively the code base from Susan it's enterprise so the enterprise distribution and

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,480
We started with that but then rather than just copy and paste

92
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,160
We started with that but then rather than just copying it and you know shipping that as our own

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,760
We've built a whole new platform on top of it

94
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,360
and and this and this is something that we've almost have as Linux users have

95
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,320
fantasized about and it almost seems impossible and it is this idea that you take a core you take the core Linux OS and

96
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,680
You make it stable you make it you make it secure you make it predictable

97
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,440
But then as an end user you get you get all of the trappings of nice updated end-user applications and things like that

98
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,080
You can get the latest things that are important to you. Yeah, you know, you know the small things like that

99
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,360
Colonel or x-breaking. Yeah, you look things like Thunderbird Chrome your steam packages things like that and

100
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
now

101
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
that is one thing to say is actually gonna happen, but

102
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,600
How how what is the long-term plan to actually deliver on

103
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
That how did how does openSUSE elite plan to actually?

104
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Make that happen

105
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Well part of it's all thanks to the the tooling we already have so things like the build service

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Which make it really easy for us to do this kind of heavy

107
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
tricky engineering

108
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,640
So that the trick going forward is we're gonna do leap minor releases aligned with the the SLE service pack

109
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
so as they move forward will move forward and

110
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,520
And for each of those minor releases, which are expected about once per year

111
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,360
I expect to see most of that user space stuff kind of jumping up catching up with what's

112
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
common standard there

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,400
With suzer taking care of the base system underneath as part of the enterprise stuff

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,580
Now Richard what happens when something comes along that says this is

115
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,600
This is the new standard. This is something we want to do and it requires

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,320
XYZ be updated. Is there a process in which a maintainer can step up and say I'm going to make sure that these

117
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,400
Libraries and this this end-user package are the latest version even though it doesn't quite track what what's less is doing

118
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,440
Exactly. I mean that that's happened a few times already with this version of leap. We actually did it with the kernel as well

119
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,400
So we had a real big bit of community feedback that you know

120
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,720
They wanted the 4.1 kernel in there something newer than what SLE has. So yeah, we've done that already. I

121
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,640
expected probably hit a few more things again with 42.2, but

122
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,600
Also, we're seeing on the enterprise side because we're doing this they're a little bit braver about some other stuff

123
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,600
They're talking about for service back to so that's awesome. We we know they might be moving a little bit faster

124
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,760
We might have a little bit less of that kind of thing to hit them

125
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,880
We were expecting when we started this a year ago. So I mean so far I've mostly talked about this in the context of the

126
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,240
desktop and why it seems compelling to me as a desktop distribution, but

127
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,040
is there also a bit of a

128
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Server answer here. Could this be maybe somebody who wants to have some fairly modern up-to-date?

129
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,500
Front-end packages of things like maybe sync thing

130
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,980
Plex, MB, stuff like that, but also then also have something that doesn't have a ton of kernel changes and whatnot. Is there

131
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,560
Do you see a role for openSUSE leap in the server position or is that clearly still defined for SLES?

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,900
What's your thoughts there?

133
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,380
If definitely totally yes, I mean as part of this release

134
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,340
We actually tied it up all of the server patterns and installation options

135
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,540
We have in leap so that they're a lot more straightforward and easy to get done

136
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,140
And yeah, I mean there's there's a big server

137
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,860
Market out there that that doesn't really fit leap doesn't really fit sleep

138
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,060
So, you know that there's not really too much concern from the SUSE business side, you know

139
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,020
We're going a different direction. We're gonna appeal to a different audience. So it's yeah, we're looking forward to seeing how that works out

140
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,680
One of the things that I think I've noticed that Ubuntu has had to figure out with their LTS releases

141
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
and I think they've done it pretty gracefully is

142
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,440
the the updates to the kernel to do hardware enablements as they call them and

143
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
one of the things that I I hear

144
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,640
consistent

145
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
consistently Richard is

146
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,400
And it happens about right now and Wes knows I'm about to say is

147
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,560
Ubuntu 1404 is starting to feel real old and he and I know of a couple of examples of people who wanted to go

148
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,640
with the LTS release but bailed because it's just simply it's too out of date now and

149
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:59,520
I it seems like the LTS updates are and to Ubuntu and the slash service packs are on about the same schedule

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,920
So what what how can leap avoid this problem where some of the base system starts to become?

151
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,920
Honestly a little stale and so things like, you know steam games start to suffer or new hardware support or

152
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,280
Honestly, even things like installing the latest versions of Java and flash to play Minecraft and what and do hangouts become complicated

153
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,720
What's what's leap solution to that?

154
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,000
well

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,480
The sleet service pack thing is moving up to about an annual release schedule now and and

156
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,840
Hardware enablement is a big part of what suzer do in those service packs

157
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,020
So we'll be benefiting from that plus, you know

158
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,880
Probably doing some of our own as well for the specific hardware that our community is interested in

159
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
So yeah

160
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,240
We we did with that that that should kind of be the bread and butter that every year when we do a minor release of leap

161
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,760
Hardware enablement should be there every time keeping this whole thing fresh

162
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,320
And would that be when I get say a new version of GTK or would that come at a different point in update in the update?

163
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
cycle

164
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
We're really expecting kind of the big things like a new num release in UK

165
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,920
Do you release to be sort of synchronized all around those annual service packs?

166
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,240
We're going to be doing so releases as we're saying so essentially I get one new version of GTK a year

167
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,320
One new version of QT a year and those kinds of things

168
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah, the open suzer packaging policy isn't necessarily that strict

169
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,440
So if there's like a nice compelling reason for us to push that out to the maintenance update during the life cycle of 42.1

170
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,120
We can we might but there has to be a reason because the last thing we want to do is break things now

171
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,240
how do you know down the road in all intents and purposes is there going to be a

172
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,560
A 42.2 and a 42.3 or is this essentially a continuously updating?

173
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
Installation that I'm going to have that will never

174
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,360
It's always just going to like 42.1 is always going to be the latest and whatever you install is just going to continually be updated

175
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,000
How does this work? And what is my upgrade path long term? I?

176
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,200
Don't know if you want a nice rolling release. That's what we have tumbleweed for. So that's your single installation that you can upgrade

177
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,840
So if 42.1 will have 42.2 next year

178
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,480
the upgrade path will be as simple as a zippered up so our equivalent of a

179
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
apt distribution upgrade and

180
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
So, you know, we're expecting that to be nice and simple

181
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,200
You can also do it offline if you feel like doing it the old-fashioned way over USB stick or a DVD

182
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
That's good

183
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,120
Yeah, and so yeah, we're expecting these to do one of these service packs every year

184
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,640
Then when Slee do sleep 13 a few years from now, that's when we're expecting 43.0

185
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Which will be sort of a big

186
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
huge

187
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,920
Change everything

188
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,520
Probably based on wherever tumbleweed is around about that time. Okay

189
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,080
So that'll be in line with what the sues are doing with the the big enterprise really send as well

190
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,080
This sounds like it's the way you describe it. It's kind of a unique little space in the Linux

191
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,040
Yeah, it does seem different and I and I look at this and I ask so I guess Richard my next question would be if

192
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm if I'm Frank

193
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,880
from own cloud or if I'm somebody who's making say a telegram server replacement or

194
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,680
You know, maybe plaques or whatever if I'm creating software for the Linux server or the Linux desktop

195
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,320
How do I as a software vendor say we are compatible with XYZ version of open?

196
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,700
Sousa leap, how can I how can I clearly?

197
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,360
Differentiate for the end user so that way they know it's gonna work on leap or not

198
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,720
What's what is so because of the reason I ask you is because it seems like one two years down the road there could be

199
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,680
Some installations of leap or something does work and some installations with leap or things don't work

200
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,500
So what's kind of the thoughts there to make it clear to end users if you know

201
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,060
Something's gonna work on your version of open Sousa say nine months from now

202
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,060
The cleanest simplest way would be I'd recommend that all of these vendors like we're already in discussion

203
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
for example with own cloud about doing this of

204
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,260
of either put your stuff in our distribution or use the build service where

205
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Building it for all for whatever variation someone might have is just a button click away

206
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,540
Nice because we're not expecting any major heavy architectural stuff

207
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,660
So if you want to be extra sure that the thing is built for you know

208
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,420
Every variation of leap that should just be nice and simply done in the OBS

209
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,740
Wouldn't that be wouldn't that be great if we could get just everybody using that that seems that would be really something

210
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,020
So if you don't mind Richard, I would love to shift gears and for just a second and talk about

211
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,180
Well for a few seconds and talk about tumbleweed. So what is

212
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,180
If I'm looking at really today, you know and and really and let's talk about 2016, too

213
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,340
I'm looking at my options as an open Sousa user and I'm looking at tumbleweed it seems like and I'm looking at leap

214
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,540
I got two different things in front of me. I

215
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,420
Feel like maybe because I'm an arch user today if I was gonna make a switch to Sousa

216
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,820
Maybe I want to go tumbleweed and I actually kind of want to ask you straight up

217
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,880
What why would I not go tumbleweed?

218
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,500
And why would I go leap? Like what's the downside to going tumbleweed if there's two different versions of Sousa?

219
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,540
What is what is leap giving me that say tumbleweed isn't?

220
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,540
It leaps giving you a slower pace of change. It's really down to like what Linux is comfortable for you

221
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,780
You know, the thing we find is tumbleweed is you know, we've tackled those technical problems. It's stable. It works

222
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,340
You can rely on it

223
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,620
But it's changing at whatever the pace upstreams are and we have feedback from my users saying like ah

224
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,440
I didn't want to relearn my entire workflow this week

225
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,360
So, you know tumbleweed if you're if you're one of these guys who likes whatever upstreams are doing

226
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,560
Tumbleweed is fine great use it

227
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,020
But at the same time in certain use cases or just depending on how you are you want something that changes less often

228
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
That's what leaps going for

229
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,860
That's a kind of you know, the two complementary approaches really? Yeah

230
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,920
So if and and and also maybe if I was a if I was the administrator of a couple of Sousa Enterprise Linux servers

231
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,520
Or even more than a couple. Yeah leap would probably be a pretty good desktop for me

232
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
Seems like yes

233
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:07,100
Yeah, I mean I'm actually running tumbleweed and leap on my servers and kind of comparing at the moment and yeah, so um

234
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,980
I think was like three weeks ago

235
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,360
We did a review of open Sousa leap 42.1 release candidate in the Linux action show

236
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,180
And now I want to put a call out to the Linux unplugged audience and their virtual lug

237
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,820
If you would like to talk more about open Sousa leap

238
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,280
Let us know in the comments at linuxactionshow.reddit.com for episode 118 of Linux unplugged show

239
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,940
Would you like to have a dedicated segment where we discuss leap?

240
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,000
I would I would like to see how you guys are actually experiencing using it

241
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,920
Setting things up like telegram and her upad and steam and chrome and how is all of this going?

242
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,000
You know the everyday livability elements. Yes, and and what is what exactly what has been your experience?

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,160
So we've got a we've got a bond. We got a couple volunteers from the mumble room today West

244
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,840
You're gonna give it a go thing and let's next week Richard

245
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,440
Would you mind joining us again next week at this time and we'll kind of do a roundtable discussion of actually using leap for the last

246
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,840
couple weeks

247
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,600
Sounds awesome

248
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Yeah outside of this. Yeah. All right, so I would love to hear it and kids and kitty

249
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You had something you want to chime in with?

250
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,360
Yeah, I was actually gonna ask the question about the inclusion of gnome

251
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,040
316 in leap versus 318

252
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,080
Why go with 316 if 318 is going to be supported for a longer time?

253
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,180
318 came at a weird time during our development process. So we were like, okay, we could accept it

254
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,000
But there's an element of risk of you know, maybe we're not gonna get all the patches in in time, you know

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
318 2 isn't quite out yet

256
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,480
So so we wanted to make sure that you know what we shipped as leap

257
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
We're happy maintaining for a year

258
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Is there a possibility that?

259
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,960
318 might come as a service pack update. I

260
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,520
Can I can be pretty sure that I expect 320 next year? Oh

261
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Okay. Yeah

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,740
So 316 is what ships today, which you know as far as that goes that's also what 1510 is shipping with right?

263
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,280
So not not horrible like as far as wider adoption

264
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,880
But it does feel like a year is a long time to wait

265
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,140
But then again, I guess if you're gonna wait 320 is the one to wait for and at least it's kind of a consistent

266
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,000
You know, all right, once a year you get the new upgrades. I can wrap my head around that I can plan around that

267
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah, I I like that a lot actually

268
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,980
So and then last but not least Richard, I know that there was a big event that just wrapped up for Sousa

269
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,440
Do you want to mention anything about that? Oh, yes

270
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah, the big company party in Amsterdam. Sorry conference

271
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Look like a party

272
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,700
It's Amsterdam. I mean what what kind of conference has beer served during the last keynote?

273
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,980
I mean that was just awesome. If you watch the YouTube videos, they had beer as a service and and they had yeah

274
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,420
That's amazing. You know just an aside really quick. Yeah, I got to say the open Sousa booth

275
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:03,140
When we had Linux con here in Seattle was given out free not only given out free beers, but beer koozies open Sousa beer koozies

276
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,000
Respect. So how did Sousa conga or how was the event overall?

277
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,060
The biggest we've seen by far way more customers than we used to having lots more partners lots of really interesting

278
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,700
It's mainly an enterprise conference. I mean the fact that open Sousa was there and we were launching leap was a little bit

279
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,220
weirder than usual

280
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,340
so

281
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,460
Yeah, it was it was not but it was really nice actually seeing that that collaboration between the two and like having a whole

282
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,100
Bunch of people come up to me and say like hey, we're we're running people ready. We're running tumbleweed

283
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,700
We want to know what you're doing with open QA. So it's like it's

284
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,660
You quite often see in other communities like there's a big

285
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,940
Bridge but a big divide between the enterprise guys and the community guys and and it was really nice to see that kind of just

286
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
completely disappearing last week

287
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,500
and of course

288
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,820
major props to you guys

289
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,020
Again, you've done another music video this year and it has been massively successful online

290
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,300
This is kind of ridiculous. But should I play a little bit of it? Should we as we wrap up?

291
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,100
Should I play a little bit of this? Let's see it. Alright, so we'll play a little bit of this

292
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,180
This is uptime funk, which interview sis admins are gonna love

293
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,740
My manager's mad it ain't pretty I need caffeine a big screen gotta fix the server and it's it's too hot

294
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,900
Cartouro boys and core hard man, it's too hot

295
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,100
Make a sis admin retire man. It's too hot

296
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,260
Holy cow, am I in the gym? It's too hot

297
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:09,420
Hot patch tell me get now it ain't funny service bad live patching. Hallelujah live patching. Hallelujah. Ooh, that's not a

298
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
Louie, yeah

299
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,260
Uptime funk. I'll give it to you cuz uptime funk. I'll give it to you cuz uptime funk. I'll give it to you

300
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
Don't reboot it just patch

301
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,660
Yeah, that was a huge hit so you guys can check that out online

302
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,140
So it sounds like it was a good event and good on you guys too for doing

303
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,180
For spending the time and the effort on that music video. That was really funny. Yeah. Yeah, and the money too

304
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,740
Yeah, that was a lot of fun. So alright. Well, I Richard we look forward to talking to you next week

305
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,980
be sure to join us and

306
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,900
Linux action show to reddit.com if you want to give us your thoughts on leap and then

307
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,800
Really if you want to double down on that and you're serious if you want to advocate this Gabriel 3

308
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm talking to you if you really want to talk about this

309
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,220
Come join our mumble room. We have a virtual log. It's open to you. You can participate think of it like this

310
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Back in the day before the internet was a thing if you are a Linux user and you wanted to advocate one distro to another

311
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,740
You would go to what these things were called Linux user groups. You had to go outside. It was horrible. Yeah

312
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,660
You had to go to like this place. There was probably like a school or something library. Who knows?

313
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,140
Yeah, yes, and then you had to go in there and you had to convince other people

314
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:24,100
well, that's what our mumble room is if you go to jblive.tv you do bang mumble and you'll be able to get our address and

315
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,020
Yeah, this there is an outside kids and kitty. There is an outside and I'd love you have a come in here tomorrow

316
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,660
Or I'm sorry tomorrow. Yeah, come in here tomorrow. No, that's next week. Come here next week and tell us about your thoughts on

317
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,220
OpenSUSE elite. I'd love to really hear how it's going for you

318
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,900
All right

319
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,060
So before we go any further and we have so much show to get into I want to talk about digital

320
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,220
ocean digital ocean is a simple cloud host provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your

321
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,420
Own Linux reg or freeBSD and here's the thing. I

322
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,960
Need you to use the promo code do unplugged. I need it. I need it. Like I need a chicken pot pie

323
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,860
Have you ever had the KFC chicken pot pies? Oh, no, I have not. Are you serious?

324
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,700
I haven't I know what I'm doing after the show

325
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, so when you leave the studio here, there is a KFC on the corner there

326
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,300
Here's what I want you to do. What's the setup now?

327
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Here's what they do is they put an amazing pie crust on the top and then it's a tin bottom, right?

328
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,380
And so it's not too much carbs and it's tons of good chicken, but you get that right? Yes

329
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,820
You can still get a little crisp in there and a lot of good protein and there's some good veggies in there, too

330
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,380
And what I just described also applies to digital ocean. It's exactly the same. It is the same thing

331
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,100
It's a high protein content use the promo code do unplugged do

332
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:41,420
Unplugged one word lowercase because everything's lowercase like a boost and you'll get a $10 credit over a digital ocean calm

333
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,060
You can start in less than 55 seconds because their system is cray and pricing plans start only five dollars a month

334
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,660
five dollars a month

335
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,500
which is a 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte a

336
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
freaking terabyte of

337
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Transfer and digital has data some locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore Amsterdam, London, Germany and a brand new one

338
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:10,340
Because f the NSA in Toronto, I mean they didn't say that I am saying that they're not saying that it's not digital ocean thing

339
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
f the NSA and

340
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,220
They yeah, you know what? You know what? That's right

341
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,500
F the NSA and the value of this is negative so they got new data centers in Toronto

342
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,240
You go over there use the promo code do unplugged one word lowercase you get a $10 credit

343
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,020
You can try it all over their rigs. They run Linux. They're on top of KVM

344
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,780
They have SSD drives everywhere everywhere. It's nice

345
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,620
They got 40 gigabit e connections and their newest data centers is so sweet and their interface is like

346
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,560
The bestest of all of the interfaces. It is really good when I started in

347
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,040
Virtualization West. Okay. Now you probably use VMware or something right in the past. I have yes

348
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,880
Have you ever used VMware server where it was in the web page? No, I have not

349
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh god, this is such a travesty of humanity. It is the worst. Okay. All right, it is now boxes, man

350
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm tight with boxes

351
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, I can get down with that if you want to do some local emulation like an animal man boxes is awesome

352
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
But when you want something up in the cloud, I mean, yeah, honestly

353
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,440
Honestly digital oceans UI is better than boxes. Oh, yeah hashtag just saying

354
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,040
It's one of the best you eyes. I don't know. Yeah, every should I say it ever?

355
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,680
I think you should because I'll tell you why you get HTML 5 console, right?

356
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,000
You get all this stuff. You can you can choose between your data centers. You can transfer you get the snapshots

357
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,840
You get the one-click deployments. You can use Docker like a pro even though you don't know what I'm talking about

358
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,600
You don't have to know you don't cuz there's tutorials for that man

359
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,940
They have some tutorials use the promo code do unplug check out the interface check out that API

360
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,760
Which makes a bunch of open source apps possible and by the way speaking of their community because I didn't speak of their community

361
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,080
But I am now it is tight. They have some really good tutorials, you know, because they're willing to pay for them

362
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,400
It turns out that if something's valuable you should pay for it

363
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,240
I know right anyways talk to Linus. So anyways, they pay for the tutorials, right?

364
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,400
And this is really something they've hired multiple editors and you know a

365
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,840
Little background you ready for this? I don't know a little exclusive info just between you and me

366
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,040
Don't tell the audience help anyone. I don't think do wants us getting out

367
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,440
So this was the first podcast they started talking about their tutorials online and how you could write and make some money

368
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,120
Yep, this was the right here, right here and they got such a like crazy response

369
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,760
That they ended up having to hire two extra people after running the spot on the show

370
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
That's awesome. Isn't that cool? Because they have work guys

371
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,360
Yeah

372
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,800
I know the JB community

373
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,000
Freaking rocks and they're writing really good tutorials like this one right here how to run nginx on the docker container

374
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,800
Using a boon to 1404 right there use the promo code deal unplugged you support the show you get a $10 credit boom

375
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,480
It's magic digital ocean comm big. Thanks digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged. It's awesome

376
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:54,760
All right, Wes, so you and I had a chance to try out a boon to matei 1510

377
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,680
Now you ran it for yourself. Yes, I did. Okay, I installed it for my girlfriend Hadia

378
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,380
Oh for her first Linux computer and I got her a new machine cuz her computer

379
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,480
She had an HP and it totally this is actually kind of a funny story

380
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
I should probably just a real

381
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,580
Detail Chris her her HP had like these metal metal trimmings on it. And whenever you touched the metal the computer would shut off. Oh my god

382
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,560
So I was like

383
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,040
And she uses this computer to run her business, right?

384
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,200
And so like I mean I'm talking like booking because she runs her own practice

385
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,840
Booking, you know all the accounting stuff messaging and of course any kind of like notes and anything like that

386
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,480
She have to take on her patients goes into this computer and this computer when you touch the metal turns off

387
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,520
I'm like go to Best Buy go get the yoga 3 because you had to get a computer that day, right and

388
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
You know have a business

389
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,880
Exactly. So day one I get the computer. We don't even put into Windows

390
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,000
I install integrals and I'm like boom. Look at this. This is the gnome 3 desktop. It's awesome. It's wonderful

391
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,080
Except for the Broadcom wireless didn't work. Oh, and I could have got it working because we got it working for Angie's machine

392
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
I mean, I could have done it but I

393
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,760
I let it sit for a while and I went on the road trip and all this kind of stuff and then I got

394
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
back and I realized

395
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,720
There were 384 updates like I just this wasn't something I wanted to manage

396
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,280
Yep, and so and you didn't want to be at fault. It was literally

397
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,280
Yes, yeah, and it was literally like

398
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,680
Two days after we talked about the episode where it was like that what's new mate

399
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,120
You know that where wimpy basically just sold the shit out of me on on using the food to protect good job wimpy

400
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,740
And so I was like, all right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'm installing this right now

401
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,880
This is gonna solve my problems and I deployed Ubuntu mate on her you deployed it. Yeah, I did. Well, that's how I talk

402
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Yeah, cuz cuz I'm enterprise. Yeah

403
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:55,360
So I deployed Ubuntu mate following my standard deployment procedure that I thought which is a which is the installation

404
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,400
But with all of the stuff on the bottom of the screen

405
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,200
So I got the menu on the bottom of the screen. I got all the apps on the bottom of the screen

406
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,360
I forget which config that was called in the leap. That's Redmond. Yes. I think it was Redmond. Yeah, it's very good

407
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,960
I chose the Redmond config and mate tweak. Thank you wimpy for including that and then I went to town welcome

408
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,000
And it really you know that really got me started fast and I'd like to the advanced menu is there too

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So I could use that if I wanted but I opted not to

410
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Here's the thing Wes

411
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
There was three apps out of the gate. I had to install

412
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
Spotify, okay

413
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Telegram yep

414
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Scrivner cuz it's it's

415
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,440
Namo ramo or whatever. It's called. What's that called? I don't know. What's that in that nine more ammo? What's that?

416
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,120
Come on guys. What's that right? It's this the writing month right now and Scrivner is the big. Oh, I see what you're saying

417
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,880
Yeah, Scrivner is the big app everybody got it. So I I

418
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:53,160
In each single freaking app. I had to go bend over backwards to get it working really so for Telegram

419
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,040
I don't it was a bit of a process, but it wasn't that bad

420
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Spotify though was the real SOB

421
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:06,680
Spotify I if I recall I had to go get an encryption library from a Debian repo pull it down and install and I wouldn't I

422
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
What I do wrong

423
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,240
Yes, which which version of Ubuntu Marte did you 1510?

424
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I went through the welcome screen and I installed minecraft using the welcome screen and then and then yeah

425
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,160
But then telegram didn't you didn't fancy installing telegram or Spotify through the welcome screen. Was that in there? Yeah

426
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes, they are. That would have saved me some time

427
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,520
and and

428
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Navigates all of those hurdles you're about to describe. Oh

429
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,760
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are you serious? How did I not see that?

430
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,100
There's a lot of options in the welcome screen. So yeah in a good way

431
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,480
Now that the other one you mentioned Scrivner, I've not heard of so that's new Scrivner is like it's like a it's like a book

432
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
writing screen writing program and

433
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,640
It's for people who want to write they have a beta out for Linux. There's I don't think there's a repo or anything like that

434
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,520
I think there's just some deb files you can download or a tar. GZ, right?

435
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,720
And so that that did also require some libraries, but you know apt cache search and all that and I got it pretty quick

436
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
but

437
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,040
For me that was that all that all took, you know, what 30 minutes? Yes top

438
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,320
So it wasn't that big of a deal. You've done it before. Yeah, not a big deal

439
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,000
I

440
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,080
What has been what has what what has been to beach what has turned out to be challenging?

441
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,480
Has been the small things that you wouldn't really think of really and today today while I'm driving

442
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
That's why this one jumps out at me was

443
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,260
So I got Chrome installed and then when Chrome launches

444
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,600
About about eight seconds after Chrome launches the you know

445
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,640
The the prompt that comes up that says enter your key ring password enter the master key ring password a default application

446
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,240
Requires access to the key ring and enter your master password and then in the title bar says key ring or something like that

447
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,880
Okay, like I I in fact, hold on West standby one

448
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,840
Let's pull this up because this act of this this matters here. So we go here. I got the screenshot this morning

449
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,040
Boom, it says enter password for key ring

450
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:13,520
The key ring default key ring quote to unlock an application wants to access the key ring default key ring, but it's locked enter

451
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,660
Password and the title bar says unlock key ring. Yep. I got it now

452
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,080
I got this on telegram because the question was is the hell is this and is this okay?

453
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,800
and is this why I can't save my files in Scrivner and

454
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
It is just these weird

455
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,960
wordings of applications like that enter password for key ring default key ring to unlock doesn't make any sense

456
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,040
And so any user who's actually painted the screen that you're describing. What's that?

457
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:45,880
Well, you know and recognize the screen you're describing what it is in the application that uses the gnome key ring or the gt

458
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,360
Whatever the so it's chrome chrome has saved usernames and passwords and it stores them in the key ring

459
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,200
And so when you launch chrome the key ring prompt comes up now

460
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,240
That to me is normal because I know I'm unlocking the key ring where the passwords are stored, but to Hadeah

461
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,480
This was like I went to a website and I and all of a sudden now it's asking me enter a password

462
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,160
This feels like fishing now props to her for being cognizant enough to be like this feels like fishing. What's happening Chris?

463
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,200
Why is it doing this right? I'm like, okay. Thank you for asking me that at the same time

464
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,440
Just enter your frickin password for God's sakes. All right, type it in hit enter. It's fine

465
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
So I'm doing a show right now

466
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,600
Yeah, so it is like it is slightly there were there's been a few bumps along the road where there's stuff

467
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I didn't expect like another one was

468
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,320
The screen dimming like describing the process of going into the settings and changing screen

469
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,360
Do you mean was much more complicated than I thought at first? I need to change that study myself

470
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,680
I haven't tried it yet. So what have you been your thoughts? Well, I've been using it in a very different use case

471
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,520
I'm I've been playing with a NUC that I've got one of the new Broadwell ones

472
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,280
Or Braswell, excuse me. And so right well, well, no, it's probably well. Well, Braswell is the new one

473
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,280
It's like the oh Adam Pentium. Oh, but it has a h.265 h.264. It's got a pretty nice graphics

474
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,920
It's not a that of a BP CPU, but the NUC was just dirt cheap

475
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,480
So I'm picking it up to give to my parents as a way to oh cool

476
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,040
It's like a VPN node to connect to my network. They can see some of the media files

477
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,240
I have we can do you know backups with you know, that sort of thing

478
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,280
Yeah, so before I had been configuring it with arch just because that's kind of my default

479
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,000
But this gave me a great opportunity to install, you know, I'm going to 1510 Monta, you know

480
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,160
I should say like arch was my default too, and I actually

481
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Removed arch to put this on

482
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,200
Wiped out the whole hard drive. Yeah, so I've been really impressed

483
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,600
My main use case here is as a VPN node and as a as a Kodi front-end basically and Kodi through MB

484
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,360
Mmm to connect to my media share

485
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,720
So you're using the MB database and you're using Kodi to display the metadata on top of Monta

486
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,640
but but I didn't you know

487
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,760
I didn't want to use open a lack or any of those kind of alternatives because I want it I wanted to be

488
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,040
Easy to you know kind of augment I was gonna use it to kind of do check-ins, you know

489
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
If I need to fix anything on that network, etc, etc

490
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,280
So I've been really impressed. It was super fast to install once it once it was installed

491
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,960
I mean at first I was like, oh, what's the is it gonna show me the boot animation? Oh, wait. No, it's already booted

492
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,560
Never mind. Yeah, it's asking me for my password to login. So I've had a really good positive experiences

493
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,280
It also it kind of rekindled, you know back before

494
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,280
Ubuntu switch to unity that was my main operating system

495
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,080
and you know, there's like that love there's this fondness and using mate 1510 it brought back all that like

496
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm familiar with a bunch of I've used on servers. I know my way around it, but it feels modern. It's super snappy

497
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,560
I I tried out the Cupertino. Yeah arrangement. Yeah, and it has it has the you know plank panel right on the bottom

498
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,880
Which is really easy. Everybody loves plank. Yeah, I think I'm gonna use it like that because it's really clear

499
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,120
You know, it's like someone who's not familiar wants to like how do I start Firefox?

500
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,480
Oh, there's the icon right there at the bottom of the screen

501
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,840
So it's been rocks rocks all yeah, and I know that it's like I'm happy to have another arch box that I just you know

502
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,440
Administer because it's not that big of a problem. But this might be a perfect solution of it has relatively recent packages

503
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,240
I won't have a problem if I want to update to 1604 later and

504
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,800
It'll be rock-solid and I know I'll always have it sitting right there. So I think it'll keep on there

505
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,200
Yeah, the thing I like about it too is like it's it's pretty performant. So I feel like hey

506
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,760
I'm giving you a nice fast computer. I feel like the battery life is pretty great and

507
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,560
I like that. It seems like a pretty obvious upgrade path to 1604. I was also super impressed with the welcome screen

508
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,480
I mean just all the number of apps that you can install

509
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,280
A lot of the default apps that are installed as well

510
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,640
Like I love that you have that easy option for deja-dupe backups that impressed me a lot just like oh, yeah

511
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,640
I just stick this up to I can you know, I could set up for my parents. I could set up a I

512
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,640
Actually, I actually think you could remove every single

513
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,000
application and package from that welcome screen and

514
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,560
just have Minecraft and if it if it if it became known that you could install Ubuntu Mate and then one-click install Minecraft

515
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,560
It could become like a Minecraft appliance. I mean, I don't know

516
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,840
So if you have you know anybody out there who's listening who has kids, you know for it for or above

517
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,880
You know what a big deal minecraft is

518
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,900
It's literally their life and the fact that I could deploy at Ubuntu Mate machine with one-click installation of Minecraft

519
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,340
Is a huge huge deal and if you could tell you know, my son Dylan that this would become

520
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,340
I mean this would be his obvious choice

521
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:27,020
It is it just making that accessible even though it is as simple as installing Jerry and getting the Minecraft jar

522
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,920
Like making it one button installation is a transfer more. It is how can I put this?

523
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,440
It is it's like closing that 10% gap that makes all of the difference

524
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,120
It's the uncanny valley that makes Minecraft and easy gaming

525
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,780
Completely accessible and if you're looking at somebody who has an older machine

526
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,840
They don't need Windows 10 and you can say Ubuntu Mate low resources one-click installation of Minecraft mind blown. Yep

527
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,980
So Wimby now that we're a few weeks into it. What's been some of the what's been some of the feedback?

528
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,980
What's been some of the consistent response?

529
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:06,580
Um, yeah, it's been positive. I've not heard anything, you know negative or worrying about it

530
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:14,780
So I'm pleased in that regard. I think the one thing I need to do is try and position because you've you've borne this out

531
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:20,180
I need to position that software feature from welcome a bit more clearly

532
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,500
Mmm, because people are used to these

533
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,580
Welcome screens being a bit anemic. Yeah, I'm probably don't realize this one actually does stuff for you

534
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:37,180
So yeah, you should have poked around in there a little bit because you could have installed Chrome and Chromium and

535
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,300
Telegram and Spotify not even telegram to oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

536
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:50,260
I thought that was great. She's maybe maybe calling it welcome screen is what's making people think it's gonna be anemic

537
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:56,740
Because welcome screen in Windows NT was a thing you just press close to. Yes, exactly. You check the box you never see it again

538
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,580
right, so what I'm working on is some of the

539
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,740
applications in Ubuntu

540
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,900
Have multiple icons and when you launch the different icons

541
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,420
They actually launch the same app but open it at a particular tab or section of the application

542
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:19,900
I've noticed that. So I'm thinking of making one just called software which basically just opens welcome at that software page

543
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,780
Hmm and drop that in there to sort of you know, kick-start that process, but then again with

544
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,600
The recent announcements about Ubuntu 16.04 and GNOME software. I'm very interested in you know

545
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,780
Including that in Ubuntu Marte providing there's no

546
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:44,580
Compatibility issues. So I've got all sorts of options and things to consider. No kidding. For the next cycle. Yeah

547
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,620
Yeah, I suppose the you know, the standout feature the thing that's really

548
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:56,540
Being popular is the Raspberry Pi 2 version for Ubuntu Marte. That has really so that's really good

549
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,180
That's seen some traction

550
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,620
Yeah, yeah, well and it has done for the 15.04. It's the most popular platform by far

551
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,780
So yeah and that in the 15.10 version

552
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
That makes 100% sense

553
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:19,020
With Minecraft, so you have you you have an inherent advantage of the Mate desktop being known for being low resources

554
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,680
So it makes it obvious for some of those use cases

555
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,380
Yeah, but and then you have the whole advantage of being on Ubuntu

556
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,220
So you have the home advantage of being known for being a low resources desktop on the Ubuntu on the Ubuntu platform, man

557
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,020
You know could no doubt that's popular in the Raspberry Pi

558
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
Yeah, but you know in making

559
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:44,300
Ubuntu Marte for the Raspberry Pi 2 it then became obvious that I was only two lines away from actually making any

560
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,220
Ubuntu version for the Raspberry Pi so I have ported every Ubuntu version to the Raspberry Pi 2 now

561
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,020
And I kicked off a little project a couple of weeks ago called the Ubuntu Pi flavor maker

562
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:03,100
And I presented that at OggCamp and at UOS. Brilliant. So all the Ubuntu's are now available for the Pi 2

563
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,180
and the one that I'm enjoying the most is the

564
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:13,660
Ubuntu minimal server image because you've got a proper Ubuntu server or traditional Ubuntu server

565
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,780
On the Raspberry Pi that you can now turn into anything you want

566
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:25,420
But it's got all the hardware unlocked for the you know, the video call. Talk about the perfect sync thing appliance or something like that

567
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,500
Yeah, I think the Raspberry Pi 2 with a with a sort of a minimal

568
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:36,540
Base OS. Yeah, like the Ubuntu minimal image. It makes that a really, you know flexible device

569
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:41,300
I mean, it's a flexible device anyway, but having a a trim a trim. Yes. Yeah

570
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,060
Kits and Kitty you wanted to ask would be a question about

571
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,980
Customizations and then maybe other distros kind of taking that and running with it. Go ahead

572
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:55,820
Yeah, one thing I've noticed there with mate is with well mate Ubuntu is it is a model mate distribution

573
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,380
And it provides a lot of stuff that I don't see open Susie. I don't see fedora

574
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,780
Implementing in their versions of mate in the future

575
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:14,380
Do you think that's going to change and we're gonna see distributions adopt more of your tools around that or do you think that other?

576
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,740
Distributions just don't care about and are you okay with that?

577
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:25,500
Yeah, I'm completely fine with that. I mean the thing that the tools in Ubuntu Marte that make it Ubuntu Marte are

578
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,580
not

579
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
wholly original

580
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,380
You know

581
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,940
Bits of software right two of the utilities. I forked from software from within Linux Mint

582
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,460
Ubuntu Marte welcome was forked from

583
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:47,740
And man now it was forked from and Turgos welcome, which was forked from Manjaro world

584
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,060
I really just walked from Karora. I love them. So this is now a fourth generation fork

585
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,580
So, you know those those utilities

586
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,740
You know if anyone wants to fork it and turn it into

587
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,180
Zubuntu welcome or the bun to welcome or whatever then, you know, go for it

588
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,180
I mean the end the day it's more Linux users, right?

589
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,060
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's the whole point of open source

590
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:16,380
Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to make these tools as quickly had there not been existing code out there under an appropriate license

591
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,140
For me to work from last but not least wimpy

592
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,180
Nobody likes to talk about this I have a feeling

593
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,700
This is probably something I shouldn't even say

594
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,060
But I mean, is there a is there a point say it's 2020

595
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,780
Is there a point where you could make a full-time living doing this because it seems like something that's being pretty well received by

596
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:43,620
The community and it feels like once it's that well-received. There's obviously value to it. There's obviously something there that people need

597
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:50,380
I mean, I know you have a great job. I know you love it. But is there yes, that's curious because I'm unemployed at the moment

598
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
Trying to make you sound like a hero

599
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,740
So, I mean

600
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,860
So actually that underscores my question even more than I mean because this is obviously a critical distribution

601
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:12,020
A lot of people find very valuable a lot of good utilities here something innovative and different on the market just like leap is

602
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:18,340
You know that we today we're talking about two very different distributions that are bringing something unique to the market. Do you do you?

603
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,820
Wish there was a way to make this a full-time gig. Do you want something like that to develop? What are your thoughts there?

604
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,820
Certainly if there was the opportunity for me to work on a plinthu Marte on a full-time basis

605
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,820
That would be terrific. That would be a lot of fun

606
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,580
And to be honest with you as generous as the community of being with their donations in order to sort of pay for the bandwidth

607
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,460
Which is mostly consumed by serving up the Raspberry Pi 2 downloads

608
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,260
I don't know that there are enough users out there to you know

609
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,380
Sustain, you know a team of people working on it on a full-time basis

610
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,340
and

611
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,660
You know, it's a it's a desktop Linux operating system. So

612
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,140
It's a niche of a niche. So, you know, you've already got a small audience of people

613
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:11,180
so and there's there's room enough in the Linux community for you know distributions like a bun to Marte and Zubin to an

614
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,060
Ubuntu to have

615
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,980
significant user bases

616
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,260
But I don't know that they can they can support

617
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,580
I mean linux mint have been hugely successful with what they've done what they've been able to generate in their community where they've that their

618
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,500
Community is funding the full-time development of mint

619
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,860
and

620
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:34,380
this has always been a bit of fun for me and it's been a learning experience as well in some respects and

621
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,220
Maybe it's better if it continues to be that

622
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:45,260
hmm, but sure, you know if there's somebody out there who wants to deploy this to you know, a

623
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
thousand people or something and they

624
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,140
Want to offer me a job to look after it and make bespoke changes then it'd be perfect come and find me

625
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,660
Yeah, well, you know what honestly a wimpy I would not be surprised if you keep it up if it doesn't eventually happen

626
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,420
But anyways in the meantime patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore mate

627
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,300
That would be a good place for people to go wouldn't it?

628
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,540
That'd be lovely. Yes, the bandwidth bandwidth bills are getting quite scary now

629
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:16,580
I'm a backer and if you are if you are a if you're a tech talk today patreon patreon.com slash today

630
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,420
You support the Jupiter broadcasting network

631
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:24,860
Then really pretty much everything you need is all set up on patreon and you just go click the button and make sure that even

632
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,380
If you're not a user of this distro

633
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:33,620
Something very approachable in the traditional desktop paradigm is available to everybody 88 patrons. That doesn't seem like enough to me

634
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,580
Yeah, come on guys. Yeah, if you can't pay his bandwidth bills

635
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:42,200
then how is he gonna show up here if you could back in all of us if you can even if you can't back JB go give

636
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,020
Them two bucks a month and if you can if you can afford to back two projects

637
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,180
Then I'd say patreon.com slash today and then patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore mate

638
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,900
But if you can't afford to back us go black go back them 88 patrons

639
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,260
I feel like that's not enough for something that literally is making Linux

640
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:02,000
Accessible to an entirely new generation of people who do not want the Windows 8 slash Windows 10 paradigm

641
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,420
I think that's a pretty cool effort and and not that there's not other distros out there

642
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,700
But I think we've all I think you know watching this from the incarnation up to now

643
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,300
I think it's pretty obvious is a good one to support. Yep

644
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,340
It has that spirit you mentioned the one-click installer for

645
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:22,140
Minecraft which I got the tip from kids actually using it and saying yeah. Well if it doesn't do minecraft, it's irrelevant

646
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,420
So I sorted that one and then the other thing I learned from my in-laws

647
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:33,540
Is well, if hasn't got solitaire, it's irrelevant. So you'll find directly after minecraft is yes. I did actually

648
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:41,040
Solitaire when I get home, which is free free to install on Ubuntu Marte, but I believe is a paid up on Windows 10 now

649
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,140
That's worth the patreon backing right there

650
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,340
All right, so very nice and wimpy

651
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,860
I'll I'll continue to give you my bits and tids and pits and pieces here and and and Wes

652
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,700
Continue to use it yourself

653
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,740
Let you know wimpy

654
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:02,580
But I actually so far and feedback is greatly received because it'll only get better if people tell me what's not working

655
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,580
right, I can already tell you I

656
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,700
I

657
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:13,220
Love I love them. I love the integration of compass and mate tweak because that just got me like oh, yeah

658
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,300
Matt mate tweak is very helpful. I got me like 70% of the way there right then and there it was really sweet

659
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,480
It really was sweet. I liked a lot and you know what super fast boot Oh super fast just the whole thing

660
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,780
I mean, it seems like the go-to testro for yeah visual appliance. Yeah

661
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,700
I was very very very impressed and I hope I hope it continues to be impressive

662
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,780
You know what else is impressive my mobile service provider. It could be yours to ting go to linux.ting.com

663
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,060
Now here's why I want you to go there. It supports the show keeps us on the air and you get to put Linux in your

664
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,980
browser bar

665
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,460
Really walk away right there Linux

666
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:52,860
You mean do you have how many URLs have Linux in your in your recent history? Not enough linux.ting.com

667
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:59,140
You also I mean this kind of is nice too. You get a $25 discount on your first ting device or if you got a ting

668
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:05,420
Compatible device and you probably you probably do you probably do. Yeah, you probably do you get $25 on service

669
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,380
Which is paid for more than my first month. Here's why I say you're probably doing this is really kind of a nice thing

670
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,360
Ting has a CDMA and GSM Network

671
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,560
So you get to be a baller you get to pick because you know what the difference between GSM and CDMA and CDMA is so

672
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,680
Check box there. You actually know what GSM is and you know, it's CDMA is not good CDMA. Good job

673
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,800
I don't know what it is. I don't know. I can't even say it

674
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,640
I can't even say because I just like to blur it. Apparently ting is so helpful. You don't you don't need to know

675
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah, I suppose you don't I mean what I like what I like about ting is

676
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,840
It's obvious because it's no contract it's pay for what you use. It's six dollars for the line

677
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,240
All right, so that's the baseline but we're like why I really like it is

678
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,840
if you just like

679
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,040
If you just like a little bit smarter than the average bear like you don't even have to be like super smart

680
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,560
But like if you've heard of the word Linux before or you know

681
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:07,240
What a bios is you probably can figure out ting and like everybody else who can't not judging because you know what?

682
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,160
I love them. They're basically my entire family deals

683
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:18,200
Yeah, we have we we have the advantage to game the system and we can game the system nicely with ting

684
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:24,880
Go to linux.ting.com use your Wi-Fi pay for what you use. No contract. No early termination fee

685
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,720
It freaking rocks. They got every single device from like a bare-bones GSM

686
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,320
You can just go get the GSM or CDMA sim and put them in your thing. You got a thing

687
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,320
You can put in a thing. That's fine. Just pay six dollars a month for the thing

688
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,520
Or get like, you know a feature phone because you know

689
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,880
You need to make calls and just need a speaker and a microphone

690
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,600
it's funny how these feature phones have really good speakers and microphones to and like

691
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,120
Ridiculous seven-day battery life. How is that not a thing anymore?

692
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,720
How did we let that go you could you charge your phone every night every night every night Wes without fail?

693
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,520
And don't forget you got to charge the watch. Yeah

694
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah, because of course the watch uses the power on the phone because you got Bluetooth turned on all the time now, right?

695
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,480
Okay, so you can go get yeah, you can go get your iPhone 6s or your you know your s6

696
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,440
Yeah, I got both those you can go get your Nexus's. They got the Nexus I

697
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,760
directly from ting

698
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,560
It's really cool. Go to linux.ting.com. Go check them out. Actually what kicks ass about ting is their

699
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
customer service and their dashboard

700
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,560
They treat these things as like features for their platform. So they're respectable

701
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,780
Go check them out linux.ting.com and they'll get a device now. They don't have these very often the Novotel mi-fi

702
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,480
5580

703
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,920
Very frequently goes out of sale. This is a small

704
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:48,080
crazy long life battery life mi-fi device pay for what you use six dollars a month data in your pocket when you don't use it you

705
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,080
Turn it off because they have a crazy cool dashboard

706
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,340
Linux docking comm you go get this you get $25 of service credit

707
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,320
For all I would guess if you get $25 of service credit

708
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,060
I would bet you can use this mi-fi app because you buy it no contract, right?

709
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,040
You buy this Novotel mi-fi 5580. They don't have it on sale very often

710
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,160
So that's a great price to literally they like I only talk about this when they have it on sale

711
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,780
I haven't talked about this for six months you get this thing

712
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,140
$6 a month when you're using it. You can literally turn it off read their control panel when you don't need it

713
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,240
Okay, and then last but not least what I love about it

714
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,440
$6 so if you just want to accidentally leave it on right whoops

715
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,080
So you have it in your bag or whatever like it's $6

716
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,480
They're like that's less than that frickin burger you got from the fast-food restaurant in your couch. You'll find it in chain

717
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,360
I know like and then when you need data on the go. It's ready for you

718
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,060
I freaking love it and a hundred bucks no contract

719
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,380
No early termination fee pay for what you use and if you go to linux.com you get the $25 credit

720
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
You'll probably get about three months

721
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
That's crazy, right

722
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,160
Three months of data hundred bucks out of your pocket and you've got data on the go that if you do if you do any kind

723
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,920
Of remote administration, or you need to be available all the time

724
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:09,160
Man for an insurance policy six dollars a month is nothing you don't have to you don't worry about tethering your phone

725
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,960
Or any of that you just turn it on and you're ready to go you'd be like Noah to Noah got one of these recently and

726
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,080
He just has it in his Jeep. Oh, that's that's and they just yeah, it's his Jeep. This is Jeep connection

727
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,160
They got all the great phones. They got the motos they got that they got the Apple phones

728
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,160
Now the netgear zing is what I have in the rover and the nice thing about the zing is you got the touch interface

729
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,400
So you can be pretty much do all the config right there on the device

730
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,120
That's what I have in the rover. They got all the good stuff and and I think probably right now the best value. I

731
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,980
Mean besides the Nexus devices, which would be my first choice, right would be the LG G flex, too

732
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,920
It's got that nice curve to it. Nice version of Android

733
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
$237 no contract you own it

734
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,240
Linux.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

735
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:02,220
Man, I just want to go get phones. What's up? Hey, I wanted to do like some quick follow-up on fedora

736
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,100
I don't know how many people in the mumble room were using it

737
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,420
But a couple of things for fedora before we move on some of the spins are out the cinnamon desktop spin

738
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,420
That's right that one. Yeah. Yeah thoughts

739
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,460
It's not quite as nicely integrated as let's say mint, right? Hmm, but it was familiar

740
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:25,660
And it has all the fedora pluses, you know modern kernels lots of new packages all those wonderful fedora tweaks

741
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,780
Yeah, but not quite as nice as the gnome version. Well, or maybe it would just you can kind of see it in this little image

742
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:36,260
Here it's a little brown. It's a little you know, like gnome but without the gnome flashiness and modern

743
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,420
I don't know

744
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,100
I was less impressed than I hope to be but I think with like a few minutes of configuration

745
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,940
It could be a pretty it could be really it's all now that you say it

746
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,940
It kind of looks like a well, you're not running gnome. So here you go, right?

747
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,820
Right, you know and it's like that the icons aren't blue which is fedoras thing whereas in mint they're green

748
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,640
They're just you know, it's a little more and it's kind of a weirder blend between

749
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,620
Yeah, the gnome look and the cinnamon look but yes

750
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,820
But that said like for a fedora base with with a really good cinnamon on top is something I would be interested and the theme

751
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,260
Is something you can quickly change right exactly. Yeah first impressions do count though

752
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:18,060
also for fedora 23 of course the KDE plasma desktop spin is out featuring KDE plasma 5.4.0 and

753
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,300
KD frameworks 5.15 of course and because it makes sense. The application stack is 1508

754
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,640
So just because KD is really easy understand don't call it KDE though

755
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,340
You got you got plasma desktop 540. You got the framework of

756
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,700
5.1 5 and you got the application stack of 1508

757
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,780
I don't understand what you guys don't understand this

758
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:47,920
What can't you follow about this by the way plasma 5.4 includes because it's 5.4.0 includes a new audio applet

759
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,500
application dashboard and an updated breeze icon theme and

760
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,420
With some controversy Firefox as default

761
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,560
There you go. And then last but not least on our fedora 23

762
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,220
Something kind of neat a new fedora community blog. I'm actually kind of excited about this today

763
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:14,260
Yeah, it's kind of neat right the fedora project is pleased to announce the launch of a new publication platform for different fedora

764
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:22,460
Contributors the fedora community blog the community blog intends to better connect the different projects groups and efforts going on in the community

765
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,460
Every single frickin day

766
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,680
Which is great because fedora is already kind of that, you know Linux next pushing the boundaries

767
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,600
Yes, Lauren things right nice to hear more about what I agree

768
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,840
I agree and then last but not least in our fedora 23 follow-up category fedora ra hide

769
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:44,720
If you're already done with 23, you're bored with that s fedora ra hide enables Wayland by default when it is

770
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,140
Supported. Oh, I am so ready for this Chris. Are you I mean X is great. It works really well

771
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:55,420
It's stable and you know everything I want but X is X is

772
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,660
Suitable. Yeah, I wouldn't know it's not great in any way. Yeah, it is sufficient for now

773
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,340
Yeah, I am I am I am so ready for the Wayland future and I'm excited to explore it

774
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,820
I'm sure that a million things will break and I'll be very inconvenienced and I'll complain on air to everyone but

775
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,380
It's gonna be fun

776
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:17,400
Anybody the mumble room had a chance to try out fedora 23 anybody have any follow-up thoughts on our review for fedora 23?

777
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,780
The floor is open. I am running it right now. Tell me about it

778
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,160
so I think the only criticism that I have is that

779
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,000
RPM fusion took like a week to update that is really annoying and by the way

780
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:39,960
Couple us to two points about that. They got the they got the repository online much faster than they got the website updated

781
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:46,440
So it actually was possible to get working under 23 much earlier than those sites said it was but that aside the hell

782
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,280
One of the things that I didn't talk about in my review in Linux action show

783
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:58,800
But the hell is why are all of the third part third-party repositories and all the third-party flavors like a week at

784
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,640
Best and in some cases Korora a month behind

785
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:09,080
Fedora like when Ubuntu releases 1510 every single frickin spin is ready to go

786
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:16,720
You got PPA is good to go. Everybody's everybody's got tutorials talking about the new 1510 how to install crap when it's fedora

787
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
It's like oh

788
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,200
Wait a minute

789
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,520
Hold on. I'm sorry. Uh

790
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,880
Is there a new fedora release I guess we better update our repository I

791
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,440
Guess we should wait. It's been four months

792
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,800
I guess we should write a tutorial on how to do something in fedora

793
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,360
It literally feels like you're in a vacuum

794
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,160
When you install a new version of fedora like in the first like I would just say two three weeks

795
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:51,180
It feels like you live in a universe where no other person in the entire universe runs your app

796
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,520
Or your operating system and then and then here's the great thing five six months in

797
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,180
Everybody's got repos. Everybody's got tutorials

798
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,700
Everybody's got forum threads on how to do s in your version of fedora six months into it

799
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:13,440
But good news everybody that version is about to be replaced before you're even before you can even get settled and use a version of fedora

800
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:20,520
There is a new version out and nobody and and I'm looking at you RPM fusion. I'm looking at you how to Linux

801
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,500
I'm looking at all of you people out there. I'm everybody out there source Forge sure. I'm looking at you

802
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,200
I don't care

803
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,800
I got I just I want to see how you all the Ubuntu users do it when a new version of Ubuntu ships all the

804
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,720
Flavors are out all the tutorials are out all the PPAs are out web update omg, Ubuntu

805
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,080
All those people have articles on how to do crap under the new version

806
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,840
The top ten things to do with the new version of Ubuntu Google search that right now go go Google search

807
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,480
Top ten things to do with Ubuntu 1510 and go look at all of the crappy blog

808
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,160
Articles about the top ten things to do after you install Ubuntu 10 and 1510 and you know what they all have they have PPAs

809
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,100
They have themes they have tutorials all of which are relevant to the current version of Ubuntu now

810
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:07,500
I invite you top ten things to do fedora 23 go search that nothing shows up

811
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:14,180
literally nothing shows up and it is what fundamentally makes the difference between a usable desktop environment and that

812
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:22,180
Actual people use and other users can recommend to other people and what now stuff shows up. Well 21 and 22. Yeah. Oh, yeah

813
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:29,820
That's what shows up after the release and this is consistently the problem with fedora and and and how do you quantify this in a review?

814
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:36,820
and how and as literally as somebody and I'm just telling you this as somebody who has reviewed every single release of fedora

815
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,460
Since they literally called it fedora. Okay, since they called it fedora

816
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,060
I have been reviewing every single version of fedora and this is every single time been a problem

817
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:52,140
We are 23 releases in it will never change apparently and it's not fedoras problem

818
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:58,420
It's the community's problem the community apparently takes a week to get off their ass and the RPM fusion site

819
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:04,100
You know should just even update the wiki take some four or five days and it takes them three days just to get the repo

820
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,980
Online and you go on reddit and you see the number one thing about fedora 23 years

821
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,620
Oh, I can't get RPM fusion working

822
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:17,260
It is embarrassing and it is literally the difference between a distribution that is usable by end-users and approachable and recommendable to their

823
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,540
average person and

824
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:24,260
Something that makes it only approachable to the elite and on top of that it makes it a huge pain in the ass to review

825
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,260
I'm sorry about the rant

826
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:32,740
Done Wow, actually I was able to pull up some top 10 articles on a fedora

827
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,580
But they don't give specifics because everything is yeah

828
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:41,380
To cuz well, yes. So first of all, you can on on Tuesday, November 10th

829
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:47,020
Find some things for the fedora 23 a week literally after it's been released

830
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,420
You can find some stuff

831
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:54,060
But the majority of the stuff you will find is for the previous version of fedora that only a clown show would be using at

832
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,060
this point, yep, it's just it's

833
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:02,180
So what makes a successful version of desktop Linux isn't just that you release and ship

834
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,340
It is that there are people out there that want to use it

835
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,660
It is that there are people out there that want to support it

836
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,900
It is people out there that want to write tutorials for it

837
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,980
It is sites out there like OMG Ubuntu they'll want to have an entire blog about it, right?

838
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:20,140
It is all of these people that make the ecosystem around distribution that are fundamentally

839
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:27,060
Required to make it approachable to the end-user you need to have a good chance when somebody goes to search

840
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,300
how do I install steam on Linux there needs to be a a

841
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,500
a

842
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,220
At least a decent chance that a tutorial on your distribution shows up, and you know what if you're a boon to today

843
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,620
That's probably the second maybe even the first link right. How do I install steam on Linux probably?

844
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,580
I don't know

845
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:46,020
I've never searched that cuz I'm not a moron, but probably this it's up there, right

846
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:50,380
I would be willing to bet you right actually do the search. Let's do it. Are you are you on Bing?

847
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:55,940
Well, of course, I'm on Bing. We're running Windows 10 in the studio here folks. Yeah, the Windows 10 test continues

848
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,880
All right, I think he just wants to torture me. Okay. Go ahead search it right now. I do actually every week

849
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,540
Okay, so install steam on Linux

850
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:11,620
Now here we go. Here we go. And our first result is steam. Of course links. There you go and developer valve software comm

851
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:16,740
Debian Ubuntu boom right there Ubuntu right there even on Bing. It's Ubuntu. Where's fedora in that list? I

852
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,980
Don't see it. There's arch. Yep. Yeah, go to the next page

853
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,060
Okay

854
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,060
arch Ubuntu mint

855
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,660
Uh-huh open suit. Hey, there's open sues

856
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,980
Uh-huh

857
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:36,620
Okay, we're on copy Linux. Oh fedora 18. That's that's good on which page of Bing

858
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,780
I'm sorry, go which page you go down to the page. We're on three. Okay on page three

859
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,780
There is an article on how to install steam on

860
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,540
fedora 18 fedora 18

861
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,740
That is my point right there that proves my point right there this

862
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:57,020
Ecosystem this ecosystem that makes it possible for average people to approach your distribution is lacking for fedora

863
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:03,220
It is good steams page does have a fedora subsection. Yes, but that's just and and if you look at it

864
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,020
Let's see fedora fedora to do to do to do. Yeah, uh-huh. Okay. Yeah

865
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:12,360
Nothing on there about 23. Nope, but you do have to rely again on RPM fusion here

866
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:21,140
Which is the unspoken thing about many users using fedora is it's it's not just fedora. So what how does fedora fix this problem? I

867
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,140
Have a solution. Yeah

868
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,660
so

869
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,780
every distribution regardless if it's

870
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,880
Ubuntu

871
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:37,060
Open to see or fedora has a development version which tracks the latest versions of software and everything and as

872
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,380
It gets closer and closer to stable. Of course, it becomes more stable

873
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,020
now

874
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,020
when I was on

875
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,100
the

876
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:53,680
RPM fusion website I noticed this that they had releases for rawhide which is the rolling

877
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,620
unstable for fedora and

878
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,360
Yet they didn't have 23. Why weren't they able to just freeze rawhide?

879
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:06,620
Because they already knew it was coming out. So there was a point at which they could have said hey

880
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:13,860
We're you know, this is coming up a week from now. Let's go ahead. Yeah and freeze that so the biggest issue for me

881
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,280
Oh, sorry, you know what the biggest issue for me is this the communication right? It's like if it takes you a week

882
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:23,420
Okay, yeah, thank you for doing what you're doing, but if you just put out something that says we run hit a snake

883
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:28,180
No, it's super cool to be known as the distro. That's great to install a week or two after it's out

884
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:34,380
That's what you want to be known as the distro you install two weeks after it's released and and and nothing nothing

885
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,220
You know really nothing the fedora project can do here other than continue to kick ass, right?

886
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,540
They have to continue to kick ass to motivate their community

887
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,440
I call on the fedora community to step up a little more though

888
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,820
I think but I you know

889
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:50,540
I've watched it with 22 and now I just watched it with 23 and it seems like the rest of the crowd is a little bit

890
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,340
Behind the scenes like oh, there's a new release. We didn't see this coming

891
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:00,340
Like that needs to stop happening and I I feel like that is the fundamental

892
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,500
fundamental downside to installing fedora on release day is I

893
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,700
The one thing I left out of my last review is just wait a month

894
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:14,060
That would be the one like to make fedora the perfect desktop for you. Wait a month and then it's great

895
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,140
Don't get caught up in the excitement. Yeah, don't increase the download kept just wait a month

896
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,540
Anyways before we move on anybody in the mobile room have any thoughts

897
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:29,980
Yeah, I've actually spoken to a few fedora guys about stuff around this and we've seen the same thing in openSUSE of way back

898
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,900
when in the past that the really tricky part is

899
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:38,940
Like having build systems that can keep up keep this all stuff in sync

900
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:43,980
Yeah, you know, you know, it's part of it's a bit of a technical problem as well as a community one

901
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:48,300
Yes, I don't know what RPM fusion are using in the back end their stuff

902
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:54,180
Really? I mean honestly in a way. This is something the build service could fix, right?

903
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,220
Well, it's something that Pac-man our equivalent of RPM fusion

904
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:03,580
They're using their own build service for this exact reason because it means they don't have to worry about it anymore

905
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:10,220
Yeah, yeah that you can link actual build services to each other so they know there's two hours

906
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:16,500
Yeah, figure out what the heck we're doing and then it just builds and actually they got our one done a week before

907
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:22,540
So is it is it just that there's a different class of user using fedora?

908
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,620
Who are less inclined to want?

909
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:34,580
Vast I mean all the things you've talked about are pretty much all proprietary products so Skype steam

910
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:42,620
telegram while telegrams not but yeah, like hosted externally third-party probably binary only stuff, right and

911
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:49,340
every distro has a profile of users and is the profile of a fedora user the kind of person who

912
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,340
Values their freedom, you know fedora doesn't ship with any non-free stuff

913
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:58,900
but therefore is the kind of person who isn't inclined to want to

914
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:03,740
Fill up their lovely free software desktop with a load of non-free stuff. I

915
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,940
Think you could be onto something there. Yeah, I I do actually completely agree with you

916
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:18,740
Yeah, I I do actually completely agree and I I actually think that is a a pretty legitimate market right now

917
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:25,460
I mean it, you know, I think there was I think ten years ago. I think that was sort of a tiny tiny tiny niche, but

918
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:31,900
Honestly, I think that's tens of thousands of people now and I think that's a legitimate people to it to right and that's tens of

919
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,900
Thousands, but that's not that's not

920
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:40,740
Enough that can sustain a vast community of users who can maintain build servers who can yeah maintain

921
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,380
right up-to-date blog packages and right tutorials and all that or

922
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:51,380
Honestly blogs that drive enough traffic to make advertisers interested right right even break even on right?

923
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,260
Yeah, is it worthwhile me doing that kind of thing? Yeah, that is the huge part that you have to break through to make a complete

924
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
ecosystem and

925
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,840
And leap has got an interesting approach fedoras got an interesting approach approach

926
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,100
Especially if you haven't seen our review from Linux action show go check it out

927
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:13,660
The DNF upgrade might make it easier to move between releases. I talked about that a little bit. We'll see right

928
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:18,820
I'm gonna do an experiment for the next few releases and see how it goes Kitson. You have our last thought ticket, sir

929
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,620
Yeah, the counter on poppy on that one

930
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:29,100
There's actually quite a few titles of free software that is hard to get on fedora her root pad is near impossible

931
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,060
Yeah, it's free software and it's just not packaged. I

932
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:37,260
Know it drives me crazy. It makes me it makes me the sad it really does but I

933
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:42,600
Guess nobody else has taken the time to make her pad work. I don't know either as

934
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:47,620
Richard said I don't know what fedora or opium fusion used behind the scenes

935
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,940
I mean, we're very lucky in that we have

936
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,820
PPAs in any member of the community can just yes create a PPA for nothing for free

937
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:01,940
Yeah, two gig of space. Yeah, and it will be built on any supportive release including the development release

938
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,900
Which isn't even out yet?

939
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:09,160
So people can be building stuff before the release comes out and we're we're lucky and our users are lucky that they have that

940
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,860
I don't know what's stopping opium fusion from being able to do that

941
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:20,140
But that might resolve one of the issues you're you're talking about. I would imagine the RP infusion folks are probably just resource limited

942
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,980
You know volunteers

943
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:25,860
it's a migrate it's a it's a combination of several projects and

944
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:31,180
It's it's easy to sit here and take you know our you know be judgmental

945
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:37,460
But it does feel like the community needs to I guess here's here's my closing thoughts and then we're gonna move on

946
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:42,300
And it is this with the fedora dot next initiative. I

947
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,580
feel like the fedora project

948
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,740
stepped up their game and

949
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:55,380
23 is really the long-term realization of a lot of that 22 was interesting 23 is really that and

950
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:59,700
I feel like the rest of the community that does the support stuff around fedor

951
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,660
Hmm a lot of them the majority hasn't stepped up at the same way

952
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:09,060
Fedora project stepped up their game community didn't necessarily step up the game to match it

953
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:14,940
And now I call on them to step up their game a little bit. We could have something really excellent here

954
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:20,060
Yeah, it just takes a little bit more. Let's make 24 the one where everybody's on page at the same time

955
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:26,540
And it really is something you could say to an average person go try fedora 24 and all of the support infrastructure around it

956
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,180
Ready to go at that time. It'd be really sweet. Hey, you know what else?

957
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:36,060
It's really sweet Linux Academy another sponsor of Linux unplugged show Linux Academy comm go there right now

958
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,940
In fact pro tip West you ready for this Linux Academy comm slash unplugged. Boom

959
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:47,780
Unplugged special discount for the Linux unplugged are you fine folks? I need you to go there now

960
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:53,780
I need you passionately to go there because here's why you think there is you think it's just random chance

961
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:58,860
They've been advertising on the unplugged show for a little while new. Oh, it's not no turns out

962
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:04,820
It's because it's the perfect fit for our audience. It is a resource built defined created born

963
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,620
By people who are passionate about Linux, you know, there's other sites out there Linda other sites out there

964
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,340
I won't even name them

965
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,020
They just put like Linux and open source stuff on there as like a feature

966
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,060
Oh, I hear it all the time, you know on advertisements on online

967
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,980
There are

968
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:29,940
There are other podcasts out there today. They may run a you know a lynda.com ad

969
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,300
It's for people who like to mess with computers

970
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:40,580
But see they will list something like Linux or nginx or Apache or Ruby or Python or RPM or IP tables or our sink

971
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,580
or SSH

972
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:49,100
Exactly those are buzzwords. Those are those are bullet points on their website. They couldn't really give a shit about them

973
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:53,140
They really couldn't Linux Academy is more like Jupiter broadcasting

974
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:58,580
It was created because man this thing Linux is really freaking awesome

975
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,860
Now, how can we get more people to use it?

976
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:07,220
And then from there they partnered with educators and developers and they created the Linux Academy platform

977
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:12,740
They have over 1900 self-paced courses with instructor help on demand, which is a big deal

978
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:18,220
They got scenario based labs you go in they actually use something before you go do it in production and I love this

979
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,740
7-plus distros to choose from

980
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:27,200
You choose your distro and then the courseware and the virtual servers match that up

981
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,180
Everything matches. Oh, yeah comprehensive study guides ready to go audio video download them

982
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:36,540
Listen in the shower while you're naked you can do that. You can listen in the commute

983
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,860
Oh that might make sense. It's incredible. Plus they got live streams

984
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,980
Instructor help did I mention that? Yeah, it's pretty nice

985
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,380
and then of course in the month of October every single month, it seems like really

986
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:53,320
They got new features a new CDN all Linux powered new HTML 5 players throughout. Oh, those are slick

987
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,320
I love that and of course

988
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,840
Now better than like anything before when you go through and do a system

989
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,180
They can give you real-time feedback on how you're doing

990
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:06,540
Plus they have new systems to prep you for the big certifications. And by the way, the community

991
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:11,960
Stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members. It's pretty nice. Very friendly. Yes, go check them out

994
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:31,380
Maybe you can learn more there just help the show out and learn a little bit more about Linux Academy visiting Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

995
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:36,380
There's a very special discount for you Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big

996
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,740
Thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

997
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:45,140
All right, Wes. Well, we're gonna move right along now. And did you hear about this?

998
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:52,460
Well, oh actually, you know, I gotta give a special mention before we move on a friend of the show Benjamin Krencia or

999
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:59,660
I always get that wrong. What's what it's you know, you say it like Krenza Krenza. Thank you

1000
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:09,240
Anyways, it is a he has an app called glucosio for I I guess he's working on iPhone

1001
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:13,820
But it's it's out there for Android right now. It's diabetes month. This is a special thing for me and

1002
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,520
It's not like other stuff. It's not like you don't have to go. You don't have to go donate money

1003
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,360
Really? They just want people to spread the word. So it's like a crowdfunding campaign only it's sharing it socially

1004
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,360
So you can share on Facebook Twitter tumblr

1005
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,640
And I'm gonna do it right now. I got a link in the show notes

1006
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,880
If you have anybody in your life who's affected by diabetes, this is extremely interesting

1007
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:41,000
So glucosio is his application for Android and iOS and other platforms. We talked about it on tech talk today and

1008
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,320
He is doing basically open source crowd sourcing of

1009
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:52,640
Glucose and diabetes information to do some interesting crowd research and he's got a great app available for Android right now glucosio

1010
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,080
To track that and to track blood sugar what you've eaten to do some some really nice data

1011
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:04,000
And so if this is something if you have diabetes and something you manage you might want to check out glucosio

1012
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,560
It's an open source app

1013
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,760
That also is contributing anonymous data for research

1014
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:16,240
It's expanding to multiple platforms and right now that they simply want to spread the word about their open source free application

1015
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,360
There's no money involved

1016
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,600
it is an open source app from a friend of the show friend of the network and I got a link in the show notes and

1017
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,960
they just want to spread the word for diabetes month and

1018
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,600
Honestly, if you have somebody with diabetes an open source application is a great way for them to manage it

1019
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,480
I think this is also important because I think it can be a good wedge into the the medical

1020
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,760
Industry in that I think having these open source apps like if you have if you have diabetes

1021
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:44,660
Shouldn't there be you know just in common humanities infrastructure a way for you to you know

1022
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,040
Open source something auditable something you can trust a way to keep track of your health issues, right?

1023
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,280
We need those as a you know as a free society. I agree and we need more of that in the medical community

1024
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,280
So to see something like this, I think we should all support it. Even if it affects you or not

1025
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,120
Yeah link on the show notes if you want to tweet about it or something like that

1026
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:06,320
So did you guys hear about this new Linux ransomware that's targeting the Linux system?

1027
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,160
We thought we were safe. It was a Windows admin problem, right?

1028
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:09,640
Right

1029
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:16,560
It's called Linux encoder or Linux dot encoder dot one and it targets personal website files and demands

1030
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:23,360
$500 in bitcoins the antivirus company. Dr. Webb has issued an alert about a new form of crypto ransomware

1031
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,480
Stroke your beard. Oh, these terms are so fun. I know you see me stroking the beard. Oh, it's beautiful

1032
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,960
Thank you, sir. Can I maybe next time I'll know? Yeah, never mind. Keep it growing. I'll keep your own beard growing

1033
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:39,600
You got it going right now. I targets Linux users. It's designated as a Linux dot encoder one and

1034
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:45,400
the malware largely targets web services encrypting the contents and demanding a ransom of

1035
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,680
bitcoins of value about five hundred dollars many of the systems have been affected by malware and

1036
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,960
Is

1037
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:00,600
Primarily, I believe at this point targeting the magneto CMS. So if you don't run that you don't really get a you know

1038
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,440
I'm back to you know, this doesn't apply to you, but it's a critical vulnerability for magneto CMS

1039
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,600
Which has already been patched, but of course people are lazy

1040
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,720
And so this thing is attacking those CMS is with the low-hanging fruit

1041
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,000
And another point here is that you know since this has been

1042
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,240
Productized or whatever it forms a good, you know, there are still servers out there available the shell shock or you know

1043
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,520
You just kind of take this you change that one thing. Yeah

1044
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:28,040
Yeah, like this week there was a there was a story that WordPress now is like running 25% of the web

1045
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:33,080
That's that's frightening. Yeah, which basically means it's gonna take forever for security updates to go out

1046
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,180
In order to run the malware has to be executed with administrative level privileges

1047
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:42,520
Using 128-bit AES crypto the malware encrypts the contents of the user's home directories. Hey, oh

1048
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:49,800
Yeah, your home directories gone and any of files associated with the websites running on the system. It goes scanning for those

1049
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,880
Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, it does dude. Check this out. It goes through the whole directory structure of mounted volumes like

1050
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:02,880
shares it's gonna check those right and and it encrypts a variety of files in each directory it encrypts things like text files and

1051
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,600
Then it leaves a file behind called readme

1052
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:13,260
underscore for underscore decrypt dot txt all uppercase because it's boss that's cruel. Yes boss level clearly

1053
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,160
Influenced by the windows pedigree here. Yes. Yes very much

1054
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:20,680
So a very much so edit demands payments and provides the links to the hidden tor site

1055
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:28,160
The malware specifically looks for a patching engine engine X installations as well as my SQL installs in the director structure of the targeted

1056
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,640
Systems you got that database. It's gone. That's right

1057
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,600
It's gone and it's gone and it also seeks directories log files

1058
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:40,320
Locations of web pages contents port ultimately going after a variety of file types including Windows executables. Hey, oh

1059
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:49,320
Program program libraries and actor server pages. Yes, those ASP files and SQL files Java JavaScript and document files

1060
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,360
The victim makes a payment the malware itself will then initiate decryption of the file

1061
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,960
Otherwise it remains encrypted. They don't mention Python. That's what I usually end up writing my servers in so

1062
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,300
You know, it's funny actually about that. The fix is a Python script. Oh perfect. Yeah

1063
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,500
I love it. Yeah, this has been a whirlwind story and by the time we got on air

1064
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,020
There's already a fix out and you can decrypt your files

1065
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:18,500
The tool was created by malware researchers from antivirus firm bit defender who found a major flaw in the linux dot encoder one

1066
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,400
Ransomware turns out uses really shitty random number prediction

1067
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,140
The researchers discovered that when it generates as keys

1068
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,220
The most program uses a weak source for random data and the time and date at the moment of encryption

1069
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:35,520
So it can be figured. Yeah, they just they just seed it with the current date. Yeah, and there you go and they

1070
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,900
Encrypt it with an RSA

1071
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,540
Private key here, but you don't even need it because you can just guess it

1072
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,820
Yeah, the timestamp is easy to determine by looking at when the ASP files were created on the disk

1073
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:50,300
Therefore researchers were able to reverse the process and recover the AS keys without needing to decrypt them

1074
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:57,060
Making the RSA public key and private keys essentially pointless the tool is created and released by bit defender. It's a script written in

1075
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,380
Python

1076
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:05,180
That determines the initialization vectors NES encryption keys by analyzing the files encrypted by ransomware program

1077
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:09,500
And the decrypts the files and fixes the permissions even fixes your permissions guys

1078
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:15,420
It mods your files for you. If you can boot your compromised operating system download script and run under the root user

1079
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:21,500
You're okay to go. Okay, if you can put any Linux live CD, yeah, you know how to mount a drive exactly exactly

1080
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,780
The first little is hard guys, you know, I wanted to come on the show

1081
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,980
I want to talk about the first Linux ransomware

1082
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:34,460
I wanted to tell you that it was a it was a it was a real scary thing you guys

1083
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:39,420
I mean, I'm not saying I wanted to come on this show and I wanted to be all like Alex Jones up in this space

1084
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,200
What's driving me crazy is that photo right there zoom in on that

1085
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,180
It's one of those cops in a black uniform with a mustache and you just look like an absolute clown freak

1086
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,900
That works for murdering terrorists the jack our food and water. I think you're a big joke

1087
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,040
But no, it turns out your Linux boxes are completely safe

1088
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040
completely safe

1089
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,060
But mustaches are not

1090
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:05,800
All right. So I wanted to talk about one more thing before I wrap up today this, you know Linux unplugged show

1091
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,740
It's a community show. It sure is. We got our virtual lug here

1092
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:16,880
Bunch of handsome assholes beautiful, you know, we need some ladies to come in here to represent. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah go to jblive.tv

1093
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,540
We do this show to a 2 a.m. Oh my god 2 p.m

1094
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,540
Pacific over on likely that's like, you know in the best time zone ever

1095
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:30,220
But if you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar will convert that to your time zone for you automatically all sentient beings are welcome

1096
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:34,740
If you're sentient, yeah, you know, you can think for yourself. You run Linux. Can I come hang out? Can I make an asterisk?

1097
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:39,140
Yes, and your microphone. Yes. Okay, you need a microphone. You need it to be interference free

1098
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,940
You need to not listen to the live stream while you try to talk to us

1099
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,980
That's all of these things and then you can please please join us

1100
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,300
All right, so anyways before we moved on I

1101
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,160
Wanted to talk a little about a little bit of community drama

1102
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,680
Because this seems like the show to do it. It's the unplugged show. We got to talk a little bit about things

1103
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:03,380
But here is something that I don't know what to process and maybe something the moment room can chime in

1104
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,600
but it appears to be that there is a bit of

1105
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:12,140
Controversy in the Debian community and this is coming from the developer of the Debian live releases is

1106
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,640
And it is permanently halting. He says that Debian live is dead

1107
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:23,480
Hi jacked by the Debian CD and the Debian installer teams. The Debian live server will shut down at the end of the month

1108
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:30,200
Get repositories will go read only as of now and are mirrored to a github for archival

1109
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:36,080
So long and thanks for all the fish. Now Debian live is the basis of a lot of distributions live CDs

1110
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:42,720
And it seems to be pretty upsetting and it appears to be with the result of a bit of an in-project

1111
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:48,400
Controversy where there was things that were not happening. Like oh, I don't know you EFI support

1112
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:54,160
What not that Chris right and so Debian live CD and G was created

1113
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,960
Which sort of added some of these features

1114
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,360
but the original developer of the Debian live CD project wasn't notified and

1115
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:06,360
When he found out it was based on a pull request that referenced the new project

1116
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,320
Not a great way to find out no upstream patches or you know, nothing submitted to him. Yeah. Yeah

1117
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,120
This is a you know

1118
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:19,960
Debian seems to get these where there's many sides and it's kind of just a complex human problem, you know

1119
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,400
It's very much is open source community and it can be hard to do these, you know, some things need to happen

1120
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,120
But it's it's hard. Yeah. Yeah, like they have to move on right?

1121
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:36,040
But at the same time like they have the same difficulties that all of us who have difficulty to having difficult social interactions

1122
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,840
I'm exactly yes

1123
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:43,240
And so I don't anybody the moment before we open this up anybody the moment of have immediate thoughts on today's story about Debian

1124
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
live being dead

1125
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,120
It just sounds like a lot of overreaction

1126
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,800
How so

1127
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,240
Well, I think that

1128
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,760
You know the Debian live maintainer could have been a bit more diplomatic about it, you know, if I was in issues

1129
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:06,200
Yes, I would be a little bit upset that I wasn't notified about it, but I'm not gonna

1130
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,680
Reject somebody else's work

1131
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,360
And it does sound like he has had some

1132
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:16,960
Diplomatic issues in the past. Yeah, that is all honestly something that I've picked up on to

1133
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,280
And it seems like some basic communication stuff might have been missed both ways perhaps

1134
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,060
Yes, exactly. And now we have this and unfortunately though

1135
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:32,200
Who's really affected our end users and specifically Debian stable users who don't really stay up to date on the day-to-day stuff like this

1136
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:38,280
They're depending on it to be stable. Yeah, and it is an interesting development. Any other thoughts in the moment before we wrap up? I

1137
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,560
Think it's kind of unfortunate

1138
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,480
But I don't really think it's a big deal if you have an owner who doesn't want to play nice with people who submit patches

1139
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:50,860
Then they're going to fork your project. That's just kind of inevitable. I mean, that's sort of the point really. Yeah

1140
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,640
Cognizant of it. I feel like he should have been aware. They were doing this. It probably wasn't you know, completely behind his back

1141
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,640
I'm sure there was talk about it. And

1142
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,400
And so I'm sure it wasn't just all of a sudden. Oh one day. Here's this project that no one knew about it

1143
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Has all these patches contributed to it?

1144
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,560
Right, right

1145
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,360
There is some sort of pressure in the open source world

1146
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,720
If you don't make yours your branch the best then you get what else's will be very much

1147
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,720
So it isn't that in some ways?

1148
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:20,320
Exactly. Exactly. That's just what I was gonna say. Isn't that in the long term exactly what we want? Yeah

1149
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:26,200
Yeah, go ahead and his response is actually kind of Braddish, you know, he could have just said oh, well

1150
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,900
Maybe I shouldn't be the owner anymore and I can hit it off to all these guys who clink they know

1151
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,800
You know what the correct direction for this project is

1152
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,080
Shutting it all down and for them to go with the fork instead of allowing them to take over this original name and continue on

1153
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:44,000
Yeah, the lineage. Yeah, although I do wish there could have been more communication up front

1154
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,420
Yeah, just a notch of waste labor to you know, help. Yeah and avoid really the story. Yeah

1155
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,480
Yeah, I have a theory as to why these problems keep happening though

1156
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Go ahead

1157
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,360
So I think a lot of it is and I've noticed that it's personality conflicts

1158
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:06,440
And I really have to wonder if these people have any experience in jobs where they work with people

1159
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:14,120
maybe they don't have that experience like working with customers and whatnot and just dealing with angry upset people and how to

1160
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:19,720
Yeah, calm them down. You know saying everyone should have to perform a customer service job in their life

1161
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:24,760
Then I would agree with that. I will tell you the people the sys admins that have at one point in their life as they

1162
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,040
Worked the chain up that worked in the help desk position or the knock or the whatever

1163
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,100
They are absolutely the best admins like because they they have spent a year or two

1164
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,640
Understanding the end-users perspective and no matter how intellectually you are know how good you are

1165
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:45,320
Visualizing and tell you've actually worked that role you don't understand and it really does make a difference. That's a good point, too

1166
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:50,440
All right. Well, I'd like to hear your points linuxactionshow.reddit.com. Go find the next unplugged episode

1167
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,920
118 and leave us your feedback. Maybe you have another viewpoint, you know

1168
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,120
You could also join us live and give us your view your viewpoint

1169
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,560
We mentioned yeah Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that in your local time zone

1170
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:08,380
And don't forget we want to get your opinions on open Sousa leap. Have you been trying it out?

1171
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,140
Let us know. In fact, you can even join us live next week

1172
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:17,480
I should be back from system 76 in Denver, Colorado, and you can join our mumble room and let us know

1173
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:22,440
Or you can go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact or even better Linux action show dot reddit

1174
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,880
Comm West is anywhere you want to point you buddy this week. Not this week. Come on, man

1175
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,840
Come on something Twitter account something. I do have a Twitter account. I'm also noble pain in the IRC

1176
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,200
Oh, I got some more content coming your way. Nice noble pain in there

1177
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:40,160
I like it for that next week. Very nice jblive.tv for live shows Linux action show dot reddit.com for content

1178
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,160
Thanks everybody. See you right back here next week

1179
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,440
I've never installed you know slash looks

1180
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
It's for people who like

1181
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,400
If you and you know who you are if you're somebody doesn't want to mess with I just want to surf

1182
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:12,520
I just want to buy something on Amazon send an email to my kids look at some websites

1183
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,120
That's you you don't want to mess with it

1184
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,840
Probably

1185
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,400
I

1186
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,040
Think the Chromebooks are a good choice

1187
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:28,080
I think a new version of Windows would be fine Windows 8 if you can afford it a Macintosh if you've got even more money

1188
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,920
That's a good choice

1189
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,920
It's only for the enthusiasts that I'd recommend

1190
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,560
Ubuntu

1191
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:40,840
There you go. All right. All right, Jimmy titles calm. Let's name this sucker a great turnout in the mobile room

1192
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,440
Thanks everybody really appreciate it. Yeah, you guys make the show

1193
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,600
Definitely definitely

1194
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,880
I feel like we could basically turn them on and then if we just gave them a couple ideas and walked away, right?

1195
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,920
We can you and I go get some tacos and we be fine. You come back you rant a little yeah

1196
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,980
Charged up again, and then and then it's good

1197
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,920
Usually when that happens it turns into a text editor action show

1198
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:08,120
Yeah, nice. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah, Jimmy titles calm. Jim. Tell calm everybody boat

1199
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,880
Taking a leap mate

1200
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,080
Sport no

1201
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:21,200
So Chris you mentioned installing Spotify on Ubuntu and you had to grab an old

1202
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,600
Yeah, like live

1203
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,880
G-crypt one one. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Look, I'm just gonna paste the link

1204
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,320
This is probably the website that you read on the Spotify Linux download page. Yeah

1205
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,580
That was where I started which kind of sent me down the wrong direction really

1206
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,200
Yeah, so here's the thing that the the little bit of text in there is the word currently 1404

1207
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,520
Yes information is relative to 1404 but in those instructions

1208
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,680
They say at this repository and there is the word stable

1209
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:03,120
if you change stable for testing you get a secret source

1210
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,160
Not only that but it's the it's the 1.0 release and it's got the 32-bit and 64-bit

1211
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,760
Packages in there the whole thing and good to know

1212
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:25,000
Yeah, and that's what that's what welcome does behind the scene is turn that repository on very nice. Thank you. Good to know

1213
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,760
I will I will I will keep that in mind for future deployments, but it's worth knowing for check-in

1214
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:35,920
I haven't looked in the AUR packages, but if there's Spotify packages in the AUR if they're not grabbing them from

1215
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,460
The testing repository grabbing the devs from the testing repository

1216
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:48,660
Then they're probably also pulling in, you know G-crypt one one, but that means you're getting like naught point nine something of Spotify

1217
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:52,360
But I'm running like one point fifteen or something at the moment

1218
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,480
So, okay, and it's nice. The new version is sort of like feature parity. Yes

1219
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,840
I did I did notice that on my arch desktops. The new version is much better

1220
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,720
Oh, well, it looks like someone in arch has already figured this out in which case yes

1221
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,660
Yes, but good to know very very much. So actually thank you

1222
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,800
Well, you can pull pull in. Hey citizen kids and kitty and North Ranger. They've all been I know that they all have good mics

1223
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,560
Well, actually, I don't know about hey citizen. Oh, hey citizen has the annoyingly best mic here. Oh, really?

1224
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:26,400
That's really nice. Oh, I want to hear I haven't heard it yet. Yeah, so do I cuz yeah, it's telling me about yeah

1225
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:31,160
Yeah, yeah drag him down in here. Let's see. Yeah. Hey citizen. Let me hear it. Let me hear it. Hey, okay

1226
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,160
Hello, hey citizen. Hey

1227
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,160
Now hey citizen, are you a podcaster yourself?

1228
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,200
No, you're shitting me the why do you have such a good mic just to make you feel bad

1229
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,320
Well, you should host a podcast you're hired

1230
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,680
What what equipment do you have

1231
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:56,520
You know just a cheap sound card and this mic. I bought like ten years ago when I was in a band

1232
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:03,040
Until recently. Yeah, it was an old old mic from a stage

1233
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:09,640
There's like also though. There is a like a five percent reverb that gives you a little tiny bit of God voice

1234
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,880
So you sound like very authoritative like you could just you chime in with a teensy-teensy

1235
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,000
Bit to echo and it really works for you. We're all intimidated courtesy of Jack

1236
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:28,040
So you're using Jack to do your EQ and stuff. Oh, yes. Yeah, that's my it's working so good. Yeah

1237
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,280
Yeah, I might be why you sound so good. It's almost worth tinkering with Jack, isn't it?

1238
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,160
Yeah, it almost really is I should yeah, it's really rock-solid

1239
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:44,360
Hmm. So what what what distro you're using and how did you persuade Jack to work with mumble?

1240
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:51,880
Um, well on arch there's actually a package in the AUR, which is a mumble git

1241
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:56,520
Of course and mumble jack. Yes. Of course. There is yeah

1242
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,520
So that's for a current that's for a current version of mumble because I've heard people talk about this adapted

1243
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:09,080
Version, but it's usually like one dot two zero or something quite old, but you must be running a current version

1244
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,200
Yeah, one point three point. Oh

1245
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
There we go. So

1246
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:22,360
Well, it's all lies everything I've heard about the jack version not being available for a current version of mumble then that's just lies

1247
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,040
Yeah, it's it's it's in the arch user repository as a god dash voice and you just go ahead and

1248
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:33,640
What's the what's the difference between uh jack and lapsta plugins or whatever they're called

1249
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,120
Are they the same thing at all?

1250
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:41,320
Well, those plugins are are what you use in jack to uh, oh, yeah effects

1251
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,160
Hmm

1252
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,400
Okay, I need to spend some time with jack. Yep, me too. Oh, okay. So they are the same system

1253
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:53,400
Well, yeah ladspa, which I think now has been replaced with uh, lv2

1254
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:58,520
Um, those are like a protocol. It's kind of like vst you have instruments and effects

1255
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,480
Hmm actually, um citizen, I think you've lost a bit of the base that you had

1256
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:07,160
You know when we told you to turn it into an am radio the other day to make us feel better

1257
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:11,720
I think you didn't turn it back to exactly how it was before you've lost some of your low end

1258
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,760
A bit. Oh, really?

1259
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,800
This just won't do

1260
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:28,360
Hmm this just won't do yeah. Yeah, is this a bit better? Oh, there you go. Whoa. Whoa. Oh no

1261
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:32,760
Okay, so apparently I should throw away thousands of dollars worth of gear and just use jack audio

1262
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:48,620
Yeah, hashtag puppy wants it deeper
