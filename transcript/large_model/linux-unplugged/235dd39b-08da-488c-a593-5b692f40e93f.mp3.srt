1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Okay Wes, I'm almost there. This will be the last machine, and then they're all

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:17,320
gonna be Ubuntu. Are you ready? Oh yeah! What? Uh-oh. Oh no.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:36,640
We better ask Noah. This is Linux Unplugged episode 223 for November 14, 2017.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux sole injection. Now featuring a

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,360
hundred percent more of Chris, Rekai, Wes, myself, and of course the Mumble Room. This

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,000
hour we're going to take your phone calls, 1-855-450-6624, and welcome

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,360
everyone. Welcome Chris, welcome Wes. I'm welcoming you guys to your own show. I'm

8
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,640
kind of the guest, right? No, you're here Noah, and you're saving the day for us.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,360
It's a Fedora 27 Extravagant. Blowout! And you know what? It's funny, as a

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,040
Fedora guy, I'm the only person as one of the hosts that's not actually running

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,640
Fedora 27. So how pathetic is that? Noah, to make it up for you, all three of us are

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,560
running 27 right now in the studio. How many people in the Mumble Room, hello

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:33,400
Mumble Room, how many of you are running Fedora 27? Yep. Oh my gosh. Long day.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Every day, all day, of course. Well I think this is going to be a super fun

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,560
show. I don't, I think we've only done one other episode of Linux Unplugged where

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,920
we've had a bunch of us all in the studio because sometimes it's not even,

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,360
it's not even technically possible because there are only so many

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
microphones that we have when we're all together, right? And so this is, and if

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I'm filling in, oftentimes you're out of town or you're traveling. So this is the

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,520
first time we've actually gotten together for this, you know, big Linux

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,880
party, so to speak. Yeah, it's pretty cool and we have a great turnout in the

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,760
Mumble Room this week, including, I'm very excited to say, we have a special guest

23
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,400
from the Fedora Project who will be chatting with us a little bit. Dan from

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,960
Elementary OS just had himself quite the interview and we'll talk to Dan a little

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,560
bit about that, but we also just have like a great showing, like Popey and

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Wimpy pulled themselves away from Rust to be here with us guys. I'm very excited

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
about that. That's, that's great. And Kits and Kitty, I'm actually playing Rust whilst we're in the

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
Mumble Room, by the way. Yeah, we didn't pull ourselves away. Yeah, okay. I should have known. And Kits and Kitty's here.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,320
I don't, I kept, Kits and Kitty, I can't remember how long it's been since you've

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,280
been here, but I'm, it may even been last week, but I'm excited. Either way, Noah,

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,840
it's gonna be a good show. I agree. So starting off, the first thing that

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,120
we're talking about today is Firefox Quantum. So tell me, you know, as a

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Firefox user, you get to enlighten me because I don't know what Firefox

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,880
Quantum is. Oh geez. Oh, oh, it's, it's Quantum Day, Noah. It's not, it's not

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:05,000
just Firefox 57. Today is and shall ever be remembered as Quantum Day. And it's,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,960
this is it. This is where Mozilla realized that they could bunch up a bunch

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,800
of features all at once and actually get everybody excited about their browser

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,080
for a chance, for a change, and really make a big splash. No, no, no, no. I'm not

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,480
being critical. What I'm saying is Mozilla really figured this shit out. Like,

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,280
okay, they have, they have staged a bunch of fundamental changes to the browser. A

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
new UI. They've switched back to Google for the default search. And the Quantum

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,080
part, the Quantum part refers to a brand new way of getting shit done in Firefox.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,320
It's twice as fast as the previous version of Firefox. It has a new CSS

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,040
engine, supports multi-process architecture so you can prioritize for

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,080
different CPUs, different jobs. You can have properly sandboxed and isolated

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:00,600
tabs. And it is significantly faster for the same, essentially, yes, for

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,880
essentially the same memory footprint. It's, that's fantastic. It's the version

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,040
of Firefox we've all been waiting for since Chrome was released.

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, so I, I don't know if I've been waiting. I don't know if I've been

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,240
necessarily waiting for that, but it is nice to see Firefox starting to step up

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,880
and compete on in some of the same ways that Chrome has been competitive because

52
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,720
you know, as a person and I've bound, you have to, but we've both bounced back and

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,880
forth between Chrome and Firefox. And for me, we kind of, we're opposite, right?

54
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
I primarily stick to Firefox and every once in a while I try that Chrome thing

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,960
out. In fact, I'm using Chrome today, but there are legitimately performance

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,160
things that I notice anytime I'm using Chrome that just don't exist in Firefox.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,360
To me, it feels sturdier. It feels faster. It feels like the pages pop faster than

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Chrome. Um, I don't have all of my extensions yet, which has always, has

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,080
always been my, sort of my, my problem, but I'm trying to just come up with

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,040
other ways to do that stuff. It's pretty, it's pretty nice, Noah.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,600
Huh. Well, that is exciting. I, you know, I knew that today was national pickle

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,560
day. I did not know that today was national quantum day for Firefox. But

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,640
today I learned.

64
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,640
In the show notes, I put a link to a blog post at hacks.mozilla.org and they

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,080
talk about, um, everything. But the things that I like the most is they talk

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,960
about laying the foundation for what they call coarse grained parallelism. And,

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,280
um, it's, it feels like, uh, it feels like they, they looked at what Chrome's

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,360
doing and they went, shit, we really have a problem here. We've got to really

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,440
fundamentally fix this. And instead of pulling like a Microsoft approach where

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,800
they just sort of like back port fixes to windows and windows just keeps getting

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,160
a bigger and bigger beast that can do more stuff. They really did like a house

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,920
cleaning here. They went through and they broke some stuff and they reinvented

73
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,880
some stuff and they replaced some stuff and they redesigned the UI and they, and

74
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,200
then they, and then very clever, very clever for the Mozilla project. They,

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,760
they saved it all up for this big release, this big quantum release and they

76
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,800
gave it a name and of course that's from the quantum engine. They gave it, they

77
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
gave it this whole spin. It's been, we've been talking about it for months now and

78
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,320
it all landed and by doing so it gave them time to test and refine the

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,760
features. So they were ready for launch and it gave everyone a common target to

80
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,480
look at for Firefox. Yeah. And it gives you a night and day experience. If, as

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,120
long as you don't have any extensions that block the quantum engine, it really

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,360
gives you a night and day experience. And it uses, at least on my machines, it

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,160
uses less memory than Chrome. Okay. So here's, here's really the, here's really

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
the bottom line question. Who out there, and I'm kind of looking at you guys

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,440
mumble room, who out there is currently a Chrome user and is now as a result of,

86
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,480
of this news considering switching back to Firefox? That would be me. Okay, tell

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,440
me about it. Yeah. Tell me about it. Well, well, you know, if they claim to be faster,

88
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,960
I really want to look at it and see if they claim to be, if they claim to be

89
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,840
faster and they actually are, if they've got a new, they've got me switching back

90
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,120
after probably several years. Yeah. So what does, what does Firefox offer you

91
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,040
that you're, that you're willing to jump ship on, on a working platform? What does

92
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,520
Firefox offer you that's above and beyond? Why is it that if both are doing

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
the same thing, basically we're saying is Firefox has caught up. Why then are you

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,200
going to jump off Chrome to come back to Firefox? Well, one thing I've noticed is

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,120
that Chrome can get very laggy as it goes, because like if you have a ton of

96
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,280
open tabs, it will actually bog down your processor because it is actually

97
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,360
literally running each tab in a process. Chrome seems to be streamlining out into

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,840
like shared processes per tab. See, you know what I'm saying? So if it is, if it

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,400
truly is faster and more efficient on the memory, more efficient on the CPU,

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,520
then that gives me more power to do other things like video editing or audio

101
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,200
production, that kind of thing. Okay, that makes sense. Anyone else? I'm looking at

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,520
partly. Okay. Who was it that spoke up? One of our friends across the pond? I

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,080
think it's been me. Okay. Sort of a switching over from, I think when they

104
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,840
went Firefox 56, which was the recent speed up, I've sort of been about, from

105
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,040
Chrome going to about 5050 between Chrome and Firefox. Some of it is just

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,920
partly to half de-Googlify stuff and give support back to Firefox as a

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,160
competition against Google. Right, and that's my, that's my position on it too,

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,760
is a large reason that a large portion of the reason that I put up with some of

109
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,440
the things I put up with in Firefox is largely because I like the organization,

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
I like what they do, I like what they stand for, I like their principles, and I

111
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,160
want to support that. And I am willing to sacrifice a certain amount of features

112
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,040
and a certain amount of usability, I guess, is what it really amounts to. I

113
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
mean, that's the truth. I'm willing to sacrifice some of those things. You know

114
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,320
that means that's bad. They cannot, that cannot factor in at all in their

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,840
strategy. Not a single tiny itsy bit. If that's what they're relying on, then they're not

116
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,960
going to get adoption. I agree from a business standpoint, however, I think that

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,880
they have earned enough good, because there was a time before Chrome was ever

118
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,520
even a thing, where the Mozilla, where Firefox was my retreat away from

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Internet Explorer, and they bought themselves so much, so much buy-in

120
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,960
capital with that from me personally, and as I continue, you know, there's so many

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
things that the Mozilla Corporation does, that all of their meetings are open

122
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,840
meetings. Anyone can attend a Mozilla meeting. I think they have a phone

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,320
number you can dial up, or they have an online web stream, and you can just

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
listen to what they're talking about, their line of thinking, how

125
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,280
they're thinking. I mean, they're a very transparent organization, as opposed to

126
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,560
Google, which is very much not a transparent organization. And so today, if

127
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,240
we're saying that, you know, as the as the as Firefox becomes a technically

128
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,480
competitive product against Chrome, then I think they really start to hold their

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,800
own to be able to say, look, now we have the technical features, plus we have all

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,680
this really good community offering. Yeah. Well, not only that, Noah, but also it

131
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,880
seems like if I'm in the enterprise, this is the horse I want to bet on if I'm

132
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,760
building internal applications that are dependent on a browser. Chrome is very,

133
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,240
is very, is, is, everything's built around Chrome now. Like, you look at all these

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,520
electron apps, it's, they're really all built around Chrome and Chromium. But if I'm

135
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,280
in the enterprise, and I'm looking at building applications around a browser, I

136
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,160
would, at this point, I would be much more inclined to go with Mozilla's

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,200
products simply because what the foundation's purpose is, don't you think?

138
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,880
Like, you can try, you have a lot more trust, and just that they won't suddenly

139
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,620
change what they're doing. You have access to this act or secret sauce if

140
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,480
you need it. Yeah, exactly. So I'm not hearing much from from Rika. I know

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Rika, you're a really strong Chrome user, real strong proponent of Chrome. What do

142
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,720
you think about this? I'm not gonna change. Okay, that's fair. There's no

143
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,780
real reason for me to do so. I like Chrome and a lot of the extensions that

144
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,000
I use on Chrome aren't available on Firefox. Yeah, I think there's a couple

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
people in that boat. I definitely heard some people just around the office chatting

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,960
about it who I wouldn't say are that interested in browsers. I mean, they are

147
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,640
technical people, but I was, I was kind of surprised. I will say for my own usage

148
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,740
as well that I already use Firefox and Chrome, you know, I have a, I use Google

149
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,920
apps, etc. But I think Firefox is gonna be even more of a part of my life, and

150
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,720
there'll be some systems where I probably will just drop Chrome altogether.

151
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah. Popeye, I don't know if you're willing to talk about this on the air,

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,840
but you have a very interesting workflow that Firefox is not currently capable of

153
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,920
mimicking. Is that something you'd be willing to talk about? Well, yeah. So I

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,920
use Chrome all day every day, and I use lots and lots of separate profiles,

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,240
separate users in Chrome. And I like the way that Chrome lets me click a button,

156
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,560
switch to another user, and I'll have a completely separate browser window with

157
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
multiple tabs. Everything's saved for that user, which has a separate Gmail

158
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,840
account. Everything is completely separate cookies. And whilst Firefox, I am

159
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,080
told, can do this. And every time I try this, there are various extensions and

160
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,600
ways and command-line options that let you do this. It's never as smooth as it

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,640
is in Chrome. And, and I, what I want is a browser which is my work window to the

162
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,040
world, and a browser which is my personal window to the world, and then another 10

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
for my other online personalities that I have. And Firefox just can't do that,

164
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,400
and Chrome does. And what's funny is, you know, so aside from the puppet account

165
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,480
thing, what's interesting about that is I think you are willing to push the

166
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,520
envelope a lot further than the average user, even the average technical user is

167
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,040
going to do. Because I can tell you, I'm a fairly technical person. There is no way

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,920
in this earth I'm going to sit there and open up terminals to start launching my

169
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,280
web browser just to get, you know, it's just not practical for me. And I think

170
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,240
there's a lot of people, so I think if you aren't able to fit that into your

171
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,360
your workflow, I think anyone else that has that similar, you know, concept of

172
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,760
they want to have online personas, and I think a lot of people do, I think those

173
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,440
people are hosed. At least, I think I'm just as lazy as the next guy. I want an

174
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,280
easy way to separate one bunch of work from another set of work. On a

175
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,560
Friday night when it's five o'clock, I want to be able to close an entire

176
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,160
window and all of my work disappears. So I can say I don't have to

177
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,560
worry about email notifications or tabs that have documents in that are related

178
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,240
to my work. I can just forget those as soon as I close that tab. Now I realize

179
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm a bit of a special snowflake because my my work machine is my personal

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,840
machine. Yeah, and I know that's not the same as use cases. Most people have a

181
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,440
work machine and a personal machine. I would say that that landscape is

182
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,600
changing. I would say that the vast, there's a lot of people that are working

183
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,320
from home, and I think a lot of those people are going to wind up with some of

184
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,240
the with some of the same challenges and desires that you have. And I'll tell you

185
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,640
what's interesting about working from home, because I do it too. It

186
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,240
becomes so important to be able to distinguish this is home and this I'm

187
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,040
spending personal time and I am doing working time. And when you're

188
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
working from home the best way to do that, if you can, is to have separate

189
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
machines. But the problem with having separate machines is oftentimes they are

190
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,080
expensive. And so one of the advents that has come along in the past couple years

191
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,920
that has really opened us up to be able to play with things, especially those of

192
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,240
us that that are doing things from home and are trying to do simultaneous

193
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,800
different projects, is obviously the ARM architecture. And up until recently I

194
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
have had this issue where I I'm deploying Red Hat all day long and I'm

195
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,680
deploying CentOS all day long and all these servers and then I get home and I'm

196
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,280
like, and this just happened just a couple months ago, we were testing an EMR

197
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,960
for a clinic and they said can you set it up and just show us kind of how it

198
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,480
worked. So sure, so I'm kind of setting everything up and kind of got

199
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,600
everything set up on a Raspberry Pi because they're cheap and they work. The

200
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,520
problem was when we went to actually put it into production, we had to end up

201
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,680
exporting out all of these, you know, SQL templates stuff because I couldn't just

202
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,360
move everything over because it was it was the ARM port of it. It wasn't the it

203
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,280
wasn't it wasn't binarily compatible with the x86 processor that that they

204
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,640
were going to use in production. And and so what Red Hat has announced today blew

205
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,880
me away because it's going to in a large way change a lot of that. And this is

206
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,000
from Red Hat themselves. Red Hat has announced Enterprise Linux for ARM. So

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,400
the article goes on to say today marks a milestone for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

208
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,080
with the addition of a new architecture on our list that fully supports

209
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,920
platforms. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for ARM is a part of our multi-architect

210
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,760
strategy, the culmination of a multi-year collaboration with upstream

211
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,080
community and our silicon and hardware parties. And so the article goes on to

212
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,600
talk about how Red Hat basically took this pragmatic approach to ARM servers.

213
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,480
And I remember, and Chris and I were talking about this earlier today, Linus

214
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,600
said that a couple years ago that one of the things that excited him about ARM

215
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,600
was he believed it was a true competitor to Intel in a way that he hadn't seen

216
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
since back in the old back in the old Mac days when they were on a different

217
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,280
architecture all together. And and and now we have a true competitor to Intel.

218
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,000
And at the time I was kind of skeptical of that. I was like are you kidding?

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,040
Because the ARM like basically at the time was like the thing that was running

220
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,040
inside of cell phones. This couldn't do anything serious. And then year after

221
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,520
year I've watched these things literally double in power until just last year I

222
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,600
think we were doing our for last we were doing our review of the latest Ubuntu

223
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Mate and lo and behold I was installing the same operating system on my

224
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,200
Raspberry Pi for $35 Amazon Prime available that I was installing inside

225
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,360
of my studio. And it's just it's just this mind warp that I just couldn't get

226
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,840
over. And I know Chris you you as a person in the studio I mean how many

227
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,920
different computers are you sitting in front of? You can put your hand on

228
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,880
probably eight of them right now. You know the thing that I think you touched

229
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,640
on there that really is just un it's just it's an impossible force for Intel

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,120
to deal with is because ARM processors are in all of these routers and all of

231
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,760
these little tiny devices and all of these lady tubes and obviously in all of

232
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,240
these phones. Yeah they're lady tubes. No I know I just I think of something else

233
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,480
until I figure out what we're talking about. This is my safe way of not

234
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,160
triggering them because people they're listening to the podcast they get

235
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,640
really frustrated when you trigger their lady tubes. So I just refer to it plus

236
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,600
it's it can be the Google it could be the it could be the. There's all kinds of

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,680
annoying people in tubes these days. And there's a lot of annoying lady tubes so

238
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,640
in fact they're all kind of annoying in their own unique way. Oh yeah. And the

239
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,400
thing is all of them have ARM processors every damn cell phone though that's

240
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
really the thing right every cell phone has the ARM processor in it and this has

241
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,200
caused a momentum of investment and year-over-year improvement in a

242
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,520
platform that Intel and AMD just can't simply sustain on the x86 side they just

243
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,160
can't compete with that. Now they're so far ahead that it hasn't really mattered

244
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,080
but the thing about these ARM CPUs is damn if they don't work great together

245
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,280
because you can write and use modern operating systems to sort of carve out a

246
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,280
few of these cores and so you have companies like Cray and Qualicom that

247
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,040
are launching 48 core systems oh boy 48 core ARM systems and they don't carve

248
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,800
they don't they don't even I mean Noah you and I were chatting about this

249
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,200
earlier they don't they don't really cost that much. No they start out at

250
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,280
lowest price I found and this isn't for the 48 core I think this is 30

251
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
something cores 20 something cores 30 something cores but they start at 900

252
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,400
bucks and then for the 48 core version you're looking at like just under 2k but

253
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,160
you know the core is 2k but if you compared that to what you would what you

254
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,720
would pay for just just just a quad core Xeon you know that's that's half the

255
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,440
price of what I pay for some of the servers that that we we have that have

256
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,940
four cores in it so the the amount of computing power that you're getting per

257
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,720
dollar and then you know we haven't even talked about the energy because the the

258
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,880
power consumption of these ARM devices is just a fraction of what they are on

259
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,040
Intel or you know or AMD and so and and then by then by proxy then or by

260
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,960
translation the heat that is output by a lot of these ARM devices is a fraction

261
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
that's a big thing and then the fans are quite easy right yeah it means well it

262
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,800
means less cost for the data center to run cooling and while these per core I

263
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,960
think beard is probably about to say this while these per core don't compete

264
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,120
with an Intel or an AMD chip yet the thing is is you can you can build core

265
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,400
specific jobs so you can slice off 20 or 24 or whatever the cores for this

266
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,440
particular application that you've custom written for this job well I can

267
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,120
also think of like any number of servers I run and or have that it's not like

268
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,920
they're at their peak performance all the time a lot of times they're just

269
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,720
sitting there and if you could just have a especially if maybe you're running

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,800
some sort of maybe you're running a chat server something else that has a high

271
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,720
degree of parallelism but doesn't actually do that much it's mostly just

272
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,960
sending keepalives between the million clients connected to it these seem like

273
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,280
great fits for anything like that yeah now can I just say all of this aside and

274
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,400
and much congratulations to the Red Hat folks for getting full Red Hat

275
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,440
enterprise support behind this platform which is I think a huge milestone for

276
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,640
the industry in general I also part of me has to say welcome to the party by

277
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,600
the way a lot of us have been here for quite a while now especially those that

278
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,480
are Debian based or Ubuntu based and then you look at some projects like the

279
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,440
canonical has that like specifically some of the like long-term investments

280
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,300
that some projects have made into working on ARM platforms into into

281
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,160
really solid upgrades on those platforms and delivering software it I mean it's

282
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,280
good that they're here but I kind of wonder what took them so long at the

283
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,560
same time if actually I wouldn't mind commenting on that actually yeah sure go

284
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,440
ahead go ahead Christian yeah so so as you know Red Hat the business model of

285
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,560
Reddit right is that you sell a as called the standards operating system

286
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,240
that you traditionally have installed on x86 systems and I think for anyone who

287
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,640
worked with ARM in the past right it's historically been you know highly

288
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,040
custom platforms where you basically like you get some sort of Linux version

289
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,320
from usually the hardware vendor and it's a lot of manual tweaking to get it

290
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,200
to running and maintain it and then ship your device right with with this

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
Linux version and and of course when you need to do an update it is usually a

292
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,320
bit painful so so when Red Hat decided to enter this market one thing that we've

293
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,960
spent a lot of time doing was actually working to ensure that there is a

294
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,960
standardized platform we deploy towards so oh so so I mean like the fact that

295
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,480
this ARM service will be using UEFI that's partially because we said you

296
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,240
know we need a standard way to boot the systems you don't want to you don't deal

297
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,680
with ten different bootloaders on ten different platforms Christian if it

298
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,560
would it be an accurate to state would it be an accurate statement then to say

299
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,200
that some of the delay was Red Hat dragging the industry towards some

300
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,200
standards yeah I mean it was working with you know Linaro and the industry

301
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,520
partners to say that okay you know we are happy to put Red Hat's name as an

302
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,840
enterprise hardware software vendor behind this but we also need you to then step

303
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,120
to the plate and say that hey we're going to have a standards platform that

304
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,880
you can install a standard operating system on you don't need to have a

305
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,120
bespoke operating system to install it because I mean Red Hat is not I mean

306
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,440
I don't even say this but Red Hat doesn't really have an interest in going

307
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,960
into you know the bespoke OS market you know that it's interesting because that

308
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,120
seems to align with what my perception of Red Hat and a lot of times if I'm

309
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,200
being honest is a lot of times what is what pushes Red Hat to the top of the

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,720
list anytime I'm sitting in front of a university board you know or what have

311
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,920
you is that if something is put out by Red Hat I know that it's mature

312
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,000
technology and I know there's there's an argument to be had here about system D

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,400
but but for the most part when when Red Hat put something forward here they're

314
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,900
usually one of the later adopters they're not one of the you know the the

315
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,240
cutting-edge pioneers at least not on Red Hat Enterprise so what you're

316
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
describing seems to fit with what my perception has been and again that's

317
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
just I'm just some guy talking about you know my experience but that's what I

318
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,500
have seen mumble room who else in here is is interested in who would deploy Red

319
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,480
Hat Enterprise an enterprise operating system on an ARM architecture what does

320
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
this change anything for you or is this something that you say well like Chris

321
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
said you know Debian's had it for a while canonical has had it for a while

322
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,400
so this is it's really nothing new this really doesn't give us a tool we didn't

323
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,240
have in the toolbox anyone the problem the problem is probably that people are

324
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,120
not using ARM architecture on business level right now but that might change

325
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,080
soon I think so I think I think it is going to change soon I don't think it's

326
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,160
I mean everybody's been predicting this over and over again but you now have

327
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,320
Cray you have Qualcomm I mean you have a lot of big players they're saying we're

328
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,760
not replacing x86 but if you have an application specific task for us we're

329
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,040
ready to go it also seems like it might lower that entry right because like well

330
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,840
we weren't even considering it before but suddenly if we can run the same OS

331
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,960
we can use very similar image versions from the people who maintain that no

332
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,080
like we have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's that run TVs at my office right we

333
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,120
already had that option if if we were a rel shop now that would that would be

334
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,720
great right and so that that's actually what I was about to say was I

335
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,280
respectfully disagree that that arm doesn't have a strong foothold and in a

336
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,560
wide foothold inside of an enterprise audience I think where that where it

337
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,960
best fits though is in a lot of you know appliance type applications but but but

338
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,440
in that same way and kind of what you were touching on Wes is in that same way

339
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,060
a lot of these a lot of these platform systems if you have software stacks and

340
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,960
you have you know management systems for us that was really big our remote

341
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,800
management system to log into systems and pull statistics and all of that when

342
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,000
they came out with an arm port that was huge for us because we could then enroll

343
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,680
all of those arm systems that we had even if they're just appliances into

344
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,080
that central management system and so I would imagine that there are tons of

345
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,380
businesses out there like you said they're either rel shops or they have

346
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,880
custom software that runs on rel and they can say now we had these kind of

347
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,800
one-off appliances that were out here that were on arm if we switched

348
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,000
operating systems we could then have all of those standardized and I think that's

349
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,240
hugely beneficial to businesses yeah I just want to know when I can build my

350
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,360
arm PC you know as a longtime x86 user all I really care about is that I can

351
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,480
build my own PC system because that's just cool and when I can start building

352
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,560
my own arm systems then I'll care that's really for me that's it yeah and I think

353
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,320
to us I mean if you're you know if you're happy with a raspberry pi you can

354
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,760
do that today there also are there are more robust arm architectures out there

355
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,040
in fact some of the I think some of the some of the best representation we have

356
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,840
for that is from the arch arm group and those guys and I see them all the time

357
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,040
at different Linux events and stuff and they have a whole table full of you know

358
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,800
because we when I think of arm and when you think of our most people we think of

359
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,240
these $35 raspberry pies but they have like four and five hundred dollar

360
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,380
computers that are arm computers that you can install that are designed you

361
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,760
know with with tighter tolerances because at the end of the day the

362
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,280
raspberry pi was never designed to be a general purpose computer it was designed

363
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,320
to be a teaching tool turns out it's such a great teaching tool and was built

364
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,200
so well and designed so you know above what they targeted to do that you can

365
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,080
use it as a general purpose computer and for 80% of people it works just fine but

366
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,840
it does you know and I've tried to put it in some critical applications and

367
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,760
I've gotten bit and so there are other devices out there and I wish I could

368
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,120
tell you what they are I don't know I tell you what I do know Colonel 4.14 was

369
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,160
released olinjiabuntu came out with an article today said Colonel 4.14 features

370
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,880
a large number of new feature changes and is set to become the next long-term

371
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,960
LTS release backed for several years by ongoing maintenance and support things

372
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,080
that they have a whole list of things that they have added and those are in

373
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,520
the show notes but things that stood out to me that I think are particularly

374
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,480
interesting the Asus T100 touchpad support now if you don't know what the

375
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Asus T100 is it is a small laptop UMPC not quite UMPC more like like a netbook

376
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,240
size PC they sell for about $150 to $200 you can pick them up at you know any

377
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
Best Buy Target has them that kind of thing and it had the computer and the

378
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,480
display is all in one so it's kind of a tablet style but the keyboard can be

379
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,080
attached or maybe it flips around I'm not exactly sure but it is one of the

380
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,400
most cost-effective well-built little netbook computers out there and Linux

381
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,360
was originally very problematic on it when they when they first came out we

382
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
tried to put Linux on one and we couldn't get Wi-Fi to work couldn't get

383
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,560
Bluetooth to work the touchpad didn't work sound didn't work so basically you

384
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,000
had a display and a keyboard and that was it and that was still such a good

385
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,600
deal that I would run into people in fact I ran into somebody at Linuxcon I

386
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,600
think last year and he had like this can just concoction of USB dongles to get

387
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,600
all of the connectivity and devices working and with kernel 4.14 the last of

388
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,200
those devices is now supported that's the touchpad so I thought that was

389
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,400
pretty cool but yeah a better support for Ryzen processors if I can make a

390
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,680
quick plug next week on the ask Noah show Monday 6 p.m. central we're going to

391
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,280
have Wendell Wilson from level one Tex and Wendell is just he's a really great

392
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,600
guy and he's been doing some really cool things with Ryzen and and threadripper

393
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,160
doing PCI pass-through and and so that he can run Linux on his bare metal and

394
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,580
but yet he can still take advantage of all of the software that Windows has to

395
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,420
offer and he has some really interesting theories about how none of us are we're

396
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,880
all going to be using Linux in just a couple of years I think I think he backs

397
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,080
it up pretty well so make sure to tune in for that but but better Ryzen support

398
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,020
for Linux means that that is all the more realistic yeah yeah I mean I as

399
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,040
somebody who has almost exclusively either Intel or Nvidia hardware I got to

400
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,700
admit it's looking really good for AMD GPU users these days but you know no I

401
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,440
gotta say that I think the big thing about 4.4 don't say butter fs don't say

402
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,500
butter fs nope no it's just the fact that is this is the new LTS kernel

403
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,120
that's gonna be like six years and if if we start getting this in these here

404
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,480
Android devices we might actually have ourselves like a sustainable patchable

405
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,640
manageable Linux kernel that's used by millions of devices like this could be a

406
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,840
really really good thing for Android let alone all the other distributions but

407
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,520
just Android alone this could be a huge thing if if OEMs and and Google start

408
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,160
shipping this kernel at some point absolutely

409
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,760
mumble room what do you guys think who's super excited about the new kernel

410
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,920
release oh well I mean there's butter fs

411
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,600
produce back who comes in with the butter well yeah what are you super

412
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,320
excited there you lie new compression support for butter fs everyone that's

413
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,120
what that's what the feature set is just so that you can continue to they did

414
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,820
also improve their SSD allocation algorithms and other which which I will

415
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,720
say like we're all pretty down about butter fs especially for large storage

416
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,200
but I think maybe OS volumes on SSDs is one of the places it does see some use

417
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,440
yeah yeah I wouldn't put our fs on anything the no one that actually stood

418
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,080
out to me is HDMI CC support for the Raspberry Pi no kid yeah yeah let's talk

419
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,320
about which I believe is the thing that lets the Raspberry Pi yeah like here in

420
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,720
the studio the Nvidia shield TV supports HDMI C so when you wake up the shield it

421
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,280
automatically turns on the TV without you having to grab the TV remote so it

422
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,760
kind of solves like the universal remote problem by just not needing it and my

423
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,160
added support for more Raspberry Pis as well my understanding too and somebody

424
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,080
correct me if I'm wrong on this but CEC allows you to not only just turn the

425
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,200
device on but also acknowledge which is the active input so you can set CEC so

426
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,360
if I have four different devices that are plugged into a TV when a device

427
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,360
starts seeing activity it will switch the input to that particular device and

428
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,040
power the TV on am I am I right about that yes yeah yeah it's great I mean it

429
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,960
works here in the studio with the Android TV devices so it makes sense

430
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,880
that you'd want this on a Raspberry Pi because you could put this on cody

431
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,480
appliance work with previous kernels because I have auto arm here on a

432
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,200
Raspberry Pi 3 and if I launch it my TV launches too yeah okay so there are two

433
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,520
things there's HDMI CEC which is what Rick Rick I is talking about and that's

434
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,200
where the Raspberry Pi is actually talking it's it's talking via data over

435
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,960
the HDMI cable there is the box well so but just so we're clear a lot of TVs

436
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,400
just support if there was an active HDMI signal just turn on the TV that's that's

437
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,240
my bed my Western Digital TV which rest their soul they're great devices even

438
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,200
though I'm not using them anymore those devices didn't support HDMI CEC but

439
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,720
still when I powered the device on my TV would come on and that was just because

440
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,240
the TV had a feature of if I see an HDMI signal just power myself up so there

441
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,720
there is a different just because the TV came on doesn't necessarily mean it was

442
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,720
doing CEC but it could have existed I have a Sony I have a Sony Bravia here

443
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,080
so all I had to do I have to I had to install lip CEC now it's introduced in

444
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,280
the kernel but I just had to add lip CEC install it and then it worked out of

445
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,800
the box well okay all right if you had to add the live then it's not out of the

446
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:17,800
box no no I don't don't feel bad we got to kill the term out of the box cuz

447
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,720
when's the last time anybody installed Linux from a box give me a break we got

448
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,400
to kill that yeah it's this giant nice big monolithic kernel I would buy one

449
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:35,000
just for the novel have it on the shelf funny story guys Red Hat 7 shipped with

450
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,880
a boxed version of Red Hat 7 yeah as a promotional item you could buy a boxed

451
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,640
version of Red Hat 7 and they would deliver it in a box to your house you

452
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,080
could open it up and they were like I don't know what they put inside I hope

453
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,220
it was an optical disk because I wouldn't know what to do with it in a

454
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,040
server these days we don't have optical drives anymore in storage somewhere I

455
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,960
have a nice CD case with Red Hat Linux 5 yeah do you really yeah I collect

456
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,880
versions of Red Hat I bought every single version of Soos and Mandrake that

457
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,440
came out I got the free CDs from Ubuntu as long as I could I was all about it as

458
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,760
long as I could because there's there was there was a celebratory fact or just

459
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,840
like I have this I have this physical thing and one of the things I one of the

460
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,120
things that made me use Soosa early on was this beautiful gorgeous detailed

461
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,320
updated manual for every single release it was a book it wasn't a pamphlet Soosa

462
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,920
had a book and I would read through that and I could feel the texture of the

463
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,720
paper and it would have screenshots and it just it was so awesome that this

464
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,560
Linux thing had this really physical book and I would still do I'd buy it for

465
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,040
Ubuntu 1604 I'd do Solus I any you know I really would because not only is it a

466
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,260
nice way to contribute but it's there's just but what I would want now is I'd

467
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,560
want a branded USB Drive like like Martin there knows about a he seems to

468
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,760
he seems to have found somebody who can make a very nice looking Ubuntu mate

469
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,720
thumb drive maybe people should talk to to wimpy about that because damn that

470
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,800
thing's hot looking it's a nice metal thumb drive and you could put that in

471
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,160
like a packet with like a book or a pamphlet about it like oh I I'd spend

472
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,480
$65 for something like that as long as like a good percentage of it went to the

473
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,600
project you know that's yeah that's an that's interesting that might be a

474
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,920
funding source or a funding revenue source for them you know I and I like I

475
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,080
said I think redhead did it kind of as a promo thing so hopefully we don't find

476
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,960
out if that actually worked out you know it's interesting so when you got that

477
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,320
book did you go through and like read it like was there it was a reason in there

478
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,920
I would say I skimmed it I skimmed it it was more about converting something that

479
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:46,040
was this hobbyist crazy-ass nearly hippie ideal to a physical good that

480
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,080
came in a box yeah like six discs and a book it was more about like that like

481
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,120
reality of this thing that I had so I never had the soos but I had the

482
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,240
redhat thing and the redhat I don't know if anyone out there remembers this but

483
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,160
redhat used to come with a little pamphlet and it gave you like this

484
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,520
quick start like this is Linux and it's a different operating system that you

485
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,560
might not be familiar with and here's kind of the the basic how to kind of

486
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,660
getting started thing and one of the things that you know the thing I guess

487
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,000
that really kind of drew me to it was at when I sat down at Linux for the first

488
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,240
time pulling these things out of the box I had no idea what I was doing and so

489
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,880
every little tiny hint that I could get including those little pamphlets you

490
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,840
know that was that was a big help to me of course today if I was doing that I

491
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,060
would head over to Linux Academy slash unplugged because Linux Academy is going

492
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,760
to do that same thing where you're going to have the ability to just visit a

493
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,080
website and get a tutor that and these people these people care about Linux

494
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,360
these people understand Linux they know Linux and you can tell if you've ever

495
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,060
taken a bad online computer course a video course you can hear the

496
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,360
instructor kind of like reading through his notes or they'll have bad takes or

497
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,960
something and you can tell when you're sitting down and I did the the Red Hat

498
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,440
7 one I think most recently rather than actually paying for the Red Hat course

499
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,800
and I didn't find myself lost at all and I could tell as the instructor kind of

500
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,280
went off on on little real hand stories well when I was working for this client

501
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,840
or when I was doing this we found this to be most useful and this is why I'm

502
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,080
super excited about this being in Red Hat 7 you can hear that personal

503
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,440
commentary that's stuff that you just don't get with somebody who's just a

504
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,880
paid voice to to read or or to to explain something right so Linux Academy

505
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
slash unplugged they've worked out a really great discount for you so you can

506
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,800
get started cheaper than ever and get started on your you know on your next

507

Linux career we get emails all the time at both at the ass know a show and I'm

508
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,640
sure you get them here on unplugged Chris but people are saying hey you

509
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,840
started my career you jumpstart my career in fact is Eric still in the

510
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,400
chat room with us Eric Eric H maybe not Eric I think I think it was smoking the

511
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,720
crack pipe yeah maybe Eric H was he was telling me just the other day he was

512
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,040
like you know what you and you and Jupiter broadcasting and thanks to

513
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,400
companies like Linux Academy you got my new career started I started because of

514
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,880
what you guys were we're doing on the network and for what things like your

515
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,520
sponsors like like Linux Academy have done for me and it launched his in

516
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,020
launches entire career and now he's on a completely different path and and I

517
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,720
think that's just really great because we spend the majority of our lives are

518
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,480
working here so you want to be doing something you love so head over to

519
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,080
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and make sure to take advantage of that

520
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,880
discount sorry going I was just gonna say you know the thing about Linux

521
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,280
Academy to that I really love about it as a Linux geek is they they passed the

522
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
sniff test because when you start using it you go oh yeah these guys are

523
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,080
definitely they're geeks they love Linux and that's when you that's when it

524
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,400
clicks that's when it clicks so apparently I'm talking about Linux

525
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,760
Academy like it's something that everyone knows they have a website it's

526
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,000
linuxlinuxacademy.com slash unplugged apparently there's there's a URL that

527
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,840
you have to go to to actually get there oh then you get the free seven-day

528
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,180
trial so that's that's useful yeah that's academy.com slash unplugged there

529
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,440
you go all right so is it is it is it Chris or Rekai who oh no no no no I'm

530
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,800
sorry I'm sorry I jumped ahead so one of a new software new software release yeah

531
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,320
I know I know I know but I didn't I didn't see that until I scroll down a

532
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,520
little bit new software version of OpenShot 2.4 is released and I tell you

533
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,040
what I I played with it for just I didn't have a lot of time to play with

534
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,400
it when I when I saw it I was I saw it just for researching the show and I

535
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,440
downloaded it and I was just playing with it a little bit man are they making

536
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,880
some progress OpenShot even if and I'll be the first one to admit even if

537
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,160
OpenShot is not the video editor that I could use today to do the things that I

538
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,760
need to get done even if that's not for me today OpenShot is definitely the

539
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,920
nonlinear video editor on Linux that I want to succeed long term yeah I don't

540
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,360
know if that makes sense you know no it does that's the nicest possible way to

541
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,580
say it and I would like Jonathan to get a hold of me and I would like to have a

542
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,560
conversation with him because I can honestly tell just by looking at the

543
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,540
screenshots that this is never gonna work for Jupiter broadcasting this is

544
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,560
never gonna work for me and you know if you look at the Linux gamecast I think

545
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,960
there's a very specific reason that they're on a much older version of this

546
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,400
program in this current one and I completely support somebody working

547
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,320
their ass off on an open source project and I completely want somebody to build

548
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,160
something for Linux that does this but Jesus if if it's not gonna be

549
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,640
completely irrelevant by the time he gets anywhere where this thing is usable

550
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,200
pipewire is now just a couple of years away to be completely feature complete

551
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,560
and this thing's gonna have to be completely rewritten to use any of that

552
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,040
and the UI is fundamentally impossible for anything that's more than just a

553
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,400
couple of tracks of editing so which means if it's anybody that's trying to

554
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,000
edit anything more than their Thanksgiving dinner it's never gonna

555
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,880
work for anybody that was a really nice dinner yeah right that's all it's good

556
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,280
for and I totally respect Jonathan I totally respect the OpenShot project I

557
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,720
have used past versions of OpenShot which are really great this unfortunately

558
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,480
is like skating to where the puck was about six years ago and I really I

559
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,520
really am a disappointed to say that as somebody who actually backed this

560
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,200
project when he did it on Kickstarter I was a backer of this I mean yeah I mean

561
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,480
you have to be realistic you know I will say they have they have done some they

562
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,480
have done some cool things improved playback one of the things that Linux

563
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,120
has struggled with is both 4k and video that is above 30 frames per second so

564
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,840
this has a smooth playback for 50 50 frames per second 60 frames per second

565
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,840
and 120 frames per second so they are making progress and I'll tell you where

566
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,160
OpenShot really fits in is if you just need to clip some video files up if you

567
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,240
just need to drop a video file in and clip off the beginning clip off the end

568
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,400
or you know make a clip mashup or something like that if you want a really

569
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,880
easy simple video editor to do that I think OpenShot fits the bill there but I

570
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,040
echo a hundred percent your sentiment I think when you start getting into any

571
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,800
even remotely complicated workflow you're just you're gonna be struggling

572
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,320
I mean Kdenlive is is is is a great fantastic open source editor that I

573
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,080
think is light years ahead of open OpenShot I agree Kdenlive is a is a is a

574
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,360
much better candidate for this particular type of work and then when

575
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,640
you need to go beyond that Lightworks it's a bit of a learning curve but it

576
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,760
is absolutely a capable editor and that's available for Linux as well and

577
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,520
so it's getting you have you have go ahead yeah yeah yeah talk about that

578
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,000
is it rotten are you using DaVinci resolve I have used it I don't use it

579
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,600
typically because I don't like the way they distribute it but overall it's uh

580
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,560
it's it's still it's definitely a good editor and I wish they would make a more

581
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,880
reasonable distribution method well what are you using for tux digital Kdenlive

582
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,380
basically okay always Kdenlive I use Lightworks occasionally too but it's

583
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,920
almost always Kdenlive but I just wanted to say like I think OpenShot's more in

584
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,760
the iMovie realm yeah I would agree I would agree it's it's one of those

585
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,600
things that you can you can pick up and just throw something together real quick

586
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm curious what do you find egregious about the distribution for DaVinci

587
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,560
resolve they have a it's a binary that you have to run a rooted sh file to

588
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,040
install it so like it's not any kind of format of it's it's a it uses this thing

589
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,920
called make sh and it's just like it's a weird binary compiled bash

590
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,760
script essentially you can't see what the script is doing and you have to root

591
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,680
give it root access as a script oh and then you and it's and it's so weird

592
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,840
because you can't like unpackage it or anything so it's like if anything at

593
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,560
least do an app image like do something that's reasonable yeah even OpenShot

594
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,880
doesn't have image yeah yeah yeah well anyway I think part of that I think is

595
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,440
there's a discussion to be had on you know how software manufacturers are

596
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,080
supposed to target distributions because when they go to make an installable file

597
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,000
it's like well which distribution are we installing for something I think

598
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,120
there's a discussion to be had there and I think that snaps and flat pack and

599
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,880
stuff are gonna go a long way to fix that so Chris tell me about this gnome

600
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,760
show for proposal this is really interesting because it's it's gotten a

601
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,280
lot of immediate reaction today on on the internet and some of the reaction

602
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,000
has been are you kidding me you've just gotten gnome basically stable and now

603
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,640
you want to reinvent the wheel with gnome 4 and then the other other end of

604
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,820
the spectrum has been finally what the hell is taking you guys so long to

605
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,280
address some of these fundamental issues so we have two links of the show notes

606
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,880
ones to a pharaonic article that summarizes it really well and then one

607
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,240
is to the actual wiki post by the gnome project that gives a lot of detail but

608
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,120
essentially you have gnome 3 shell today which is doing great right everybody's

609
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,760
loving it it's getting deployed in all the places but it's built around x11

610
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,520
it's built around the era of x11 and with gnome shell for they want to build

611
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,880
it around Wayland a Wayland first design as the project puts it and the whole

612
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,320
idea is to do away with x11 slash X org support entirely their words not mine

613
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,280
the new gnome shell would be better fitted for low latency input 40 and low

614
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,680
latency visual input event feedback who doesn't love that and low latency zero

615
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,880
copy client 40 those all sound good because they have the word low latency

616
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,000
in front of them you hate latency I kind of like zero copy I don't know what that

617
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,040
means but I like it it's good because it's like you can copy without having to

618
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,120
copy on the back end of them for back to the client it's good Rekha it's good

619
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:34,280
based on synergy yeah it is and that's so so that's the the Wayland first is

620
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,000
what's getting the headlines but what I think is more interesting about this

621
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,840
story and you you learn more when you read the actual wiki post is the gnome

622
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:49,720
project is facing a couple of really really hard choices three I think to be

623
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,680
exact and they identify they identify a few core problem areas the number one

624
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,960
problem that need new solutions and man if I don't agree with every single one

625
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,920
of these number one low latency input 14 is a problem that they need new

626
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,720
solutions for number two low latency visual input event feedback like

627
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,520
specifically to put that back in user terms they mean cursor movement feedback

628
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,400
you move the cursor it should be glued exactly to your mouse movement exactly

629
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,480
you you move that mouse a millimeter it should represent that exactly it should

630
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,720
be glued together low latency and zero client copy forwarding also input methods

631
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,320
in the shell and this is the number one thing that they put as number five on

632
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,640
their list but for me this is number one stalls on the main thread and stalls on

633
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,320
the compositor for frame redraws now that one line item is a really really

634
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,960
big deal because it means breaking gnome up into a bunch of different processes

635
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,160
where you don't just rely on one primary renderer which is what always ends up

636
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,000
being the fundamental criticism of gnome now they have a few different potential

637
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,040
solutions for this that they've outlined on their wiki and some of these are

638
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,760
radical option a is pretty big and it's the closest to the I would say the

639
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,000
plasma desktop setup it's a UI process and a compositor process which is

640
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,560
exactly how the plasma desktop does it today there's also a few other like less

641
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,760
dramatic options that they have available to them that they're

642
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,600
considering another option potentially being less drastic but would only solve

643
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,200
three out of the five problems I just listed is to introduce a proxy display

644
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,080
server yeah proxy display server would be somewhat similar to an X server and

645
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,080
then they would essentially have gnome talk to that and then that proxy would

646
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:50,200
talk to Wayland you know kind of like Mir but let's not bring that up and then

647
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:57,840
they have pros and cons outlined for all of that and what it left me with is this

648
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,480
is what I was talking about earlier in the year on this show is the transition

649
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,400
to Wayland and we've all been like let's get Wayland going let's get Wayland by

650
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,280
default let's get Wayland working on Nvidia let's get Wayland working on

651
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,520
Intel the thing is is once you get to Wayland there is so much more work for

652
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,400
these desktop projects and they in some cases are gonna have to reinvent some of

653
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,320
the core aspects of the desktop and in the case of gnome shell 4 it would

654
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,760
break most likely and and the projects the one saying this not me gnome shell

655
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,960
3 extensions so all the extensions that you are currently using to make your

656
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,640
gnome 3 shell usable would likely break with gnome shell 4 now I'm not saying

657
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,400
that's gonna be the end of the world I'm not saying there's not gonna be an easy

658
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,840
transition or maybe a new standardized stable API out of this it could all it

659
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,160
could end up in something much better

660
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,680
yeah but but he could end up in something that's better than what we

661
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,000
have now but in the immediate short term your doc your crazy hack to do XYZ could

662
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,240
break you know for me be my Bitcoin widget I'm sure because they like to

663
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,920
break that a lot and so gnome shell 4 is now on the horizon and it's it is just

664
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,560
one of the millions of dominoes that are gonna fall in this transition to

665
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:25,160
Wayland yeah I it so it's gonna be interesting to watch but I kind of

666
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,520
resonate with what you were talking about earlier when you said why not why

667
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,080
not start working with you know canonical and mere to do a lot of these

668
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:40,800
things that they're trying to reinvent the wheel on well you know you know here's

669
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,960
got a lot of a lot of you know we call this thing called drama I don't know if

670
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,400
would you guys call it over in Grand Forks but here on the west coast we call

671
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,600
it drama well here's and here's well here's the other drama if we're talking

672
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,680
about drama then what kind of message does that send from the gnome community

673
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,560
up to canonical would have basically just banked their business on this on

674
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,600
this desktop I wouldn't say bank the business I'll say that at least the

675
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,480
desktop part of it yeah yeah I don't know that's a good question

676
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,120
they're desktops I don't they don't seem to actually have like they care about it

677
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,800
but business-wise they don't care about it well I wouldn't say that I don't know

678
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,120
about that I wouldn't the desktop art because you can say like this server

679
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,120
implementation doesn't really matter if gnomes there or not the IOT stuff doesn't

680
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,960
matter if gnomes there or not yeah but so here's the thing here's the thing

681
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,560
rotten is if I'm Dell or I'm HP or I'm anybody that's gonna pre configure and

682
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:37,400
ship a canonical derived desktop I feel better right now that they're using

683
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,640
gnome because I look at business risk and I evaluate other companies and

684
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,600
compared to me canonical is a small shop that is struggling to make it by and I'm

685
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,200
super rich I'm worldwide I want to ship my products to millions of customers and

686
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,840
I'm a little skeptical that they can pull all that shit off and so the fact

687
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,440
that they're now deferring that work to the community that the wider community

688
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,400
and a huge part of that development is backed by redhat and that's no secret to

689
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,360
anybody anybody in the industry you know you look at these facts and you say well

690
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,200
now we've just deferred our risk because now canonical is not solely responsible

691
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,280
for the development of the Ubuntu desktop all of these companies are all

692
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,040
in and they just have to do a great job of packaging up and make it work right

693
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,480
and that's all I need to ship it on my hardware you know and that's that's the

694
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,400
harder that's the hardware vendors perspective but then you have to look at

695
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,160
the and this is not an insignificant amount of dollars not an insignificant

696
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,720
amount of revenue and not an insignificant amount of the Ubuntu

697
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,680
infrastructure look at companies like Amazon and Google and I'm not talking

698
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,840
about Amazon servers I'm not talking about Google servers I'm talking about

699
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,280
the workstations that sit in front of the human beings that use them those

700
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,000
machines are running Ubuntu on the desktop Amazon has and I've talked to a

701
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,680
number of different Amazon employees one of them is a good friend of mine he's

702
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,400
been on you've been on this show and on ask Noah Sean and and he's one of the

703
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,800
guys that works in the the IT department for Amazon and Ubuntu is by far the

704
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,560
dominant operating system desktop dominant operating system on their

705
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,080
computers and very much the same thing if you talk to a Google employee they

706
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,640
have a lot of Chromebooks they have some people what using MacBooks and really

707
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,440
the common denominator for Google obviously is going to be Chrome and

708
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,480
they've tooled Chrome to do all the things they need it to do but the actual

709
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,680
workstation that does the calculations the actual thing that they're remoted

710
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,240
into the actual thing that's doing the thinking that's a Linux Ubuntu desktop

711
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,360
I'll give a brief you know because I've talked about it a lot recently on the

712
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,740
show here but for us I was looking at different options for the studio because

713
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,360
we were having a different array of technical problems that essentially came

714
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,760
down to running multiple Linux distributions I mean not to not to make

715
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,800
but that's what it kind of came down yeah yeah and so we if we just

716
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,600
standardized on one thing and I emphasize that by hitting my mic if we

717
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,120
just standardized on one thing then we would kind of like have one common thing

718
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,600
to work towards and so after after a bunch of testing which I've talked about

719
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,840
a ton on the show we landed on Ubuntu 1604 for the production OS yep now the

720
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,920
reason one of the things that did factor into that is there isn't multiple

721
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:15,200
versions for me to figure out there's one Ubuntu LTS that gets five years I

722
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,080
don't I don't have to go get like a CentOS version of Ubuntu right or like

723
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,240
some sort of rolling version that's supported by a open source subset of a

724
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:31,300
corporate backed it's just it's Ubuntu LTS and then later on after I get it all

725
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,320
set up and I go oh guess what this shits actually working for me and it hasn't

726
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,220
cost me anything I can I can then go choose to subscribe to landscape or some

727
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,200
other some one of their other subscription services which then all of

728
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,040
a sudden turns them into legitimate systems yep that I'm centralized managed

729
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,160
and I don't have to like play this mental game that feels like it's from

730
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,100
the 90s deciding which version of Linux I need do I need the Red Hat corporate

731
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,320
version where I subscribe to their service do I need CentOS which is kind

732
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,080
of like the same thing but I support it myself do I want tumbleweed do I want

733
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,480
leap none of this crazy stupid abstracted different versions I get

734
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,600
Ubuntu 1604 full stop it's Ubuntu 1604 it's the same one you can download for

735
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,680
free it's the same one I can download for free it's the same one I can put on

736
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,920
my personal laptop is the same one I can put up on a server on a VPS it is the

737
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,880
same Ubuntu and the systems that are important to me I subscribe to landscape

738
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,400
and I get a bun to advantage and now all of a sudden they're enterprise systems

739
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:38,280
and to me that simplicity that felt like it was more kind of like like a basic

740
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,880
straight approach was what was the eventual like okay well you combine the

741
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,480
commercial support you buy it you combine the software support and you

742
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,360
combine the selective commercial software like back support by canonical

743
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,360
where I need it and it's great because I can have we can standardize 16 systems

744
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,920
in the studio on 1604 and I can subscribe for support on six of them

745
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,720
yeah absolutely and I you know the other thing is you are you are very involved

746
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,960
in the community so probably not much comes as a surprise to you but there's

747
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,360
there are a lot of companies that they just kind of they kind of just you know

748
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,480
ad hoc trust that they want a company to to do the thinking for them and do all

749
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,800
the planning and they deal with all the community minutia and just deliver them

750
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,480
a product and that is a valuable service and that is also a valuable selling

751
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,800
point when I'm going to talk to people about you know switching to Linux

752
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,560
basically sure sure I bet it is and and when I was when I was working with a

753
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,400
company where we were deploying lots of really critical Linux servers it was it

754
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,760
was it was no question to buy the $5,000 red hat enterprise support I can't

755
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,800
remember what we called it back then but they had multiple grades I don't know if

756
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,800
they still do this and one was like you got like ten years and you got like a

757
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,360
hotline to call support and that was what we bought we bought that really

758
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,120
yeah yeah you know I'm talking about yeah and that wasn't even a big deal

759
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,440
like whatever that's fine that's just it was just included as part of the

760
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,000
purchase cost of a server and so you spend $15,000 and about 3500 of that was

761
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,200
the server license and support and it was there wasn't even a conversation it

762
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,480
wasn't a debate it wasn't looking at the merits of it it was you buy Red Hat and

763
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,520
it's fine but now when I'm running my own business my own small business it's

764
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,040
a completely different perspective I have on it and so I think that's why Red

765
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,240
Hat can make billions of dollars still with this particular setup they have and

766
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,000
it doesn't and and canonical can make a profitable revenue source with their

767
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,080
setup because they're they're essentially appealing to a bit of the

768
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:46,200
same market while at the same time super fulfilling different ends of the spectrum

769
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,920
absolutely anyone if for the mumble room have any perspective to add before we

770
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:58,920
move on actually I did so in regards to the whole gnome for thing you know with

771
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,200
them the question should be is are they deprecating or are they reinventing

772
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,520
because this sounds like a process that they've been working on for years it

773
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,640
sounds like and have been building up to it just sounds to me like that the media

774
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:21,080
is just freaking out in the same way that with pop OS and calling it a fork

775
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,800
when they're just changing the theme around no they're okay one pop OS is a

776
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:32,960
fork system 76 said it is to the the gnome thing it has been in process for a

777
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,840
while yes but it they also said that it would know gtk4 and gnome 4 would break

778
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,560
all compatibility gta3 that's why gta3 is going to have a very very long LTS yep

779
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,520
and you know you also have to figure that there's more and more LTS distros

780
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,000
these days shipping it yeah so they're gonna have like they're not deprecate

781
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,080
yes they are deprecating it but they're going to wait a very long time before

782
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,440
they deprecated it yeah yeah you should double down on your point to they have

783
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,040
been they have been forecasting this for a very long time it's not like this is a

784
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,080
surprise this is something that they've been talking about for a long time

785
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,120
version 4 is called version 4 because it's meant to warn developers there's

786
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,960
gonna be some breakage here yeah they said that about I think three years ago

787
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,960
they started saying that this will have breaks and to chime in a bit here I've

788
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,720
been at the wikipost was written by Jonas Odal who's on my team and who's

789
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:35,080
been on the main guys behind a lot of our port work to to Wayland so I mean at

790
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,800
the moment no code is written here this is basically him saying okay you know I

791
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,640
spend a lot of time helping off with the port of gnome 3 to Wayland and we still

792
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,400
have things we plan to do there but here's some of the problems I see and I

793
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,000
think here's maybe how we want to look at resolving them in the long run so I

794
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,680
mean my recommendation to anyone be that not don't hold your breath for gnome

795
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:05,320
shell 4 it's sort of multi-year thing so Chris tell me about James Nugent yeah

796
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,560
so this is a friend of the show a podcast they've put out over at advanced

797
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:15,320
tech media org and they just did an interview with James Nugent and James is

798
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,600
an interesting interesting fellow he's across the pond over and I I'm gonna I'm

799
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,680
gonna try to I'm gonna give an attempt I feel like I can get this one bath

800
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:35,640
England yeah he works at joinette which we talk about about on this network

801
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,840
especially the text net program and in BSD now they were recently acquired by

802
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,880
Samsung Electronics and they still are super active in the open source

803
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,960
community and he's a core contributor at hashicorp and event store and he also

804
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,320
produces the open source stream database with a built projections system I don't

805
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,520
know what that means but I would almost listen just to find out you almost got

806
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,640
it Chris it's actually joint oh I know I know I always get it wrong I've always

807
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,520
gotten on joint you're right you're someday so joinette joint this looks

808
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,160
like a great podcast oh man yeah yeah that's the interview fans tech media org

809
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:17,280
and it's put on by Alexandra and Adam and they both came to our barbecue meetup

810
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,040
that we had a little bit ago so I thought we should give them a plug so I

811
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,240
know what I'll be doing after the show plug skis we'll have a link for that or

812
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,360
you can just go to advanced media org it's episode 9 with James and he's all

813
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,680
in with joint or joinette however you want to say it I don't judge I don't

814
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,080
judge where those things the guys that in the sous vide yeah well I yeah yeah

815
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,320
yeah they were and I don't know I don't know I don't know if we got actually a

816
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,580
chance to eat it during the barbecue because it would took so long that's the

817
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,320
problem with the soup yeah they did give the go and they brought the whole unit

818
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,640
with the cooler and all that so it was me and Adam yeah yeah yeah that's right

819
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,040
bachelor fruit was here too of course Dustin was yeah yeah yeah Adam and I

820
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,400
just came down together I love it I love it so their podcast is at advanced media

821
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,760
org check it out advanced tech media org check it out for episode 9 you know what

822
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,560
I would totally recommend to them if they if they're if they're not doing

823
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,240
this already is they should check out tune in because tune in is it's a it's a

824
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,800
really cool service and what they do is they allow you to basically you can you

825
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,800
can use their infrastructure to have a mobile app that people can listen to

826
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,320
your show or they can listen to a web browser they can listen to it on the

827
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,600
Alexa all of that kind of stuff there's a really cool tool that I really like

828
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,080
it's called easy stream it's a command line based streaming utility that you

829
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,780
can use to send an ice cast either a file or an ice cast stream out to a

830
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,800
service you can just take you know a given mp3 and you could put it on a

831
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,880
loop people could go to that tune in site and they could and they could

832
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,900
listen to it to your show and crazy well here's the thing the problem is when

833
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,200
you're first setting this stuff up there's like this config file you have

834
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,960
to write and I'll throw the config in the show notes for anyone that wants to

835
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,880
play with it but let me tell you the first time here's what it is it's you

836
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,720
install the operating system you set up the software and then you try and see if

837
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,080
it works and then you're not quite sure well maybe this thing is wrong or maybe

838
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,520
that file is wrong or maybe I put this in the wrong location I'll just better

839
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,040
start over and then you blow it away and then you start all over again you know

840
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,000
what the easiest way to do that is with something like digital ocean digital

841
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,080
ocean is Linux on demand it's like Linux on tap actually that's what you could

842
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,400
call it and basically I can get a Linux server anytime I want it just by going

843
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,680
to digital ocean comm I have I'd say probably I'd say I think at this point

844
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,520
all but two of my servers on digital ocean are on the $5 droplets all of them

845
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,400
are on the $5 you know the $5 droplets just get you everything you need of

846
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,280
course they can go up to $10 droplets $15 droplets $20 droplets but it gets

847
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:42,440
even better because if you use the code do unplugged then you get free droplets

848
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,240
at least the $5 ones you get those for free for two months so if they so these

849
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,640
guys they want to do a streaming service so they want to set this up and have a

850
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,560
mobile app they could use easy stream they could go over to digital ocean use

851
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,480
that code do unplugged and they'd have a mobile infrastructure for free for the

852
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,400
first two months and after that's only five bucks so how you getting better

853
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,600
than that digital ocean comm make sure to use the code d o unplugged dashboard

854
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,960
for dashboard you and your dashboard I don't you know we've never said the word

855
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,840
dashboard on the ask no show I don't think oh no you are doing your viewers a

856
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,840
disservice my friend is a good dash an amazing dashboard you know why you know

857
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,880
I know what you better be talking about the API oh that's right yeah you say

858
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,360
that all the time yeah oh no okay that yeah no you don't but finish you should

859
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,640
finish your thought though why is it that you always talk about the dashboard

860
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,920
I lived in servitude to really really really really really really really

861
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,600
really really hold on really really bad virtualization you eyes and I and I and

862
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,320
sometimes like the whole infrastructure all of it would run on on Linux and then

863
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,640
I would have to have a Windows machine to manage it and it would drive me so

864
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:58,920
crazy works in Internet Explorer yeah oh oh it's active active active X yes

865
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,240
Internet Explorer 5 or 6 maybe oh and I suffered through a lot of that in my day

866
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,600
and so now to go to to go to digital ocean and have all of it work in

867
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,720
whichever browser you want to use on Linux but it more importantly to have it

868
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,960
be better than anything I used and some of those things you know they cost 200

869
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,520
300 thousand dollars three hundred four hundred thousand dollars maybe actually

870
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,520
be expended there why wasn't me it was the businesses that were buying it and

871
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,040
it was and you ended up with these total crap you eyes well not only that but it

872
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,720
shows that they have total trust in their API because the dashboard is

873
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,880
sitting on top of the API yeah yeah it's pretty great it's pretty great that's

874
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,520
all that's why you know what I thought you know what I thought you were gonna

875
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,680
say I thought you were gonna say well I say dashboard because a bunch of people

876
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,080
who got all upset that I said the word dashboard like twice and so then they

877
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,400
went on this like they went on this like rampage to like Twitter and read it

878
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,800
right all this other stuff I'll just say that's why I say it now yeah I mean

879
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,240
that's why I say it for now that now that's why I say yes okay so so

880
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,720
interestingly enough in the show in this show that I'm I'm guesting with you guys

881
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:03,040
I'm not the one that puts the new fedora 27 workstation features in the doc I

882
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,320
feel very ashamed about they're ahead of the curve over here you see Noah that's

883
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,520
because you're not running fedora because you you hate the the dis turn

884
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,880
out you're such an Ubuntu apologizer it's embarrassing for us it took us

885
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:23,520
hardcore redhat users here at jb1 to get this straight and oh sorry yes right

886
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,000
right hardcore redhat users yes you know we're back to the good old days we're

887
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,280
back to the good old days of Linux where fedora and Ubuntu kind of have the same

888
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,000
features but Ubuntu ships a month early and

889
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:45,680
you remember how it used to be like that because it's known again and a lot of

890
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,640
the progress comes from known because that's where the fedora project invests

891
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,320
a lot of its time and so I joke but at the same time a huge part of fedora 27

892
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,880
is it's everything you love about fedora with gnome 3.26 but one of the things

893
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,240
for me as somebody who likes to just follow all of this is this was really

894
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,840
the release that marked the end of the alphas and there's something else that I

895
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:13,760
just anecdotally noticed that I got to give them credit for not only did they

896
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,240
kill the alphas with this release cycle but I more than I have ever seen in in

897
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:25,760
well I I have actually I have followed the fedora project since it was the

898
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,960
fedora project I you know so I mean literally since I've ever seen this

899
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,480
distribution I have never seen more people anecdotally say across different

900
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,760
places that I monitor that this has been the most stable most reliable beta that

901
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,320
they have ever used of the fedora project and so not only did they end the

902
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,480
alpha sort of release cycle but they definitely upped their game on the

903
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,360
stability of the beta because just anecdotally I mean this is just my

904
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,160
observation monitoring a lot of different sources having followed this

905
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,920
project since it was just a glimmer in somebody's eye this seems to be the most

906
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:09,680
stable release they've ever had now I will say selfishly what I really like

907
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,200
about fedora 27 is this is the release that really lays the groundwork for

908
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:20,080
pipewire which is the new media oh boy yeah oh boy yeah we're excited about

909
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,080
that here at Jupiter broadcasting because this is something that we think

910
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,960
Linux really needs to be competitive with macOS on the video editing side

911
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,280
and it was something just a year or two ago I thought would never happen and so

912
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,080
the fact that the fedora project is taking this on they will they will for

913
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,240
the rest of my life have my respect taking it seriously I mean they

914
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,860
recognize that this is something Linux community me mm-hmm yeah and and it has

915
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:47,080
been it has been something that I thought would never come to bear because

916
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,440
it seemed like it took it would take like this huge multi project multi

917
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,440
distro cooperation but I think pipewire the way they're doing it is it's humble

918
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,080
it's a it's a good steady slow approach so in fedora 27 it's it's nothing major

919
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,120
it's just gonna handle screen sharing and screen capture under gnome shell

920
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:09,160
it's like laying the fundamental groundwork and of course it's it's the

921
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,760
groundwork to support these functions under Wayland which couldn't couldn't be

922
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,840
done before so I really like the way they're their way the way they're

923
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,560
approaching pipewire the KDE version of fedora hasn't seen a lot they've switched

924
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,560
to five dot nine one for cute five and there's a few other things but Christian

925
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,880
is joining us he's there we he is very dutifully filling in at the very last

926
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,920
moment to join us from the fedora project to talk about some of the new

927
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,000
features so Christian welcome to Linux unplugged and I know I've mentioned a

928
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,280
couple of features but I bet I missed some feature fedora 27 that is deserved

929
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,920
of mention yeah thanks for having me yeah I think you mentioned some of the

930
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,440
important things and I mean I think what I mean you were talking about that you

931
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,560
know we are a month late but on the other hand we spent that last month

932
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:00,200
fixing a lot of last minute bugs in home so hopefully it's a bit more stable to

933
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,920
rinse us under a lot of multi-month ratios that we were hammering to the last

934
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,360
minute yeah sorted yeah I mean the one of the things that really stood out me

935
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:14,440
when we installed fedora 27 is it is a straight-up showcase for gnome for like

936
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,680
upstream known and it's the the background is gorgeous and the

937
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,480
transparent the transparent bar up top that it's just it's it's a beautiful

938
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:29,240
default theme for fedora it's a great showcase for stock no thank you I mean I

939
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,800
think one of the features I would love to highlight a bit which is almost sort

940
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,760
on the side is is that this is also first release really where we where we

941
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,680
have fleet commander available which is our new tool for administrating a large

942
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,320
number of desktops okay so fleet commander so is fleet

943
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,400
command you haven't played with fleet commander no I play is it like is it

944
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,520
related to cockpit or is it a separate thing it's it's an extension of cockpit

945
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,280
so when when you have cockpit stolen and fleet commander you will actually see a

946
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:03,040
link where you can click into fleet commander from cockpit so it's but of

947
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,840
course my cockpit of course was written and it's mainly targeted doing server

948
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,320
administration a fleet commander is all about you know administrating desktops

949
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:17,520
oh nice and I'm in the background for fleet commander actually was we had a

950
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,080
discussion a couple years ago in how service saying that you know if you ever

951
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,840
want to see for instance Linux making a headway in corporate settings against

952
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,440
Windows we need to come up with something that's a bit more accessible

953
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,440
to people than you know telling them to you know rewrite scripts figure out how

954
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,080
different command and tools work on Linux to configure stuff and instead

955
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,440
have something that's all graphical and and you know won't click deploy and it

956
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,320
integrates with the people's director services you know Christian I have to be

957
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,440
honest if this this is this is the dichotomy I have with the damn fedora

958
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,440
project right here you guys have cockpit you have fleet commander you have atomic

959
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,640
you have fedora cloud you have all of these things that would make fedora so

960
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,520
frickin perfect for deploying in production except for that fact that the

961
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:08,560
fedora releases are only supported for a few months like this is the dichotomy I

962
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,000
just can't get over yeah but maybe what they've done there I mean I mean you're

963
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,360
not the first person of course who complain about that but I mean for me

964
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,120
fedora is it's definitely like you know the distro we're targeting towards an

965
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,000
old enthusiast users developers and people who want to you know get the

966
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,280
news right away straight off the press yeah and at the same point of course I

967
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,400
know people were not so happy by use with CentOS or well because I felt it

968
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,440
was like okay it's fine real new rel out but then as the years go by you know a

969
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,880
becomes a bit long in the tooth for a desktop user so what we did switch for

970
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,280
in rel 7 is this model where we actually updating the desktop in rel and CentOS

971
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,400
of course as a result of that every second release okay so so that way you

972
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,360
get a refresh desktop experience continuously and so so that's also what

973
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,800
I'm telling people and I said hey I want a more long-term thing I said like well

974
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,160
you know I know that historically things like CentOS might not have appeal to you

975
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,920
or getting a rel subscription just because you didn't want to be there at

976
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,240
you know the dot six release and feel that you were using you know the desktop

977
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,160
yeah from ten years ago but that that's no longer true with well now you're

978
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,200
getting a brand new desktop every second release and every old release we're

979
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:25,360
updating a lot of the major applications there okay and I think as we go forward

980
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,320
and this so it's called a strategy we'll we'll call it coming to folks a bit more

981
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,040
because I mean one of the big goals I I hope that we will achieve it with things

982
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,400
like flat packs is that you suddenly can create like you know an application

983
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,400
stream that's independent of both fedora and rel so that you no longer have this

984
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,760
sort of tight link between like you know which application version you have and

985
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,800
which desktop version you had sure you just have you know hey I want to let

986
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,720
this gimp and I can deploy it either in fedora or on rel or of course or else

987
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,980
good point that's a that's a that's a really good point is the this may be a

988
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:04,720
non-issue once that's once that's in the pipeline so I have so many things to

989
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,880
ask you about and I don't know which which you'd rather answer so I'll give

990
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,200
you I'm gonna throw two at you actually how about three Christian I'm gonna give

991
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,400
you three questions and whichever one you feel more comfortable answering you

992
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,860
go for number one is what are your thoughts on on gnomes position about the

993
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:27,120
system tray icons to quote the fedora project workstation release notes the

994
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,480
quote-unquote antiquated system tray has been removed to reduce visual clutter

995
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,760
so that's question one is what are your thoughts on that question two if you'd

996
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,880
rather answer this is some big changes in fedora atomic including the support

997
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,520
for kubernetes have been introduced which seems like a huge huge was one of

998
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,680
the things I was most excited about like a huge change there and then also some

999
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,280
badass support for trim support on encrypted disks I know that's three

1000
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,480
totally different topics Christian but since you haven't you know you know I

1001
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,640
just thought I'd toss you those three and you pick which one's the best for

1002
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,960
you to answer I think the last one is sort of old summer scope I mean just to

1003
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,480
give you a little background on who I am and I'm actually the senior manager for

1004
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:15,840
desktop graphics I 18n and fedora inside reddit all right great to meet you then

1005
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,720
so of course so even though of course the fedora team that I manage are in

1006
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,720
charge of all the fedora editions of course due to all the other groups being

1007
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,120
distributed that's sort of usually where my focus and it's being so so I don't

1008
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:34,400
necessarily have a lot of insight into call it these other parts of of fedora

1009
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,000
and so I'm also interested in just your opinions too so you don't you don't feel

1010
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,440
like when you come on the show you have to have like I'm speaking on behalf of

1011
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,640
the fedora project I'm just interested in your opinion as a Linux user too yeah

1012
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:52,720
yeah I mean it's a talk to take the system tray I mean I think it was

1013
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,840
something that was single for a long time that they wanted to stop having

1014
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,140
people use these data cycles because a they were using an old an old extender

1015
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:05,940
that was problematic in terms of focus and many other things yeah and so they

1016
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,280
tried to do this thing where I you know we sent up an awesome saying hey you

1017
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,880
know eventually this will be deprecated and of course nobody ever moved on those

1018
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,920
yeah but do you think but what makes you think anybody will move now well the

1019
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,800
hope is of course that once it's not a default feature that you have to know

1020
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,920
install extension if you want the system tray it will motivate and at the same

1021
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,040
time we do have an active outreach effort at the moment working with

1022
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,000
various vendors who are still using the system trade to try to basically say hey

1023
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,760
this is a better way of doing it well that's good yeah that's nice I mean so

1024
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,760
I'm glad to hear about the outreach so the thing that crosses my mind is that

1025
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,000
see here's where it gets sticky and I again I know you're not speaking

1026
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,400
officially just in your opinion it seems to me like if the position is we need to

1027
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,240
stop doing this in the meantime use an extension but oh by the way that

1028
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:57,480
extensions totally gonna break and inversion I mean that that is a

1029
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,000
particular sticky situation don't you think yeah no I agree and what I guess

1030
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,880
what not very well communicated was that at least you know speaking for for the

1031
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,680
team I managed at Red Hat I mean we took ownership of making sure that that

1032
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:16,720
extension works in Fedora okay okay and thus I mean it's it's a community

1033
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,160
extension but of course if if you see that it breaks we will fix it to make

1034
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,600
sure it works so if I install that on Fedora is that coming from the Fedora

1035
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,280
repository no it does come from the extreme extension repository but we

1036
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,560
would go there and fix it oh guys officially announced that he was not

1037
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:42,200
going to continue maintaining it hmm yeah so I mean as I said we will as a

1038
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:47,760
project you're gonna keep ah okay and I mean what you have any background on

1039
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,840
that decision that's that's awesome to hear that thank you for telling me that

1040
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,720
but what's the do you have any background on did that did the project

1041
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,160
sort of did Fedora debate you know this is something we need to do or how did

1042
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:02,880
that come about because I had no idea about this no I mean well this we had a

1043
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,040
decision that that in universe some people who had you know an old

1044
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,760
application where they still acquired a system tray I mean I have to say though

1045
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:17,260
I have a couple applications that still use a system tray icon but I have

1046
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,840
forgotten about them right because even with old UI they were sort of hidden in

1047
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,840
a little weird corner and done at the bottom yeah yeah and so the multiple

1048
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,680
applications that you know builder UI in a way that require it are quite few and

1049
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,880
far between these days and yeah the few know about this ones we're trying to

1050
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,380
work the hardest with to get moving to a different setup but but in terms of you

1051
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:42,800
know discussion we had inside Fedora and reddit was like hey okay we know that

1052
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,840
this needs to be there and of course we need to step up and make sure it keeps

1053
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,760
working because you know well at the end of the day right we a lot of these

1054
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,920
things you know end up also in rel and us we have to make sure over sharing

1055
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,800
customers have things at work you know having thought about it for a couple of

1056
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,760
weeks I agree they are kind of user hostile in a sense and you know the

1057
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,280
thing is is if you're if we're all honest with ourselves it's a paradigm

1058
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,560
that was that was forced upon us from Windows and it's one that we just

1059
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:14,080
adopted on Linux to fit in and it kind of sucks it really actually sucks and so

1060
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,440
I'm not I'm not opposed to figuring out a better way of doing it and I think

1061
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,560
it's it's it's pretty decent of the Fedora project to say we're gonna try to

1062
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,320
work upstream to keep this thing working and and that sounds like it worked for

1063
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:31,960
all gnome users to not just necessarily Fedora yeah that's pretty cool and also

1064
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:36,480
going back to the gnome 3 thing since that's I mean that's not gonna be

1065
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,360
deprecated for a while anyway so that the support for this extension will

1066
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,720
still have a long life even though the guys not maintaining it it's still he

1067
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:49,160
also said it's gonna still be around for a very long time yeah yeah yeah so I

1068
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,680
also just a just I'll just touch on this point just to make just a follow back

1069
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,680
people that heard it might be wanted no more so trim support has been around in

1070
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,240
Fedora for a little while now but the thing that's really great now is that

1071
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,920
the Fedora 27 has introduced trim support for encrypted disks which I know

1072
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,920
Noah's gonna care a lot about because it's gonna greatly enhance the

1073
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,680
performance of Fedora workstation on SSDs that use encryption and I know

1074
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,520
that's got to be you brown bear absolutely I I don't own a computer that

1075
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:21,000
doesn't have an SSD anymore everything has either an SSD or is envy any which

1076
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
you know SSDs but yeah yeah first so everything is and you know everything is

1077
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,360
going that way too right I strongly suspect that for the rest of the time

1078
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,720
that I ever buy laptops I'm not gonna buy a computer with spinning rust in it

1079
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,000
I mean that's just that's just the reality of 2017 hey guys I want to get

1080
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,920
one last plug 8 5 5 4 5 0 6 6 2 4 that's the phone number you can join us live on

1081
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,280
the air for a special edition of Linux unplugged Jay is calling hey Jay you're

1082
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:52,080
on Linux unplugged what's on your mind hey I'm calling about well I'm doing

1083
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:58,800
tech support for club well I I was one client that I do freelance and I work at

1084
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,800
the software developer actually but I still have one client I do freelance

1085
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,840
that I'm good friends with the CEO and I was wondering how I could resolve

1086
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:13,120
issues where I make mistakes and I don't feel like I should go for them how do

1087
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,560
you how do you handle that if you if you make a mistake and you spend a lot of

1088
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,520
extra time doing something and then you feel like you shouldn't build them but

1089
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:26,360
you still spent the time to get it done yeah so part of that Jay though it's an

1090
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:31,200
ethics question right and the way I answer ethics questions is I simply do

1091
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,800
the moccasin test if put the other person's moccasins on and walk them out

1092
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,800
in their shoes and see how you feel so for example if you if they asked you

1093
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,920
they said we want you to come install a router for us so that we can get our

1094
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:46,440
four front desk machines on the internet so what you should do is take

1095
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,960
the router out of the box and plug it into the modem and turn it on and plug

1096
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,680
all the computers in and they should just come online that that's what you

1097
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,720
need to do and you'd build a client for like an hour of time and in instead you

1098
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:01,440
pull it out of the box and you know unbeknownst to you maybe you maybe you

1099
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,600
inadvertently shut the web interface off and you can't figure out how to turn it

1100
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,040
back on and you're trying to get in you're trying to SSH in so you're

1101
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,840
calling the manufacturer what's the default password for the SSH oh yeah

1102
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,280
well I don't know what version I have and you're doing that dance right and so

1103
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,320
come lo and behold you spent four hours doing it is that if you were the client

1104
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:22,040
would you want to get billed for four hours of work for that while you're

1105
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,020
while your IT guy learned how to do his job right no of course not but at the

1106
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,840
same time if you get called in and the client says yeah we need our internet

1107
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,040
went down we don't know what to do and you say well I've never been here before

1108
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,880
tell me the layout where's your network documentation who is the last guy that

1109
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,560
worked for you and they say yeah we don't know anything about that listen

1110
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,520
this that closet at the end now that's where your breaker room is whatever then

1111
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,960
it's the other one over there that closet yeah okay that's the right one so

1112
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,840
where's the documentation we don't have any documentation there's the owners

1113
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,920
manuals I think if that's what you're looking for those are in there now if

1114
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,360
you're spending time resetting username and passwords and you're spending time

1115
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,280
tracing wire connections that's not I mean yeah absolutely you should bill for

1116
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,240
that and and and that comes down to again how would you want to be treated

1117
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,680
and so and sometimes you take a hybrid approach to sometimes you get somewhere

1118
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,920
is some you know so far into something like maybe you're tracing a cable and

1119
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,200
you get to a point you say I should oh I'm an idiot I should have known that

1120
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,000
this cable would run to that switch room or I should have looked for if there was

1121
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,480
another switch closet that may be your fault that may be something you feel

1122
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:24,760
guilty about but at the same time unless you were told about that it's but you're

1123
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,720
perfectly lit you're perfectly within your right I would say to build the

1124
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,880
client and a lot of times what I'll do in those six in their circumstances is I

1125
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,720
will I'll kind of do my no affair billing so if I look at something and I

1126
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,600
said well I was technically here for six hours but I think I got about four hours

1127
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,040
I think I delivered four hours of work I'm only gonna build that client for

1128
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,360
four hours and I'm if I especially there's a particular client we work for

1129
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,360
and they pay me or they would pay me if I build them for it they they would pay

1130
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,080
me hundreds of dollars to stand in front of locked doors because they have this

1131
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,400
idiotic policy that the security guy is the only guy that can come unlock a door

1132
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,080
for me and so I walk up to the door and I stand there and I call in the front

1133
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,880
desk and I say yeah I need somebody come it just it's ridiculous and so if I was

1134
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,760
billing them you know and I would I would say I'm within my right if I'm

1135
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,880
standing there for 15 minutes every time I need to get through a door I would be

1136
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,920
within my right to build them are $75 an hour and I don't partly because mostly

1137
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,680
because I value their business and I like the owner and I understand why

1138
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,560
those security principles are in place given the nature of their business does

1139
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,520
that answer your question yeah yeah because I really like to you know I try

1140
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:33,280
and give give give my customers the the the kind of service I would like to have

1141
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,400
and it and and and I knew that if if someone made a mistake and they were

1142
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,040
just you know spin the wheels for a couple for a couple hours I wouldn't I

1143
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,680
wouldn't want to get those for that and at the same time I just I spent time on

1144
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:51,680
it and they did get done yeah but that's just yeah I hear you it's kind of a

1145
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,360
different it's kind of a it's kind of an interesting thing to thread one more

1146
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,000
room do you have any thoughts as well as the answer I gave is that is that how

1147
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,240
most you feel or somebody have a different opinion I agree it just it

1148
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,240
depends on how much of your mistake like how much of a setback is your mistake if

1149
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:11,120
it's if it's a something that's not that big of a deal that you know maybe cost

1150
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,960
you an extra 30 minutes of time and work you could you could say that that's

1151
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,560
that's something you can just kind of throw in but if it's something that you

1152
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,400
you I think if you cause the problem that gives you yourself an extra four

1153
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,560
hours I think you shouldn't really but you shouldn't really charge for that if

1154
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,880
the mistake was solely on your fault but it was not you know well lack of

1155
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,440
information or something like maybe you configured something and you come back

1156
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:40,160
an hour later and you realize oh you have to start all over again this is why

1157
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,080
you build research into your contract you build a right hours for of research

1158
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,080
in yeah yeah and you Pat and you know that's the thing too is I and I explain

1159
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,320
this to people a lot I'll say if we're gonna quote something we're gonna quote

1160
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,840
high and some people you know they're put I mean I'm serious if we're if

1161
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:59,240
you're gonna yeah over I mean 100% 100% every time you know we don't under bill

1162
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,760
if I if I go into a place and I'm being honest if I go into a place and I think

1163
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,800
somebody's going to if something's gonna take 10 hours to do we're gonna build

1164
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,960
that client for 12 or we're gonna estimate them for 12 or 15 and the

1165
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,320
reason for that is because I've done this long enough to know that things

1166
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,480
come up and on the off chance that something doesn't come up well that just

1167
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,760
offsets the number of times that something did come up and we went 10

1168
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,000
hours over and like you said after a while you start to budget that in and

1169
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,120
you start to get a good feel of it but if you and we'll do real-time real-time

1170
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,120
billing we do that if you say just come and do this job fine we'll do it and

1171
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,400
we'll let you know at the end how long it actually took and we'll believe for

1172
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,480
that but if you want us to stay because it goes both ways if I'm gonna go in and

1173
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,240
I'm gonna sign my name to something saying we will only bill you for this

1174
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,480
many hours well I'm gonna make sure that we don't lose money on it that's just

1175
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,360
the way we do things but you know more often that more often than that more

1176
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,000
often than I'm worried about not losing money I'm worried about saving my

1177
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,440
clients money oh yeah one of the ways I've done that recently and this was

1178
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,880
actually with a law firm we recommended them with Ting and Ting if you're not

1179
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,960
familiar with it is a mobile service provider where you own the service and

1180
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:05,080
you own the device I remember the first time I switched to Ting I instantly I

1181
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,360
knew well there's two things I knew first of all I knew that any service

1182
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,920
that had a URL of linux.ting.com and when I went to that linux.ting.com it

1183
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,880
saved me money if I get somebody's gonna give $25 to go to a Linux URL that right

1184
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,680
off the bat I knew that was a good thing but then after I started to get

1185
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,440
involved with Ting and I was previously on a big-name carrier and they sent me

1186
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,760
the phone and it felt like my phone because they're not they're not locked

1187
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,320
phones they're not locked to Ting you can take it to any service you want and

1188
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,160
vice versa you can go to Best Buy and buy any phone you want about my son and

1189
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,000
Asus do you remember what that was Chris he showed it to you when we were in

1190
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,800
Minneapolis ZenFone I bought him an Asus ZenFone at Best Buy and you know

1191
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,040
we and I had anticipated this so I'd activated the Ting SIM card which I

1192
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,640
have on hand I have like 10 or 15 of them that I keep around just you know

1193
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:53,240
and we get out to the car and my son goes as soon as he opens a box I knew

1194
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,920
this was coming just dad this thing doesn't have internet how do we get an

1195
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,040
internet I'm like I got you buddy I got you here's your SIM card and I just

1196
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,900
handed him a SIM card and with Ting's dashboard yeah I said it dashboard the

1197
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:08,560
dashboard allows me to control how much data he uses how many minutes he uses

1198
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,640
and how many messages he sends and so I've gone in there and said he doesn't

1199
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,880
need to be texting anyone there's nobody he knows that he would know how to text

1200
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,480
he doesn't need to do that we want everything over Telegram where I can

1201
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,680
monitor his communications I don't care if he calls people but I don't want it

1202
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,160
to last I don't he never needs more than a hundred minutes if he accidentally

1203
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,800
inadvertently dial something and just leaves the phone sitting for three days

1204
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,760
you know I don't want a big bill because I'm gonna be calling you Sarah or my son

1205
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,480
and until we run yeah exactly exactly and so and so they're they're only pay

1206
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:40,380
for what you use and the ability to for that granular type control absolutely

1207
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:45,320
fantastic linux.ting.com and huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

1208
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,720
unplugged program so I have a article I don't know if you saw this Chris I

1209
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,160
threw it in your kind of last minute but there is a gentleman by the name of

1210
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:59,160
Tommy Jordan really liked the guy and basically he has a website that he runs

1211
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,440
called eight minutes of fame it's a long story about that relates to a YouTube

1212
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,040
video that that kind of cast him into the limelight unexpectedly but he wrote

1213
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:10,000
a very interesting article about encryption and basically the article

1214
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,840
starts out it says we've seen it plastered all over national news these

1215
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,120
last two years the encryption debate between tech companies and civilians

1216
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,240
wanting to keep their data private while being weighed against the government's

1217
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,780
desire to gain access to anything and everything that can be hunt to stop the

1218
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:26,880
terrorists now he goes on to say and he outlines us very very well he says the

1219
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,720
government argues that these kinds of data being hidden behind encryption

1220
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:35,200
provides important clues that they need to stop terrorists the data that they're

1221
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,980
able to retrieve out of a cell phone tablet or encrypted message can be

1222
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:41,520
viewed in simple terms and I think that I can give you an inclusive list and

1223
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,920
then he lists them so what things can we get out of encryption well he says we

1224
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:50,000
can get where where they have been so the GPS location when they were there so

1225
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,760
you know when they were there the timestamp what they what they read

1226
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,440
online so the browsing history stuff like that who they've talked to messenger

1227
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:03,000
it telegram email contact lists etc how they've communicated analyzing which

1228
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,540
apps they've used and all that stuff and then the contextual conversations of the

1229
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,920
email and then they show what files they that they've downloaded onto the device

1230
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,560
but you know the one key thing that is missing out of all that stuff that we

1231
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,880
could get if we just done away with encryption if we just turned encryption

1232
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,120
off and it is an on-off thing and he goes so far to explain to make a real

1233
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,680
big point about that that the government keeps saying they want reasonable

1234
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,320
encryption there is no such thing as reasonable encryption it's a light

1235
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,280
switch the light is either on or the light is off there is no in-between and

1236
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,920
if you say if your argument is but but no what they're talking about is they're

1237
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,120
saying that they want encryption that's weak enough that the government only can

1238
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,120
crack well then it's not encryption that's not actually encrypted if the

1239
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,840
government you get into it try and hold the light switch in the middle of the

1240
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:48,920
thing and it's either on or off but what the important thing is even if we do away

1241
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,360
with encryption we turn that light switch off you know the one thing we

1242
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:56,600
don't ever get why why did somebody do this why did somebody send this message

1243
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:02,160
why does somebody feel this way and the why is the most important aspect of it

1244
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,840
because the why tells you what they're going to do and you know of that so

1245
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:14,360
good I'll say this so this is this is a big problem for open source projects and

1246
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:18,640
I haven't really figured out how to talk about it yet because I don't know how to

1247
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:23,120
talk about it without seeming like I'm I'm like I didn't like I need to get

1248
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:27,080
like a tinfoil hat and need to run around about the sky falling right

1249
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:33,480
because to me I don't I don't I don't understand how the US government is

1250
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:38,400
going to Institute laws about how encryption is implemented that affect

1251
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,320
open source projects that are developed all over the world they can't

1252
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:46,240
tributaries yeah I just don't understand how how can open source comply with

1253
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:51,720
anything and and anything anything that the u.s. district just decrees

1254
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:56,160
encryption must follow these these projects are built by people all over

1255
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:00,280
the world yeah and people that largely couldn't care people that largely not

1256
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,320
only don't care what the US government thinks yeah but largely want to combat

1257
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,280
what the US government thinks and the reason that that encryption exists in

1258
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:12,600
the first place or yeah or have no reason to give a shit

1259
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,720
no right yeah yeah but there are other governments that they also might have to

1260
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:20,800
comply with that yeah the opposite well and and if the US government decides it

1261
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,440
wants it well then how soon after that does China and Russia you know what all

1262
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,520
the other governments want it honestly it doesn't matter if every government in

1263
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,000
the world wants it because what you're fundamentally trying to do is put a

1264
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,440
genie back in a bottle I mean it is it is it's just this to me seems like the

1265
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,360
same argument is when a celebrity has pictures that are leaked and then they

1266
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,760
say we want to start taking them down yeah right don't look at them I think

1267
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,320
what they're gonna ask for and when I say they I mean the US government is

1268
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:51,560
they're gonna ask for some sort of escrow system where they're not gonna

1269
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,640
say give us the keys give us the backdoor put it in an escrow and then

1270
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:01,880
when we have a lawful when we when the FISA court gives us the lawful right to

1271
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,900
peak we will go to this escrow and we will activate the backdoor so they'll

1272
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,260
go where's my rubber stamp it's around here so oh there it is okay they'll go

1273
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,640
to Apple they'll go to Google and they say with your messaging platforms and

1274
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,040
they'll eventually go to Telegram and WhatsApp and all of them that they can

1275
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:21,240
and the only the only the systems like wire and signal that are better designed

1276
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:26,000
will be immune from this everything else skype's already a victim will be in

1277
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,360
slack I'm sure will be subject to this you know the thing is though the people

1278
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,240
that care are going to know I mean it's not gonna be a secret I mean it's a

1279
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,320
secret the first time and then after the first person is convicted or or their

1280
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,680
messages are decrypted then then the cat's out of the bag and then everyone

1281
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,200
that cares about keeping their stuff private it's gonna move to something

1282
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,240
else so I don't seem like a one-burn match I would like to hear from somebody

1283
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,480
from the mobile room who it may be is even outside the u.s. a bit or inside

1284
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,640
the u.s. is fine but you know this is something that's gonna affect the whole

1285
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:01,000
world yeah to make extra one point there though I mean I have no direct

1286
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,600
knowledge about this but I mean what the US government or any government can do

1287
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:09,040
right they can enforce what local companies do and so I mean it's not just

1288
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,920
about stopping you know well some of in London kind of guys here I mean it's

1289
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,040
also about like you know catching white-collar criminals for instance in

1290
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,760
in big banks or whatever and of course if you have policies in place that

1291
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,640
enforces this bank to for instance provide any encryption key that used to

1292
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,680
escrow that means that I can get to you know the email exchanges whatever that's

1293
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:32,920
happened inside that company yeah but I I mean I don't mean to be the cynical

1294
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,640
person of the room but to me it seems like anybody who wants to break the law

1295
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:42,760
in any significant way is going to be hip enough to realize they shouldn't use

1296
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,800
any system that's been proactively tapped by the US government they'll use

1297
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,880
the system outside of that and there will always be system outside of that

1298
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,280
and the only people subject to monitoring will be the standards regular

1299
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,680
old Joe Schmoes let me pose it let me let me pose it let me pose another

1300
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,120
question to you guys the problem one of the problems with giving up encryption

1301
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,000
is that if you had a guy and there's the article I'm not coming up with this this

1302
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,020
is in the article if a guy goes through an airport and he has caught trying to

1303
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:14,360
bomb that airport and they take him down and they search his person and they

1304
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,280
find a camera I don't think anyone in this room would argue that that camera

1305
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,380
is not pertinent to the investigation of why this guy was trying to blow up the

1306
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:24,960
airport might contain evidence right we agree on that but the camera might only

1307
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,600
contain 30 or 40 pictures when we start talking about they want access to you

1308
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,280
know your Google photos we're not talking about the last 30 or 40 pictures

1309
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,120
you took you're talking about everything you've ever done the entire scope of

1310
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,640
your life when you're talking about the phone right you're talking about every

1311
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:44,800
Wi-Fi exact point exactly and so and so who thinks that who out there legitimately

1312
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,320
thinks that any government has the right that once you commit one crime because

1313
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:54,040
of that one and actually really you're accused of committing a single crime why

1314
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,200
who out there actually believes that the government should get unfettered access

1315
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,720
to every your entire digital life which is more and more of our actual lives

1316
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,880
these days who actually thinks that's fair I would say it's it's a bigger

1317
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:13,720
problem than that though because we can all decide as as a democracy and the

1318
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,520
Republic of the United States we can all decide that's fine the land of the brave

1319
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,240
and the free that we want to be screened we want our devices scanned we want

1320
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,160
everything downloaded that is totally fine and 100% as a democracy we've

1321
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,360
decided it's great I'm talking like in the future we've decided we are going to

1322
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:34,240
trade all of our freedoms for security the thing is that doesn't necessarily

1323
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,560
mean that the citizens of Canada want to live that way right and the problem that

1324
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,120
open source has to address here is how do we serve a market as huge as the

1325
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:50,040
United States that has all of these fuck crazy laws that are essentially 1984

1326
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:55,200
draconian laws that the rest of the world except for Iran and Russia and

1327
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:00,200
Syria those countries have these laws in place but outside of that nobody no

1328
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:04,640
others no other modern democracy has these kinds of laws in place so how do

1329
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,840
we serve the United States and everywhere else and I don't understand

1330
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,240
how you're gonna have people that can contribute to one common code base that

1331
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,080
have significantly different laws that they have to adhere to can work

1332
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:19,480
together I don't understand how you can ship one distribution for the US and one

1333
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:23,120
distribution for Canada when we have significantly different encryption laws

1334
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:27,600
that fundamentally mean back doors into encryption versus no back doors I mean

1335
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,640
Chris it's really easy you just have a setting in the settings you flip a

1336
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:36,440
switch yeah totally crappy encryption we can have a dashboard American week

1337
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:42,800
encryption and world encryption the solution is obviously turning all the

1338
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,720
US laws into internet laws and everybody has to associate to the right and we'll

1339
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:50,840
all go by UTC right well that's the one logical thing I've heard in this

1340
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,120
conversation but no you know it's it's going to be something interesting

1341
01:35:54,120 --> 01:36:01,640
because this to me seems like it's largely one of those things that is is a

1342
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,840
driving force in one direction I I very seldom see anyone the government

1343
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,820
reversing its opinion and suddenly deciding well actually you know we're

1344
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:13,060
not going to push to to try and break encryption and the one thing that we

1345
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:17,800
have working in our favor is this is the one time when market reality and social

1346
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:21,360
reality doesn't really mean anything we're really it's about the technical

1347
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,480
advantages that's really what matters so I actually a funny thing about the one

1348
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:31,360
of the recent releases from from the current government is that they they are

1349
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,000
saying that they're kind of pulling back on not wanting the encryption broken but

1350
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,080
you know just just make copies of everything so we can look at them later

1351
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,800
yeah yeah well it's like I said it's one of those things that I think as long as

1352
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,560

negative in the freedom dimension

1362
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:23,880
something tells me you like having the ability to scream like a madman without

1363
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:29,360
it actually winding up in a recording that matters long into the outro before

1364
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:34,560
I've never heard it I felt like I was just jiving with it it was what did you

1365
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,840
say was yeah that was did I play the wrong one no I'm just that we just never

1366
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,960
we cut it off before that sometimes I just hard cut it you know we all really

1367
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,040
oh you don't want that nice grad that's such a good fade it's good though it's

1368
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,800
good right I mean I did originally and I didn't originally build that fade to

1369
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,440
just let it play out but yeah you know in the last 30 weeks or so I we've

1370
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:59,840
started we just can't shut up because everything's too much fun that's what

1371
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:04,160
the thing is yeah not only did I not only did I let it play out then I gave

1372
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,920
it a good like one or two seconds before I started talking so we're Kai has a

1373
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,400
nice tape cut point all right so we got to pick a title we got to pick oh yeah

1374
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,160
I haven't participated in this process in a long time I'm gonna do this okay

1375
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:22,080
the process is kind of a convoluted now no you just always it really you well

1376
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:27,880
you go to the discord you search for your bang suggest so you can't do it's

1377
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,800
not JB titles anymore I'm sorry you can go to both oh you can do both okay so

1378
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,360
you got to search the search them you guys search the discord okay bang

1379
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:39,480
suggest because you can just it turns out a discord has a great search so you

1380
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,560
just search for bang suggest and you just see all of them in one result and

1381
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:50,000
then JB titles for you know like the bot action I'm not liking these titles yeah

1382
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,800
well what do you think we should go with what anybody like Dora quantum leap hmm

1383
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,800
that's not bad but that was a very small part of the total thank you Christian

1384
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,720
for joining us that's the combo thing I don't know if there was a was there a

1385
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:06,960
big part of the show hey before we get out of the post show I because I wanted

1386
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,360
to mention in the main show that Dan here from elementary OS was just

1387
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,400
recently over on late night Linux had a great interview they gave him a few hard

1388
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:20,480
questions and he was he had some great answers so if you want to hear Dan have

1389
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,320
to answer some tough questions go check out late night Linux do you remember

1390
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:30,120
what episode number was Dan that's a great yeah you know I'm gonna do Dan is

1391
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,720
what I'm gonna do is why you and I look it up is I'm just gonna fill a little

1392
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,320
bit of air time and by doing so I'm just gonna sit here and talk for a few

1393
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,360
moments because what you want to do right is you want to Google it real

1394
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:50,120
quick episode 24 everyone yeah episode 24 of late night Linux has this here Dan

1395
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:53,880
the rabbit in there and he answers the hard questions about elementary OS that

1396
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,920
have been on your mind by the way we forgot something for the Mozilla review

1397
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,200
there's a new chapter in the book of Mozilla right now with the quantum

1398
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:12,120
release it's now chapter 11 colon 14 you know the story about that well chapter

1399
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:20,560
11 here in the United States I think means you open the Mozilla browser and

1400
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:27,800
you're typing about colon Mozilla and you will get a chapter which normally

1401
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:34,280
tells you about to release and the time of the release so if you have version 16

1402
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:42,120
it's starts with the twins of Memon quarreled and now with version with the

1403
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:48,280
new version the book of Mozilla is 11 colon 14 which started the Beast adopted

1404
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,980
new Raymond and studied the ways of time and space and I didn't it goes on like

1405
01:41:53,980 --> 01:42:01,720
that whoa it's some kind of Easter egg it's some kind of Easter egg hey guys

1406
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:08,600
hey guys Jordan Jordanism from the chat room suggested member when JB cared about

1407
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,840
IRC that really seems like that'd be appropriate for the title don't you

1408
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,280
think that seems like that'd be a really fucking good title for this episode I

1409
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:20,840
think I think it really exemplifies what happened in the episode I think we

1410
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,200
talked about it a lot throughout the episode there was a lot of good

1411
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:28,000
discussion really respectful for all of the work that one two three four five

1412
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,320
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifteen sixteen people put

1413
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,520
into this week's episode and all the topics we covered yeah that's really

1414
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:45,600
that's great that's thank you Jordan thank you I wanted to kick Chris's

1415
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,280
nostalgia a little bit you'd mentioned open CC in the box it actually didn't

1416
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:56,640
come with one book it came with two so it came with the user manual I don't

1417
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:59,920
remember when they started doing this but they put a second book in there with

1418
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,760
all the printed man pages that's what it was I couldn't remember I thought so

1419
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,440
good good memory good recollection do you have like a box around it have you

1420
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:15,680
looked at a box recently how did you remember that oh I I don't have my box

1421
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,000
anymore and that's depressing I threw it away oh that's sad yeah so she said

1422
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,560
well yeah man printed man pages that sounds really nice though just keep it

1423
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:31,240
right on your desk thumb through it totally searchable I love it well okay

1424
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,920
so we got a title this thing we got it we got to get a name for this thing

1425
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:41,840
because this is this is going off the rails I got a real I got a real crash

1426
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,640
course and installing applications fedora oh yeah we should talk about that

1427
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,520
the beard had to install a few apps on the door for the show today we didn't

1428
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,360
even get to that a lot less fedora than I expected I I installed apps we have

1429
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:57,920
five different methods or attempted to anyway you first you have the the normal

1430
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:04,040
DNA software oh okay and you didn't go gooey first who was gooey for installing

1431
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:10,960
software people that like to install software these it's for people who like

1432
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,800
to mess with the computer pretty easy and plus the other thing is three of the

1433
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:21,920
methods don't have ways to do it via the software okay I was pleased that slack

1434
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:26,080
had an rpm I could easily install that was nice yeah okay the second thing I

1435
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:30,920
tried and this was actually pretty easy to get chrome installed you just add the

1436
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:36,640
third-party chrome repo from Google are you telling me they have a repo for

1437
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:40,600
fedora yeah that's they did the same thing for Debbie and as well I gotta be

1438
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:49,640
honest with you I'm sorry you guys but Firefox yeah the third method which I

1439
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:57,720
managed to get nothing installed via is copper okay that was no good no the

1440
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:03,200
fourth method was enabling rpm fusion that was to get telegram installed mm-hmm

1441
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:12,400
oh nice method because I could not get discord via rpm fusion or copper was

1442
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:16,600
that I also had to use flatbacks oh my god I enabled a flat hub and I install

1443
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:23,160
that via the software stuff okay so okay so let's back up for a second so what

1444
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:27,680
did you say before discord what did you install before tell good how did so how

1445
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,440
did the telegram thing go down how does that work so did you what did you do to

1446
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:36,360
get telegram working rpm fusion so you added a repo yes so you did like a DNF

1447
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:41,000
command use there's a DNF commands yeah and then did you install it via the

1448
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,440
command line or did you install via the software center command line okay and

1449
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:49,440
then the last thing you installed was discord and you installed that via

1450
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:55,480
flatpak but you added a repo for flatpak yeah I enabled a flat hub and

1451
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,360
did you install it then after that via the command line or if we had known

1452
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,640
software known software interesting so it now it just shows I actually couldn't

1453
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,560
figure out how to install via the command so you added the flatpak repo

1454
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:10,240
and then you you open gnome software and you searched for discord and then

1455
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:16,400
discord showed up it told me that the source was flab oh interesting in when

1456
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,640
you want to install flat pack flat pack from the the command line you also have

1457
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:25,800
to include the repo in the flat pack command yeah yeah yeah I'm not a big fan

1458
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:31,760
of that it's a little convoluted but yeah that seems counterintuitive like I

1459
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,360
already added the repo why is it not just searching the enabled repos yeah

1460
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,360
welcome to PPAs yeah mm-hmm yeah I know this is this is so this is PPAs don't

1461
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:43,760
require you to tell the prepo after you haven't installed though so no but you

1462
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,280
do have to do an update right so you add the PPA you add the key when you add

1463
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,120
it and then you have to do an apt update and then you have to do that then you do

1464
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:55,600
the install it feels a lot like PPA yeah but with flatpaks you have to every

1465
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:00,160
time you install the app you have to specify the repo URL that's true yeah

1466
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:06,400
that's true yeah everyone should use a UI anyway that's how we designed it say

1467
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,680
again everyone should use gnome software I mean that's a whole point here to move

1468
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,720
away from needing command line tools it definitely it definitely does feel like

1469
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,020
that like the whole thing is pretty straightforward install the repo there

1470
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:21,800
right well that's true yeah adding the repo you still drop to the command line

1471
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:25,720
yeah I the reason I tried to do every the command line was because I was

1472
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,800
already on the command line to add the repo I don't think there is a way in

1473
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,360
gnome software to add it through and add it add a flat hub anyway yeah that does

1474
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,880
seem like something that needs to get I guess that does feel like a feature that

1475
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,960
needs to be added because it'd be nice yeah yeah I actually want one thing

1476
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:45,520
we're looking to do there actually subject is we are going to start

1477
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:52,520
pre-populating this database with various repos so that so the setup will

1478
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,160
be that when you start fedora since it's meant to be all free software you'll

1479
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,600
better get a question as part of the initial setup saying hey do you want to

1480
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,400
enable third-party repositories and if you say yes a lot of these things like

1481
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:10,360
chrome and and steam and nvidia driver and and and so on will just be

1482
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:19,040
pre-populated for you to download that's wonderful hmm yeah I I when I they it

1483
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,600
seems like it seems like a decent solution like I the more I the more I

1484
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:27,480
see distributions implementing flat pack the more I see how it really does make

1485
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,200
sense for a lot of different yeah different uses for open source software

1486
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:36,280
yeah I think if I do use fedora in the future I'm gonna start with flat hub

1487
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:40,240
yes yes exactly that's what I would do too now because it seems like it has

1488
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,720
most of what I wanted like I actually just searched telegram and gnome

1489
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,440
software and now there's two different versions I have one from flat hub and

1490
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,680
one from yeah our people and then you could and then the fact is you can still

1491
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,660
get snaps working on there too so that kind of covers some of the other space

1492
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:56,360
and then it's like well what do you have left that isn't covered by those two

1493
01:48:56,360 --> 01:49:03,120
things and the list well but thankfully they package it for the distro you want

1494
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,680
yeah I mean they're doing that work now right yeah I can see if one of these

1495
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:12,320
things takes off either way that I could see Google changing that if if fedora

1496
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:16,800
supported both snap and flat back then that would solve most of the issues of

1497
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:38,240
packaging entirely mm-hmm and I'll use app image for everything else
