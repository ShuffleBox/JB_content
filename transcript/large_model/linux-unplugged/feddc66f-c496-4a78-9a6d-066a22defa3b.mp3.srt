1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,320
All right, so here's what here's essentially what my the last like week and a half has been like so

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,760
Starting last week. I was out at a clients, and I was working and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
My kids every time they get sick it kind of like passes around

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,300
It's like we're gonna rather Rosie, and then we all die right and around Sunday

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,440
I started to get sick the Sunday that I arrived there now

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,260
That's a Sunday that feeling prior with starting this is Sunday prior to election day, right?

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,240
so Sunday and Monday, I kind of stick it out not too bad and

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,120
Around Monday Tuesday it starts to kind of sink in right after the election start to lose my voice start to get super stick start

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
Throwing up start coughing. Yeah, it's bad and

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,920
Go basically the rest of the week like that get home Friday late late Friday

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,720
and I thought well, I'm gonna take the weekend and just

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
hyper hyper rest

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,640
Lots and lots of rest lots and lots of water lots and lots of good food try to fix yourself

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Yeah, I'm gonna kick myself back into gear so that I can be here ready to roll on Monday

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,240
So that's what I do Friday that what I little time I have on Friday

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Saturday and Sunday

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,320
Monday get a super important call, and I decide I have to go into a client to take care of something before I leave town

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,160
So I look at the seats available, and I find out that there aren't a lot of flights to Seattle anyway

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,760
So I go take care of the client and I get to the airport fly over to Minneapolis

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,680
Which is the only place you can fly out of Grand Forks?

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,560
And I spend nine and a half hours in the airport trying to get flights to Seattle

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,760
We get to 1045 at night, and it turns out we're not going to get to Seattle

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,680
There's just no way flights are not gonna happen so I

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,120
Call Rekind I'm like dude. I am exhausted. I have had four or five hours of sleep

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,240
I have been here for nine and a half hours

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
I don't know how to get to Seattle and

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,400
I just I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do and Rekind says well

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,040
We got to find something so him, and I spend like an hour

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,640
looking at every possible flight between Minneapolis st. Paul Airport and

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,760
Seattle Airport where did those two intersect well turns out Boise, Idaho is

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,140
A city that nobody wants to go to or from from either

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Minneapolis or Seattle and so they have 68 seats available, and so I'm all right

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go get on that flight

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
So I go hop on on the flight to Boise the problem is the flight to Boise

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Doesn't leave until 1045 at night, so now I'm at the airport going on 12 hours, and I

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,960
Fly to Boise, and I land in Boise at midnight flight back out of Boise into Seattle isn't till 645 the next morning

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,560
so I go like lay down to try and get some sleep and

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,360
Airport security guy comes and he's like excuse me sir you you can't sleep here you have to be outside of security well

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,240
Inside a security they have nice soft little benches outside of security

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,200
They have the anti-bum metal benches that have big bumps on them, so you can't actually sleep right

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,400
So I'm I try it can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep about an hour in I get some sort of sinus

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,080
plug infection something and

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,760
It just makes my entire jaw and my face

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,320
Just like this crippling pain that I can't I can't even I can't talk I can't breathe

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,680
I can't do anything all I can do is concentrate about how much my face hurts

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,920
So I look to see if there's like a little shop or something I can go get some some decongestant

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,000
Well there is on the other frequent side of security, right?

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,760
So I'm telegramming Rekai, and I'm like I need to get something you know arm

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,680
I I don't know how I'm going to continue living like this because I really cannot take this

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,960
So finally after four and a half hours or five and a half hours the security checkpoint opens back up

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm able to get through before I actually get through this the security line the

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,840
Crippling pain goes away, so I'm well

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,360
I mean yeah

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,920
This is this is looking up so but I still go spend seventeen dollars on some decongestant stuff just to have on hand

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I just considered a mantis suicide pills because it was gonna be and I didn't take my own life from pain right seemed like a good

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,960
Investment so I get those I get on the plane, and I'm like and thank God they had first-class available

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,920
so I was I was like well, I'm actually gonna get to sleep well apparently everyone in first class on a

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,040
645 a.m.. Flight wants to like have a social hour with the flight attendant right that's crazy

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,200
So every 30 seconds the flight attendants is coming up, and she's like

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,360
Hey there

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
How do I?

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,200
You know do you want anything to drink? Would you like a banana? Would you like toast?

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,480
Would you like to add a bread like really what I'd like is for you to GTFO and just let me sleep right you know

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,320
So I so I you know it's a it's a hour or something actually I entered the space-time continuum

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,200
It took off at 645 and landed at 6 o'clock, which is kind of cool. That's great. Yeah, so

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,600
So I land and and

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,200
Or maybe it was I took off at 6 and we let I don't remember anymore

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,960
but I land and all I want to do is get my just get a rental car and get to the studio and sleep and

69
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,520
I pull on to i5 and it is

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,640
Standstill traffic, and I'm like what is going on and so I'm flipping through the radio stations turns out

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,060
There's this huge car accident takes me three and a half hours to drive from the airport to the studio

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,820
And I finally get to the studio like I don't know 10 10 30 and I just crash right onto the couch

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,660
No sooner does my face hit the the the cushion do I hear the deep rumbling voice of a beard going?

74
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,300
Hey, Noah. It's you might want to get up because you got to be on air in 20 minutes. I'm like

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,020
So I drag myself back up go into the shower

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,060
And I have been trying not to use my voice

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,140
for the past couple days for two reasons one is because it hurts and two is

78
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,620
because I need to save what little of my voice I have left to do these two shows so

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,740
all

80
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,000
That to say that big long rant to say

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,460
I

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,340
Hear it's gonna be a fun. Yeah, it's gonna be a fun show and you get you know late-night jazz announcer Noah

83
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,420
That's that's what it's gonna be and the thing is like I was talking to my mother and we're going back and forth and

84
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,940
I'm like this is this is why my clients hire me though and

85
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,900
Because when Noah says Noah's gonna get something done

86
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,420
I will either get something done, or I will die in the process of trying to get something done

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,900
But one way or another yeah, it's happening. It's very stressful for your family, but it works out great

88
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,540
Yeah, yeah, well shit with you know we knew about the the JB trip

89
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, we didn't know a family perspective was we weren't aware that I was gonna be gone the week prior in Wisconsin

90
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,380
I didn't find that out until late in the week. Yeah, that's rough

91
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
so beard was kind enough to share his orange juice with me, so I

92
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,540
Have I have I have orange juice and vitamin C that I'm gonna be sucking down on the whole show

93
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,820
This is Linux Unplugged episode 171 for November 15th 2016

94
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:11,100
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show where the current hosts have taken off and been replaced by the walking dead

95
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,060
My name is Noah and joining me for the first time both of us here in the studio is Wes

96
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,820
How's it going man, I think I'm doing better than you are I think so you know it's great to finally be here in studio

97
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,700
I don't think we've ever done a show just you and I in the studio. I don't think so

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,300
We've done it remote yeah, we've done remotely you and I well those are a lot of fun

99
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,860
So this must be even more I agree I agree and hopefully if all goes well and according to plan

100
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,500
I won't kill you by the end of the episode and Chris won't tell us when he gets back exactly yeah

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,660
I didn't wipe out JB. That'll work out

102
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,420
We have a super fun and exciting show, but no show is complete

103
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,300
No show can even begin without first saying hello to our mumble room. Hello mumble room. How are you guys?

104
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,780
Holy cow

105
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,100
Full house well

106
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,700
Thank you mumble room and yeah

107
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,900
If if you didn't catch if this doesn't if it if my rent didn't make it into the pre-show this week

108
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,060
Noah is doing jazz voice Noah because Noah is

109
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,460
Practically dead, but I'm still here so

110
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,680
The first thing we're gonna talk about today is something near and dear to my heart anyone that has known me for more than 10 minutes

111
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,980
If you if you meet me on the street, or we're having a conversation in a restaurant the first thing

112
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm going to do is switch you to Linux and

113
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,180
After that happens after you've been converted and after you are letting you that's going to know it's gonna happen. Yeah, I just did it happens

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,240
After that happens though the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to give you direct communication like to me

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,660
So that I can continue to troubleshoot your problems and so that you can communicate not like an animal

116
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,220
And so I put people on telegram. Mm-hmm. I

117
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,460
have so many telegram conversations that it it would take me a

118
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
year to

119
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,860
Just get through. I mean I'm scrolling right now right scrolling. I'm continuing to scroll. I'm continuing to scroll

120
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,180
Continuing to scroll. I'm just I have telegram conversations with everyone so if he doesn't respond

121
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,700
That's why yeah, that's why and here's a great way to get me to not respond if you send me like

122
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,100
Seven messages in a row. It's not I'm not trying to be rude

123
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,140
I just I literally like my brain does this weird thing where I'm like I'll just ought to get back to him like I can't

124
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,260
I can't process that much information when the tech star goes off the screen. I just I can't keep up with you

125
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,660
And then and then a lot of times I just forget so it's not me being rude

126
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
I just I literally don't know

127
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah, I have I have I have the memory fish of a I have the memory of a goldfish anyway

128
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,820
So besides you don't need to do that. That's what the great feature of editing your messages are for

129
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,940
Right exactly or maybe just you know composing a message one time and then sending it. You know, there's that

130
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,580
so when signal messenger first came out I

131
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,580
I was super excited because I saw this is possibly the only replacement for telegram

132
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,300
I would have ever considered I am I've been very happy with

133
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,100
Telegram and I've had no reason to want to leave telegram, but

134
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,580
At the end of the day all of the security audits of telegram have come back and said

135
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,320
We haven't found any problems with it per se

136
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,920
But the way that they tell us that they want us to audit their security leads us to think that

137
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,700
There may be some security holes that were unable to discover

138
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
so introducing

139
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,080
signal signal messenger is a

140
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,760
encrypted

141
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Chat program that not only does chat but also does voice

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
communication SMS that whole the whole nine yards and it went through a

143
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Crypto analysis and the results are in you can trust it

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Signal is secure

145
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,640
So the article from the register.co.uk says encrypted SMS and voice app signal has passed a security audit with flying colors as

146
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,160
Explained in a paper titled a formal security analysis of the signal message protocol published by the International Association of Cryptologic Research

147
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,040
signal has no disc no discernible flaws and offers a well-designed and

148
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,520
Compromise resistant architecture signal uses a double ratchet algorithm that employs in

149
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
ephemeral key exchanges

150
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Continually during each session minimizing the amount of text that can be decrypted at any point should the key be compromised

151
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,640
Signal was examined by a team of five researchers at the UK Australia and Canada namely Oxford University

152
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,440
information security professor Cass Kramer and his PhDs

153
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,660
catril cone garden and Luke Garrett

154
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,980
Queensland University of Technology PhD Benjamin Dowling and McMaster University assistant professor Douglas Stabila

155
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,100
so basically they went through and they looked at

156
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,140
the

157
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,060
this particular messenger

158
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,020
And they said yeah

159
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
It it's it's actually pretty secure

160
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,500
Providing a security analysis for the signal protocol is a challenging for several reasons first signal employs a novel and

161
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,420
Unstudied design of involving over ten different types of keys and a complex update process which leads to various chains of related keys

162
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,580
It therefore does not directly fit into existing analysis models second

163
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,540
Some of its claim properties have only recently been formalized

164
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,400
Finally as a more mundane obstacle the protocol is substantially documented beyond its there is not

165
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,260
Substantially documented beyond its source code now. That's an important point

166
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,720
signal messenger the

167
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
protocol of the server

168
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
The entire thing from top to bottom

169
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,780
Open source open code. Yep, you can look at it look at it modify it run it right so that makes me

170
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,440
It makes it a very compelling product now. I tried it a couple weeks ago, and you know my experience was not great

171
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I had a crash a lot

172
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,940
You know that was back when I was on a boat too, but I

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,140
I the experience was definitely not as polished as telegram

174
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,540
Did you try it on the phone no because I think you know that's kind of like where they started like they had

175
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,540
Tech secure on Android for a long time

176
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,100
and then they they had a different iOS app and then they kind of made signal and merge them together and finally it's merged and

177
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,620
Then eventually got the the desktop app which I think is a Chrome app right isn't it really these days

178
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,660
So like all electron. Yeah, yeah, it's electron app

179
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,060
So they've come a long long way so that I can definitely see the desktop not being their primary focus at least hasn't yeah

180
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,380
Yeah, and to be fair most of the time. I'm on telegram. I'm using it on my phone

181
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
But you know on the other side of the coin

182
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,180
Telegram has made the Linux desktop client a huge priority for them really is it's a very good client

183
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,780
I mean honestly I use it more because I like it as a chat program than it has a security chat program exactly

184
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,420
How about you the desktop version of telegram doesn't even have security at all anyway?

185
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,740
Well, it's still encrypted. It's just like yeah, it's encrypted from this. It's not encrypted

186
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,320
It's it's from server to server like everything on the server is not encrypted

187
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,320
Say what no if on their server when you use the secure chat feature in telegram

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,500
That's encrypted when you're not using that it's not encrypted

189
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,180
I was under the impression that the difference within the secure chat and the regular chats were the secure chat the private key is on

190
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,740
your device only

191
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,660
whereas the

192
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,220
Regular chat it's still encrypted, but they hold the key on their server so that it can do synchronization

193
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:28,660
What'd you but the fact that you can edit it on on both parties means that it's not really secured

194
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,560
Okay, because it's on their server editable

195
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,140
So it's not yeah secure and so that's just like it comes back like telegrams the thing that I try to get my family

196
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,200
On because you know end of the day if we're spied on that's alright

197
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,220
But for people you know that have more real concerns are more concerned about that lead different lives sure cool enough

198
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,500
You know we could have even more trust in open whisper systems and signal in particular. Yeah, yeah

199
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,580
They have a choice anyone in the mumble room actually used whisper. What do you think of it?

200
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,300
Yeah, I use it. I used it when it was tech secure then it became signal, and then it combined red phone

201
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,000
Right into signal. Thank you, and it's uh. It's all it's really good and

202
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,100
It also could do tell on text messages for SMS on signal on the the phone version

203
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,600
So it's it's really cool because it also gives you like a notification whether this this particular conversation is encrypted or not

204
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,040
So like if someone else is using signal

205
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,280
But you're you there or you're using the SMS feature, and they're also using signal as their SMS

206
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,600
It will just automatically convert it into a signal thing so that's really cool

207
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
But what can yeah?

208
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,940
What confuses me is more like how do they have the keys shared between devices for conversations that are encrypted?

209
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,200
From phone to phone and then move to the desktop right it's an electron app

210
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,480
It's like I don't I don't even see how it works. That's a good question, but

211
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,860
Just to be one more thing is really interesting to know that that signal protocol is also used by Facebook really

212
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Yeah, they're messenger

213
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
Yeah, and what's that? Yeah, it's too bad

214
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,720
They won't let that messenger be like it's the thing is when Facebook started forcing you to install messenger

215
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,840
That's when I stopped using messenger second. I just I don't play that game. Yeah anyone else in the mobile room use signal

216
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
What do you think of it?

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,120
Nobody when I installed it I installed it, but I have no friends using it so

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,480
Very difficult to to really convert them the canonical chat platform

219
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,240
That's the problem if you don't have anybody to get on there

220
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,480
It's a little point in having it right I have I have telegram

221
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,200
But that that got started pretty slowly, and I just met new people there right

222
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,800
Mm-hmm yeah, and you know if you think about it any social networking platform any chat platform any communication platform

223
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,300
Really what it amounts to is you're gonna be where your friends are right? Yeah, and I think that's why

224
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
things like g-plus and Facebook have reason to such prominence and in Twitter because

225
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
So many people are already there. It just becomes natural. I mean I remember back when I was in high school

226
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,240
MSN messenger was the way that everyone communicated right and

227
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,000
Nobody used it when MSN messenger started to die was when Facebook took off

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Yeah, because they had an integrated messenger, and so why would you why would you have friends on MSN?

229
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,240
When you could just chat through Facebook, it just doesn't make a lot of sense

230
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,960
So well what's up? I remember the same thing I used to be on Yahoo messenger and MSN messenger

231
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Isn't it funny how we just kind of go rotate through chat platforms. Yep. I just have everyone on aim

232
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Yeah, I'm not died. Yeah, I see Q like j-core says and IRC

233
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,360
IRC is still around and we're still using yes. Yeah. Yeah, there's a guy never got on IRC until like three years ago

234
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,460
You know I think that's actually kind of it seems like the PRC has kind of had a resurgence at least in the

235
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Tech crowd oh for sure yeah, I was I was on the original ICQ

236
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,880
You know why IRC has got a resurgence because slack has an IRC. Oh, yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah

237
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,360
Yeah, that's that's a big thing and if you think about it really slack is just IRC for 2016

238
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,760
What is right I'm a huge fan of riot and matrix tell me about it um so

239
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,080
Matrix is a way to do federated chat so you can it's sort of similar to diaspora

240
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,960
But for just a chat protocol and so you have all these disparate home servers

241
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,680
And you have usernames at the home servers hosted on a domain

242
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,520
And so it's kind of federated in the same way email is

243
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,280
So if I'm at one server with my name I can send to another server with that name and they connect to each other and start

244
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,000
Sending messages back and forth got the server store the seat and then you log into the servers using some client like riot

245
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,240
That's really the biggest one actually you may have heard of it. I don't know of many others before they used to be

246
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
Okay, yeah, yeah, but one of the neat things about it is like

247
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,480
I think they kind of build themselves as the the missing signaling layer for web RTC

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,160
So they support web RTC kind of you know yes as a first-party platform and the same time

249
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,600
It's really the signaling part really shines through so it really is good at like they have a lot of different bridges

250
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,480
IRC bridges slack bridges sure rocket ship bridges and so like it's a it seems and the nice thing is you can host your own

251
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Without having to deal with someone else's server directly you always just talk to your own local instance

252
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
And then it goes out and federates with other people

253
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,620
And on top of that it also has bridges for slack and IRC

254
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,160
All of your conversations in there like you know like a modern web

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,100
HTTP json focused yeah bridge that can just take glue that you can take between I actually like it more than using quassel for IRC

256
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,580
I have all my IRC pumped through a matrix Helm server really that's which is super nice

257
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Yeah, and then I just use riot on like my phone or in my browser. I will have to try that

258
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,820
It's pretty cool. There's a lot of infrastructure you to set up, but it's pretty nice once you get it running

259
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,020
So now how do you have a setup on your phone? Oh the phone?

260
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,500
There's an app so iOS and Android have a riot app right now. You can talk to your own home server

261
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,660
So ham radio you were saying that they're going to be discontinuing along a lot of the Google apps

262
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,820
Yeah, I heard that Google next year is going to be disabling the Google apps on Chrome

263
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,780
And so that means that the desktop client for signal is going to be going away

264
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,180
Huh, okay, and that does not know doesn't mean that

265
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Okay, what does mean then?

266
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,540
Anything running on electron can run on electron because that's a completely different framework

267
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,620
It's Google is room is eliminating the apps that are inside of the chrome store

268
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,800
So like they're like you won't be able to be able to install apps from there. Why are they removing it?

269
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,060
I thought that was a big thing part of the whole Chrome OS thing Chromebook

270
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,300
they're saying that the whole point of those ass was to be able to use offline and

271
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,180
They're saying that the majority of people who use those apps do not use them offline

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,820
So it doesn't really benefit them to even have that infrastructure available

273
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,200
That makes sense, but if I go to open whisper systems website, there's no

274
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,800
Download our look on app. It's you have to download it through the Google Chrome store

275
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,520
So, yeah, but they could convert it more than likely like it's mainly that the bit there what they're

276
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,400
Just they're removing is the offline features and because signal is a online only thing

277
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,400
Well as far as like is sending the conversations back and forth right it makes sense they could just switch it but

278
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,720
They're not that's good. It's gonna be for at least another year. I guess we'll have to wait and see

279
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,160
They're actually doing it they're just gradually doing it most of the rest you'll be doing it for like a year

280
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,360
They're just gradually doing it most of the rest you had a comment about why IRC is coming making a research

281
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,160
Actually wasn't really that it was speaking of research. It's just that I can remember using it before the internet became big and

282
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,920
as

283
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,120
Things went on a lot of people that were on like, you know

284
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,480
The old-school BBS is and all that kind of stuff if they wanted to keep in touch with each other

285
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,200
They ended up just sliding over to IRC because it gave them the same kind of setup as well

286
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,600
I RC unlike let me see if I can get the theme here

287
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
MSN messenger Yahoo messenger

288
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,600
AIM if you're not getting the theme the theme is that they're all branded IRC is not branded

289
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,720
It's just kind of there. It's sort of like hey, it's a library. It's called a library. It's not Roger's library or

290
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,480
Verizon's library, it's a library you go to the library, right?

291
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,280
Sure, so it was the same thing with IRC just anyone had it and he would access it

292
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,560
The servers were all over the place. You just kind of went there. So it wasn't

293
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,960
Attached to any one particular company. So it wasn't a matter of hey

294
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,840
I don't like this company or hey this company how it now has you know

295
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,560
These flashy little ball things that wink at you and stuff like that. It was just kind of there

296
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,320
All right. Anyone else any thoughts on signal messenger? So

297
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,120
They conclude that it's impossible to say if signal if signal meets its goals as there are none stated

298
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,640
but what their analysis did say is approves that it's it it satisfies security standards and

299
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,340
They add that we have found no major flaws

300
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,240
So it's not definitive but it's a kind of the first the first ratchet if you along the way towards it being trusted

301
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,520
All right. Now this next story as you can imagine it has me super excited and that is that the new MacBook

302
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
doesn't run Linux

303
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,120
So there was a gentleman that did a very comprehensive write-up in the Ubuntu

304
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,760
subreddit and basically he took his brand new 2015 MacBook and

305
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
Went through and said here's what I tried to do

306
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,440
Here's I tried to get Linux to work and here's why it doesn't work. Basically

307
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,040
It the

308
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:56,600
The first problem is that you can't even get past the grub screen. So you can't even actually get Linux to boot

309
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,040
Secondly if you can actually get into Linux the built-in keyboard and mouse don't work

310
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,480
Only the power only the power key works to force

311
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,620
The the reboot and he tried this on the non touch bar version

312
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:16,420
He says that there's a patch for the 2015 MacBook that may work for it, but he's not obviously entirely sure

313
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:24,340
Any links to the driver and we'll have that in the show notes and the biggest problem is that the NVMe drive?

314
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,420
has the wrong PCI class ID so

315
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,280
Linux doesn't actually see it as a bootable device. So you can't boot off the built-in hard drive

316
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,360
Which by the way, if you look at Louis Rossman's breakdown of it, they used like some

317
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
fancy special connector that is

318
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:50,400
You know only available to them and that particular computer so you can't just replace the drive

319
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,560
The thing is a walking disaster

320
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,600
Another thing is like the input devices. He was saying they don't work

321
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,520
That's because they're over the SPI bus and said right USB bus, right?

322
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,960
It really is quite a different machine than we've seen before

323
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,320
This thing is a disaster. Yeah, I was glad to see that at least some of the people in the reddit thread world, you know

324
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,600
Thank like being like well at least thank you for sharing right?

325
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,160
I know some people turn to the like

326
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,200
You know like you should have checked and like yeah

327
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,560
Probably if you weren't willing to spend that that money check to see if it's Linux compatible right given like the history of Macs

328
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,420
But it is it is a nice donation to the field of maybe we can eventually get something work sure

329
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,480
You know and the thing is is there's oh, there's a lot of chat in this in the subreddit about well actually

330
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,080
There's a lot of chat in general the community of we need to be ready to accept Mac users when they come over to us

331
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,720
I think a certain amount of time should be spent on that and then I think we should start focusing on

332
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,040
the manufacturers that aren't actively working on these like

333
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,400
One-off models that are just freaking crazy. You know, it's one thing to you know

334
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,760
Take a Lenovo machine and swap a wireless card in it

335
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,960
It's one thing to open a you know, the Adele and and you know

336
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,640
Put a different wireless card in it or put a different sound card or something like that

337
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:11,440
It's something entirely different when the manufacturer makes a totally separate hard drive that is barely related to

338
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,480
What we know as computers everything

339
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,780
Exactly

340
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,320
exactly, it's just

341
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,320
The amount of time that I would like to see the the Linux community doing that

342
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:32,440
For a couple of reasons one is I don't know that I even necessarily agree that there are droves of people that are buying

343
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,040
a 2015 MacBook and then wanting to put Linux on it

344
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,200
Think of you're in the market for a to think of you're on the market and you're willing to make a compromise

345
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,080
For a laptop that's limited to 16 gigs of RAM and doesn't have an escape key

346
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
You're probably buying that computer because you wanted macOS to begin with

347
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,200
so I

348
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,760
Don't know that that's a really valuable use of our time

349
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,720
But secondly if we really want to take people over and we really want to be there for Mac users

350
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,560
Then they can sell their Macbooks and buy something like a system 76. It's gonna work right out of the box with Linux, you know

351
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I'd be interested what you guys in the mumble room think I

352
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,400
Think it's crazy that you have that 16 gig limitation on something so expensive

353
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,520
I mean I have 16 gigs on a T for 20 from 2011 so but it's he 420 has so much more space on the motherboard

354
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:31,080
And the chassis you have to kind of understand what Apple's constraints are for their motherboard and layout of devices and such things

355
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Well, they're only getting one dim in there effectively

356
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,720
Even though I think it's actually soldered on but it's the capacity of one dim in one controller, right?

357
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,480
So it's until they make 32 gig dims. They're not gonna have 32 gigs available

358
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Yeah, but you know the answer that I've seen for that is that they wanted they wanted to keep it smaller because they wanted

359
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,820
More room for the battery exactly, but hold on

360
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,280
That stands up to reason until they say well until we reach 100 watt hours

361
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
And then we don't want to go over that

362
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:05,960
Because the airline the airlines wouldn't let you take a laptop on on a plane and I looked into this that's total BS

363
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,080
The airline restricts external batteries over a certain

364
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh and I don't remember off the top of my head what it is X external batteries are restricted

365
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,760
So you can't separate on your big pack of right now separate batteries

366
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,480
You can't take on and only that you can take that on carry-on. It just can't be checked in luggage

367
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,400
Internal batteries things that are inside of a device. There is no limit

368
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,920
So you could have if you can find a way to get a five thousand, you know

369
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,160
What our battery attached to a laptop as long as it's in case the in the laptop generator in that whatever day

370
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,560
Yeah, exactly. You can take that puppy put it in a laptop bag. Check it in the baggage compartment

371
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,160
No problem from the FAA. So that's BS

372
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,640
Now they might be limited to it to a single dim and I guess I can understand that the problem is

373
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
It seems like they had two lines

374
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,120
the MacBook Air seemed to target the

375
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,840
Daily desktop user and the people who wanted light and thin exactly there were their focus exactly. I want a thin

376
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,440
Daily driver laptop exactly exactly that seems like the appropriate place to put in

377
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,080
You know 16 gigs of RAM and integrated graphics and stuff like that. The pro line has always been set aside for

378
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
People that are doing more demanding tasks media tasks

379
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,060
You know, well, what else do they have? I guess just media tasks, but people

380
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,160
How much yeah, yeah, I guess you're running VMs so I don't understand Apple's decision to handy

381
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
well, I guess I shouldn't say that I

382
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,280
I understand their decision from this standpoint

383
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,900
Even with as many MacBooks as you see at a conference

384
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,420
They still don't really hold any significant share of the PC marketplace, right? I'm still under 10% Maybe 15, right?

385
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
They're the outliers in the enterprise, right?

386
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,040
So by and large

387
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:02,800
Majority dominated by Windows right with Windows 10 no longer having a I mean as far as they say no longer having a newer and newer

388
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,640
version of Windows

389
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,420
They've lost the advantage of well buy this machine in the last two ten years or whatever and we'll just keep giving you updates

390
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,880
No, Microsoft can make that claim at least for the time being right at the same time

391
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:20,440
You look at tablets and smartphones and they are surging right a lot of people even die-hard Linux users

392
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,840
Make compromises and go buy an iPhone or an iPad. Yeah, definitely

393
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,480
So if you're the if you're a executive at Apple and you're sitting in your office and your primary

394
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,260
Task is to make a lot of money and you look over here and you say

395
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,600
We're selling iPhones out the wazoo and making bank on them and over here on this department

396
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
We're still struggling to get a real grasp on the marketplace

397
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,560
Where are you gonna spend your R&D? Where are you gonna spend your time?

398
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Where are you gonna spend pushing all of the stuff together?

399
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,480
If you look at the latest version of Mac OS it resembles now more than ever

400
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,960
iOS right, so I think that there is a I think there's a real chance

401
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,720
That I think there's a real chance that what they're looking to do is

402
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Migrate iOS into Mac OS make them all one platform

403
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,480
Let the people that are doing media production and all that stuff

404
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,240
Port all their tools over to iOS and use all that stuff and

405
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,520
Then just then they all they have to do is sell what they would call like an iPad Pro with it

406
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,120
Oh wait, we already have that. You know what I mean? So it's just like at every turn

407
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,080
It seems like they're continually doing that. I'd be interested if anyone has any feedback

408
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,120
I think it plays into their history as well of just like, you know, but before they went Intel they had their own

409
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,320
I mean not that their own architecture, but they you know, they used these power chips and they used Motorola chips and

410
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,400
I think we just see what was almost more of a convenience or coincidence for them when it was like a large overlap with

411
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,200
Our x86 based PC marketplace and I think we see iOS as sort of its own ecosystem its own architecture

412
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,680
They're making their own processors or at least, you know having them fabulous

413
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,920
Right, so I think that they've always viewed their desktops or Mac OS X in the same way

414
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,600
It just doesn't look like it from the outside

415
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,640
But now like with more with their touch bar and with their you know

416
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,720
The arm chip sitting on their system on a chip right?

417
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,960
Well, it really is like they see it as a whole platform as one thing and probably yeah

418
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,480
It will form more into with iOS into their Mac ecosystem

419
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Mamoru, what are your thoughts?

420
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Honestly, I'm saying

421
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,120
IOS is going to be better than Mac OS for professionals is I didn't say that

422
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:35,040
Well, I don't think IOS would ever be for professionals if anything any professional that I know from

423
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,840
Outside of Chris or Rekai or professionals. I know personally

424
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,400
They don't use Mac anymore because of their hardware choices and their software choices. Yeah

425
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,200
They're like they're done. They they've had it if if Matt doesn't you know cater to them and go look

426
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,440
We have these awesome machines for editing. We got this rock solid OS, you know

427
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,440
We're still working on Final Cut. If you don't grab those people you're gonna lose them and I don't see them doing that with their offerings

428
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,280
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, we actually we had a we have a small production house in Grand Forks

429
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,720
They're an offshoot of a local news agency and they have switched to Adobe

430
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Premiere on Windows boxes and the university. Yeah, and the university first they dumped. They originally dumped Final Cut Pro for

431
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,840
For Premiere and and the new machines the new desktop machines are Windows boxes because they support all of their PCI capture stuff

432
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,520
And they have repurposed the they had like a learning lab and those had a lot of IMAX and those have been repurposed for up with

433
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,280
Adobe

434
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:48,240
Premiere on on those IMAX so that when those students get up into the the later years and they're they're doing because then

435
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,920
In your third and fourth year when you're doing journalism school, then you actually go do assignments, right?

436
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
And so they're teaching them to do it on these IMAX in

437
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,520
On Premiere because they already had these IMAX and then they're moving off onto these Windows machines where they're using Adobe

438
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,960
So I've seen the exact same trend. However, I of course being the Linux guy that I am I

439
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Contacted a couple of guys that were teaching that particular video course at UND

440
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
Switched them to Linux

441
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,960
Got them editing all of their stuff under Linux and now this year is the first year that they are teaching in tandem with

442
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,680
Premiere Lightworks, so it's gonna be done. Yeah, unfortunately, it's gonna be done on IMAX because that's where the that's where the lab is

443
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,280
But the advantage of those students is they can take those they can take that software those things that they have learned

444
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,560
Inside of that class and take it home and then they can edit there. So

445
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,960
I actually haven't checked in with those guys to see how that's going. But um, you know at the end of last year

446
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,920
That was my that was my understanding that that you know, they they saw that as being a really competitive advantage

447
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,960
So I I have seen that I I have I have seen that trend as well with people moving off of OSX

448
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,960
But I think what you have to consider is that there are a lot of people

449
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,360
That change the definition of what a professional is right 15 years ago 20 years ago

450
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:06,320
a video professional was somebody that showed up with a $65,000 camera and had either you had a studio camera

451
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,560
You're recording inside of a studio or you had an electronic news gathering crew. So you had an ENG camera

452
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,240
And you filmed and then you brought that back into an actual edit bay and you had and you know

453
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,080
And you had you had a you had an actual hardware mixer where you took your audio

454
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,760
Where you know everything was recording you could tweak all that stuff in you know live right there and you do all of your editing

455
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,840
And then you produce it you take it to your editor and then that would go out and then that would get produced onto

456
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,000
Some sort of published media like a DVD or VHS or whatever master sent and get stamped out exactly and we can send out, right?

457
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,600
today

458
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:44,080
The definition of a professional has changed Apple sees a professional as somebody who films on their iPhone

459
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,380
Edits edits on iMovie and publishes on iTunes the New York Times fired the majority of their photographers

460
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,740
And gave all of the reporters iPhones and said here they all have 64 gigs of RAM start clicking away

461
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm sure you'll get something that's usable

462
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,700
Does that quote post? Huh? Well, you know, yes, but I mean, you know, there was a there was actually I was looking

463
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,220
I was watching a um

464
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,860
Thing on still photography and they bought a bunch of Canon rebels put them all on auto mode

465
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,780
Handed them to 50 people and said go take pictures of the sport events

466
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,100
They had you know

467
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,420
150,000 photos 148,000 of which were useless and then they found like six that they actually wanted to use

468
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,420
But the cost to buy those cameras give them to people have them shoot was still cheaper than hiring like 10 real professional photographers

469
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,220
So I think the definition of a professional is is rapidly changing. I think people on YouTube broadcasting themselves

470
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,060
Are professionals, right?

471
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,380
And Apple does a good job of hitting that like we have a pipeline and it's good enough for what you want to do

472
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
I completely agree. They

473
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,300
Put all of those tools in place. So my my question back to you, sir, is

474
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,540
Is is it possible that Apple says they take all of the stuff in iOS and they just say all right. Here you go

475
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,220
Let's make

476
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,340
Let's make these tools available on iOS and push those out to people

477
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Just redefining what a professional is

478
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Or you're still not seeing it

479
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,900
Maybe i'm totally off

480
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,300
I I can say that they the fact that they're more switching to the prosumer grade. I don't think professional is really changing

481
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I think more

482
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,500
More areas and industries are developing to become professional

483
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,740
But I think the vast majority of people who are like professional youtubers are using professional gear

484
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,140
Yeah, I I think that statement is true like you like you can use

485
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,660
low-end

486
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,780
prosumer stuff or consumer stuff, but eventually you will be going to

487
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,740
Cannons and other rigs and you know professional XLR mics. It's just the road to get there pretty much

488
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,300
so eventually

489
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
I think any kind of prosumer that's not hardcore

490
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,060
A studio or news journalists or anything like that from the past

491
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,940
Will eventually want to demand tools from Apple and I think they're just going to have to give it to them eventually

492
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Andy Akers, you're saying that that you still define a professional photographer as somebody who can operate a camera in manual mode

493
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,380
And it's essentially second nature to them

494
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Andy Akers

495
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,900
He's going once going twice

496
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,140
Thanks for the call. So, uh, basically I

497
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,900
I believe I truly believe that Apple is uh, is

498
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,940
Is sucking it up on I think they're sucking on the desktop and on the laptop

499
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,220
And I think that's a good thing for their business model because I don't think that was where they're going to see

500
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,380
Huge profits anyway, right? And I think that the cost to continue to develop macos to make it a competitive platform

501
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,820
Was going to be high and I don't know that they would see the returns that they're getting

502
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
So I think that's a good thing

503
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,900
for them as a Linux desktop user. I have never been more excited because

504
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,780
Windows despite the changes that they have made

505
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,780
still suck and they will forever hold a

506
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:13,780
A bad taste in everyone's mouth for being Windows. What do you what do you think though about the that new subsystem of theirs for Linux?

507
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,140
And and the potential there for at least like a new version of Windows

508
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,220
What do you what do you think though about the that new subsystem of theirs for Linux and and the potential there for at least

509
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,180
Like the developer side or the content creator, right? Because they have the Adobe apps. Yeah, and there you can have both

510
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I I it did it does scare me a little bit

511
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,460
um

512
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,740
I think maybe what we're counting on in some ways is there is that distaste distaste of Windows and the want for a real

513
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,940
You know POSIX style system, which you get with OS X at least a little and and obviously with Linux

514
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,660
Huh?

515
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,020
I I I I I guess I can see that I I can see that being a threat at the same time

516
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,020
I think that eventually the people that like to dig down and get dirty with the system

517
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,780
Are eventually going to want more so I think they'll come over to us eventually

518
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,740
And I think they're also going to just be honest with you

519
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,060
I think they're just going to get tired of their computer crashing all the time

520
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,940
I like it. So uh

521
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,220
So this brings a lot of hope to me because I think that you're going to have people

522
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,860
I don't think Windows is a great place to be on the desktop

523
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,780
I think macOS is becoming a less great place to be on the desktop. And so

524
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,300
Microsoft continues to focus on and in transition to cloud-based services

525
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,180
Exactly and Apple is transitioning and focusing on mobile. So who's left to really concentrate on the traditional desktop?

526
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,860
Linux now

527
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,860
If if if the answer to that is while the majority of people are just going to have an iPhone

528
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,580
They won't have a computer. I can totally live with that

529
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,680
if my job revolves around supporting Linux desktops for people that work in in CEO positions

530
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,020
Or tech level positions or something like that and in the traditional desktop keyboard mouse laptop

531
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,020
If that paradigm is is relegated to Linux

532
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,700
Even if the even if the amount of people in that paradigm shrinks and those people have and the majority of the society

533
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,740
Has moved over to mobile devices. I can live with that compromise. I can happily live with that compromise

534
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,620
I think I think there's some nuance there at least in terms of where

535
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,100
We're expected to do things but along as long as things are currently shifted towards the

536
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,820
Obviously you can do content creation in some domains on your mobile device

537
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,660
but I think as long as it's like, you know, there's professionals in the back rooms creating things and then you know

538
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,660
We have all these other devices we use for consuming and interacting with them. Sure. Yeah, that's where I could I could live with it that way, too

539
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,580
so a couple of uh, so a couple of weeks ago we talked about the

540
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Super Nintendo on

541
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,620
or the uh, the new Nintendo Entertainment System that is going to be running on Linux

542
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,940
And apparently there is an exploit compromising Linux desktop

543
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,460
Wes, can you tell me about this? Yeah, so it doesn't actually relate to that fun device. It's just kind of similar

544
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,260
There's a lot going on with the NES these days

545
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,700
So this is a zero day exploit right now, though

546
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,340
At least the one that was released it really only affects like a specific version of Ubuntu 12.04

547
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,260
So it's not something you necessarily need to have

548
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:10,900
But basically there's a Gstreamer plugin that plays these NSF files, which are music files from the from the NES

549
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,780
Um, and when you're using something like Nautilus

550
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,500
Yeah

551
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,740
It it tries to part like when you open it

552
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,740
these files gets parsed by Gstreamer and there is a

553
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,380
There's a vulnerability in in one of these it's in the bad set of plugins for Gstreamer and it only is in the 0.10

554
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,920
Distribution not the newer 1.0 Gstreamer package

555
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
But basically when that happens then

556
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:40,520
Then you get pwned, but it's kind of interesting because these files they're not like a regular music file, you know broken down into samples

557
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:40,920
Yeah

558
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,680
It actually emulates a processor like it takes less space and the way they're encoded it emulates a processor to then

559
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Tell and then it tells the processor

560
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,480
Do these instructions to produce these tones and then it captures those tones and plays them which I thought was kind of interesting

561
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,600
It is interesting

562
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,840
So not to not to totally so first, I guess I'll open it up to the moment room. What do you guys think of this?

563
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
You guys are so quiet today

564
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,400
You guys come in the the technology of the the emulating the the processing of it to create the sound is it's kind of amazing

565
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,440
because it more like one of the biggest problems with most emulators is like they're trying to

566
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,400
reverse engineer it instead of trying to

567
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Try to create a hardware emulation

568
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:27,960
Uh-huh, like one of the the biggest things is like a lot of games that are impossible to play as an emulator because the the hardware

569
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:36,600
Emulation that they're trying to compensate is more like slowing down the current process the current hardware we have

570
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,800
whereas this is more super interesting, but the

571
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,240
the the the problem with the zero day doesn't really sound like it's a big problem, but it's

572
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,880
You know, it's going to get a ton of attention, especially like ars technica and stuff, right?

573
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,160
And it just to me it was more interesting really to highlight these files and the way they work and of course to be just

574
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,960
To just to realize like, you know, um, obviously this just doesn't affect newer distributions

575
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,600
But it's always good to be aware of parts of your systems that are

576
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,240
Taking vulnerable inputs which are you know file system files and auto loading them or that kind of thing

577
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,840
Just just something to think about

578
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Anyone else? I'm only using 12

579
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,320
1204 should yeah gtfo great from what I saw it was

580
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,380
Is recommended to use a raspberry pi and put retro pi. I mean, how does that compare?

581
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,740
I mean, this is not really right. It's

582
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:30,300
This is a difference between being an official product versus um, you know creating yourself. It's like you you technically aren't

583
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,060
Legally allowed to download roms unless you own the game itself

584
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
so um

585
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,100
They're not losing any money from it. So they're not gonna like

586
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,180
technically attack anyone for those doing those things but

587
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,980
This is more like if you want to have like a set top box kind of thing that's built for you

588
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,300
And you don't have to build it yourself, but there's also certain games that can't run

589
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
without proper emulation

590
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:00,060
So like if you're getting retro pi that retro pi is just like a distro that pulls all these different emulators in

591
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,500
So you're not really going to get the exact kind of experience

592
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:09,580
So maybe some games like for example, this is not what nes classic does because it's just the nes

593
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:17,180
but if they ever come out with like n64 classic or something like that, that would be amazing because games like banjo kazooie were

594
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,100
taking

595
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,940
Flaws that were in the hardware of the n64 and making that a feature of the game

596
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,820
So they're impossible to emulate. So if they figure out a way to emulate the the

597
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,420
Processor for the n64 that would be amazing

598
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:38,640
I mean i've been waiting on that a long time as well. Uh, super nintendo, I think would be more exciting to me or n64

599
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,120
I I i'm really hoping for the n64

600
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
In fact when uh, I was I was joking with rikai a couple of weeks ago

601
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,120
I said when we talked about that little portable nes system. I said I wish nintendo would make a portable n64 system

602
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,040
Right, I would take that everywhere. I would if I had a portable game boy like device that I could play

603
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,280
golden ion that would be ideal, right and what uh rikai's answer was

604
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,680
He said you have one. It's called your s6 and I said

605
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,360
They they have that and he goes. Yeah, so sure enough went to the google play store

606
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,840
And uh, and I was able to download an emulator on my phone and you know, the great thing about

607
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
My phone is it's on ting, right?

608
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,520
And so I have I don't pay to download any of the any use any of my data because i'm on wi-fi

609
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:32,000
In fact, we have a special wi-fi network that is at every location that we work at and it we call it the tech network

610
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,320
The tech network and it's oh that's clever. I like it. Yes. It's there's no speed restriction anything like that

611
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,280
So basically any client I go to I have internet. I have network coverage

612
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:48,880
Unrestricted unrestricted network coverage and so I can walk into to any of these places and and just my phone automatically connects

613
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,120
So basically what I need my mobile carrier to do is to provide me with

614
00:46:53,840 --> 00:47:01,120
Basically gap coverage, right? So right when you're on your way between sites exactly. So I had a nine and a half hard drive between

615
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,000
uh, wisconsin and grand forks and then

616
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,040
Today, uh, well over the past two days. I actually I had to

617
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,240
I was in an airport for well what ended up being like 17 hours 18 hours, right?

618
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
And the great thing was I don't usually

619
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,400
Tether on my on my laptop. Usually I just have a dedicated little card that that connects there

620
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,240
Card wasn't connecting and so I was like i'll just tell it right now

621
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,320
This is something I haven't used in a long time on my phone

622
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,880
My phone had a great signal laptop didn't I take my phone?

623
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,680
Climb up the airport and set it on like the edge of the window. Nice. Yeah enable hotspot

624
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,440
Ting doesn't charge me any extra for the hotspot. It's just pay for what you use

625
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,760
So you use 100 minutes you fall into that bucket

626
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,920
They charge you for 100 minutes you use one gig of data you use one gig of data and they don't care if you're using

627
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:53,440
That giga data on your phone or if you're using that giga data through tethering on your laptop cell phone plans for adults

628
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,200
Exactly. Yeah cell phone plans for adults. Now. There was a gentleman in the chat room that asked me if I would send him

629
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,200
A ting sim. So if you send an email to know at jupiter broadcasting.com with your address

630
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,840
I will throw a ting sim in there and get that out to you. No problem ting sims as a service

631
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,400
I am. Yeah, I am. This is not an offer for everyone

632
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,880
I said one person that like reached out to me and specifically asked i'm going to accommodate him

633
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,880
I am not going to send ting sims to everyone but that particular guy it's i'm feeling generous

634
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,560
So, uh, you send me your address and I will ship you out of ting sim free of cost at my expense

635
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,420
And if you want to get a ting sim, you can go to linux.ting.com

636
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,560
It'll get you 25 off your first device your first month of service or

637
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
You can get 25 sim cards

638
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,240
You didn't think about that. Did you no I didn't no you didn't but if you wait for the dollar

639
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,600
That's your whole business right there. Exactly exactly if you wait for the dollar sim sale

640
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
You could get 25 sims

641
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,160
for free

642
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
with your first month of service

643
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't know if that's really a necessary or good thing to do but you could totally do it

644
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,320
The other thing you could do is you could get uh, 25 off your first phone which for me

645
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,480
Paid for the majority of the phone because I buy cheap phones exactly or you could get 25 off your first month of service now

646
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,080
Between my wife my son my mother and I I think our average ting bill is like

647
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,880
Oh, and I have a couple office phones and I think our average ting bill is 45 bucks

648
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,920
That's all right. Let me look i'll tell you what not only does ting have an amazing dashboard. They have an amazing app

649
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,320
We don't talk about the app nearly enough, but I can pull this app up in about 30 seconds 27

650
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,920
Wes, will you verify please? Yep, 27. All in the nose now. Look at how many minutes i've used

651
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,880
Zero zero minutes. You know why because all of my calls are funneled over sip

652
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,280
So I use a I use a program data and then and then you're just you have the one bucket system to worry about

653
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,520
Exactly not only do I have the one bucket system to worry about that particular bucket doesn't apply to me

654
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,680
Basically anytime i'm not in in transit, right when I got here as soon as I got here stop not using minutes anymore

655
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,480
So linux.ting.com get yourself something nice and thank you

656
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,720
To ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

657
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,720
All right guys, so let's take a look I want to dive back into

658
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,040
This uh

659
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,600
Linux fest northwest founder honored with uh, the community builder west. Can you tell me a little bit about this?

660
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,920
uh, yeah, so there's just uh, there's a an award called the cascadia community builder award and it's you know, it's meant to

661
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,840
to recognize people in the the cascadia region the pacific northwest who

662
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,120
Have done good work building community building things that people can feel a part of building organizations that last you know

663
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,080
Over time that bring people to get diverse groups together

664
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,480
and so this is kind of it's just a nice article over on open source.com talking about uh,

665
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,120
Bill who has been the the main founder and person running linux fest northwest. Obviously the home show here of the jb network

666
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:52,640
Yeah, um, so kind of tells the story back in 1968 the great northern railroad hired bill then a student at western washington university my alma mater

667
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Uh because of his computer experience

668
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,160
Uh bill became interested in linux and open source community in the late 1990s as things were ramping up

669
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,320
With another few other computer nerds

670
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,640
He helped start the bellingham linux users group and then from then started its linux fest and since then he's been he's been doing it uh,

671
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,560
You know, he's he's seen a lot at other festivals around the area. He's known in the community. He's recognized by people all around

672
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,920
So this is just a great little thank you bill. Thank you for all you've done and some nice community recognition. That's super cool

673
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,880
Momo room, how many of you guys are coming out to linux fest northwest?

674
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,560
I'm, hoping to be there. Awesome. Anyone else?

675
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,200
No idea if i'll make it all right. All right. Well, it's in april. So start thinking about it now

676
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,680
early may

677
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,640
Money money issues. Yeah, that's that's a real thing, right if we could come up with some way

678
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,840
To have some sort of like sponsorship to get people to uh different linux fest. That'd be a be the real way to go

679
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,840
Uh, you know, the other thing is too is I wish they would split these uh linux fest linux cons up a little bit

680
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,480
Because it would be nice they all hit like in the first couple months. Yeah march to june

681
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,440
You know scale the linux fest northwest itself. Yeah, it's just like immediately all in a row exactly

682
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,040
Yeah, it just it just it just it drains the pocketbooks of those of us that have to uh,

683
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,000
Have to be at all those it's unbelievable. I'll be at scale. I don't know about lfnw. All right

684
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,240
Uh, so kde neon users are requested to perform a full

685
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,760
Reinstall, uh west. What can you tell me about this?

686
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,240
Uh west, what can you tell me about this? Uh, well, so it looks like it was just that some of their uh package distribution servers

687
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,200
Uh, it was possible for people to push things to them, right?

688
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,640
So here's a package archive used by katie neon was incorrectly configured so that anyone could upload packages to it

689
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,760
They have no reason to think that anyone actually did so or that there was any, you know

690
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,800
Intentional compromise or that any of these packages are bad, but they do ask that for your own protection

691
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,320
They've they've updated packages. Everything has a newer version in the repo now

692
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,100
So if you if you do a reinstall you'll get all the new packages and they fix that configuration

693
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,520
And restore the server. So it's just something to be aware of if you're on neon

694
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
That's crazy

695
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,360
uh

696
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,320
What else do we have mumble room? How are you guys doing? I haven't heard much from you

697
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,440
This would be a great episode for you guys to to chat because my voice is just uh, it's not great

698
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,640
Take it easy on poor newick. Well, I mean, I don't know you're chatting at all

699
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,120
I just don't want to be rude when people are talking. Oh, no, no

700
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,200
Um, we we're we're following your lead though. All right

701
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,440
For so for the about the uh, the katie neon thing

702
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,960
um

703
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,960
There it's not necessary to

704
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
To do a reinstall

705
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
They're they're suggesting that

706
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
If you're worried about it

707
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,320
Like for extra security to be absolutely sure you could do a reinstall

708
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,400
But they're saying that if you just do an upgrade once the packages are rebuilt that it's it should be fine

709
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Do they not sign their packages?

710
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,440
they they do sign the packages but it's more like

711
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,840
if someone had access like the configuration issue is that someone could just push the packages and

712
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,640
They would be on the server

713
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,000
kind of

714
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,360
with like

715
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,640
Already allowed to be in so they would be signed by this process kind of yeah

716
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,840
So unfortunately that doesn't solve the problem

717
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,840
but uh

718
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,600
They wouldn't be able to like replace the other packages. They would be able to replace like add their own

719
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,560
extra package they could kind of like so it wouldn't be like

720
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,080
Like having to rehash anything or anything like that

721
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,280
It's just more they could put something on the server and then they could kind of like

722
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Trick a mega mega meta package to pull something down. It's it's a really

723
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:31,040
Uh, it's it's a really scary sounding issue that is not as bad as it is but could potentially be terrible

724
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,240
So it's more like just let's be aware of it. Yeah

725
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,280
It's more like let's get it and get in front of it. So it doesn't actually make any problems

726
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,580
I'll tell you what else is terrible is the internet of things this article comes to us from hackerboards.com

727
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,120
Despite growing security threats the internet of things hype shows no signs of abating

728
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
Feeling the fomo companies are busily rearranging the robots for iot

729
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,880
The transition to iot runs deeper and broader than ever before

730
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,440
Iot runs deeper and broader than the mobile revolution everything gets swallowed into the iot including smartphones

731
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,360
Which are often our windows on the iot world and sometimes our hubs and sets are and endpoints now I have

732
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,200
Said once or twice on this show and on lass

733
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,440
That I don't like the internet of things. I don't like the concept. I don't like the name

734
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,680
I don't like the branding. I don't like anything about it

735
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,840
and yet there the answer now is

736
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,520
from what I understand

737
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,520
looking at containers

738
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:39,680
To solve a lot of the problems that we face in the iot world. So canonicals iot oriented snappy abuntu core

739
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,960
Version of abuntu is built around a container like snap package management mechanism and offers app store support

740
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,920
The snap technology was recently released on its own for linux distributions on november 3rd canonical released abuntu core 16

741
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:01,360
Which improves the white label app store and and update service control some update serve update control services, excuse me

742
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,440
So basically their idea is let's take this really crappy

743
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,840
World that we live in and try to use containers to leverage updates and security patches

744
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,120
and I think on one one on one side that sounds ridiculous because

745
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,240
Obviously from the world of our you know in the you go from the iot world to the server world and containers are the new

746
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,440
Thing that's kind of viewed skeptically from the security angle where vms are trusted or you know bare metal even

747
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,480
Uh, but but I think here the the idea really is, you know

748
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,120
You're using you know using a bunch of like this the snap stuff or you're using resin.io

749
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,800
Which is like a platform trying to use docker containers on embedded devices. Yeah, um, I think really what you're getting

750
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,880
Is better, you know a better understanding of what you of the build structure and a lot of these embedded devices, right?

751
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,040
Like they're you know, they're using build root. They're they're forking from existing open source packages

752
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:55,200
But they're maybe not upgrading things. They may not have great build pipelines or anything approaching that so I think this is just trying to take

753
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:02,320
Some some modern development practice modern, you know understanding what your dependencies are understanding what you're built from in ways where you can then

754
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,640
Improve on that rapidly, uh to to hopefully at least compartmentalize and then establish right because with a container system you need to then

755
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,160
Rather, you know

756
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,520
If you have a telnet system, you know

757
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,840
You have telnet running because you have to export the port for the telnet and you have to configure the daemon

758
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,560
Uh more so than if you're just taking a fork of open wrt and sticking it on your light bulb bow chicken. Wow. Wow, you nailed it

759
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,280
Yeah, no, uh mama room. What do you guys think?

760
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,800
I don't know how that fixes the problem. I mean most of the problem is people aren't doing their jobs in

761
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,280
Setting the systems up securely

762
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,480
right, so I think I think and not not that this is the answer but more like it's it's one place they're exploring I think the

763
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
their their idea then is to is to

764
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,320
And make that easier to do have better systems to produce those artifacts to produce, you know

765
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,320
And things without having to do things from scratch where you might not have the incentive to actually update things or configure them securely

766
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,680
But personally I still like the separate offline network of things. That's my favorite. Yeah. No, that's fair

767
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,320
Yeah

768
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:05,920
But you're just complicating the the design of the solution to make it simpler and more secure kind of oxymoron there, you know

769
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,000
Well, I I mean, I I think I think basically what they're doing is they're trying to say if you're going to have something insecure

770
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,680
First of all, let's try to make it so that the people that develop the iot stuff don't have to

771
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,800
Think about the security per se that can be handled for them on a different level and be pushed out, right?

772
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
And the second they're not thinking about it now

773
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,480
I agree, but that but so I mean if my choice is between

774
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,560
An insecure internet of things any more secure internet of things. I don't like internet of things either way

775
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,360
But i'll take more secure internet of things every time right and it may be that you have less of a service area that you

776
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:45,200
You know if you're if you're responsible for the entire os stack and securing it versus if you're grabbing a base, you know

777
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,440
Almost container hypervisor type thing and then you're responsible just for your app and what it exposes. It may be a different incentive structure

778
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,400
And also it's more even more specific that it's not just a containerization system like docker

779
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,240
snaps are

780
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:06,080
Are are secured in a more of a mount a mount point that is its own

781
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,440
Separate thing that it's but it's also connected to other pieces so that you have benefits of basically both worlds

782
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
Hurricane uh herndes

783
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,440
Hey, how's it going on

784
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,320
Correct me if i'm wrong

785
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,760
But most of the iot in devices that have been insecure has been because people haven't followed

786
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,640
Best practices right and we're talking at the base level of the operating system

787
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,080
So I don't see how docker is going to stop people deploying these

788
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,960
devices with operating systems that have

789
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,120
Um, you know, I mean the same password on all the systems or I mean the same security certificate

790
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:52,560
You know, I mean these guys are not following best practices and I think that's the biggest issue here. Yeah, absolutely

791
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:58,160
It's it's it's because it's not docker and it's more it's the same thing of you want to upgrade your system

792
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
You do snap upgrade you're done

793
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,360
Well, I think what he's saying is that if you if you take a company

794
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,680
That doesn't it's we have a human problem not a security problem, right?

795
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,160
We have companies that aren't taking security seriously

796
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,920
And if you think that technology can solve security concerns and you don't understand the technology and you don't understand the security concerns

797
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
That's the famous quote, right?

798
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:24,960
Right. It's the issue of them being lazy and not updating it sure, but that's the same thing with all software of any kind

799
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Okay, fair enough mini mac

800
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Yeah, I more and more see that

801
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Internet of things has become a marketing

802
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,160
Argument for products. I don't see the reason that a coffee machine has to be on the internet

803
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,360
So the real need and use it to secondary and these are in fact the machines

804
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,120
They're in fact used for spamming other machines afterwards, right?

805
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,840
Right, and that happens a lot actually you find that

806
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,080
You find that you you you run into a lot of these machines that like I saw a meme

807
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:02,480
A couple days ago and it was talking about you know things like the the the internet connected broom and stuff like that

808
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,480
When you get to I mean there becomes a point where it becomes ridiculous, right?

809
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,960
There are certain things that make sense to be connected to the internet, you know from my perspective

810
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:17,280
But even people like my grand my grandparents would have not understood internet connected light switches to them

811
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,680
That would have been ridiculous that you'd want to put your light switch on the internet

812
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,240
So I I have a hard time deciding where exactly to draw that line because what seems ridiculous to me

813
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:32,080
May may not seem really ridiculous to the next generation and what seems perfectly logical to me probably seems ridiculous to the previous generation

814
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,480
but I this idea that this idea that

815
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,560
This idea that everything is is going to just happen in the cloud for us and talk out to the internet

816
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,520
Is kind of ridiculous, you know, I think it was william that brought up

817
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,000
There is a you don't have to be on the internet to have a connected lifestyle

818
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,680
I have ip based cameras. They are connected

819
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,360
Three through their own dedicated switch. They have their own dedicated dhcp server

820
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:07,120
Uh, and they are on an entirely separate wiring system than the rest of the house

821
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:13,280
They are technically networked. Yes, but there is absolutely no tie-in to my normal household

822
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,000
Network and certainly no tie-in to the internet

823
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,880
So the chances of those cameras getting hacked some even if they they could be the most insecure thing in the world

824
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,040
The chances of those getting hacked slim to none slim to none unless you're physically inside of my house

825
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,000
And you manage to plug into that switch. There's no wi-fi access. There's no outside internet access

826
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,680
In a weird way. I kind of wonder if we haven't jumped a little too far with containers too fast

827
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,600
I kind of wonder if we haven't rushed it a little bit

828
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,600
I remember when containers first came out

829
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,600
I barely had a chance to start trying them before I started to hear people rolling them out into production

830
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,640
And in fact, I myself have rolled a couple of them out in production

831
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,400
And the only reason I was comfortable doing that is because we have services like digital ocean that

832
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,680
You that I can go ahead and try those things on before I actually have to go to a client's network

833
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:09,200
You know or someplace that where it really matters and you can set up a production ready

834
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,240
Emulation suite, you know, there was a time

835
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,480
When I was going through networking where I had to rent a cisco stack

836
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,200
So I rented, you know, you know a cisco switch and a cisco router and a cisco this and you know

837
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
It's very expensive. It's a couple hundred dollars

838
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,000
For the week to access that what they call the cisco lab, right?

839
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,360
and I I did when I was first setting up containers I did the same thing by going over to digital ocean and using the

840
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,160
uh the promo code do unplugged

841
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,440
And basically I was able to get a ten dollar credit and I was able to spin up

842
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,720
My first two droplets my first two five dollar droplets for free using their private networking

843
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,080
I was then able to build a virtual data center that I could test all of this stuff on

844
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,440
And I mean it was it was a total game changer

845
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,880
So come five six months down the road being able to walk into a client's

846
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,800
Facility and say yeah, I can do this with confidence. Yeah, we can go ahead and set this up

847
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,520
It was no problem for me because I had already tried it

848
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,840
I had already had a chance to play with this stuff

849
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,280
And if it didn't work out, I just blew it away and I started all over again

850
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,600
And i'll tell you the real key though, and no pun intended pun intended

851
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,480
The real key is when you pair this stuff with a ubi key

852
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,400
Because now you're not getting root passwords emailed to you and they're always like some obtusely long thing that you have to like copy

853
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,360
And paste and then you forget that you have to use shift when you paste into the terminal

854
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,680
So it doesn't really paste and then it closes something else. Oh my gosh, it's ridiculous

855
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,960
And then the other thing is too is I have this weird paranoid sense about me

856
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:40,240
I'm, like oh the nsa is spying on me that they've captured my yeah. Yeah, they've captured my email now

857
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,440
None of that with the ubi key

858
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,520
I literally add my ssh key and then when I spin up all my digital ocean droplets

859
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:51,120
I just checked that little box that says, you know, noah's ubi key around his neck or whatever and boom digital ocean spins up

860
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,680
Do makes it so easy to do that they do and if you use our code do unplugged again

861
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,120
You're gonna get ten dollars

862
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,560
Which will give you the you can get a five dollar rig for free for the first two months

863
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,560
Or you can get two rigs or you could get a ten dollar rig if you wanted to try something

864
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,840
You know with a little bit more oof to it. We actually spun up

865
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,200
We were testing uh saccom one and saccom two

866
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
uh, we actually

867
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,360
We spun up like super super powerful ones just to kind of get the hang of it

868
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,400
Just to kind of see what it would be like to to work on a super powerful linux rig

869
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,920
I think we did it more out of novelty than any real production requirement

870
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
so linux, uh, uh

871
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,680
Digital ocean.com and use the promo code do

872
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,000
Unplugged is crystal with us or did he he drop out?

873
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,080
He's still there. Yeah, you gotta did is your uh, is your connection any better, sir?

874
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:46,180
It's not his connection more like he's trying to set up push to talk and he's currently on voice activation

875
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,480
Got it. Okay. All right. Well, we'll let him sort that out. I uh, yeah

876
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,720
Kind of nice to have him here because uh, you guys are super quiet today

877
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,160
Uh, so west tell me about the the end of the general purpose operating system

878
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,800
Uh, yeah, so this was just an article

879
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,320
I saw that I thought was kind of interesting uh over at the blog more than seven dot net

880
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,040
Uh, and it was just talking about kind of and it's probably is focusing maybe on the opposite end

881
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:18,000
Spectrum of the iot. I threw that article in there just to kind of get this this topic started. Um, but what we're seeing at the

882
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,760
I don't know when I when I started doing things on the internet, you know

883
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,440
Kind of in the early days of linux not super early, but the early days of like web scale linux

884
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,480
You know you were getting your vps or maybe a shared host and you were configuring things on the you had an ftp account

885
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,280
Or you had a you know, you had a whole open vz server that you were then configuring you had a whole

886
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,760
That you were then configuring you installed apache with mod php and you got your mysql going

887
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,520
Oh boy, now you got your web app running. Uh, but these days there's a lot of things

888
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,320
That's that's not necessarily the level of abstraction that people are going for these days

889
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,720
We're seeing a lot more, you know, you have infrastructure. It's a service

890
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,280
You have all kinds of different intermediate service platform service layers

891
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,080
Uh, you have things like aws lambda where you know, you're not concerned at all or you know

892
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,320
The the whole no ops thing where you're not concerned about what operating system is. Is it rel?

893
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:10,000
Is it ubuntu it all runs on linux sure, but but for you, you know, you you write your java application

894
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,160
It gets executed in your container or wherever and then it runs. I want the candy

895
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,680
I don't care how I get the candy, right?

896
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,640
And I understand that I mean I even may support that that worldview when you're trying to build large scale distributed systems

897
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,080
I just wonder what it is that a success for linux. What does that mean?

898
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,520
Also, like what does that mean in terms of new developers who you know, maybe they start from the code side

899
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,120
But they want to start deploying things

900
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,440
I think in the past some of those people would then be pulled into the linux ecosystem

901
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,040
Where you're suddenly running linux at home and you're converting your media center and you know

902
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,240
You get in the linux culture and if you're just using these cloud scale platforms where yes linux is there

903
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,000
But that's not really never, you know, you make a docker container where you you know

904
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,840
You might your import python and then you build your python thing. Never is it even say the word ubuntu?

905
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,240
Or linux on it. What does that mean for the linux ecosystem and new developers new people in that ecosystem who are coming to this?

906
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,000
Well, let's tie that back to our original discussion about free nas and bst, right?

907
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:08,720
right, I think if you start to look at things in it from the from the from the perspective of I just want to

908
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Put yeah, I want to push the button take the banana

909
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,600
If you know if we look at things in that sense

910
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,400
I like free nas because I can drop an enterprise ready solution if linux becomes

911
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,600
So effective at doing its job that I don't have to know it exists for me to get the banana

912
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:30,480
I'm okay with that. That actually doesn't bother me and if amazon can make a buck by customizing that operating system

913
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,160
And delivering delivering an end of banana to a to a user without them having to understand

914
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:41,920
How how the banana got there to begin with I guess i'm okay with that too. And so then to to to go on from there

915
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,920
How do you feel about the uh, how do you want to call it patriotism or you know to the to the kernel level?

916
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,680
Do you care mostly about?

917
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,440
You know the experience is it posix like is it or is it a license issue?

918
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,560
Like could you could amazon then replace their ec2 service with free bsd hosts or even a luminous host?

919
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,120
And would that change things for you? Would you is there a community loss there? Does it matter?

920
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,840
Well, I think first of all, I don't I i'm usually not aware if they're going to change something like that out

921
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,680
Right, I wouldn't know is again. I'm it's it's a black box. I don't know how it's working

922
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,920
I like I don't see that happening for a couple of reasons. First of all

923
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,680
I think that a lot of these systems have gotten built up

924
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:28,560
On the backbone of linux and they have ridden that train up and you get a lot of people that are very very comfortable

925
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:32,240
Uh administrating in in what they already know and i'll give you a great example of that

926
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,380
It's been 15 years since I first sat down and was required

927
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,040
To use a given server a server operating system, right when I first started out

928
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,480
They said you will use rel because that's what we use here and that's you know, whatever

929
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:50,320
And you know, I was formally trained on rel and whatnot and and I got and I and I got my start in rel

930
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,080
Partly because I sought out jobs in that in you know in that area

931
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,920
but

932
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,280
I ever since then I have formal training on rel I have worked with rel i've worked with redhat the company extensively

933
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,400
So when I go to set up a server, it is second nature to me

934
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:09,520
I just naturally want to use rel and you see in the military a lot of the guys that that go in and

935
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,160
They become very proficient with with a given firearm

936
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,360
They own a very similar firearm when they get home because it's what they like to shoot because they're very comfortable with it

937
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,800
And I I think that we have gotten as an industry

938
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,120
so entrenched in the linux ecosystem in the linux system

939
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,160
I think it's going to be very difficult if not impossible to ever back our way back out

940
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,440
And and and and so if you're going to go to something like bsd

941
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,320
Bsd would not just have to equal linux in in a competitive advantage

942
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,480
It would have to far exceed it because you would have to have something so compelling

943
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,360
That it's worth people to fundamentally relearn the system that they know. What do you guys think in the mumbo room?

944
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,920
In general, I don't think the general use os is going to go away for a long time because I mean

945
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:00,160
These cloud solutions are great and all but even the average user is going to have to be on the technological level

946
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:05,200
And understanding to be able to use these and have them work

947
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:11,040
And people who really want a general use os to do whatever they want with as a playground

948
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:18,560
I think most of us in here and most people who work in it and devs who like to tinker will probably always use one

949
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,440
rotten corpse, what do you think?

950
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,400
Going once we'll always use um

951
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:34,320
I'll always use a, you know, general operating system. I mean, yeah, totally. I'll add stuff like um

952
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:42,720
A cody box or something. Sure, you know, there's definitely there's definitely places where it makes sense, but it's not a fundamentally going to change

953
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:50,080
How I use majority of what I do like I guess and I think that applies to most people because they're they're even if you have

954
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:59,040
Uh, like even if people switch like earlier we were talking about how maybe the mass majority of people will switch to something like a phone or a tablet as their main system

955
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,120
That's a general operating system. Sure. So I don't really think that this really has much

956
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
You know ground to stand on sure

957
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,440
so I guess I just wonder from the new user perspective and

958
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,360
And and maybe maybe it's like the the difference like you were talking about like learning rel

959
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,000
And like even learning rel like even though it's an enterprise distribution. It's kind of locked away in its own little tower

960
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,520
You know, you're on the command line. You're using these gnu tools. It's it feels more part of the community versus like

961
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,320
These days maybe you could have come up and like what you got you got certified in aws, right?

962
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,760
You know how to administer the acls for network access as you know

963
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,600
All about ec2 sure and that doesn't I guess that doesn't feel the same in terms of

964
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,440
You're maybe even accomplishing the same things, but it doesn't have the same heart to me

965
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,880
You know, it doesn't and you know

966
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,880
The thing is it's we're in a drastically different landscape today than we were 15 years ago

967
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
You know these days when I started out

968
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,760
I spent I and I spent it out of my own money too. Uh, no, no actually I didn't that's not true

969
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,360
That's not true. I I got a company to pay for but I I I contacted a company and had them pay

970
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,440
I think it was like three grand

971
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,200
To send me to official training to get trained on on rel because I was doing this stuff for them

972
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,400
And I said, you know, I just I really need some some actual training and it wasn't so much that I needed

973
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,080
To learn how to do things. I think I knew how to do the tasks

974
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,160
I needed to do really what it gave me was the confidence to know I was doing things correctly

975
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,480
These days you don't have to spend twenty five hundred three thousand dollars to get that sort of training

976
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,620
You know, you don't you you can go to linuxacademy.com

977
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,640
Unplugged and we will give you a great deal

978
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:38,000
Uh to be able to use linux academy and the thing about linux academy is they take everything in bite-sized pieces

979
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,240
So they work with your schedule

980
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,960
They take everything that you'd need to know and and you can do it on anything

981
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,940
You can do it on rel you can do it on abuntu. You can do it on aws

982
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,760
You pick the area of expertise that you need to know and then you go through those snippets now for me personally

983
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,520
I went through when I when rel7 came out. I didn't need to go through

984
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,400
You know the basics of the red hat operating system

985
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,760
I'd been using it for 10 years, but I needed to know it was different between six and seven

986
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:10,480
Wow, linux academy had a course for me. They had a course from transitioning from six to seven and I was able to in just

987
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,240
A week or so get myself up to what I would have had to spend

988
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,280
Five days plus hotel plus food plus taking time off work. A lot of people don't

989
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,760
Constantly, you know if you're self-employed

990
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,880
The cost to come here to do a show the cost to fly out here the cost to stay here that

991
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,640
That's not where the money is

992
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,520
The money is in the fact that i'm not working when i'm back in grand forks

993
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,920
How much money could you have made exactly the cost in going to a training session is not the 2500 three thousand dollars

994
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,360
Really? That's peanuts

995
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,280
It's not the couple thousand dollars i'm going to spend on a hotel for a week or the food i'm going to spend

996
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,560
It's the time away from it's the time away from my business and and I see that dropping well with linux academy

997
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,360
I'm able to keep doing my work keep serving my clients and at the same time

998
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,040
Stay up to uh, stay up to date on the leading edge of technology

999
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,280
You can get a professional grade education right there in your office

1000
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,920
You can and these people are dedicated linux professionals. They're not just people that show up, you know

1001
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,280
You know just just to collect a paycheck. These people are dedicated linux professionals that that you know

1002
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:15,600
Really have a passion for teaching linux. So head over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged and a huge. Thank you

1003
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,000
To linux academy for sponsoring the linux unplug program

1004
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:28,080
So one of my passions in fact it one of the focus of uh, the show that we are working on uh, the call-in show

1005
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,360
Called ask noah that we're working on is uh going to be small business. Small business is near and dear to my heart

1006
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,720
And one of the things that fits in tandem with small business is of course

1007
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,240
Linux because in small business, it's all about that roi

1008
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:50,400
How can I get the most return on my investment for the least amount of money invested? So this article comes to us from zdnet

1009
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,520
Many small businesses with tight budgets are facing a tough choice stick with an obsolete operating system and remain vulnerable to hackers or spend a lot

1010
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,520
to install new gear

1011
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,280
David gerwitz shows how linux can help preserve your investment while still staying safe and secure

1012
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,560
Earlier this week my phone rang. I looked at the caller id and it was from a neighbor in the community since I was writing

1013
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,040
I ignored it. Next week. I'm going to show you how to do it

1014
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,720
I ignored it next came a text from the same guy. Please call me. Like I said, I was working so I ignored it

1015
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,720
God, we've all been there, right?

1016
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,560
Then came a succession of text alerts on my phone. I turned my phone off and finished my article

1017
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,120
When I finally looked at my phone there were a scroll of alerts all from fred

1018
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,840
I don't know fred all that well, but we often bump into each other around town and events

1019
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,480
He normally seems like a cheerful calm sort but not today

1020
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,160
I listened to his voicemail message where he sounded like he'd been crying

1021
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,300
We're done. Dave. Don't know what to do expletive computers

1022
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,440
It was a busy week and it sounded like it'd been generally desperate. I I reluctantly decided to get involved

1023
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,200
I called him back and said hey fred what's going on? You sound upset dave. Can you come over?

1024
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:58,880
I think I might be done for if there's if there's a chance fixing computers is not her. Sorry. This is back to him

1025
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,840
Fixing computers is not my favorite thing, but i'd been inside all day and so it would be nice to get out

1026
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
So I headed over to his office

1027
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,560
What I walked into seemed like a war zone more than an office a cluster of workers

1028
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:16,640
Were staring at a clunky old lcd monitor that looked like they'd seen a ghost. Here's what I discovered fred's service business

1029
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:23,600
Has 20 pcs all more than a decade old and still running you got it windows xp. Where's abel?

1030
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:29,600
This time it was ransomware this time. He wasn't going to recover quickly or cheaply

1031
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:35,760
Fred was running windows xp for a few reasons his hardware was running solidly and he didn't want to pay for a windows upgrade

1032
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,720
Remember that free windows upgrade to windows 10 didn't include xp, but he couldn't afford to buy new machines

1033
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,440
Now here's the thing

1034
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,320
I see this

1035
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,400
This is this is not a this is not a an isolated incident

1036
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,920
I see this on a daily basis this right here

1037
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,560
And if you're wondering why I dove so far deep into this article

1038
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,520
It's because I first of all, I think the writer just did a fantastic job

1039
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,240
really drawing you into his narrative, but the second thing is

1040
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
this story is

1041
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,600
Probably 95 of our customers really rings true. They have reached the end of their rope. They don't have a

1042
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,800
Necessarily large budget they have a budget

1043
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,760
Yeah, you know, we're not america worker, right?

1044
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,080
But they have a budget just not a large budget and they don't want to spend, uh, you know

1045
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:27,540
60 000. Well actually more than that. We we just did a bid for a business that is getting all new machines

1046
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:33,060
Uh whole nine yards and that's I think it was 85 grand and of course that includes all the network

1047
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,420
Infrastructure and installation stuff like that and they're doing you know, so we're pulling new wire and stuff for them

1048
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:43,060
Yeah, but uh, but and that doesn't even include I mean i'm sure it would be more expensive

1049
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:46,660
We are buying those computers with windows right because these are no operating system. We're gonna put linux on them

1050
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:51,300
This kind of client exists out there. So if you are a that there are two

1051
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:56,980
People that this story should speak volumes to the first story is if you want a small business and you're running computers with windows

1052
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,980
Xp you need to stop today

1053
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:02,500
You need to go download up on to mate and you need to make it work for you

1054
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,940
The first thing you're going to say is well noah

1055
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:11,060
There are some applications that I just have to run on windows xp or that i'm just very used to this

1056
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,980
Not saying it's going to be a perfect experience. You might have some hiccups along the way

1057
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:17,300
But I promise you a hundred percent

1058
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:23,460
You are going to have hiccups if you continue down this path of using a 15 year old operating system and expecting it to continue

1059
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,980
To work for you

1060
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,980
Microsoft isn't doing any favors in that regard, right?

1061
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,940
The second group of people that should really take light note of this story

1062
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,700
Is if you have it in you to start a local it service

1063
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:42,980
This is your client right here. You go find this person and you say for you know, $50 an hour $75 an hour

1064
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,580
You know $50 an hour $75 an hour $90 an hour whatever you think you can get

1065
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,780
I will come in here and I will clean all these machines up

1066
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:55,460
I will reinstall them with the latest version of an operating system for you and i'll work with you until we get your business operating

1067
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:00,260
With acceptable solutions if you are willing to do that and you're willing to stick with it, you know

1068
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,340
And I sat just last week

1069
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,580
sat in a boardroom across from a uh, you know a very demanding client

1070
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:11,700
And he looked right at me and when I told him we're gonna wipe these machines gonna wipe windows off

1071
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,940
I'm gonna put linux. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do that. You know, it was not I was not met with uh,

1072
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,460
You know, oh that sounds great, right? He wasn't very happy about it

1073
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,820
Um, but you just you stick on your guns and you say this is why we're doing it

1074
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:28,740
And I have a I have a proven track record in the last 10 years of doing this and we have successfully served clients

1075
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,300
We can successfully serve you but you need to trust us on this

1076
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,140
You need to let us go forward. You need to let us do this and this is why and here are the competitive advantages

1077
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,140
You will make so much money off of doing stuff like this. It's not even funny

1078
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,140
I'm a room. What do you guys think about this?

1079
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:49,940
I definitely think that's a good service to have and people should be jumping up on that because they really do need to move

1080
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,780
away from xp

1081
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,060
It seems to be like a a good value add that the community, you know

1082
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,820
Like where maybe open source plays well where a commercial solution wants to wrap it all up

1083
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:03,780
They want to sell you the support but where open source solutions open up is a good business opportunity for people who like open

1084
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,420
Source who contribute who support it who can then go out in the agency and one evangelize and then two

1085
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:12,340
Maybe provide support sell support that can then you know foster the community

1086
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,220
What do you guys think it'd be it'd be a great option for

1087
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:22,340
If there was like a community project that would do a service but provide like you still had to pay for it

1088
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,420
but you're paying for support and

1089
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:30,100
The people who are committing to the project are getting paid from that in certain ways. So it's more like

1090
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:35,460
You're you're contributing to help the community help people come to the community

1091
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:38,020
And that would be awesome. Um

1092
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,380
but there was actually there's people who are still using xp and

1093
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,820
continue to use xp regardless of having

1094
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:53,300
Dealing with stuff all day. Like there is one. This is just an anecdotal story

1095
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:59,060
But there was someone I was talking to a company that was potentially becoming was going to become a client for mine

1096
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:05,220
But they decided that um, they didn't they didn't realize they didn't think that they were a big risk

1097
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,300
So they're going to keep using xp

1098
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:08,500
um

1099
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:14,260
And I refuse to let them keep using xp as everywhere because they wanted to do it where every

1100
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:19,700
Every system was xp and their server was xp and everything absolutely. Everything's xp

1101
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,460
I wanted to get like give them uh, linux everywhere

1102
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,020
But an xp vm for the people who are going to use it so I could keep them off the internet and

1103
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,580
Since the xp is not online. It's not a big deal

1104
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,140
Uh, but they refuse to do that

1105
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:40,100
So I have uh one person who works there who sends me messages at least three times a week or so

1106
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:45,700
Uh complaining about something going wrong where their their computer completely crashes or

1107
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:50,820
You know the server getting infected even though supposedly that's impossible as they say

1108
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,820
but

1109
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,820
if we could actually provide them a

1110
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:59,940
community or a service or something that would give them, you know a semblance of

1111
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,740
support and they

1112
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,900
Weren't they're not going into like oh, we're switching completely and it's up to us to figure it out

1113
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:12,260
Right. How many business owners would spend hours on google trying to figure that out when they really just need to get it done?

1114
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,540
And if they have a resource that they can maybe support financially or you know

1115
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:18,900
Whatever you need to do to make that work where it feels like, you know, they're doing it as part of community

1116
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,900
Maybe it helps put uh, you know businesses together against the virus

1117
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:28,660
Uh, you know businesses together who have done that so that they have people to talk to talk about how the transitions went

1118
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,900
Problems with training all that stuff

1119
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,780
That's a good idea

1120
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,780
More as a part of a

1121
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,780
Good good. No good

1122
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:42,340
I was a part of a local it business, uh that that totally missed this vote

1123
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,140
Um, I had been railing on them to begin supporting

1124
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,300
linux in any form

1125
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:53,860
Um from day one that I arrived there and I spoke to several clients about you know, oper oper

1126
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:00,260
Switching their operations over to linux and and finding solutions that worked and this was five six years ago

1127
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:01,380
um

1128
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:06,420
and now the local it business is dead and those clients are

1129
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,500
Looking around I guess they they have nothing to fall back on

1130
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:15,620
Uh, because this was this was a business that developed when doing hardware repairs was easy money

1131
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:19,860
And you could actually make you know a fair living at just repairing the boxes

1132
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:23,540
And I could not get this business to look bigger to look smarter

1133
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:29,460
at what was going to happen in the next five years with the hardware becoming essentially unrepairable because

1134
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:34,580
Joe consumer was buying tablet related machines more so than laptop or desktop related machines

1135
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:41,620
And they weren't looking at the commercial market. So there's my sob story of of an it business that totally missed the boat

1136
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,800
uh, yeah, just give me a second here. I got the link for you

1137
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,840
It is a company called three

1138
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,560
Sorry, there's a company that is inside of toronto where i'm located called free geek toronto

1139
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,520
What they do is they take old machines and they convert them over

1140
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,920
Get them back up and running and they always throw linux on it. Sometimes they give them out for free

1141
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,920
Sometimes you can buy them. Here's the link here

1142
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,560
Now the reason why i'm bringing them up is because there's a lot of people that are

1143
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:15,640
out there right now that are in the hey, we're just going to remake this machine business now if more of them actually provided

1144
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:23,080
Setups with linux on it, which would mean that they wouldn't be paying as much towards the um, the operating system

1145
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,440
They could always you know, donate that to the people that are making the operating system

1146
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,800
You know more people would be actually willing to try it out because a lot of people

1147
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,600
Who are you know making the decisions about the computers at the work place?

1148
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:41,560
You know making the decisions about the computers at the workplace. They're going to have windows at home

1149
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,320
Or they're gonna have mac at home

1150
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,520
So if they start off with linux at home say linux and windows like what I have all of a sudden

1151
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:54,360
You're no longer as afraid to sit there and try out linux at the workplace because you already know

1152
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,280
Hey, this is what it can do. This is what I can't do so on and so forth

1153
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,400
And i've actually converted businesses doing exactly that rotten corpse

1154
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,700
I like the idea of providing machines to people so that they have the transition

1155
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
From work to home

1156
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,800
And I also like the idea of giving them

1157
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,080
Uh, you know a service that provides them with the free equipment to make it easier for that transition

1158
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:24,200
But I don't like the idea of these free equipment. There's been there's multiple plate companies that do this

1159
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,040
I know of one

1160
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,080
One that mosenrath mentioned in toronto. I know of one in the uk

1161
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,080
And they all do the same thing

1162
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:37,560
They take these really terrible hardware that well linux can run on this old hardware. Yes, it can

1163
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,040
But that doesn't mean it's going to be a good experience

1164
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,240
Right, it's probably going to be an awful experience because it's awful hardware linux deserves good hardware

1165
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,560
You'll get even more value. Exactly that like when when they use something that's good

1166
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,240
That's fantastic when they use them. They're giving something that's terrible

1167
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,920
They're just going to blame linux and not the hardware because they have no idea

1168
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:02,280
Exactly. Well, thank you so much for the mumble room for joining us today. We really appreciate it as always

1169
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:08,120
Special thanks to michael tonel our producer and show screener mit free the man who keeps our mumble room up and running

We look forward to seeing you right back here next week

1174
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
So

1175
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,220
So, uh

1176
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:16,640
There's an article here from mod zero on modzero.github.io

1177
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,040
Github.io

1178
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:26,240
And it is with the release of microsoft windows 10 operating system several innovations have been introduced into the market regarding privacy settings

1179
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,080
What is normal?

1180
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:34,880
What is a normality with apple since long apparently has been accepted by osx user now has finally become a reality for microsoft users

1181
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,520
The analysis of the user data and behavior of the us american creator of software

1182
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:46,160
Over time more users published instructions on how to break microsoft's habits of spying on the users including

1183
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,640
Private users whose computers are not part of a company or enterprise domain

1184
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
I was annoyed that this

1185
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,240
That this leads to manually clicking check marks on a graphical user interface

1186
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,040
Or running confusing powershell scripts that merge with several several single rule sets

1187
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,640
So I don't know if you guys have seen this article or not

1188
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,600
Um, but it it basically

1189
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:14,960
Uh it my understanding is that there is a it is a it is basically a how-to guide

1190
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,440
On how to fix windows 10 to be more privacy respecting. Is that right?

1191
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,280
Well, even better than that. It's uh, like uh something you can install that will do it for you

1192
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:30,880
Took a bunch of other guides tips on how to do it best practices that have emerged and then made a tool that will just

1193
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,840
Apply that for you, you know
