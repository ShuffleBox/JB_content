WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Now, Chris, I know you're an animal lover, but mostly just on the outside.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.080
You ever been curious about the inside?

00:07.320 --> 00:11.320
No, no, that sounds like that would be something a psychopath would want to do,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.000
like cut open a cat or something.

00:13.000 --> 00:13.760
It sure does.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.440
Why are you asking me this?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.440
Oh, well, I've got a link for you.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.960
A kind of cute, kind of disturbing new VR cat demo.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

00:24.760 --> 00:25.960
This one from Leap Motion.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.520
Yeah, I've I heard about it.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.480
I had not seen it.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.040
I don't think I need to go inside a cat, Wes.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.560
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 253 for June 12th, 2018.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.680
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:51.680 --> 00:55.520
that's definitely not going to talk about Microsoft buying GitHub this week.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.960
Well, I mean, I mean anymore.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.880
And yes, I'm still live from the road.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.840
I'm just outside of Dallas, Texas, parked at the Linux Academy headquarters.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.960
I'll tell you more about that.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.280
But let's bring in everybody.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.160
My name is Chris.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.240
And that right there over there is my name is Wes.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.640
Hello, Wes, you and your wonderful Seattle weather.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.280
Oh, I know, right?

01:17.280 --> 01:18.560
It's overcast right now.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.040
Can you even imagine that, Chris?

01:20.680 --> 01:22.680
No, no, no, no, I cannot.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.560
Wes, we're going to try something a little different today.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.080
Going to reformat the show a little bit.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.520
This is the Unplugged program after all.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.960
And we're going to do things in blocks.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.800
This is an idea I came up while I'm on the road, totally 100% open to feedback.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.000
So here's what's going to happen for the first time.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.680
We're going to bust through a community update block of news.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.480
Then I'm going to block all of the sponsors together in one easy to navigate

01:44.480 --> 01:47.480
spot in the show with all the links of the stuff I'm going to talk about this

01:47.480 --> 01:49.720
week, because they're all launching stuff, some big stuff.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.520
I'll tell you about that.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.080
Then towards the end of the show, we're going to kick back.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.760
I'm going to tell you about Texas Linux Fest, what the event was like, about

01:57.760 --> 02:04.280
the parties that we attended and all of those kinds of stories, and then we'll

02:04.280 --> 02:10.160
wrap it up with an app pick that is extremely useful and our own Mr.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.280
Wes Payne will tell us all about it.

02:12.560 --> 02:17.000
But Wes, before we go any fervor, there is one duty that we must perform.

02:17.000 --> 02:17.480
We must.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.080
We must.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.480
We must holla at that mumble room.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.120
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
What's up?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
Hello.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.320
Hello.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.200
Hello, everybody.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.360
So wonderful to hear you.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.080
I, uh, I'm, I'm feeling pretty good right now.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.120
You know, I've started to acclimate to the Texas heat.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.760
You're Texan through and through.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.040
Yeah, I'm not doing too bad.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.640
It's 97 degrees here every single day in Keller, Texas, but, uh, I don't know.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.760
You kind of get used to it after a while, if that makes any sense.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.160
And it's a little less humid here than it was down in Austin.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.360
So that helps a lot too.

02:47.360 --> 02:52.560
And, uh, I got to, uh, I, I, Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy, picked me up

02:52.560 --> 02:56.520
Friday morning out, uh, from the campground to take me to Linux Fest.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.360
And while we were driving, I chatted with him.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.360
I said, yeah, you know, we're, we're a little concerned about the heat because,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.280
uh, it's going to be 97 degrees.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.440
And of course I'm going to have to run my generator to be able to run the AC.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.320
And that's going to be loud and it's going to be limited.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.600
I'm only going to run it for, you know, it's just kind of like, it was just kind

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
of convincing as I'm sometimes known to do.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
It's only sometimes.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.600
Yeah.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.600
It's almost like I've made a living out of it or something.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.040
And so, uh, you know, super cool guy.

03:25.040 --> 03:29.480
He, he gets ahold of his facilities guy Friday morning.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.960
And by Sunday, when I got here, they had a power hookup for the RV.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.400
So I could hook up and get full service.

03:36.400 --> 03:36.680
Yep.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.160
So I got AC, I got full power.

03:39.200 --> 03:39.840
It's great.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.320
Even, I'm even in the shade a little bit by the, by this time, it's, uh, it's,

03:44.320 --> 03:48.080
um, almost about three o'clock, uh, uh, about Chicago time zone area.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.360
Um, about this time, the, uh, building starts to shade the RV too.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.400
So it's, it's, it's actually downright comfortable.

03:55.160 --> 03:55.920
I couldn't believe it.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.680
How did you get such a sweet spot?

03:57.800 --> 03:58.320
I don't know, man.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.040
I was worried about it the entire time before I left.

04:01.040 --> 04:01.560
I was worried.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.520
Like I was, I was, I almost went out and got like this whole reflectix kit that I

04:05.520 --> 04:07.280
was going to put out all over the windows.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.840
And I was going to, I remember I was really upset when my awning got busted

04:10.840 --> 04:13.720
because that was like a key part of, and that still would have been very useful.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.960
Uh, but it was a key part of my shade strategy.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.920
Like I was very concerned about this particular aspect and it's gone way

04:20.920 --> 04:22.040
better than I could have imagined.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.720
And on top of that, we're right next to like a little pond crick thing.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.120
I don't know.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.000
They're not like what we have in Washington because there it's just like

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
any old average, like basically big ditch, but it's a natural thing and it's full

04:36.000 --> 04:38.240
of fish and turtles.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.080
I have a turtle pond next to the RV and so far I've counted four turtles and I'm

04:43.080 --> 04:44.360
told there's some turtles in there.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.480
They're as large as hubcaps, like big turtles.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.480
So you brought one on as a guest on the show today?

04:48.520 --> 04:48.920
Yeah, yeah.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.560
He's sitting right there.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.440
He's, uh, he just hasn't had much to say yet.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.720
So last night I'm working out by the pond, watching the turtles, Levi and I.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.160
So that was pretty cool.

05:00.440 --> 05:00.640
Yeah.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.880
And then, and then do you found this tour app?

05:02.880 --> 05:06.080
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it right, but it's tour or something like that.

05:06.240 --> 05:06.760
Have you seen this?

05:06.760 --> 05:07.920
It's Airbnb for cars.

05:07.960 --> 05:08.760
No, I have not.

05:08.760 --> 05:15.720
And they specialize in sort of fancy cars, like, you know, so Mercedes, BMWs,

05:15.720 --> 05:20.120
Teslas, or like really souped up Jeep Jeep wranglers and trucks for Texas.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.520
And so for 60 bucks, we rented today a Mercedes with great air conditioning, a

05:26.520 --> 05:31.440
white Mercedes with air conditioning that we can bop around for a couple of days.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.920
Bopping around in Texas in style, no less.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.560
Look at you.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.720
You really know what you're doing.

05:35.960 --> 05:36.320
Hmm.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.120
It's been pretty good.

05:37.120 --> 05:37.720
I mean, I'm getting there.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.080
I've got to walk through the Linux Academy office too, and got to see some

05:41.080 --> 05:42.720
of their studio space that they have here.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.000
And, uh, I've got the OBS rig, um, loaded.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
It's got OBS on it.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.800
It's got Kubuntu 1804 loaded.

05:48.800 --> 05:52.240
It got the capture cards of the audio interface all hooked up to it.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.120
And, um, I'm going to try doing a Chromebook HDMI capture on it after the

05:57.120 --> 05:57.360
show.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.920
So they're, they're interesting.

05:59.000 --> 05:59.240
Yeah.

05:59.240 --> 06:03.160
Their transition to Linux, uh, from the Mac is, uh, is well underway.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.680
So it's been a great visit and, um, I now, I now have a new term for air

06:07.680 --> 06:10.040
conditioning and that term is life support.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.800
I now understand that it's life support.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.080
Yeah.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.600
So it was, it was a great, it was a, it was a, it was a great trip to get here.

06:16.600 --> 06:16.920
It was hot.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.800
It was 104 degrees on the drive up here and there was construction in Waco.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.760
So, yeah, it took a while.

06:23.760 --> 06:29.080
It took me five hours to get from Austin to Dallas and, uh, 104 degrees in that

06:29.080 --> 06:31.760
drive, but so, so are you, are you homesick yet?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.480
Are you, are you?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.040
Are you missing the comforts of the JV one studio?

06:35.120 --> 06:38.640
You know, actually today's kind of the day that I wasn't like some days I am

06:38.680 --> 06:41.200
right, but today isn't one of those days today.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.000
I'm really kind of digging it.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.960
I'm kind of, I'm comfortable, you know, uh, I got the car, so I was able to go

06:46.960 --> 06:51.280
out and I was able to get some babes, uh, fried chicken, which, uh, yeah, which

06:51.280 --> 06:54.680
was described to me as, as fried chicken.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.480
That's better than grandma's fried chicken when grandma grew up making fried

06:58.480 --> 06:58.800
chicken.

07:00.480 --> 07:00.760
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.280
Yeah.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.680
That's incredible.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.960
It was actually pretty good.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.440
So it's been a great trip.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.400
There's been so much cool, like, uh, people to meet.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.640
There's some people that are visiting the Linux Academy offices that are out

07:12.680 --> 07:16.640
like writing software and doing startup stuff and they're building on top of

07:16.640 --> 07:17.840
Linux and they're here talking to people.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.240
So the thing about the thing that I'm starting to appreciate is there's like a

07:21.240 --> 07:26.480
bench of people here that are like, uh, like Red Hat experts and Azure experts

07:26.480 --> 07:30.960
and like expert experts, like really, like really like I shouldn't give anybody

07:30.960 --> 07:34.400
ideas, but like Amazon and Microsoft and Red Hat are poaching people from here

07:34.400 --> 07:34.920
constantly.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.920
Like these people really, so they're, so Linux Academy has people out here.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.360
They're just, uh, you know, getting questions answered and stuff like that.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.240
They've got this new meetup space they're building to, uh, bring people in

07:43.240 --> 07:45.480
from the community and so they can get questions answered.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.520
And it's just really cool thing there.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.480
So I got to see all of that that they're building out right now.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.000
It's pretty neat.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.200
That is really neat.

07:50.520 --> 07:50.760
Yeah.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.680
So there's probably going to be some more Linux community things going on in this

07:53.680 --> 07:56.880
area, uh, later on down the road once they get all that stuff rolling.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.080
But, uh, what do you say?

07:58.080 --> 08:01.240
What do you, should we get into some, some, uh, larger open source free

08:01.240 --> 08:02.800
software community news updates?

08:03.120 --> 08:04.040
That's what we're here for, right?

08:04.080 --> 08:04.840
Let's do it.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.120
Yeah.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.280
We'll talk about Texas Linux Fest later, but let's talk about some news items that

08:08.280 --> 08:11.360
people should probably know about this week as we're, uh, it's only Tuesday and

08:11.360 --> 08:14.560
there's things you should probably know about if you're a Copperhead OS user,

08:14.560 --> 08:18.880
especially now, Copperhead OS is a security enhanced Android distribution

08:18.880 --> 08:23.720
started in 2016, but it looks like the company behind Copperhead OS appears to

08:23.720 --> 08:25.360
have run into some internal trouble.

08:25.360 --> 08:29.680
Now I don't really know the specifics at this point, but the situation seems to be

08:29.680 --> 08:33.160
devolving and there's clearly some kind of dispute between the founders.

08:33.160 --> 08:36.160
You guys know how much I hate drama, so I don't really care to get into it, but

08:36.160 --> 08:38.720
there is a Reddit post that we'll have linked in the show notes where

08:38.720 --> 08:41.640
apparently one of the co-founders essentially is kicking out the other

08:41.640 --> 08:42.840
co-founder from the company.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
So that does tend to cause drama, Wes.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.280
Absolutely.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.120
Especially, you know, at these really, these really small distributions or

08:51.120 --> 08:55.040
companies where that makes up a lot of the culture, a lot of the history and

08:55.040 --> 08:57.680
a lot of the people, you know, trying to do work and organizing things.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.240
So yikes.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.160
Yeah.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.720
And my thoughts are with the users.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.360
I know it almost sounds cliche to say, but it's like, okay, well now what?

09:05.400 --> 09:08.880
Because, uh, you know, you have a user base who's using this because they

09:08.880 --> 09:10.800
have very certain kinds of considerations.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.480
A Copperhead OS appeals to a certain kind of user base.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.080
Well, now what?

09:14.720 --> 09:15.120
I don't know.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.320
I honestly don't know where they go cause I don't follow this very carefully.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.120
I see Mr.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.160
Popey has entered in the room.

09:20.160 --> 09:20.800
Hello, Popey.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.480
Good to see you.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.000
Hello.

09:22.080 --> 09:22.600
Hello.

09:22.840 --> 09:23.640
And Tyler's here too.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.680
Tyler, welcome back.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.240
It's been good.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.280
I haven't seen you for a little bit.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.440
Taking the night off.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.240
I just got back in from, uh, driving home from Southeast Linux Fest.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.360
Well, maybe we can pick your brain about that a little bit in the show.

09:34.400 --> 09:34.920
What do you say?

09:34.920 --> 09:38.440
Do a little Texas Linux Fest update and a little Southeast Linux Fest update.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.800
Both were going on this weekend.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.240
So I'd love to pick your brain about that.

09:42.240 --> 09:42.760
Stick around.

09:43.040 --> 09:43.680
I'm glad you're here.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.120
Uh, yeah.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.640
So this weekend was huge.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.600
It was full spectrum for Jupiter broadcasting.

09:50.600 --> 09:57.080
So we had BSD can going on in Canada and Alan Jude, uh, was there and it was live

09:57.080 --> 10:04.920
streamed Tyler and Noah were at self and they were live streaming the hell out of

10:04.920 --> 10:10.320
self I was at Texas Linux Fest doing no work at all, just hobnobbing with

10:10.320 --> 10:17.440
everybody and, uh, uh, Joe and Popey were at a floss talk this weekend.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.760
This weekend, so all of that was happening this weekend.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.680
So, Popey, if you want to talk about floss talking a little bit too, we could

10:23.680 --> 10:25.920
just do kind of a whole kind of roundabout about some of the events we

10:25.920 --> 10:28.840
were at this weekend and, uh, that'd be awesome.

10:29.320 --> 10:29.600
All right.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.520
So yeah, Copperhead OS, uh, back to the news.

10:32.760 --> 10:37.200
So Copperhead OS, uh, is, uh, perhaps in trouble and it might be

10:37.200 --> 10:38.640
time to look for an alternative.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.080
I don't know if I'm in the Mamba room has any alternative suggestions or if you do

10:41.080 --> 10:44.160
West, but, uh, I'd love to hear what the audience thinks on that.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.800
It's kind of a shame to see these projects.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.200
Maybe things will work out fine, but it's a shame to see things go this way.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.520
Especially in a security focused project where you sort of hope that calmer heads

10:52.520 --> 10:56.480
will prevail as it's, you know, serious attention to details sort of work.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.480
But as always, personalities, they happen.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.520
That's exactly, basically just summed it up.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.600
Personalities happen.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.440
Uh, that's a title.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.560
Somebody said, bang, suggest that.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.680
That's a good title suggestion.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.000
Uh, open source personalities happen.

11:08.440 --> 11:14.240
So Plasma 5.3, speaking of refinement and working away on stuff, Plasma 5.13

11:14.240 --> 11:18.440
launched today, and I think the big headline feature for most users is going

11:18.440 --> 11:19.800
to be the browser integration.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.000
It's a new set of features for Firefox, Chrome and Chromium based browsers.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.680
They integrate in with plasma notification, pop-ups, transferring

11:26.680 --> 11:30.800
files with dolphin notifications, media controls can now mute and skip videos

11:30.800 --> 11:32.600
playing from within the browser.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.840
And you can send a link to your phone with KDE connect now, and, uh, you can

11:37.840 --> 11:40.120
also choose browser tabs.

11:40.120 --> 11:44.760
I've not tried this at all, but I, I understand that you can try, you can try

11:44.760 --> 11:48.440
to choose browser tabs somehow from K runner with an old space keyboard

11:48.440 --> 11:48.880
shortcut.

11:49.040 --> 11:49.840
That's blowing my mind.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.280
I got to try that at some point.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.560
So that's probably the biggest user facing new feature in Plasma 5.13.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.040
The one that I have been anticipating the longest is the redesigned for system

12:00.040 --> 12:03.320
settings and the new look for the lock-in for the lock screen and login screen,

12:03.320 --> 12:05.840
which I think looks really slick.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.760
There's also graphics, compositor updates.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.040
Kaywin gain a much improved effects for blurring and desktop switching.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.880
And of course, as all these updates go, there's been continued work on making

12:14.880 --> 12:19.000
Wayland awesome, including the return of windows rules now on Wayland, which is

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
a fantastic plasma desktop feature and the use of high priority EGL context, as

12:24.000 --> 12:27.720
well as initial support for screencast and desktop sharing.

12:27.720 --> 12:32.960
Whoa, huge one, plus something that's not really just like a bullet point

12:32.960 --> 12:33.240
feature.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.240
Here's tons of performance improvements, memory usage improvements, lots of

12:37.240 --> 12:40.720
improvements on the system setting stuff and a tech preview.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.640
That's what they're calling it of the GTK global menu integration.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.600
So if you're a fan of global menus, there has been a hack available on Plasma.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.960
I call it a hack, but there's been a way to get it working on Plasma for a

12:50.960 --> 12:51.280
while.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.760
This is official stuff.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
There's going to be official stuff.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.440
So that's really nice.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.120
And then a small one.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.040
It's kind of funny they're even put this in here, but I legit like it.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.720
The digital clock widget allows you now to copy the current date and time to

13:02.720 --> 13:03.200
the clipboard.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.040
Hallelujah.

13:04.040 --> 13:08.760
Wes, it's those small little usability things that when they're there, it just

13:08.760 --> 13:09.240
makes sense.

13:09.240 --> 13:09.400
Right.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.560
So new users to me like, oh, hey, look, this is handy.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.640
And when you want it or you're just trying to just trying to copy the things

13:14.640 --> 13:17.360
you need to send it to someone right now and then it works and you're just

13:17.360 --> 13:18.520
like, yes, great, perfect.

13:18.840 --> 13:24.640
And now I think I think I'll leave I'll leave it as an exercise to the user.

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
But producer Michael and I work together on a video for the Plasma 513

13:32.000 --> 13:32.520
introduction.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.960
So I'll have that linked in the show notes if you guys want to watch that.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.360
That covers more stuff and shows screencasts and whatnot of all of that.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.880
But big news for you, Popey, now that you're a big Plasma desktop user, you

13:43.880 --> 13:44.920
must be looking forward to this.

13:45.040 --> 13:45.680
Yeah, always.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.040
I love just getting the fire hose of updates that come on KDE Neon because

13:49.480 --> 13:53.760
because it's different for me because I'm used to Ubuntu where we have our six

13:53.760 --> 13:54.560
monthly releases.

13:54.560 --> 13:59.520
So I have to upgrade every six months in order to get new crack at the platform

13:59.520 --> 14:01.280
level with KDE Neon.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.920
I've got their PPA enabled or their repo enabled.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.520
So I just get new stuff all the time and it's great.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.040
I love it.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.360
It kind of is because it's like it's the desktop stuff.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.720
But your core OS is pretty much not changing much unless there's been some

14:14.720 --> 14:16.080
upstream change from Ubuntu.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.560
So it's kind of just the right balance in a weird way and surprisingly has not

14:20.560 --> 14:21.520
broken yet for me.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.760
You know, that's the other thing.

14:23.160 --> 14:23.560
Sweet.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.680
Always a bonus.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.840
Has it broke for you at all?

14:26.120 --> 14:27.680
Um, no.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.200
Oh, I was going to say it did right back at the start.

14:31.200 --> 14:37.520
There was a, well, Kwin has crashed once, maybe twice, I think, but everything

14:37.520 --> 14:38.200
carried on working.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.480
All the applications are still running.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.920
It's just the window decorations died and I just went to a TTY rerun Kwin and

14:44.920 --> 14:45.560
carried on running.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.480
And I carried on running for about a week with Kwin running in a TTY.

14:50.200 --> 14:50.920
It was fine.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.280
And it worked.

14:52.320 --> 14:52.720
Yeah.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.000
That's a testament right there.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.760
The Neon updates will probably be flowing.

14:56.760 --> 15:01.120
I have not tried to update my box yet because I'm doing the show right now, but

15:01.120 --> 15:02.320
I think I will after the show.

15:02.320 --> 15:02.840
Oh, you've learned.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.560
Good job.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.040
Good job.

15:04.040 --> 15:04.520
I'm proud.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.640
I am a little extra conservative about it when I'm on the road because like if

15:08.640 --> 15:11.680
it breaks at the studio, well, I could probably just go grab another machine.

15:11.760 --> 15:16.040
If it breaks while I'm on the road, I really am going to be in a, like, it'd

15:16.040 --> 15:19.000
be kind of embarrassing to walk into Linux Academy with like my laptop in hand

15:19.000 --> 15:21.640
and be like, uh, anybody have a thumb drive I can use?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.760
That's, uh, it's not the direction I want that to go.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.200
Poby, did you hear about these wine packs?

15:27.200 --> 15:31.880
It reminds me just last week we talked about a couple of snaps that were quote

15:31.880 --> 15:38.280
soaked in wine and now we have wine packs, which, uh, are just like the name sounds.

15:38.320 --> 15:42.880
Uh, it's a packaging up of wine applications, a flat pack bundle, and

15:42.880 --> 15:46.800
they have, um, Fortnite, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft as well as Internet

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
Explorer 8, everyone's favorite browser.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.080
Um, as, uh, I guess you could call it, uh, what do they call them?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.240
Wine packs as a wine pack.

15:54.880 --> 15:55.560
What are your thoughts?

15:55.560 --> 15:59.960
I think these, um, these various, uh, tools for making containerized

15:59.960 --> 16:06.320
applications are suited perfectly to this use case of having wine plus something.

16:06.480 --> 16:11.640
And the reason why is often you want to have, um, a specific build of wine or a

16:11.640 --> 16:15.880
specific tweaked set of additional libraries that you might install with

16:15.880 --> 16:20.880
wine tricks, plus the application and that, that delicate balancing of all

16:20.880 --> 16:24.280
those things someone needs to figure out and then get it all right and package it

16:24.280 --> 16:27.640
all up and it works, but then you don't ever want to touch it and you don't want

16:27.640 --> 16:32.040
to then, you know, update the version of wine or screw around with what's inside

16:32.040 --> 16:36.680
that, that, um, that, you know, fake C drive as it were.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.000
Um, and that's exactly what these containerized applications that you do,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.240
you end up having the right version of wine and the right config for Fortnite

16:44.240 --> 16:48.360
or whatever, the right version of wine and the right config for whatever other

16:48.360 --> 16:50.000
game and they don't interfere with each other.

16:50.120 --> 16:50.720
It's a great idea.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.480
I like that.

16:51.480 --> 16:58.600
And I wonder if this could be something that, um, that maybe crossover office

16:58.600 --> 17:02.000
could jump on top of and, uh, bundle it with, uh, you know, bundle their

17:02.000 --> 17:05.880
applications in a way or bundle wine applications in a way that make it even

17:05.880 --> 17:08.520
easier for end users to install those.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.160
That could be kind of a neat thing.

17:10.480 --> 17:10.680
Yeah.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.240
It really seems like it could open up this.

17:12.280 --> 17:16.400
I'm thinking about the number of people I've sort of, you know, uh, softly

17:16.400 --> 17:17.600
pushed on the Linux.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.280
Some of them are playing more games or trying to use some more, you know,

17:20.280 --> 17:23.160
they're just doing more and sometimes that involves Windows programs.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.480
I don't want to teach them how to use wine.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.160
So if I can point them at these things, that's so much better.

17:28.360 --> 17:33.200
It makes it easier for them to get at, it's just, you know, click an icon or,

17:33.440 --> 17:36.120
you know, download a flat pack or whatever, and just make it easy for

17:36.120 --> 17:39.640
people to get all the necessary bits and pieces that make it work.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.800
I'm going to be curious to watch how many more of these we get with snaps too.

17:43.800 --> 17:50.400
And, uh, I think, I think, uh, the, the whole concept is, is also potentially

17:50.400 --> 17:51.720
a huge boom for piracy.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.360
It could be, um, you know, you could go, you could, you could go pirate all

17:55.360 --> 17:56.680
kinds of Windows applications.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.160
If you can get it working right and get it in one of these, uh, containerized

17:59.160 --> 18:00.560
application delivery mechanisms.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.760
Well, that's already been done.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.120
There are on pirate bay, there are a whole bunch of flat packs for

18:05.280 --> 18:08.520
commercial, uh, Windows applications that have been bundled with wine.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.600
That was done probably about eight months ago.

18:10.600 --> 18:15.920
Um, but, you know, people will always bend technology to their will, even if

18:15.920 --> 18:18.200
it's nefarious uses, unfortunately.

18:18.360 --> 18:18.640
Yeah.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.000
Um, and some ways maybe that's a way we can preserve software to way, way down

18:23.000 --> 18:24.720
the road, so that'll be something interesting to watch.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.080
Yeah.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.960
I mean, uh, there's a, there's a mosaic snap in the store, so you can get the

18:29.960 --> 18:34.360
original mosaic browser if you really, really, really want to, uh, yeah, just

18:34.360 --> 18:38.680
do snap install mosaic and you can run the mosaic window, not a lot of websites

18:38.680 --> 18:43.360
work with it because it's a very old web browser, but the original homepage for

18:43.360 --> 18:44.680
the mosaic web browser does work.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.560
And that's what it is, the homepage for that, that web browser.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.880
So yeah, it is a great way to preserve software.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.680
You can have it in a little container is not going to break out of that container.

18:53.680 --> 18:57.280
And, um, you've got a little runtime environment that it will work in for, you

18:57.280 --> 18:58.320
know, forever and for always.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.240
No, hold on.

18:59.240 --> 18:59.960
I got to do this.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.440
This is too great right now.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.600
I mean, I'm sorry if my connection gets a little shaky cause I'm going to, I'm

19:05.600 --> 19:07.720
actually legitimately installing this right now as we go.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.280
Well, we could use this mosaic browser isn't particularly large.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.600
It's like 1.4 megs.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.120
Yeah.

19:13.120 --> 19:13.640
Right.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.480
Oh, this is great.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.080
Oh my, oh boy.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.960
It's also a train wreck on high DPI.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.440
Uh, surprise, surprise everybody.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.640
Oh yeah, it will be.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.880
I wonder if there's any webpage you can actually open on that.

19:26.200 --> 19:26.960
There are a few.

19:27.280 --> 19:27.760
You know what?

19:27.760 --> 19:30.840
One of my favorite sites, one of the things that, uh, one of the great things

19:30.840 --> 19:36.160
that I think GDPR brought us us citizens is a whole bunch of news websites,

19:36.160 --> 19:39.560
can't figure out what to do, so they just threw their arms up and made text

19:39.560 --> 19:43.240
versions of their websites, which is nothing on it, but the text NPR has done

19:43.240 --> 19:47.160
this, CNN has done this, and it's the best thing ever.

19:47.160 --> 19:53.600
In fact, if you want to try it, go to text.npr.org and it's just an all text

19:53.600 --> 19:54.080
version.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.640
Um, and I also, I tweeted a couple of days ago, this is what the CNN one is.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.280
I want to try it in text.npr.org.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.000
Let's try it in the mosaic browser and see if it works.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.160
Are we going to fail on an SSL server?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.280
I'd imagine.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.480
Oh, it is.

20:07.480 --> 20:07.760
Yep.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.680
It's SSL.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.000
Yep.

20:09.040 --> 20:09.600
Damn.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.680
That seemed like if anything was going to work, that would have worked.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.640
But yeah, it's, you know, I hear that SSL can't be trusted, so they should

20:14.640 --> 20:16.120
probably drop that cause I hear it's bad.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.200
Oh, it's the worst.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.200
Just stay away from it.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.200
I'll try out more.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.520
Are you familiar with Gopher, Chris?

20:21.520 --> 20:22.760
Cause that it's making a research.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.680
So let me tell you.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.080
Oh man.

20:25.160 --> 20:25.600
Geez.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.360
You, you just really showed your age there.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.520
You want to talk about BBS's too while we're at it?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.160
Oh, I thought that was on the docket already.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.560
We always on the lookout.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.920
For old crusty software that we can put in a stamp for a bit of a lull.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.120
So yeah, if you have any ideas to, you know, where to find me.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.960
Yeah, I love the idea too.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.600
Cause it is in a way preserving old, old work.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.680
We've been following this slow March to Linux apps landing on Chromebooks.

20:51.720 --> 20:57.160
And last week we talked about how the Samsung Chromebook is getting Linux apps

20:57.160 --> 20:59.040
support, even though it's an ARM based Chromebook.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.800
That's a, that's just great news, but now it looks like a new Chromebook that's on

21:02.800 --> 21:07.760
the market soon. Two actually that were introduced by Acer, the Chromebook 13

21:07.760 --> 21:13.360
and the Chromebook Spin 13 are going to ship with this Linux app support.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.560
So you guys recall Google revealed back at Google IO, we'd be covering it before

21:17.560 --> 21:21.160
that even that Chrome OS would be adding support for running Linux apps within

21:21.160 --> 21:25.960
Chrome OS's environment on certain select hardware because it involves as either

21:25.960 --> 21:29.600
a certain modern version of the kernel or back porting certain kernel modules

21:29.600 --> 21:30.880
and features to older versions.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.800
Which is what's happening in some cases or in some cases like the Pixelbook, it

21:33.800 --> 21:36.960
just has the newest version of the kernel and you're good to go if you get the

21:36.960 --> 21:40.720
dev channel. Last week we discovered that if you subscribe to the dev channel on

21:40.720 --> 21:43.520
the Samsung Chromebook Plus, you could get Linux apps.

21:43.720 --> 21:48.280
And now, according to a commit that was spotted by the XDA developers, Acer's

21:48.280 --> 21:51.800
new machines are going to support Linux apps at launch.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.200
That's kind of a big deal.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.480
So they're going to start from day one with Linux apps.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.800
This is actually happening faster than I thought it would, Wes.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.240
What are your thoughts? Does it seem like this is happening faster or is this about

22:04.240 --> 22:05.920
what you thought it was going to be pace wise?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.600
No, I agree with you.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.600
It sort of felt like, OK, yeah, you know, the high end, high end stuff, the developer

22:11.600 --> 22:14.400
focused stuff that's going to get this right away, the things that are already out

22:14.400 --> 22:17.600
there and people are already using this sort of experimental machines on the bleeding

22:17.600 --> 22:21.880
edge. Not something we'll see like launch right away or that people marketing

22:21.880 --> 22:26.000
Chromebooks would necessarily think that a wide array of people, potential customers

22:26.000 --> 22:30.240
might want. But, boy, this seems like, you know, the couple of news items we've

22:30.240 --> 22:33.920
covered about this, it does seem to have some real momentum and like it's a feature

22:33.920 --> 22:38.120
that's well designed enough or stable enough that they feel like they can ship it, not

22:38.120 --> 22:41.000
have to worry about it. Sure, probably not a huge amount of people will use it right

22:41.000 --> 22:43.360
away or at least won't know that they're using it.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.160
But for the rest of us weird Linux nerds over here, it's awesome.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.000
Yes, weirdos. Eric, do you have a Chromebook?

22:50.000 --> 22:54.480
And if you do or don't, would you consider getting one that has this Linux app support?

22:54.480 --> 22:56.280
Yeah, I would definitely consider one.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.120
I've been pricing out like XPS 13s and that kind of thing, but that's a little pricey

23:00.120 --> 23:04.760
for my position right now. So a Chromebook might be a good way to get Linux, but not

23:04.760 --> 23:07.760
at, you know, at a Cadillac price.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.520
That's a good way to put it. I was thinking, too, it works well as sort of like my backup

23:11.520 --> 23:18.640
Linux rig. You know, I can have I can have I can have maybe I can have a 15 inch laptop

23:18.640 --> 23:23.960
and then I have a smaller Chromebook. That's sort of like my backup portable Linux rig.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.680
You know, that'd be pretty nice. I think this might be the year that I buy a new

23:27.680 --> 23:31.920
Chromebook. I've never, never have never bought a Chromebook. I've I've bought a used

23:31.920 --> 23:36.120
Chromebook once. Of course, I played with my kids Chromebook, but I've never bought

23:36.120 --> 23:40.880
a Chromebook. And so this might be the year that I finally break down and I do it.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.160
What about you, Bobby? Would this put you over the edge for getting a Chromebook or

23:44.160 --> 23:44.880
or a new one?

23:44.880 --> 23:51.200
I actually picked up a Chromebook just last week. It was in amongst a bunch of stuff that

23:51.200 --> 23:55.440
was being thrown out from the canonical offices. They were clearing out some some

23:55.440 --> 24:01.200
cupboards. So I grabbed it and it's, it's quite neat, but it's out of support because

24:01.200 --> 24:06.960
unfortunately, it's the very, very first Chromebook, the CR 48. So there's no chance

24:06.960 --> 24:10.640
it's ever going to run Linux apps unless I wipe it and put something like Ubuntu, like

24:10.640 --> 24:14.880
1310 on there or something really old and crusty.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.200
I think that was the Chromebook I had. I think that was the same one. That was a

24:19.200 --> 24:24.880
popular one. I don't remember why it was so popular. So yeah, I think I think I'm

24:24.880 --> 24:28.640
going to I think I'm going to shop a little bit and I'm going to try it. Yes.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.400
Check that out. Acer Chromebook. Yay. All right. So let's talk about something a

24:32.400 --> 24:37.920
little sad, just a little bit. The Mars Opportunity Rover, which does have a Linux

24:37.920 --> 24:42.720
angle, we'll talk about here in a second, is in danger of dying right now this week

24:42.720 --> 24:47.520
from a dust storm. And engineers are delicately balancing the remaining battery

24:47.520 --> 24:51.040
power. It's caught in a pretty significant dust storm. In fact, the most significant

24:51.040 --> 24:55.360
I believe that it's ever been in. And if not, it's the second most significant and

24:55.360 --> 25:00.160
the craft is hunkered down, trying to survive the intensifying weather. The storm

25:00.160 --> 25:05.200
was first detected on Friday, June 1 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, at which

25:05.200 --> 25:09.360
point the rover's team was notified because whenever there's a large storm

25:09.360 --> 25:14.560
near one of the rovers, they they page the team. The rover uses solar panels. So

25:14.560 --> 25:19.440
a dust storm is going to have an extremely negative impact on the rover

25:19.440 --> 25:22.960
opportunities, power levels and its batteries. I feel like I understand its

25:22.960 --> 25:26.960
pain. You know, I feel like my rover also has suffered from similar situations.

25:26.960 --> 25:32.240
Just a harsh universe out there and you got to protect yourself. And then on

25:32.240 --> 25:38.240
June 6, Wednesday, June 6, opportunity was in minimal operations mode because of

25:38.240 --> 25:42.480
the sharply decreasing power levels. Now, the brave little rover is continuing to

25:42.480 --> 25:46.480
weather the storm. In fact, it sent a transmission to Earth Sunday morning. We

25:46.480 --> 25:49.920
last heard from it, which is a good sign. So that means there's still enough

25:49.920 --> 25:52.720
charge left in the batteries to communicate with home, despite the fact

25:52.720 --> 25:56.640
that the storm is continuing to worsen. But the main concern isn't really the

25:56.640 --> 26:01.600
dust storm itself. It's the need to keep the rover's heaters operating at a

26:01.600 --> 26:06.400
minimum while maintaining minimal power levels in the batteries because it's so

26:06.400 --> 26:12.000
cold. Opportunity, though, is a pretty hard little rover and maybe Linux has

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
contributed this a little bit. It's continually defied everyone's

26:16.000 --> 26:22.640
expectations for 15 years. It was only designed to last for 90 days and it's

26:22.640 --> 26:26.800
still going. So this, I mean, this is why it's such a kind of a big deal because

26:26.800 --> 26:32.560
not only is it represent just a massive technological breakthrough for NASA and

26:32.560 --> 26:38.960
it's just an incredible accomplishment, it's also representative of when NASA

26:38.960 --> 26:43.600
and the Jet Propulsion Labs made the change to using Linux as their

26:43.600 --> 26:48.800
development and control systems. Really? Yeah, it represents a really cool story

26:48.800 --> 26:53.840
behind, the long term behind, the development story behind this rover was.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.880
This wasn't going to be the rover initially. It was going to be a different

26:56.880 --> 27:01.520
rover, completely going to be designed, controlled, managed, developed for using

27:01.520 --> 27:07.440
all SGI systems. SGI top and bottom, SGI everything. But that mission took a

27:07.440 --> 27:14.160
turning point and in the background, JPL and others had been experimenting with

27:14.160 --> 27:20.400
Linux here and there. A Debian laptop had gone up on the space shuttle STS-83 in

27:20.400 --> 27:26.800
97. So Debian went up into space in 97. But internally, they just weren't there

27:26.800 --> 27:31.600
yet. But they had sort of like this skunk works project to move things off of

27:31.600 --> 27:35.920
the SGI's and onto Linux box, onto a Linux box. And I've got the full story

27:35.920 --> 27:39.440
from Linux journal from years ago linked in the show notes, but I'll just give

27:39.440 --> 27:43.600
you the highlights of this piece. So they say, Linux originally was not intended

27:43.600 --> 27:47.200
to be the primary development platform. Our software initially was intended for

27:47.200 --> 27:51.360
use on the Mars 01 mission, which essentially would have been a repeat of

27:51.360 --> 27:56.400
JPL's 97 Mars Pathfinder mission. The plan was to do all rover commanding on a

27:56.400 --> 28:01.040
single Silicon Graphics workstation, as had been done on the Mars Pathfinder.

28:01.040 --> 28:07.680
Our Linux support was, at that time, mainly a hedge against SGI's fortunes.

28:07.680 --> 28:14.160
Wow. After the failure of JPL's Mars 98 missions, however, JPL replanned its

28:14.160 --> 28:18.960
Mars strategy. The Mars 01 plans were scrapped in favor of a later launch. That

28:18.960 --> 28:25.200
mission later on became the MER mission, M-E-R. The upshot was that we got two

28:25.200 --> 28:28.160
years of development time that we hadn't planned on. Although it was for a

28:28.160 --> 28:31.760
different spacecraft than we had planned, we had two years. In those two years,

28:31.760 --> 28:37.040
Linux and the generic x86 hardware it runs on made enormous strides in both

28:37.040 --> 28:41.200
CPU and graphics speeds, thanks in no small part to the graphics shipmaker

28:41.200 --> 28:46.000
NVIDIA and its strong support for Linux on the enterprise systems. As a result,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
we increasingly came to favor the faster, better, cheaper solution that was Linux.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.240
We eventually purchased two high-end SGI's to add to our Linux boxes during

28:54.240 --> 28:59.040
flight operations, but it's unclear whether we ended up using them. The Linux

28:59.040 --> 29:02.960
boxes now give us equal, if not better, performance. And as a result, the MER

29:02.960 --> 29:08.320
rovers are being commanded by multiple teams working in parallel on dozens of

29:08.320 --> 29:13.040
Linux systems that we purchased for the mission. And now that's for 17 years

29:13.040 --> 29:16.400
they've been doing this. Our software suite of applications called the Rover

29:16.400 --> 29:22.400
Sequencing and Visualization Program, RSVP for short, was developed, tested,

29:22.400 --> 29:28.720
and deployed on Linux. RSVP gives MER engineers and scientists sophisticated

29:28.720 --> 29:33.440
tools for commanding Mars rovers. Because of the lengthy light time delays,

29:33.440 --> 29:37.680
which amount to nearly 20 minutes round trip, it's not possible to control the

29:37.680 --> 29:42.800
rovers interactively. RSVP provides an immersive environment that accurately

29:42.800 --> 29:46.560
displays the rover's environment and simulates its behavior. Throughout the

29:46.560 --> 29:52.000
Martian night, we Earthlings use RSVP to plan a days of activities at the

29:52.000 --> 29:56.400
command level and then uplink the resulting commands to the rover. The

29:56.400 --> 30:01.440
rover then executes those commands during the following Martian day. So

30:01.440 --> 30:06.400
there's two main components of RSVP. The Rover Sequencing Editor, which provides

30:06.400 --> 30:11.280
text oriented commanding for all spacecraft commands, and Hyperdrive, which

30:11.280 --> 30:16.800
provides an advanced three dimensional graphics for driving, arm motion, and

30:16.800 --> 30:19.680
imaging commands. I think we call that AR these days, Wes.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.800
We sure do.

30:20.800 --> 30:25.600
And they say also the messages is based on RML, an XML based specification

30:25.600 --> 30:30.080
designed specifically for representing rover commands and sequences. And they

30:30.080 --> 30:33.280
have so much more detail in the article. But they say the automation friendly

30:33.280 --> 30:38.080
Linux environment contributed greatly to the whole system's reliability. Early on

30:38.080 --> 30:42.400
we wrote extensive self-tests to code, to test our code, and then set up a simple

30:42.400 --> 30:46.480
cron job to run the tests every night. If any self-test failed, they were

30:46.480 --> 30:51.040
reported an email message to the developer the next morning. This helped

30:51.040 --> 30:54.400
us catch bugs early, while the changes that it caused them were still fresh in

30:54.400 --> 30:58.640
our minds. Our aggressive self-testing was something of an experiment, and it

30:58.640 --> 31:01.280
paid off handsomely. How about that?

31:01.280 --> 31:05.200
This is an incredible article, and what a story. I think you really hit on it.

31:05.200 --> 31:10.240
It's like the rovers have been so cool and given us such a new understanding of

31:10.240 --> 31:14.240
this, you know, this neighbor in our solar system, and that you can make it all

31:14.240 --> 31:18.400
happen with the technology we already think is great and use and love. And it

31:18.400 --> 31:21.520
just sells Linux so well, right? You don't have to make sure that you've

31:21.520 --> 31:24.480
budgeted accurately for the number of machines that you hope that you actually

31:24.480 --> 31:28.240
need and all the licenses to run them. If you can get commodity parts, you can

31:28.240 --> 31:30.960
just stick more Linux on it, have multiple people working on the same

31:30.960 --> 31:34.800
thing, not a problem. And it's so interesting that it kind of started as

31:34.800 --> 31:40.000
like this little side skunkworks hedge, and then as time went on, it's like,

31:40.000 --> 31:43.440
wait a minute, this thing has just surpassed what we originally hedging

31:43.440 --> 31:46.560
against. That's so Linux. That's such a Linux thing to do.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.360
It is a Linux thing to do, right? You're like, well, it's free, so you can kind of

31:49.360 --> 31:52.560
sneak it in. Oh, we're just running the test server on it. Oh, yeah, the backup

31:52.560 --> 31:56.080
system, it's fine. And then you realize it's just easier to work with.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.360
I met some Linux journal people at Texas Linux Fest, actually.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.520
Is that right? Yeah, speaking of Texas Fest, they had a booth. They were

32:03.520 --> 32:08.000
giving away posters and things like that. We'll talk about that in a minute.

32:08.880 --> 32:12.560
So what we just did there is kind of a new format. We just did everything just

32:12.560 --> 32:16.960
all back together, no stopping, no interruptions. We just did all of the

32:16.960 --> 32:19.920
news right there. And now I want to stop and I want to do a sponsor block

32:19.920 --> 32:22.720
because our sponsors are doing a lot of cool things this week, and you're going

32:22.720 --> 32:25.280
to need links for some of this stuff. And so what we're going to do is we're

32:25.280 --> 32:28.000
going to do all of them right here. And then the rest of the show, we just

32:28.000 --> 32:30.640
continue on. And I want to get your feedback on if you like this because I

32:30.640 --> 32:34.080
know, A, some of you have heard this before. So that makes it a little easier

32:34.080 --> 32:38.160
to navigate. And B, when we talk about some of the stuff our sponsors are

32:38.160 --> 32:41.440
doing, there's no clear place where in the show you go get those links.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.720
So let's start by thanking Linux Academy because that's where I'm parked at

32:44.720 --> 32:48.320
right now. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged is where you go to sign up

32:48.320 --> 32:52.160
for a free seven day trial. Linux Academy can help change your life through

32:52.160 --> 32:55.760
affordable, high quality online cloud training. You can learn new skills, get

32:55.760 --> 32:59.280
certified and train your team and advance your career. We heard from

32:59.280 --> 33:02.720
several people at Texas Linux Fest who said their whole IT department has an

33:02.720 --> 33:06.000
account. And a lot of people said, I just got one because I'm learning to go

33:06.000 --> 33:08.320
somewhere. I'm trying to get into security. I'm trying to get into cloud

33:08.320 --> 33:11.920
computing. I'm trying to wrap my head around how the Google Cloud works. It's

33:11.920 --> 33:14.240
really fascinating all the different reasons people get into it. But the one

33:14.240 --> 33:18.720
thing that remains true is that it's extremely valuable, extremely valuable

33:18.720 --> 33:22.000
resource. It's a training platform to learn everything about Linux and

33:22.000 --> 33:27.040
whatever Linux runs on. And back in April, they launched 70 new courses,

33:27.040 --> 33:29.680
challenges and learning activities. And I mentioned it here on the show. And

33:29.680 --> 33:35.600
that was a big deal. 70 is huge. It's a lot of content. And now that I'm here,

33:35.600 --> 33:39.200
I have learned, little bird, I won't say much, but little birdies have been

33:39.200 --> 33:47.520
telling me they are all focused on July. They have, they have a lot of content

33:47.520 --> 33:51.200
coming out in July. Their biggest ever. It's going to be a ton of stuff. They've

33:51.200 --> 33:55.760
already kind of been teasing it a little bit, including their newest pillar,

33:55.760 --> 33:58.800
security. They're going to be launching a bunch of security courses and they're

33:58.800 --> 34:01.920
doing a giveaway to celebrate all of it. So I'm going to put a link in the blog,

34:01.920 --> 34:05.760
I'm going to put a link to their blog in our show notes at linuxunplug.com

34:05.760 --> 34:09.920
slash 253. So you can get in on the swag giveaway and find out about the new

34:09.920 --> 34:14.800
content that's coming out. It's massive. And to watch the whole team work on it

34:14.800 --> 34:19.200
as they are from, from art people to developers, to the course authors, to the

34:19.200 --> 34:22.960
executives and the admins, to the marketing folks and to the community

34:22.960 --> 34:25.600
people that are trying to get the word out there. Like everybody's focused on

34:25.600 --> 34:29.440
this because it's just a huge launch. It's massive. It'll blow your mind away

34:29.440 --> 34:32.720
and they're really proud of it. So go to Linux Academy right now. You can sign up

34:32.720 --> 34:36.480
for a free seven day trial. Try out the platform and then next month a whole

34:36.480 --> 34:40.240
bunch of stuff is going to land. Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. That's

34:40.240 --> 34:44.480
where you go to support the show and get a free seven day trial. Now Ting, Ting

34:44.480 --> 34:48.960
has been providing my connectivity on this entire trip from the moment I left

34:48.960 --> 34:54.960
Washington to right now. They have been a rock solid mobile carrier. They're smarter

34:54.960 --> 34:59.360
than unlimited. If you use less, you pay less. You can go to linux.ting.com and

34:59.360 --> 35:04.800
get $25 in Ting service credit or $25 off a phone. That's linux.ting.com. The

35:04.800 --> 35:09.360
average bill is $23 per month per phone. You pay for what you use. A fair price

35:09.360 --> 35:12.880
for however much you talk, however much you text, and however much data you use.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.160
So this month my data bill is going to be more. But for the other 11 months of

35:16.160 --> 35:20.880
the year, I pay hardly anything for data because I have Wi-Fi everywhere I go and

35:20.880 --> 35:25.120
they have nationwide coverage. I've been able to use CDMA and GSM. Where I'm at

35:25.120 --> 35:28.640
right now is a GSM town. It's a GSM town. It's been working just fine. But

35:28.640 --> 35:31.280
sometimes CDMA works a little better, especially when I was in Utah. I found

35:31.280 --> 35:35.600
that CDMA just worked a lot better. No contracts, nor the termination fees. You

35:35.600 --> 35:39.360
can try Ting risk free and you can support the show. Linux.ting.com. They

35:39.360 --> 35:42.400
give you a control panel where you can manage everything, see your usage at a

35:42.400 --> 35:46.880
glance, take complete control, set usage alerts. Oh, oh, and they're doing some

35:46.880 --> 35:50.320
giveaways. They have a lot of things going on. But the thing I'm going to

35:50.320 --> 35:55.520
direct you to, because you've heard me do these ads before. You could probably do

35:55.520 --> 36:00.640
this ad and you could make some money. Ting is doing a $100 Amazon gift card.

36:00.640 --> 36:04.080
If you refer a friend or family member, you know, whoever, maybe a child.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.520
You know, convince your eight-year-old. No, I'm kidding. You can't do that. Yeah.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.120
Refer a friend to Ting and you win a chance to win. You get a chance to win

36:11.120 --> 36:16.880
$100 in Ting gift card, Amazon cards from Ting. And you just take all the things

36:16.880 --> 36:20.080
I've told you about Ting. You pay for what you use. Take your ministry message,

36:20.080 --> 36:23.520
your megabytes, whatever you use. That's what you pay. $6 a month for the line. No

36:23.520 --> 36:27.600
contract, nor the termination fee. Great company. Fanatical customer support.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.720
CDMA and GSM. You can bring your own device or you can buy one directly. They

36:30.720 --> 36:34.160
got no agenda. They don't necessarily care what you do with your device. Just

36:34.160 --> 36:36.480
use it. They're not going to try to push some sort of Ting experience down on

36:36.480 --> 36:40.000
your device. You say all those things and then you give them a link and you're

36:40.000 --> 36:42.640
probably going to get this $100 card because you're going to sell it. You're

36:42.640 --> 36:45.840
going to sell it. I know you. Start by going to linux.ting.com, either for

36:45.840 --> 36:49.360
yourself or a friend or a family or if you're visiting the States. I've met

36:49.360 --> 36:52.240
people traveling. They come here, they get themselves Ting and they use it while

36:52.240 --> 36:56.080
they're here because it's $6 a month. Why not? It's great. I love having it. I

36:56.080 --> 36:59.920
love having it. I have a CDMA and GSM now just to make it easy. I'm not

36:59.920 --> 37:04.240
activating devices or nothing. They're just ready to go. linux.ting.com.

37:04.240 --> 37:10.000
And finally today, big thank you to DigitalOcean. Making changes everywhere

37:10.000 --> 37:13.280
in the open source community and they're making it possible for you to build

37:13.280 --> 37:16.880
better applications and get things deployed in incredible speeds at

37:16.880 --> 37:21.360
industry leading price performance and predictable costs. Start by going to

37:21.360 --> 37:27.280
do.co.plugged. You get a $100 credit. You can apply that to your DigitalOcean

37:27.280 --> 37:31.280
account and you can mess around with a new account for 60 days with a $100

37:31.280 --> 37:34.880
credit. My favorite rig is $0.03 an hour. So a $100 credit is going to get you

37:34.880 --> 37:39.760
far and they have incredibly fast infrastructure, enterprise grade SSDs on

37:39.760 --> 37:44.400
everything from like the $5 a month rig up to the big mama jamas that have

37:44.400 --> 37:48.960
hundreds of gigs of RAM and Xeons for days. Oh, and they now have flexible

37:48.960 --> 37:53.200
droplets. You can mix and match the resources you need. I've got a Fedora 28

37:53.200 --> 37:59.920
box running up on DigitalOcean using 250 gigs-ish of block storage. It's so

37:59.920 --> 38:04.000
smooth the way all of this works. When you set up a Fedora 28 cloud instance,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.440
you immediately connect your SSH key. You get the DNS all set up if you do it

38:07.440 --> 38:12.000
like I do and you just log right in and get working. It's so straightforward

38:12.000 --> 38:15.440
because of this dashboard. They make managing all this stuff simple even if

38:15.440 --> 38:18.960
you've never done it before or if you've done it for a decade. So check it out by

38:18.960 --> 38:23.920
going to do.co.plugged. Cloud firewalls that block traffic at the network level,

38:23.920 --> 38:27.440
monitoring and alerting to keep you on top of what your rig is doing. Easy to

38:27.440 --> 38:33.520
use, well-documented API and tons and tons of documentation. Speaking of that

38:33.520 --> 38:36.880
documentation, I've told you in the past that DigitalOcean is willing to pay

38:36.880 --> 38:40.720
folks that write really good documentation for DigitalOcean. Well, now

38:40.720 --> 38:43.360
they're introducing something different. So I'm going to put this link in the

38:43.360 --> 38:51.040
show notes as well. You can now write for DO-nations, for DO-nations. Okay,

38:51.040 --> 38:54.800
sorry, but that's the joke. You can actually now write for DigitalOcean and

38:54.800 --> 38:58.560
then what they were going to pay you contribute to an open source project or

38:58.560 --> 39:03.920
a charity. For example, there's an article I have linked in the show notes,

39:03.920 --> 39:06.880
how to verify downloaded files that you download on your Linux box like an

39:06.880 --> 39:14.000
ISO. That was written by Michael Holly and he donated his $300 writer's fee to

39:14.000 --> 39:18.480
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. So you can go write up something that you're

39:18.480 --> 39:24.240
a technical expert on and then contribute out to a charitable donation.

39:24.240 --> 39:28.800
And they're going to match too. I think they'll match up to $400, something like

39:28.800 --> 39:31.360
I can't remember. So if you want to, anyways, the details I'll have linked in

39:31.360 --> 39:34.480
the show notes. I think this is a super cool program. It's definitely worth

39:34.480 --> 39:36.720
reading if that's something that you could possibly be good at. It could be a

39:36.720 --> 39:40.560
great way to contribute documentation to a community and contribute to a charity

39:40.560 --> 39:43.360
or an open source project that you like. So I'll have that linked in the show

39:43.360 --> 39:46.000
notes as well. Everybody's got something going on. It's just a big, great week.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.920
Check it all out and get started by going to do.co.pl and get that free $100

39:51.920 --> 39:58.320
credit for 60 days, do.co.pl. Unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean, to

39:58.320 --> 40:03.360
Ting, and of course to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

40:03.360 --> 40:09.920
Okay, moving on now. Let's talk about Texas Linux Fest. What a hell of a party.

40:09.920 --> 40:16.320
So it looks like Omnipotent had to leave. He joined me there along with a whole

40:16.320 --> 40:19.680
bunch of people. We had such a great time. So let me tell you a little bit about

40:19.680 --> 40:23.280
it. We won't spend too long on it, but it'll be real quick. Texas Linux Fest

40:23.280 --> 40:27.840
2018 was held at the AT&T Conference Center in Austin, Texas on Friday, June

40:27.840 --> 40:34.240
8th to Saturday, June 9th. And it was a hell of a party. Oh, Ironic Badger. Oh,

40:34.240 --> 40:38.880
where are you? Hello. Hello. I'm in Denver today. You are? Well, you're good

40:38.880 --> 40:42.240
to see you. Good to see you. How are you doing? How's the road been? How's the

40:42.240 --> 40:46.240
trip been? Are you recovered? Are you still hung over? How has it all gone?

40:46.240 --> 40:51.120
2,000 miles in two days for a British man. That's all I'll say.

40:51.120 --> 40:54.800
Yeah, that is a lot for you. Yeah, you've done a ton of driving. Welcome to the

40:54.800 --> 41:00.080
States. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's awesome. Alex, Mr. Badger there, has been

41:00.080 --> 41:05.280
traveling around looking for reasons for places perhaps. And he joined us at

41:05.280 --> 41:08.160
Texas Linux Fest. He made quite, I think you win for probably making the

41:08.160 --> 41:12.160
furthest track to Texas Linux Fest. Thank you. Is there a prize?

41:12.160 --> 41:20.720
Um, no. The barbecue, I guess. It was, it was so, yeah, bragging rights. How good

41:20.720 --> 41:26.240
was that barbecue? Life changing barbecue. Life changing. Like people talk

41:26.240 --> 41:31.520
about barbecue a lot, about Texas and barbecue. It's next level. You agree? Well,

41:31.520 --> 41:35.280
I wrote a blog post about it and I used the same phrase, life changingly good. So

41:35.280 --> 41:41.120
yeah, I do agree. Okay, good. It was, it was amazing. It was incredible. And it's

41:41.120 --> 41:44.480
one of the funny things about Austin is if you're hanging out with Austin locals,

41:45.680 --> 41:49.280
they're really passionate about discussing the best place to get food. And

41:49.280 --> 41:52.560
that might just be a Texas thing because we were in the hallway here at Linux

41:52.560 --> 41:56.000
Academy talking about where to get lunch and people stopped by to give us their

41:56.000 --> 42:00.320
two on where we should go. It seems to be food is important in Texas and I can

42:00.320 --> 42:04.640
respect that. I really can. About 500 people made it out to Texas Linux Fest.

42:04.640 --> 42:08.720
There was roughly about like three to five tracks going on at the same time.

42:08.720 --> 42:12.560
Really good talks. In fact, I heard a lot of people saying they're having a hard

42:12.560 --> 42:17.600
time choosing which one they wanted to go to. I attended a few. Wes, I went to

42:17.600 --> 42:21.840
a talk about how BPF is being used to do like Linux kernel tracing and stuff

42:21.840 --> 42:25.520
like that. Oh, that sounds fascinating. Yeah, the BPF talk was probably my

42:25.520 --> 42:28.560
favorite. Yeah, I was kind of creeping on the whole you guys down at the fest.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.080
I looked like there were a ton of great talks. I would have had the same problem.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.480
And that's always a good sign when you're at a conference, right? I mean,

42:34.480 --> 42:37.680
it's a little upsetting because you can't go to every single one of them, but you

42:37.680 --> 42:41.120
know it's packed. There's no filler content. Yeah, yeah, that's a good way to

42:41.120 --> 42:46.080
put it. And I liked also the talk. So you've been home. So you've been pwned

42:46.080 --> 42:48.400
like what to do in the next 30 minutes or something like that. I can't remember

42:48.400 --> 42:51.360
what it was. It was a it was a good one. You could text nappy kind of

42:51.360 --> 42:56.240
absolutely talk. Lots of lots of lots of tech snap fans there. Tons and tons of

42:56.240 --> 43:00.720
Linux unplugged and Linux action news fans. That was so awesome. Every night we

43:00.720 --> 43:03.360
had probably about three parties. Really, it was one of those things where you'd

43:03.360 --> 43:06.560
go out and then you go out again and then the group would break off again and

43:06.560 --> 43:11.920
they'd be like three separate parties. The first night we went out, it was I

43:11.920 --> 43:16.960
mean, we probably had a group of 40. I don't know. I'm guessing it was huge and

43:16.960 --> 43:22.720
it was because Linux Academy bought out the hotel bar and paid an obscene amount

43:22.720 --> 43:27.520
of money and drinks for everybody were on Linux Academy, which was amazing.

43:27.520 --> 43:32.480
So generous. There's no way I was going to cover that tab. And then and then we

43:32.480 --> 43:37.680
went out to like another place. Alex, you don't remember the name of the place

43:37.680 --> 43:42.480
that was on the lake, do you? It was the Hula Hut. The Hula Hut. What a place the

43:42.480 --> 43:46.880
Hula Hut was. Great drinks, great atmosphere, right on a lake. And so we

43:46.880 --> 43:51.760
hung out at the Hula Hut for a bit with the Linux Academy crew and another

43:51.760 --> 43:55.680
group of the Jupiter Broadcasting Group. And then then from there we went to a

43:55.680 --> 44:01.200
brewery where we got a little minor brewery tourie tourie and drank some

44:01.200 --> 44:06.160
great ciders and shut that place down and then went home. And Saturday night

44:06.160 --> 44:10.880
was the barbecue shenanigans, which were just life changing. My first thought

44:10.880 --> 44:15.920
after I ate that barbecue and I'm 100% serious and I did not expect this

44:15.920 --> 44:21.200
reaction was a shit. Now what am I going to do now? I have to come up with some

44:21.200 --> 44:24.560
excuse to come down here soon so I can eat this barbecue again because it was

44:24.560 --> 44:28.800
like I have to be back here. There's just no no question about it. So that was

44:28.800 --> 44:33.360
Saturday. We did a bunch of festing and then we went out. Oh man, I can't even

44:33.360 --> 44:36.560
remember. Oh Saturday we went and got some horrible pizza I think and fried

44:36.560 --> 44:41.760
food. That was pretty awful. But then a few of us like Alex, we went back and

44:41.760 --> 44:44.800
hung out at Lady Jupes for a while. That was pretty great. That was a lot of fun.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.200
It was good to see Lady Jupes in person that's for sure.

44:48.560 --> 44:53.520
Now I think it was a total blast. People take their food very seriously and so do

44:53.520 --> 44:59.360
I. The whole thing was so much fun. I've adapted to the heat. I'm damn near ready

44:59.360 --> 45:03.760
to move to Texas at this point. I really had a great time. It's definitely hot,

45:03.760 --> 45:07.200
but for some reason it doesn't matter. You know what I mean? It's because you're

45:07.200 --> 45:12.720
having such a good time you don't care. That first cafe we walked to for like 30

45:12.720 --> 45:17.920
minutes Friday was the most brutal of the whole trip really. That was rough.

45:17.920 --> 45:23.920
Yeah, exercising in that heat is not a good idea. No, Alex and I are both used

45:23.920 --> 45:27.120
to around Seattle and London style climates so walking around in 100

45:27.120 --> 45:31.520
degree sun beating right on you was quite intense. But everybody takes their

45:31.520 --> 45:35.600
AC very seriously so once you get inside there is some sweet, sweet relief.

45:35.600 --> 45:44.400
There was a thread on our Linux. Your favorite. I attended Texas Linux Fest.

45:44.400 --> 45:49.440
Where's the Linux? And they're calling out people for being at Texas Linux Fest

45:49.440 --> 45:53.040
and not using Linux to present, including they call it somebody from Linux Academy,

45:53.040 --> 45:57.360
although I don't know who it is, and several others for using Macs and whatnot.

45:59.520 --> 46:04.960
And it's got a decent amount of upvotes, 529 votes. It's got something like damn near

46:05.680 --> 46:11.520
345 comments. And it's this old boogeyman that we have in the Linux community

46:11.520 --> 46:17.920
where we'll collapse an entire person or an entire company down to a single

46:17.920 --> 46:23.600
variable and we'll say anyone at company X is not using Linux, therefore that

46:23.600 --> 46:28.480
company is disingenuous. Or that presenter isn't using Linux, they're using a Mac,

46:28.480 --> 46:34.320
so therefore they're not a very good presenter for a Linux event. And it's

46:34.320 --> 46:37.760
almost bigoted in a way if you think about it. Because say you take away Mac

46:37.760 --> 46:43.680
user and say they're because they're white or because they're bald. Now all

46:43.680 --> 46:48.320
of a sudden that's a real asshole thing to do. Now you're a dick. But when you

46:48.320 --> 46:52.400
replace that variable with Linux, that's a perfectly fine thing to do apparently.

46:53.280 --> 46:58.320
And it's kind of sick. It's kind of gross. It's something that I think if you

46:58.320 --> 47:01.520
were coming into the Linux community and you saw that, it would kind of disgust

47:01.520 --> 47:07.360
you a little bit. And I think it's because of insecurity. I think people are

47:07.360 --> 47:10.880
looking to those people to be validated, to have their choices validated. And

47:10.880 --> 47:15.760
when they don't have their choices validated, they're looking for, well,

47:15.760 --> 47:19.120
what's wrong with this person? Why wasn't that what I expected? Why am I not

47:19.120 --> 47:24.640
wrong and they are right? That's of course me playing armchair podcast therapist.

47:24.640 --> 47:28.640
If you look at one of the comments, Chris, it says Linux Academy have invited

47:28.640 --> 47:34.160
Chris from JB to come and convert their broadcasting workflow. The next comment

47:34.160 --> 47:39.200
says, but they are an academy, so why do they need help from somebody else? Isn't

47:39.200 --> 47:43.600
that the point of the open source community to share ideas and collaborate?

47:43.600 --> 47:44.560
Yeah, help each other.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.640
I just don't understand the hate. I don't get it.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.680
Yeah. And, you know, it doesn't make you an expert on every topic, does it Wes?

47:49.680 --> 47:55.040
But no, no, not at all. Right. And I think we Linux desktop users obviously

47:55.040 --> 47:59.360
like that, want to promote it. And that does usually get, or at least historically

47:59.360 --> 48:03.280
has gotten a fair amount of time at these, these Linux meetups and events.

48:03.280 --> 48:07.600
But especially if you just have, you know, Texas Linux fest, that doesn't

48:07.600 --> 48:10.240
necessarily mean it has to be desktop Linux. It doesn't really have to mean

48:10.240 --> 48:14.640
anything else. And shouldn't we try to be an inclusive community of, hey,

48:14.640 --> 48:17.680
we want whatever you like. Maybe you, maybe you started on the server. You

48:17.680 --> 48:20.720
love using your Mac on a desktop. It works really well, especially with the

48:20.720 --> 48:24.400
corporate provided PowerPoint that you're required to use or, or whatever else.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.920
And just try to show that, Hey, look at all these, you know, if you come to the

48:27.920 --> 48:30.880
conference and see a bunch of other people presenting on ThinkPads or see

48:30.880 --> 48:34.240
people with ThinkPads showing you how great they are, that's one way to do it.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.720
And complaining about it probably won't get very far.

48:37.520 --> 48:43.680
Well said. Good point. And what do you think about this idea that if we bury

48:43.680 --> 48:48.400
our heads in the sand and say, none of us ever use a Mac or nobody ever tries

48:48.400 --> 48:53.120
Adobe premier, they only use Katie and live or they, they never try anything

48:53.120 --> 48:58.560
on windows. They've never even booted windows. Are they an expert that you

48:58.560 --> 49:02.960
want to hear their opinion on topics from? I mean, like, aren't they missing a

49:02.960 --> 49:07.040
huge data point? Can they be trusted? What do you think of that, Wes?

49:07.040 --> 49:10.480
You do need to be aware of what alternative workflows actually exist. If

49:10.480 --> 49:13.440
you're going to speak to them, especially if you're coming from a world where

49:13.440 --> 49:17.040
people are already using those workflows, it's much easier, especially in the open

49:17.040 --> 49:20.480
source side. If you just have never touched the proprietary stuff. And sometimes,

49:20.480 --> 49:24.000
honestly, I've had it in my life where I just avoid it. You know, I don't need

49:24.000 --> 49:27.200
that. I know that if I try it, I'll probably get hooked and I'll start wanting to

49:27.200 --> 49:30.000
use that service instead of whatever open source tool I'm using.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.360
Yeah, that's the slippery slope.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.880
It really is. And that can be fine, right? We've talked a lot on the show about

49:34.880 --> 49:37.840
sometimes it makes sense to pay for things, even if they're proprietary for

49:37.840 --> 49:41.760
your own personal life. Be pure when you can support open source when you can.

49:42.400 --> 49:46.080
But none of us are perfect. And then especially going the other way, once

49:46.080 --> 49:49.200
you've established a workflow, especially if you're using it for some sort of

49:49.200 --> 49:52.960
commercial endeavor for your business at your workplace, you can't just change

49:52.960 --> 49:55.760
because you want to. You have to be able to change because it actually works or

49:55.760 --> 50:01.840
maybe is even better. Yeah. Yeah, true that. Eric, you have to use what you use

50:01.840 --> 50:04.800
a Mac or Windows for your day job. Do you find that gives you a good contrast

50:04.800 --> 50:06.080
of point of comparison?

50:06.080 --> 50:12.400
So when I first started this job, I was issued a Dell laptop running Windows

50:12.400 --> 50:16.400
7. They announced shortly thereafter that they moved moving to Windows 10,

50:16.400 --> 50:23.200
which is OK for the two games I played twice a month here at home. But as far

50:23.200 --> 50:29.760
as a work system, Windows 10 just isn't isn't there at all as a Linux server

50:29.760 --> 50:36.400
engineer. So I was able to request a MacBook Pro, which I liked my 2015

50:36.400 --> 50:39.840
MacBook, but they issued me one of the one of the one of the touchpad

50:40.880 --> 50:44.160
MacBooks with the new keyboards that feel like you're just pounding on

50:44.160 --> 50:50.080
concrete. But having having all three operating systems around me, I'm a

50:50.080 --> 50:54.080
Linux server engineer and then I'm actually talking to you guys from my

50:54.080 --> 50:59.360
from my custom built arch PC at home. So I feel like at least having some

50:59.360 --> 51:03.760
exposure to all three platforms really gives me an appreciation and really

51:03.760 --> 51:09.680
gives me a drive to work on what what tools can I port over to my Linux

51:09.680 --> 51:14.720
system? Because yeah, I hear I may be I may be running arch, but it's still

51:14.720 --> 51:19.360
the most stable platform of all three operating systems I work on.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.240
Yeah, OK, that makes sense. It sort of drives you to keep pushing it forward.

51:22.240 --> 51:26.480
So Poby, I'd love to hear your perspective on this because rumor has it

51:26.480 --> 51:30.480
there may be a Mac user to a canonical. Someone may be using arch even at

51:30.480 --> 51:34.000
canonical. So this is a controversy that you've witnessed not just a canonical,

51:34.000 --> 51:38.400
but all over the place. What are your thoughts on a don't you kind of isn't

51:38.400 --> 51:41.680
it isn't it good every now and then to like look at a Mac and see how they do

51:41.680 --> 51:45.200
it when you're when you're working on, say, creating software for the Linux

51:45.200 --> 51:48.960
desktop? Because that's good, valuable experience. And B, what about this

51:48.960 --> 51:52.800
whole attitude around the whole thing? So it's not controversial at canonical

51:52.800 --> 51:56.560
because we've never had a policy where you have to run Ubuntu. You run

51:56.560 --> 51:59.600
whatever you need to run because actually the computer is your own. The

51:59.600 --> 52:01.840
company doesn't provide you with a computer. You get a

52:03.440 --> 52:06.320
chunk of money periodically and you go buy whatever you want. Soon as you

52:06.320 --> 52:10.000
do your job, nobody cares what you're running on your desktop. And so that

52:10.000 --> 52:13.360
means some people are running Ubuntu. Some people actually aren't running

52:13.360 --> 52:16.160
Ubuntu. And that might mean they're running some other Linux distro. It

52:16.160 --> 52:19.440
might be in there running a different desktop or it might be in there running

52:19.440 --> 52:24.400
a Mac. And many of those people who are using Macs are using Macs because the

52:24.400 --> 52:28.720
software they need to use to do their job is not available on Linux. End of

52:28.720 --> 52:34.960
story. And no, GIMP and Inkscape are not alternatives. So yes, those people,

52:34.960 --> 52:37.680
some of those people work in design, but some of them aren't. Some of them are

52:37.680 --> 52:43.680
server people or DevOps people and they run OS 10 on a on a Mac because they

52:43.680 --> 52:47.840
prefer that laptop and they do all their Linuxy stuff in VMs or on remote

52:47.840 --> 52:52.080
machines. They're not part of the desktop team. So there's no real reason

52:52.080 --> 52:56.400
why they should have to run Ubuntu desktop. So you may see someone who

52:56.400 --> 53:01.920
works for Canonical on the server side or the cloud side who uses OS 10,

53:01.920 --> 53:05.200
but it's their laptop. It's their choice. They can do whatever they want with it

53:05.200 --> 53:10.560
so long as they get the job done. Personally, I can see why people have

53:10.560 --> 53:15.840
this need to point out that if you're an ambassador of a distro or an

53:15.840 --> 53:19.840
ambassador of a product, it makes sense for you to use it. You would never see

53:20.480 --> 53:25.680
someone who works for Coke on stage drinking Pepsi. It's no different than

53:25.680 --> 53:32.960
that, really. But if your role is in PR, you're making a massive faux pas by

53:32.960 --> 53:38.240
doing that Coke Pepsi thing. But if that's not your job, if your job is

53:38.240 --> 53:41.440
working on something that's completely unrelated to the Linux desktop and is

53:41.440 --> 53:45.440
like a server component or an application that runs on a server, then

53:47.520 --> 53:52.320
all bets are off. It's up to you what you run on it. So I think it's a little

53:52.320 --> 53:58.640
ridiculous that people go hunting down people who are running something other

53:58.640 --> 54:02.560
than the thing they want to run, right? And these same people are the people

54:02.560 --> 54:06.320
who will reboot into Windows in order to run Steam and they're allowed to do

54:06.320 --> 54:09.520
it, but you're not. And I don't like that attitude.

54:09.520 --> 54:13.520
That's a good point too. Yeah, I think my wrapping thoughts are really around

54:13.520 --> 54:18.800
this whole thing is it just makes really good practical sense to stick with

54:18.800 --> 54:24.160
free and open source software. And it isn't necessarily worth like going to

54:24.160 --> 54:29.200
the pitchforks when somebody is talking about Linux from a Mac because there

54:29.200 --> 54:32.800
were other presenters that were using, I don't even know what kind of hardware

54:32.800 --> 54:38.240
it was. It was ARM-based eclectic self-built small batch computers that

54:38.240 --> 54:43.040
were like you had wires running to an HDMI port. And I didn't see a Reddit

54:43.040 --> 54:48.720
thread started about that, but those are running Linux. So it's I think

54:49.440 --> 54:53.360
important to keep in mind that you want to have an informed opinion,

54:54.160 --> 54:58.080
especially if you're going to have a strong one. I have a strong preference,

54:58.080 --> 55:03.600
for example, for iOS over Android. Not a big fan of it. Just think iOS is

55:03.600 --> 55:08.080
slightly better. Think Android slightly worse. I think there's also serious

55:08.080 --> 55:12.320
privacy trade-offs with Android versus iOS. That's a position I'm perfectly

55:12.320 --> 55:17.040
comfortable defending because I've owned an Android device. I still own

55:17.040 --> 55:21.120
Android devices. I've bought many many Android devices. I know how to use

55:21.120 --> 55:26.160
Android very well. I'm a very competent Android user. So my preference for

55:26.160 --> 55:32.480
iOS is based on my direct experience using Android. I feel like that's a good

55:32.480 --> 55:37.200
thing because at least you know I've tried it. I'm not sitting here espousing

55:37.200 --> 55:42.000
how great Siri is without trying the Echo. I'm not telling you that I think

55:42.000 --> 55:45.840
iOS is better without ever trying an Android device. That would make me an

55:45.840 --> 55:50.080
idiot. It's important that we don't lose sight, that we can't just white watch

55:50.080 --> 55:53.280
the world and have everyone on Chromebooks or everyone on a Linux

55:53.280 --> 55:58.160
desktop and pretend like Windows and Macs don't exist. Because the reality is

55:58.160 --> 56:02.240
they do exist. So we have to know how to interact with them. We have to know how

56:02.240 --> 56:05.520
to support them. And we have to know where we're deficient so we can make up

56:05.520 --> 56:08.880
our deficiencies. And when you're committing, when you're trying to

56:08.880 --> 56:12.640
convince someone to switch over to a free or open source software product,

56:12.640 --> 56:16.160
and if it has deficiencies, if it does not have equivalent functionality to the

56:16.160 --> 56:19.840
proprietary thing you're switching them to, you're going to lose credibility if

56:19.840 --> 56:22.880
you don't tell people that. If they get over and then they discover, it's going

56:22.880 --> 56:25.440
to leave a bad taste in their mouth and it's probably going to push them back

56:25.440 --> 56:28.080
into the arms of commercial software harder and probably forever.

56:28.080 --> 56:32.960
Exactly. Yeah, right. And it's the wrong perspective. Especially if you're

56:32.960 --> 56:37.520
trying to convince someone, the nice thing to do is have a conversation. So

56:37.520 --> 56:41.280
maybe we can have a conversation about this topic as like, why did we not see

56:41.280 --> 56:45.360
more Linux laptops in presentations? And instead of being antagonistic or

56:45.360 --> 56:47.760
an interrogation, it can be a conversation. And if you start from the

56:47.760 --> 56:50.880
place of, hey, what are your workflows? I'm curious if maybe Linux could do

56:50.880 --> 56:54.480
those better instead of, or just try to understand why they think a Mac works

56:54.480 --> 56:57.840
well from them. That's very different. Is it a projector thing? Is it a slide

56:57.840 --> 57:01.520
software thing? What is it? What are we not, what are we not proficient enough

57:01.520 --> 57:05.760
in? We don't know. We don't know. It's a great point, Wes. Okay. So Tyler,

57:05.760 --> 57:08.880
if you're at the mic, I'd love to hear how self went about maybe, do you

57:08.880 --> 57:12.800
know about how many people were there? Yeah, I couldn't give an exact number,

57:12.800 --> 57:16.960
but definitely a healthy crowd. Pretty much filled the room during the keynote

57:16.960 --> 57:21.680
talk that Jeremy gave. And that was a good talk going over the last 10 years

57:21.680 --> 57:27.280
itself. He had plenty of funny anecdotes, especially stories about, including a

57:27.280 --> 57:30.400
story about a wedding that went on one of the years that they had the

57:30.400 --> 57:37.200
conference at a hotel. That's great. And was there a fair amount of vendors?

57:37.200 --> 57:42.000
From what I understand, there were fewer than there was last year from what I

57:42.000 --> 57:46.880
was told. And I think that's probably due to the overlapping in schedules with

57:46.880 --> 57:50.960
the conferences like Texas Linux Fest. So he didn't want to step on too many

57:50.960 --> 57:55.200
toes on that one. Yeah, I think that costs Texas Linux Fest a few vendors as

57:55.200 --> 57:58.080
well. And that really, I think the reason why it was going down at the same time

57:58.080 --> 58:01.600
came down to like venue scheduling or something really benign that ends up

58:01.600 --> 58:04.320
just totally being like, what was everybody thinking? It's really kind of

58:04.320 --> 58:10.160
a shame. So now do you regret skipping Linux Fest Northwest or do you think it

58:10.160 --> 58:12.880
was good to balance it out this week or this year? I think it was definitely

58:12.880 --> 58:18.000
good to balance it out this year. But having experienced both now, I am

58:18.000 --> 58:22.800
definitely returning to Self next year. Really? Yeah. Okay. Good plug for Self.

58:22.800 --> 58:27.760
Very nice. Maybe I'll go. So Mr. Popey, how was Floss Talk? A good get together

58:27.760 --> 58:32.880
of Linux podcasters drinking beer in a small, intimate venue. Must've been fun.

58:32.880 --> 58:37.600
Yes. Actually, it's Foss Talk. Oh yeah, thank you. Yeah. Foss Talk Live. It's

58:37.600 --> 58:43.040
organized by the internet's Joe Ressington. And this is a third one, I think.

58:44.640 --> 58:50.320
We went along as in the people who run Ubuntu podcast, Joe and the guys from

58:50.320 --> 58:55.440
Late Light Linux, and there's the guys from Linux Voice go along. And also

58:55.440 --> 58:58.240
there's a drunken mashup show at the end of the evening, which is variable

58:58.240 --> 59:01.200
quality, but was excellent this year, much better than they've redeemed

59:01.200 --> 59:06.640
themselves from last year. And there's a podcast recording then a break and

59:06.640 --> 59:09.680
a podcast recording then a break. So everyone gets to clear out and go and

59:09.680 --> 59:15.520
get another beer and then come back down into the very small cozy basement

59:15.520 --> 59:20.160
where we record the shows. And it's very intimate. There's some familiar faces

59:20.160 --> 59:25.120
that turn up in the audience and also some new people each time. It's lovely.

59:25.120 --> 59:29.360
It's really, really good fun. It's a really nice way to just have an evening

59:29.360 --> 59:32.800
out with some friends and record some silly podcasts. It's good fun.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.600
Yes, that does sound like good fun. And yes, Floss Talk, of course, is

59:35.600 --> 59:40.400
Randall Schwartz's show that I get stuck in my head because my brain does

59:40.400 --> 59:44.400
not have enough room for words. Now, I know that Joe's already put out

59:44.400 --> 59:49.520
his Late Night Linux of the talk there, and it was good. I won't lie.

59:49.520 --> 59:54.480
It made me a little bummed because the topics they chose were all the guys

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.000
had very, I thought, clear analysis of challenges facing Linux. And it

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.040
actually kind of motivated me to kind of want to try to fix it. Some of the

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.640
things they talked about around marketing and all of that. So anyways,

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.760
their episode was out. I'm assuming an Ubuntu podcast must be coming soon.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.360
Yep. Ours will go out at 3pm UK time on Thursday. We were on immediately

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:21.520
after them. They were our warm up act. And we were a lot more upbeat, I think.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.440
You bring the mood up? Good. I should have known.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.080
We lifted the mood a little bit. So yeah, look out for that on our website on

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:28.560
Thursday.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.040
I should have stacked them. That would have been better to stack them in my

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.200
podcast player if I had known because I was like, oh, all right, we can fix

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.160
this. It was kind of motivating, though. So it was good. I'm really glad that

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.920
that happened. One of these days, although they're at Texas Linux Fest,

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.360
there were several people saying, go to Fosdom, go to Fosdom, go to Fosdom.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.400
That's the thing to go to. So that may be in my future as well.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.960
Yes, go to Fosdom. It's amazing.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.280
So this must be your first US Fest, Alex.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.800
First time I've been to anything outside Europe, yeah. But Fosdom,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.080
you should definitely go to Fosdom.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.480
All right. There you go. Another plug for Fosdom. It might just happen.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.000
I'll go with you. You and I will both go, Wes. We'll go over there. We'll do

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.040
like a Wes and Chris tour of London.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.520
Or Storm Europe.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.440
So start drinking your water now because we're probably going to be

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.640
drinking a lot of beer. Yeah. Wes and Chris, Storm Europe.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.360
Fosdom's in Brussels, so you get great beer and great waffles.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.720
Ooh. Oh my, oh my.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.640
Yep. So I'll be fasting pretty soon to make up for the tons and tons and tons of eating

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.360
because there has just been... I mean, what else are you going to do when you're in Texas?

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.840
Yeah. I think you're 90% barbecue. Did you manage to steal any recipes to sneak back

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.120
up here to the Pacific Northwest?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.440
I tried to bring back a few samples so that we could study them and then derive.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.840
Yeah. But somehow it all got eaten. I don't know what happened.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.480
It's some mysterious thing. Oh, Levi.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.800
I think the secret's in the cows, Wes. That's what I think it is.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.400
Oh. The secret's in the cows.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.680
Actually, speaking of secrets though, after our really great barbecue that we had at Terry Black's

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.800
barbecue, we got to tour where they cook it all.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.440
No way.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.120
It's like behind the restaurant. Yeah. We just casually asked and they're like,

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.760
yeah, man, come on in. Mind you, it was like 98 degrees outside

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.160
and a humidity of like 80% or something.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:29.200
And so you go inside this barbecue pit, which is like a large greenhouse,

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.000
almost only it's full of barbecue cookers, temperature shoots up to like 110 degrees.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.960
It's dry heat, but it's just incredibly hot in there where they were smoking tomorrow's meat.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.040
And the guy works in there in that Texas heat all day long.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.800
And when you step out, when you step back outside, it feels like you're stepping into

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.440
air conditioning because the temperature is so hot in there.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.280
So I did try to grok a few secrets. They converted old propane tanks,

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.440
like big propane tanks, like on the side of a house.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.640
They converted big propane tanks into barbecue tanks.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.440
Really?

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.720
Yeah. Yeah. It was a good time. It was a really good time.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.120
And I'm going to have to do it again.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.280
So let's talk about our app pick this week, and then we're going to wrap this sucker up.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.200
It's FERP, F-R-P, a fast reversible proxy.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.160
And I like the way they described this, Wes, because it will help you do one of two things.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:25.760
It'll expose any HTTP and HTTPS service behind a NAT, or number two, expose any TCP or UDP service

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.800
behind a NAT, which would seem to include HTTP.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.120
So what is FERP, Wes, and how is it doing it?

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:38.560
It is a fast reverse proxy, and it's a Go application that's got just pretty simple

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.720
I and I based command file.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.520
You run one instance on some server with a public IP address.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.320
So I've got one up on our dear friends digital ocean, and then you connect to it.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.920
It also has a client program.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.440
Both of them have a configuration file.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.880
The server just sort of like sets up, opens its port for clients to connect to.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.840
There is token based authentication if you have security in mind, and you probably should.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.280
Then you configure your client and sort of configure on the client side,

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.000
what services you want to export.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.760
You then get that running with that client config, connects up to the server,

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.880
and then they do a little magic mumbo jumbo talking to each other.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.720
Then your services are, that's it, your services are exposed.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.560
You can reach them from the public internet.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.840
It does the reverse proxy back to whatever computer is behind the NAT.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.800
It doesn't really have to care.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.720
You don't have to open anything on your firewall as long as the client can reach out.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.040
And then the stateful firewall does its job and lets the server talk back through.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.080
You're good to go.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.360
That's pretty cool.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.760
And I could think of all kinds of fun ways to use and abuse that.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.920
The other nice thing is it's also got a dashboard that comes with it, and the dashboard's pretty,

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.080
it's a little more full feature than I really expected it to be,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.400
especially for something that is probably just thrown together.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.760
So there is a link that'll exist at least for a little while in the IRC room.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.240
You can go check it out.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.120
The password's admin.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.480
The username is admin.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.000
Just yeah, simple little view.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.440
It shows you all the proxies that you've set up so you can get a good idea of what's actually running,

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.960
if they're online or not.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.520
Cool.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.480
Plus it's Go, so it's just like a little, you know, it's a little static binary.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.960
They've got it for different architectures, whether you're on ARM or AMD or whatever else.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.680
Have you moused over one of these pie charts for the network traffic yet?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.440
Have you seen that little bounce effect that it does?

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.720
It's pretty cute.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.560
It's really neat, actually.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.240
I did not expect the dashboard part of this.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.520
That surprises me.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.360
Oh, this is really cool.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.120
And it's actually still responding even though myself and others in the chat room are banging

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.680
on it right now.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.880
Yeah, no, I haven't used this a ton.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.440
It just caught my eye this week, and I thought it would be neat.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.080
In other situations, you'd probably set up some sort of a version of it.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.760
A reverse or dedicated tunnel.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.480
But for, you know, if you're just moving around a lot, you don't really know what you need,

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.200
or you just need something for short term, this could be super handy.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.800
And I like how minimal the config is.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.080
So instead of having a generic VPN tunnel that you have to really carefully firewall,

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.760
you know with this program that you're really only setting up a few exported services,

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.840
and you can see them right there in your config.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.400
Absolutely.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.040
So that's pretty cool.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.280
Again, it's FERP, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.360
Slash 253.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.760
Mr. Payne, before we go, you should probably tell people where they can get a little more

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.800
West in their life.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.440
Oh, yeah.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.840
Well, one, techsnap.systems.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.800
Stay tuned.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.120
There'll be another one coming out sometime this week.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.040
Or if you're just impatient, I'm at West Payne over on the Twittersphere.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.000
Heyo, I'm at Chris LAS.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.040
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.480
I'll be down in Texas for about four more days, three more days or so.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.920
And then I'm starting the long journey back up to the Pacific Northwest.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.120
Man, do I miss those kids.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.560
I'm excited about getting home.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.480
I'm almost tempted just to fly home and see them.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.440
Aw.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.560
Leave Joob's behind.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.520
We all miss you, too.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:39.920
Don't worry.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.680
Go get more episodes at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.520
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.800
They're going to have their episode.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.640
And Joe put out Late Night Linux.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.000
So go grab more Linux content over there at our friend sites.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.720
And of course, join us next week live over at jblive.tv.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.320
We do this show on Tuesdays.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:07.920
And if we don't see you then, I'll see you on the download next Tuesday.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.400
Oh, and the boss is away, Wes.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.520
The bots will play.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.000
I thought J-Bot took the afternoon off, but it looks like the title page is actually loading.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.560
Oh, it is?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.040
Oh, good.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.920
I thought it was down, too.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.200
Yeah.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.880
Personalities happens not bad.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.840
That's pretty good.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.640
That's not perfect, but it's pretty, pretty good.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.200
It's close.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.600
Pretty good.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.240
Hey, Mumba Room.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:54.800
Thanks, guys.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.360
It's great to have some of you in there for the first time.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.000
You're welcome.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.280
You guys are the best.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.360
Where did you get FRP from?

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.160
This graph thing.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.760
Wes found that.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.600
Yeah, Wes found that this week.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.360
He is a sleuther, Popey.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:08.480
It's true.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.160
I don't actually quite remember where I saw it from.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.200
Kind of neat, huh?

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.480
Eric and I are wondering if we need to try Kansas City barbecue.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.160
Yeah, that's what everybody says.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.480
Although, man, do the people in Austin talk shit about Kansas City barbecue.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.680
You know what else they say is that you guys think it's good because you don't know any

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:27.920
better.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.640
That's what they say.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.520
That's what they say.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.480
Multiple people say.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.200
People tell me.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.000
People tell me, Tyler.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.480
People tell me.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.160
Don't they also BS about Carolina barbecue?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.960
Hey, look, I have tried all the barbecues on this trip.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:47.360
I've tried North Carolina, South Carolina, Memphis, Arkansas catfish barbecue, Texas

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:47.920
barbecue.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.360
And hell, if Texas barbecue didn't win, hands down.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.000
Yeah, only one got the life changing title.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.560
Only one.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.720
I didn't hear no memo in there.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:24.720
Does anybody want to visit Alabama?
