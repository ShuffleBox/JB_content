WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
Sometimes there's these news stories that come across

00:01.760 --> 00:03.180
and you're like, what is going on?

00:03.180 --> 00:04.920
Like, what must be happening behind the scenes

00:04.920 --> 00:06.660
to make this story a reality?

00:06.660 --> 00:11.660
So Microsoft is working on AMD GPU hot plugging

00:11.900 --> 00:16.900
for the Linux kernel, not AMD, but Microsoft.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.320
Yeah, I guess this is targeted at the data center.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.840
Microsoft said in a quote that,

00:22.840 --> 00:25.160
we believe the support of hot plug of GPU devices

00:25.160 --> 00:27.320
can open doors for many advanced applications

00:27.320 --> 00:29.680
in the data center for the next few years.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.280
So data center use, maybe for like,

00:32.280 --> 00:34.760
adding GPUs to virtual machines and then removing it?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.560
Yeah, Michael Larbo from Onyx kind of speculates

00:36.560 --> 00:38.960
that this is for Azure hot adding and removing

00:38.960 --> 00:41.500
of AMD accelerators for VMs, exactly.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.840
What a wild, wild world.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.800
And this, you know, wouldn't be possible

00:44.800 --> 00:47.460
unless AMD was contributing their code to the Linux kernel.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.960
And so now they get to benefit from the developers

00:49.960 --> 00:52.080
at Microsoft improving the capabilities

00:52.080 --> 00:53.620
of their hardware product.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.920
I mean, it's for their own interest, but.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.760
Well, on the flip side, right?

00:55.760 --> 00:58.000
Like Microsoft doesn't necessarily have to work directly

00:58.000 --> 01:00.120
with AMD, as long as they can get it reviewed

01:00.120 --> 01:02.000
and accepted upstream of the kernel,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.160
no one's stopping them.

01:03.160 --> 01:08.160
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.800
My name is Chris.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.720
My name is Wes.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.600
My name is Brent.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.520
And my name is Alex.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.320
Hello guys.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.200
How great it is to be in the same room with you.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.160
Coming up on the show today,

01:23.160 --> 01:26.400
we just got back from our big East Coast meetup.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.040
We've got some great stories,

01:28.040 --> 01:30.740
some observations about our fellow Linux users,

01:30.740 --> 01:31.580
and a lot more.

01:31.580 --> 01:32.880
Plus we're going to round it out with some boosts,

01:32.880 --> 01:35.340
some picks, and much, much more.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.940
I would normally introduce the lug right here,

01:36.940 --> 01:39.280
but we had technical issues because we're on live location.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.500
So we're not going to have a virtual lug today.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
I apologize ahead of time.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.400
It's heartbreaking.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.680
Wes stayed up all night,

01:46.680 --> 01:49.580
creating some sort of great, powerful contraption

01:49.580 --> 01:50.420
to make this happen.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.120
But unfortunately I came in here this morning

01:53.120 --> 01:55.380
and I tore it all down, didn't know what it was.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.320
And so we just don't have a mumbling.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.560
Well, it had become sentient.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.360
So I think that was the responsible move.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.960
Yeah, it was a tough choice, but the show must go on.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.320
But we do have so much to get to,

02:03.320 --> 02:05.140
and you're going to hear from a ton of audience members

02:05.140 --> 02:07.000
anyways that perhaps it's okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.160
I hope so.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.200
We're all hanging out here at Alex's house today.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.040
It's pretty great.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.280
So thanks for hosting us, Alex.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.120
You're very welcome.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.060
That is until my neighbor starts shoveling gravel

02:15.060 --> 02:15.900
from his truck.

02:15.900 --> 02:16.940
Well, it is a nice day out.

02:16.940 --> 02:19.120
So, you know, we've got to get yard work done.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.040
That is the only thing.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.900
But I've been here since Thursday.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.520
Brent, I think you've been here since Thursday.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.640
Do we all come in on Thursday?

02:25.640 --> 02:26.600
No, you came in on Wednesday.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.520
Yeah, I came in on Wednesday.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.480
Yeah, yeah.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.360
I did come in on Wednesday,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.480
but I stayed at a hotel the first night

02:31.480 --> 02:33.240
just because we came in so late.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.640
But it was Thursday that the team really assembled.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.320
Yeah, yeah.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.640
So yeah, I came in, I decided,

02:39.640 --> 02:41.680
wouldn't it be nice not to do like a red-eye flight,

02:41.680 --> 02:43.620
to just do like a midday flight?

02:43.620 --> 02:44.460
How reasonable.

02:44.460 --> 02:47.460
So in the Pacific Northwest, we flew out like 3 p.m.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.680
on Wednesday last week.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.480
And then we landed in Raleigh around 11.50 midnight.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.360
And we didn't want to like wake Alex and his wife

02:58.360 --> 02:59.200
and the baby up.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.080
And we thought, we'll just land and do one of those

03:01.080 --> 03:03.200
like right next to the airport hotels.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.600
Just, you know, wham bam, quick and easy.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.760
Yeah.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.520
So we roll up to this place called a Microtel.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.920
They call it a Microtel.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.600
Which is like, really guys, what are we doing?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.840
It's just like a cheap crappy hotel

03:17.840 --> 03:19.440
that's been refurbed three times.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.480
That's like a step above a nanotel though.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.060
It's better than a nanotel.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.280
So we go in there.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.120
And as I'm opening the door, this guy rushes past me.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.440
And he's like in a panic.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.000
And he just like kind of brushes us out of the way.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.880
And you know, we got our luggage and everything.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.480
So we're kind of like taking up some space.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.760
And he like kind of slams in past us.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.140
Doesn't speak a lick of English.

03:39.140 --> 03:43.000
So he takes forever to get his room booked.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.640
Even like leaves for part of it.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.960
And then the guy tries to like book us.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.040
And then he comes back and he's even more in a panic.

03:48.040 --> 03:51.480
And anyways, so then I'm like, that's not a great sign,

03:51.480 --> 03:54.320
right, but we're starving and we're tired.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.160
So I figured.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.600
Get to your room, get some food, go to bed.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.680
Yeah, let's just get this over with.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.260
I'm excited about getting over to Alex's.

04:00.260 --> 04:01.840
That's gonna be a lot nicer.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.020
Let's just do this.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.400
So I reinstalled the damn Uber Eats app on my phone,

04:05.400 --> 04:08.500
which I just deleted because I was swearing off Uber Eats,

04:08.500 --> 04:10.720
right, because it's so crappy usually.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.240
But I figured, you know, the wife's hungry.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.160
She's got diabetes.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.340
She's got the low blood sugars.

04:14.340 --> 04:15.780
I'm gonna take care of the situation.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.440
Oh, look, the only thing nearby is a McDonald's

04:17.440 --> 04:19.360
for a $4 freaking delivery charge.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.460
Okay, fine, fine, it's 1 a.m., right?

04:23.460 --> 04:24.840
So the moment we get the room,

04:24.840 --> 04:26.180
like the moment we get the room number,

04:26.180 --> 04:28.800
I place this order on Uber Eats, right?

04:28.800 --> 04:32.280
And I'm a little kind of apprehensive about doing this

04:32.280 --> 04:33.840
because I'm like committing to be in this place

04:33.840 --> 04:35.200
for an hour, at least if I do this.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.140
And I'm not sure this is the hotel we want to be in

04:37.140 --> 04:39.600
because my initial impressions is maybe like

04:39.600 --> 04:41.520
they're cooking something in the lobby,

04:41.520 --> 04:43.600
but I don't see anything being cooked.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.280
But it sure smells like something's being cooked.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.240
But I think to myself, maybe in the back room,

04:48.240 --> 04:49.720
like I made himself a meal, you know,

04:49.720 --> 04:50.900
just ran the microwave.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.040
What kind of smells are we talking about here?

04:53.040 --> 04:53.880
Ethnic?

04:53.880 --> 04:58.880
That's it, like all I can say is like smells of food,

04:59.120 --> 05:01.200
clearly food, but not food I could identify.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.740
I couldn't like, it were all like meals

05:03.740 --> 05:05.760
I've never personally eaten, but I'm like,

05:05.760 --> 05:06.780
oh, that's what food smells like.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.220
Strong, unknown food.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.680
Yeah, very strong.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.320
But you know, the lobby, maybe they have a kitchen, right?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.440
I don't know.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.400
So after we get all checked in,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.920
after I place my order, we get in the elevator

05:17.920 --> 05:21.280
and the elevator smells like burnt rubber, real bad.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.120
And what do you think about?

05:22.120 --> 05:24.400
Like you get in an elevator and it smells like burnt rubber.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.560
Doesn't sound like what you want.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.080
You're thinking maybe like the tracks are bad,

05:28.080 --> 05:29.780
like the little wheels it might have are bad.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.660
If there's one vehicle you would really rather

05:31.660 --> 05:33.800
didn't smell at all, it would be a Lyft.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.840
Yeah, right, right?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.160
And okay, so we get up to the second floor

05:37.160 --> 05:41.280
and we step out and it's a whole new set of food smells.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.880
Totally separate, totally different.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.640
Maybe that's like a part of their brand, you know,

05:45.640 --> 05:47.280
you get like a themed smell per floor.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.520
Right, and then as you walk down this floor, second floor,

05:51.520 --> 05:53.780
you walk through different zones of stink.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.280
And I would actually probably describe it as stench.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.800
And you would think that every single hotel room

05:58.800 --> 05:59.980
had a kitchenette where they were making

05:59.980 --> 06:01.560
their own individual meals,

06:01.560 --> 06:05.280
although there are no kitchenettes in this entire hotel.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.720
And it's like probably three or four different phases

06:07.720 --> 06:09.880
of smell as we go to the very end of this hallway.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.200
Cause of course you're walking down this torturous stench.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.520
And of course our rooms at the very end of the hallway.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.680
So you gotta walk past all of the stench.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.020
My wife described it as a bouquet of stench.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.960
So then you get to the door, you open the door up

06:21.960 --> 06:24.600
and boom, you're hit with a totally different smell.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.080
Oh, you finally learned what your rooms customs smell is.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.560
And it's been sitting all day

06:30.560 --> 06:32.080
and it was a humid day in Raleigh.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.600
So it is moist in our bedroom, right?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.960
And we're from the Pacific Northwest

06:35.960 --> 06:37.200
where you don't really have that kind of like

06:37.200 --> 06:38.240
hanging humidity.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.900
And so like, it smells horrible.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.240
We are damp, it's 1 a.m.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.880
And I'm already on my second Uber Eats driver.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.760
Like the first Uber Eats driver is already noped out.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.600
And I'm on my second Uber,

06:48.600 --> 06:49.640
I'm looking at the tracking screen,

06:49.640 --> 06:51.120
like where's my damn burger, right?

06:51.120 --> 06:54.000
So we look at the bed, we pull back the sheet,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.200
the cover, you know, there's like a big liquid stain

06:58.200 --> 07:00.880
and then like hair on the stain.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.920
And then it's just sort of like artfully placed

07:03.920 --> 07:06.200
at the tip of the stain, a cigarette hole.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.400
Like I'm serious, I'm so serious right now.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.840
Did you take a picture for Instagram?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.760
I did not because I was in a bad place at this time.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.240
I just wanted to eat.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.320
So we're sitting there on the bed,

07:16.320 --> 07:17.720
kind of like huddling together,

07:17.720 --> 07:20.360
like on one edge of the bed on this like queen mattress

07:20.360 --> 07:21.520
or whatever because like the other one's

07:21.520 --> 07:23.560
just completely like a no-go zone now.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.320
And this second Uber Eats driver just like nopes out.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.180
And I'm like, two Uber Eats drivers have noped out.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.880
We got a third one at this point.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.440
I'm like, okay, well, what's going on?

07:32.440 --> 07:33.800
This driver has been sitting at McDonald's

07:33.800 --> 07:35.260
for like 45 minutes.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.600
It's almost 2 a.m.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.320
My wife's got, you know, low blood sugar.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.340
I'm trying to get her fed.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.920
Like let's figure out what's going on here.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.260
So I text this guy and say, you know,

07:43.260 --> 07:44.560
everything okay?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.400
I send him the text message.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.380
Two seconds later, food's on the way.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.040
The guy's driving, right?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.440
Doesn't text anything back.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.600
Shows up at the old hotel.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.520
Drops it off at our door.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.400
Doesn't knock on the door.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.800
Then sends me a text message saying,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.880
your food's been gently placed by your door.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.000
So I open it up.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.360
It's somebody else's order.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.240
It's not my order.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.060
Oh no.

08:05.060 --> 08:05.900
It's not my food.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.560
It's a totally different set of food.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.580
It's all cold.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.400
It's all totally cold.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.160
Like to the touch cold, right?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.280
And then, so I'm like,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.960
I slammed down some really bad burger

08:16.960 --> 08:17.800
because I'm starving.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.880
My wife slams down some really cold fries

08:19.880 --> 08:22.240
because her meal wasn't even in there.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.920
And then I go to bed, right?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.300
But I've picked a place close to the airport.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.560
So it's like legitimately in the path of the takeoff.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.880
So as the planes take off,

08:30.880 --> 08:32.400
they are flying over my room.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.800
I got a nice view of the plane taking off.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.640
And that's fine.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.660
I started to get used to that,

08:36.660 --> 08:40.480
but around 4.30 a.m. or so,

08:40.480 --> 08:42.600
a plane came in for like a hard landing

08:42.600 --> 08:43.440
and I swear to God,

08:43.440 --> 08:44.480
I thought they were gonna hit the building.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.880
It was shaking the bed.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.540
I thought we were gonna die.

08:47.540 --> 08:48.380
It was rough.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.640
So I didn't sleep so good that night.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.600
So it's really nice to be over here at Alex's.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.600
Maybe you would have been better with the red eye.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.560
Yeah, I know, right?

08:57.560 --> 08:59.100
The moral of the story is,

08:59.100 --> 09:01.800
don't try to save money on a hotel room near the airport.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.040
We went for the cheapest.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.080
It was 90 bucks a night.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.920
This is not that cheap, but these days it is.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.520
You gotta remember, sleep is like a superpower.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.420
I know, it really is.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.060
It was a touch and go there for a little bit.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.200
So it's been nice.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.040
Alex has made us,

09:15.040 --> 09:18.120
it's like at Alex's bed and breakfast here, you know?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.960
So we got rooms, we got a kitchen.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.760
You know, we should charge 90 bucks a night on Airbnb.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.600
You could.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.280
I think, I feel like you could actually.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.320
And you got the cute dog,

09:27.320 --> 09:28.360
so people are gonna wanna stay.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.200
That's true.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.040
Oh yeah, yeah.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.360
With Airbnb, it would be a dog fee, $9,000.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.200
Right. Exactly.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.400
Now I know, so my,

09:35.400 --> 09:38.020
like a lot of my bumpiness was after the flight,

09:38.020 --> 09:39.320
like my flight and stuff,

09:39.320 --> 09:40.760
that all went smooth, obviously,

09:40.760 --> 09:41.700
cause I'm not complaining about it.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.480
But Brent, didn't you end up in some sort of weird,

09:44.480 --> 09:45.580
like multi-flight situation?

09:45.580 --> 09:46.460
I know Wes did too.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.660
So how was your trip in?

09:47.660 --> 09:48.600
Actually, surprisingly,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.180
usually I have a really great story to tell,

09:50.180 --> 09:52.400
but this time it was really bland and boring.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.240
That's good.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.640
Which I think is what you're looking for

09:54.640 --> 09:55.760
in terms of flights.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.920
So I, the only thing I went wrong

09:57.920 --> 10:00.300
was I spilled my Thai food under my seat

10:00.300 --> 10:03.520
after they forced me to put my luggage up on the rack

10:03.520 --> 10:04.360
instead of down there.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.520
So I was a little.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.480
Pad Thai down.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.440
Yeah, Pad Thai down.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.280
That's too bad.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.680
And that went quite well.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.800
And Wes?

10:10.800 --> 10:12.580
I did take the red eye path this time,

10:12.580 --> 10:13.480
just figuring, you know,

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
I'd seen your flight

10:14.480 --> 10:15.800
and you were gonna get in pretty late.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.680
I thought, okay, I'm still young enough, right?

10:18.680 --> 10:19.680
I can handle a red eye.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.500
I sleep. I love it.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.340
It's about age.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.880
I sleep decently most of the time.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.720
I feel lucky in that regard.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.220
And yeah, that part of it went just fine.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.920
But, you know, as I land on the ground,

10:30.920 --> 10:33.520
I had a layover in JFK.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.120
As I land kind of groggy,

10:35.120 --> 10:36.040
it's like five in the morning,

10:36.040 --> 10:36.880
I'm waking up,

10:36.880 --> 10:39.920
reconnect to LTE and get my notifications.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.120
Your flight has been canceled.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.960
I was like, wait, what?

10:43.960 --> 10:45.400
Which flight?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.240
The flight of mud?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.140
No, that doesn't make sense.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.560
My next flight?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.120
I guess I'm in New York now.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.040
No, thankfully not.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.120
JetBlue had figured it out.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.320
So by the time, you know,

10:53.320 --> 10:54.400
by the time I'm off the plane,

10:54.400 --> 10:55.440
I didn't have to go talk to anyone.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.720
They'd already emailed me like an updated itinerary.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.640
The only catch was the,

10:59.640 --> 11:00.720
it added an extra flight.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.920
And the first stop I had to do

11:01.920 --> 11:04.560
was go from JFK up to Boston,

11:04.560 --> 11:06.640
which is a 38 minute flight.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.360
Oh, that's such a weird flight.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.160
And because they were kind of having to reschedule things

11:10.160 --> 11:11.240
after the cancellation,

11:11.240 --> 11:12.200
of course it was delayed,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
it took a while to get off,

11:13.200 --> 11:15.240
but we still arrived earlier than expected.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.460
So there was another plane already in our spot.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.280
So it was probably like an hour and a half

11:20.280 --> 11:23.320
or a two hour fare from like learning about it

11:23.320 --> 11:25.160
to actually getting to Boston

11:25.160 --> 11:26.980
for 40 minutes of air time.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.820
Wow.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.660
A 40 minute flight,

11:28.660 --> 11:29.840
it feels like you're gonna spend more time

11:29.840 --> 11:30.760
just getting on board,

11:30.760 --> 11:32.460
sitting on the tarmac and getting off.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.300
That was exactly it.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.120
Yeah.

11:34.120 --> 11:38.200
We were on the, we took Delta on the way out from Seattle

11:38.200 --> 11:40.080
and you sit down, right?

11:40.080 --> 11:44.080
And they're booting up all of the in seat displays and stuff.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.120
And I'm like, look, look, honey, this is Linux.

11:46.120 --> 11:46.960
Isn't that cool?

11:46.960 --> 11:48.120
These displays all run Linux.

11:48.120 --> 11:48.940
Oh yeah, that's neat.

11:48.940 --> 11:49.780
You know, that's cool.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.600
We're going on Linux event.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.440
We're on Linux airplane.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.440
Yeah, that's great.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.280
Then we're on the flight

11:53.280 --> 11:55.120
and the thing is so dog slow.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.520
She's like, so this is your Linux, huh?

11:56.520 --> 11:57.340
This is great.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.180
This is.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.960
Probably like a two point something kernel still.

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
Yeah, oh man.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.600
Well, they're all doing like, they're doing like this weird

12:04.600 --> 12:06.160
like shared display when they can.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.560
I'd be really curious how this works

12:07.560 --> 12:08.400
if anybody out there knows,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.680
but like when you use the flight tracker,

12:10.680 --> 12:12.880
all of the displays on the flight tracker screen

12:12.880 --> 12:14.600
are all updating at the same time.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.720
They're all in sync.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.320
So is it one video feed

12:18.320 --> 12:20.040
or are they actually running instances

12:20.040 --> 12:21.880
of that flight tracker at, you know,

12:21.880 --> 12:23.480
whatever amount of seats that are running it

12:23.480 --> 12:25.920
and somehow they're still staying in sync.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.160
I don't know, but it was a two core Linux system

12:28.160 --> 12:30.640
cause it had two of the tuxes at the top of the screen.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.280
Oh, I know, right?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.760
I love walking through the airport

12:34.760 --> 12:37.120
and like trying to observe like what devices people

12:37.120 --> 12:39.080
are using, if they're using Bluetooth,

12:39.080 --> 12:42.520
if they're using an Apple product or an Android product.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.080
Saw a lot of laptops,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.040
a lot of people using laptops in the airport.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.840
Did you try any new tech on this trip?

12:47.840 --> 12:50.000
Hmm, no, but it is the first time

12:50.000 --> 12:51.980
I've used the Plex downloads feature

12:51.980 --> 12:54.880
since they've introduced the Plex sync versus Plex downloads

12:54.880 --> 12:57.080
and I don't really see a much difference.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.920
It's kind of wonky because it recreates

12:59.920 --> 13:02.320
the directory structure of your online server.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.720
So because I pulled it down from two different servers,

13:04.720 --> 13:07.160
I had two different like libraries I had to manage

13:07.160 --> 13:09.080
instead of just all my downloaded videos,

13:09.080 --> 13:09.960
but it worked nice.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.540
We got the new season of The Expanse

13:12.540 --> 13:15.280
and also Enterprise, season one.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.120
And the nice thing is, is you can just say,

13:17.120 --> 13:19.120
just sync down the stuff I haven't watched yet.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.040
Hmm, that's killer.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.940
And now the thing will be is how well does it do

13:21.940 --> 13:23.160
syncing back what we watched?

13:23.160 --> 13:24.560
So then when I go back to my,

13:24.560 --> 13:26.520
are you starting fresh?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.560
We'll see, we'll see, but that was nice.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
But I think that was the only new tech

13:29.560 --> 13:31.960
did either one of you guys do anything new tech wise

13:31.960 --> 13:32.800
for this trip?

13:32.800 --> 13:33.620
Oh, you did.

13:33.620 --> 13:34.880
Yeah, I picked up some of those

13:34.880 --> 13:37.000
Sony noise canceling headphones

13:37.000 --> 13:38.240
and I haven't really had a good pair

13:38.240 --> 13:40.160
of active noise canceling headphones before.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.160
So that was sort of my trial run on the flight this time.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.400
And it was nice, I think especially

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
because I was taking a red eye,

13:45.400 --> 13:47.400
you know, just let me tune things out.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.280
That extra flight from Boston too, it started off,

13:49.280 --> 13:50.640
I was right at the very back,

13:50.640 --> 13:52.480
like the last row of the plane.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.160
And there was a pretty loud mechanical noise

13:54.160 --> 13:56.120
like until it really got to cruising speed.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.840
So that was handy.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.640
And thankfully I hadn't really even,

13:59.640 --> 14:00.480
this was sort of a last minute,

14:00.480 --> 14:01.560
like, oh yeah, I'm flying,

14:01.560 --> 14:02.640
I really need some new headphones.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.160
Let's just get it, pull the trigger.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.360
Hadn't tested it, but it works beautifully with PipeWire.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.840
Ah, that's great.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.560
You didn't do any new tech for you, Brent?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.820
Or did you have it all dialed in?

14:12.820 --> 14:15.280
I tend to not wanna try new things

14:15.280 --> 14:17.160
because you know, if it's gonna fail,

14:17.160 --> 14:18.000
it'll be when you need it the most.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.920
Look at this guy, the reasonable one over here.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.660
I was tempted to move to a new phone.

14:22.660 --> 14:25.700
As you know, my sort of tried and true phone

14:25.700 --> 14:26.540
is about to explode.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.300
The battery is about twice the thickness

14:28.300 --> 14:29.200
that it should be, so.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.040
Legitimately, I keep telling him it's a fire hazard.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.160
We just think it's definitely a fire hazard.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.240
So about like three days before the trip,

14:36.240 --> 14:37.580
I thought, oh, I gotta change.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.480
I can't bring this thing.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.700
This is just a hazard to everybody.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.440
And, but I never got there

14:43.440 --> 14:45.440
because the other phone I was gonna switch to

14:45.440 --> 14:47.360
doesn't have an audio jack and.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.400
Oh, the audio headphone jack.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.040
Yeah, I got one of those little dongles,

14:51.040 --> 14:53.760
but it was a cheap one like from the grocery store.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.680
It was like the day before I was leaving,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.160
so I couldn't order anything reasonable.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.800
And it sounded awful, so I didn't even bring it.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.520
Well, you know, when you got a phone

15:02.520 --> 15:04.400
where the battery is grown outside the case,

15:04.400 --> 15:05.720
where it's popped the back of the case off,

15:05.720 --> 15:06.940
I'd probably say the best thing to do

15:06.940 --> 15:08.240
would be taking it up on an airplane.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.080
That's probably.

15:09.080 --> 15:09.900
Yeah.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.760
I like that his, you know, audio snobbery too,

15:11.760 --> 15:14.160
is he's willing to put his own personal self at risk

15:14.160 --> 15:15.000
just for that.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, cause you know, you put it in your pocket, right?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.300
You know what's near your pocket, right?

15:17.300 --> 15:18.140
Like.

15:18.140 --> 15:18.960
Yeah, it's nice and warm.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.800
I like it.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.640
Oh, man.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.240
I guess as long as it's keeping you comfortable.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.080
Well, we have a lot to talk about today.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.520
We had a hell of a meetup yesterday

15:26.520 --> 15:28.400
and I tried to talk to people about

15:28.400 --> 15:30.280
what Linux stuff they're doing,

15:30.280 --> 15:31.960
what's not working for them with Linux,

15:31.960 --> 15:34.560
what is working for them, what distros they're using.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.880
And we try to get a flavor of who's out there.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.760
And I think we did a pretty decent job.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.680
You know, we always kind of evolve every meetup

15:40.680 --> 15:42.160
and try to learn and adapt.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.120
But before we get started today,

15:44.120 --> 15:45.600
I have kind of a special announcement

15:45.600 --> 15:46.640
I want to start the show with

15:46.640 --> 15:47.980
cause I'm very excited about this.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.480
And you guys know that we've been talking about

15:50.480 --> 15:52.160
the future of podcasting in general

15:52.160 --> 15:54.360
and JB shows in particular.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.280
And you know about how particular we are

15:57.280 --> 15:59.400
and how careful we are with the sponsors we pick.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.480
And so I'm super excited to welcome Bitwarden

16:02.480 --> 16:03.840
on board for Linux Unplugged.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.920
They're on board for a little bit

16:04.920 --> 16:07.100
and round of applause, right?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.840
Because we're all Bitwarden users in here.

16:08.840 --> 16:09.680
Yeah, we are.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.200
And I think it's just an absolute great sponsor.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.560
Now I'm not sure the landing page is live yet.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.480
So the background here is Bitwarden has really made an effort

16:17.480 --> 16:19.680
to support independent Linux content.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.240
And so this is all kind of getting set up right now.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.960
So bitwarden.com slash Linux is gonna be the landing page.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.820
If it's not live when you hear this,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.940
let them know maybe via support or some other way

16:30.940 --> 16:32.340
that that's how you heard about it.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.680
Because I'd love for them to stick around for a bit

16:34.680 --> 16:36.920
because I think this is a great sponsor for the show.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.520
So it's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.920
And you go there, you get started with a free trial

16:41.920 --> 16:43.200
for a team or enterprise account

16:43.200 --> 16:46.720
or for your personal account for an individual user as well.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.100
And it really is, Bitwarden is just the easiest way

16:49.100 --> 16:51.320
for businesses and individuals to store, share,

16:51.320 --> 16:53.440
and sync sensitive data.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.920
And it's not just passwords,

16:54.920 --> 16:56.200
although that's the primary use case

16:56.200 --> 16:57.200
I think a lot of us have for it.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.240
But you can also store your two factor authentication

17:00.240 --> 17:04.020
tokens in there, things like recovery passwords

17:04.020 --> 17:06.640
for maybe like element.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.600
And maybe your Bitwarden certificate

17:08.600 --> 17:10.320
is what I realized I should be putting in there.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
I use it to store secure notes.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.560
So I have like WireGuard configs in there too.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.720
Ah, that's a good idea.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.320
Yeah, the attachments feature is pretty darn convenient.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.440
Yeah, I like the idea of putting

17:19.440 --> 17:21.100
my WireGuard config in there.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.160
Yeah, so it's more than just passwords really,

17:23.160 --> 17:24.200
but that is what's great.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.700
And like the support for two factor authentication

17:26.700 --> 17:28.780
is so nice because if you use it on mobile,

17:28.780 --> 17:31.160
it really streamlines the whole process

17:31.160 --> 17:33.680
of good passwords on mobile.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.460
And I think that is really key.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.560
The other thing they have now is account switching support.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.460
How great is this?

17:39.460 --> 17:41.440
So it's super easy to switch between your personal

17:41.440 --> 17:44.020
and a business account or maybe a personal account

17:44.020 --> 17:46.160
and an open source project that you're working with.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.960
And one of the things that's given me confidence

17:47.960 --> 17:49.920
to use Bitwarden is that I know they have

17:49.920 --> 17:51.960
a self-hosted option available if I want it.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.320
I can get that up and running if I need to.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.120
I prefer to just get things up and going really fast

17:56.120 --> 17:57.840
with Bitwarden Cloud.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.760
I trust the security they have around that

17:59.760 --> 18:01.080
and it just got me going immediately

18:01.080 --> 18:03.040
and it made it super easy to share stuff.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.760
And the other nice thing is either route,

18:05.760 --> 18:07.920
they have a very large and active community

18:07.920 --> 18:09.600
in both their forums and on Reddit

18:09.600 --> 18:10.840
and really everywhere online.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.720
Bitwarden just has millions of users.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.400
So you get a lot of community support

18:15.400 --> 18:17.800
if that's the kind of route you prefer to go.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.600
A couple of years into using Bitwarden,

18:19.600 --> 18:22.000
I think what I've really learned to appreciate

18:22.000 --> 18:24.800
is how simple it makes bringing on team members.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.760
Like Alex, you have a way where you use it

18:26.760 --> 18:29.160
where you don't share all of your passwords with somebody,

18:29.160 --> 18:30.520
you just share a few of your passwords.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.360
That's right, yeah.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.920
So my wife and I, I created an organization

18:33.920 --> 18:36.040
and let's say there's a password to log into daycare

18:36.040 --> 18:38.360
to pay the daycare bill or something like that.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.960
We can both share that password

18:39.960 --> 18:41.840
as part of the KTZ organization

18:41.840 --> 18:44.920
that I've created in my Bitwarden kind of universe.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.080
And we both have access to those passwords,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.160
but it's on a need to know basis.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.240
Yeah, I like that.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.080
That's really nice.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.400
And I've been able to do that with team members

18:52.400 --> 18:54.160
when they come on or just like somebody

18:54.160 --> 18:55.920
who's working on a project for us.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.840
And it has made just keeping really good passwords

18:58.840 --> 19:01.080
and safe passwords straightforward and simple.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.500
And I think we all probably know this,

19:02.500 --> 19:05.240
but it's a good reminder that just a good password

19:05.240 --> 19:07.200
and good password hygiene is one of the few things

19:07.200 --> 19:10.360
you can really do to notably improve your online

19:10.360 --> 19:12.440
account security and your safety.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.280
You probably already knew that,

19:13.280 --> 19:16.360
but maybe somebody in your life needs to hear that.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.200
So send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.000
Go try it for yourself, for your business,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.680
and you'll support the show.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.680
It's a great way to get started.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.720
If you're an enterprise or if you're an individual user,

19:26.720 --> 19:29.480
you can go there and get a free trial

19:29.480 --> 19:31.360
at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.940
And it's free for an individual user.

19:32.940 --> 19:35.920
You may find you don't need the cloud service.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.320
I added it for the two factor support alone,

19:39.320 --> 19:42.080
but there's a lot you can get out of Bitwarden.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.120
Just go try it, go see it for yourself.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.720
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.640
And a big welcome aboard to Bitwarden

19:48.640 --> 19:49.640
for joining us on the show.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.600
It's just super, super great to get support like that,

19:52.600 --> 19:53.960
especially right now.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.040
And you can support the show

19:55.040 --> 19:58.000
by visiting bitwarden.com slash Linux.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.240
All right, let's talk about our meetup.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.560
I feel like there's a lot to talk about

20:00.560 --> 20:01.800
and it's an exciting time.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.640
I think we should,

20:02.640 --> 20:06.800
maybe we should start with like the behind the scenes moment.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.120
We did capture a little bit of like the sitting down

20:09.120 --> 20:11.120
at the kitchen table and us having a conversation

20:11.120 --> 20:13.860
before we left to the event to go like pick up food

20:13.860 --> 20:14.920
and do all the things we had to do

20:14.920 --> 20:16.200
before the event started.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.600
So I'll take you back to like two hours before showtime.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.400
We're sitting in Alex's kitchen.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.940
It's about 15 minutes before we got to leave for the meetup.

20:25.940 --> 20:28.560
Saturday morning on April 9th.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.520
We've been here for a couple of days.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.800
Yesterday was all about eating a lot of food.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.160
And today it's not like we're,

20:35.160 --> 20:36.960
we're not nervous or anxious,

20:36.960 --> 20:39.080
but there's just so many things we still have to pull off

20:39.080 --> 20:40.400
in the next two hours.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.620
I think we're just anticipating,

20:41.620 --> 20:43.480
we're just ready to get this thing started.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.720
But also, super exciting that it's Wes's birthday today.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.280
Happy birthday, Wes.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.120
Wes.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.560
Aw, thank you.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.440
I really can't imagine anything better than,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.600
I mean, being with the team in person.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.440
Happy birthday to you.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.120
With these amazing fools.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.480
I mean, what could really be better?

21:05.480 --> 21:06.720
And Alex's beautiful home,

21:06.720 --> 21:09.280
which he has been so gracious hosting us at.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.920
And yeah, you know, there's just been a lot of,

21:10.920 --> 21:13.160
a lot of excitement and work to get here.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.080
Alex scouting locations,

21:15.080 --> 21:16.920
actually being willing to host us

21:16.920 --> 21:19.760
and the community here in Raleigh.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.160
And then just the small details,

21:21.160 --> 21:23.120
things like rolling up t-shirts.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.640
Rolling up t-shirts seems to be like the key

21:25.640 --> 21:26.960
to a good event, doesn't it?

21:26.960 --> 21:28.800
Well, you gotta have all the little pieces in place

21:28.800 --> 21:30.660
so you're not distracted and you can actually, you know,

21:30.660 --> 21:31.760
do the thing we're excited about,

21:31.760 --> 21:34.580
which is interacting with our amazing audience.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.000
Alex, how's it been having the whole crew

21:37.000 --> 21:38.520
in your house, basically?

21:38.520 --> 21:39.600
It's been a lot of fun.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.720
I really, we're all just guests in Archie's house, my dog.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.920
You know, but you know, to celebrate Wes's birthday,

21:46.920 --> 21:50.000
Chris's iPhone just showed him a montage of past events

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
and 90% of the pictures were him and Wes recording audio.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.240
One of those pictures was a beer picture.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.840
So I think this afternoon at the brewery,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.940
perhaps we need to, we need to fix that ratio.

22:04.380 --> 22:05.320
We did do better.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.200
We did do better.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.640
I had a couple, I got a couple of ciders down the hatch.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.480
You got a beer too?

22:09.480 --> 22:10.520
Oh yes, I did.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.140
So that, that worked out pretty good.

22:12.140 --> 22:13.840
And even the line at the brewery was helpful

22:13.840 --> 22:16.440
because it was a bit chilly yesterday, let's be honest.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.080
And the brewery was nice and warm.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.480
Everybody was troopers because the standing temperature

22:21.480 --> 22:23.600
was like 55, 60 degrees.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.000
But then you bring in that, you know,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.260
15, 20 mile per hour wind chill and it was really cold.

22:29.260 --> 22:33.080
So after three or so hours, maybe three and a half,

22:33.080 --> 22:36.920
four hours, we actually got the whole crowd

22:36.920 --> 22:38.400
migrate to the brewery.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.360
I think that was some excellent foresight on Alex's part

22:40.360 --> 22:42.440
to pick a spot that had an adjacent brewery.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.680
Yeah, and a barbecue place.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.200
And you know, there was all types.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.800
So let's dig into that a little bit at this event.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.900
I think we all got a chance to at least see the deck

22:51.900 --> 22:53.000
floating around.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.120
Listener Jeff brought his steam deck to the event.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.720
And of course I had to go hands on.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.280
Yeah, I have a steam deck.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.600
I love it.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.040
It's been a lot of fun.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.280
I love it for being, picking it up and being able to play,

23:05.280 --> 23:08.120
you know, five, 10 minutes of a game and put it down

23:08.120 --> 23:10.600
and not have to worry about it.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.080
And have you tried anything else with it at all?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.720
Like poking around, exploring?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.560
Yeah, I haven't had a whole lot of time to do that.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.840
I did have this whole thing where

23:18.840 --> 23:21.280
I was going to run Ansible and get everything figured out.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.880
But with the Immutable OS, apparently

23:23.880 --> 23:25.120
Flatpak's the way to go.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.040
So I haven't exactly had a whole lot of time to play with it.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.060
I do have KDE Connect on it so I can move things back and forth.

23:31.060 --> 23:33.400
But that's about it.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.200
It does look nice, new, and shiny.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.240
Do you want to show Chris how it works?

23:38.240 --> 23:40.240
Sure.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.760
All right, OK.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.680
Oh, we've got a game going too already.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.560
Hades.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.380
Hades, and it looks good.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.920
Any tips or tricks for him?

23:48.920 --> 23:51.320
Kill the skeleton.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.720
I'm good at killing skeletons.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.640
But you know, of course, the first thing I want to do

23:54.640 --> 23:55.680
is I want to get on the desktop.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.360
How do you get on the desktop?

23:57.360 --> 23:58.480
Little trigger action or?

23:58.480 --> 24:04.160
Yeah, so you've got to go down to this one.

24:04.160 --> 24:10.160
Go down to power, A, and then desktop mode.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
Switch to desktop.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.360
All right, switching to desktop.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.480
I'm going to bust out the track pads here.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.480
Oh, it's kind of almost doing like a whole new loading thing.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.080
There we go.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.120
I got plasma.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.240
That's fun.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.040
That was easy.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.080
Yeah, they've got to return to gaming mode.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.120
They've got a virtual keyboard here.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.640
It felt pretty good in the hand too.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.640
You know, it felt pretty solid.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.040
What did you think weight-wise?

24:33.040 --> 24:34.320
Did you expect it to be heavier?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.320
I expected a denser, heavier thing.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.160
Yeah, me too.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.920
It was about as light as a.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.120
As a game, like a controller, like an Xbox controller.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.080
Yeah, like an Xbox controller.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.440
Like there wasn't a whole computer in there.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.160
Yeah, it's crazy.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.080
Yeah, I think the size would be more of the limiting factor,

24:46.080 --> 24:48.480
just for portability and really the weight.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.400
I thought the screen was great too.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.280
We were in direct sun for a few little bits outside.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.480
That's where it's going to be at its worst.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.520
And it was fine.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.960
Also, I mean, just I think this speaks to our audience.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.800
He didn't quite get there, but I love the idea

25:01.800 --> 25:03.920
of running Ansible on your gamepad.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.280
I know, I know.

25:05.280 --> 25:05.760
I know.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.720
He also brought a pretty tricked out electric car too

25:07.720 --> 25:08.760
that you got to ride in, Alex.

25:08.760 --> 25:09.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:09.840 --> 25:13.320
So this is Fuzzy Mistborn on the self-hosted Discord channel.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.320
He brought the Hyundai IONIQ 5.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.160
Hyundai, sorry, for the Americans.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.600
This thing is a fully electric car,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.360
and he just drove it down from Pennsylvania.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.560
So he was a bit worried about the charging situation,

25:24.560 --> 25:26.400
getting into town and stuff like that.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.200
No problem.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.240
No problem at all.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.520
That's pretty slick.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.840
And you got to go for a ride, and that's pretty great.

25:30.840 --> 25:31.440
I did, yeah.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.920
And he put this thing in sport mode,

25:32.920 --> 25:35.480
and it pinned me back in my seat.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.120
To get a petrol car that would do that,

25:37.120 --> 25:38.560
you'd have to spend a lot of money.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.440
Yeah.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.560
I mean, we didn't really get a super official account,

25:42.560 --> 25:45.760
because we didn't have a door, an entrance where we had

25:45.760 --> 25:47.120
somebody counting and clicking.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.560
No, we were just in a lovely park

25:48.560 --> 25:50.680
where people were coming at us from every angle.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.480
But we did buy 90 name tags, and they all disappeared.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.520
So I think over the course of the afternoon,

25:56.520 --> 25:57.640
about 100 people showed up.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.120
I think so.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.200
I think about exactly we asked, if you were going to go,

26:01.200 --> 26:04.160
please try to sign up for the meetup, and people did it.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.280
It was great, and it helped us plan for that.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.800
I didn't sign up for the meetup, I'm sorry.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.400
Great.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.120
Sorry.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.640
Somehow he snuck in anyway.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.760
Yes, who led that guy in?

26:12.760 --> 26:13.680
Party crusher.

26:13.680 --> 26:17.920
So I don't know really how to describe it without saying we

26:17.920 --> 26:19.080
just had all types there.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.760
I mean, when I say that, I mean people who were longtime Linux

26:21.760 --> 26:25.000
users, people who were brand new users to Linux,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.960
people who were 11 years old, people who were 70 years old.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.040
The whole range was there.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.320
And one of the interesting couples that were there

26:32.320 --> 26:34.000
was Jason and Kelly.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.080
And they had come from Virginia.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.280
So here we are at the meetup.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.800
Tell us your names and where you came from.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.880
I'm Jason.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.200
I'm Kelly.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.520
And we came from Alexandria, Virginia.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.880
And for someone like me who has no idea how far that is,

26:48.880 --> 26:50.560
how long would you have drove or?

26:50.560 --> 26:51.760
It was a really long journey.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.240
No, it's just about a four hour drive without traffic.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.200
It's not bad at all.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.200
And we actually have family in the Raleigh area,

26:58.200 --> 27:02.920
so we were able to see them, multitask, and come here.

27:02.920 --> 27:06.680
She graciously agreed to come with me to my Linux Nerdfest

27:06.680 --> 27:07.720
meetup.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.080
And what does the Nerdfest feel like for you?

27:10.080 --> 27:11.680
Is it very inviting?

27:11.680 --> 27:13.640
Oh, you know, I feel right at home here.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.000
I have very nerdy brothers.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.720
I have my own brand of nerdiness,

27:18.720 --> 27:21.080
like Star Wars, fantasy, and sci-fi related.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.360
You fit right in.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.400
But not necessarily IT related.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.520
But yeah, so no, it's great.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.920
And how's the meetup for you?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.560
Is this the first time you go to something like this?

27:29.560 --> 27:32.480
This is the first time I've been to anything quite like this.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.080
Closest I think before would be something like MAGFest,

27:36.080 --> 27:39.600
which is like a music and gaming festival years and years ago,

27:39.600 --> 27:41.920
because it's in the area that we live in.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.360
But yeah, no, it's great.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.240
It's so nice to finally put names

27:46.240 --> 27:50.480
to faces from all the voices you hear on us and meet everybody.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.960
Yeah, Jason and Kelly were really great.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.360
And I would say that is true of most people.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.360
But Jason was, I don't know, he stood out for me.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.920
He told me that he worked at the Department of Defense

28:01.920 --> 28:03.880
in the Office of the Inspector General.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.760
I don't even, it sounds really interesting.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.920
I don't know exactly what that is.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.600
But he was the kind of person, and I saw this repeatedly.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.640
You guys might agree with me, is that he was just

28:14.640 --> 28:18.800
like insatiably curious about all the technologies

28:18.800 --> 28:20.920
that he could get his hands on.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.840
And so for instance, he said he learned Ansible recently,

28:23.840 --> 28:25.280
which came up a lot.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.000
And he said it just changed his world,

28:27.000 --> 28:33.320
but also really made a really nice stride in his career.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.120
He said that took him to a whole new level.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.820
So I thought that was really interesting.

28:36.820 --> 28:39.800
He said the Department of Defense, where he is,

28:39.800 --> 28:43.880
runs all their stuff on Red Hat 7.9, which is interesting.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.560
He was a little nervous about that.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.640
Yeah, he was.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.480
So I thought that was funny.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.680
But he also said he works with a whole lot of data scientists

28:52.680 --> 28:56.120
on some data analytics stuff, which sounded fascinating.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.440
I love that there's Linux users everywhere.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.560
So great.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.280
This kind of lets us get a real sense of just

29:03.280 --> 29:05.920
every weird little niche that Linux has found itself

29:05.920 --> 29:06.840
over the years.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.080
Yeah, yeah.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.720
There's also those moments where you

29:11.720 --> 29:15.200
meet people that you either click with right away,

29:15.200 --> 29:17.320
or you share something in common with.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.200
And we had those kinds of moments.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.440
Of course, when you're named Chris,

29:21.440 --> 29:24.080
you always meet another Chris at these events.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.120
But Brent, you had a chance to meet another Brent.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.900
My name's Arturo, and I drove here from Roanoke, Virginia.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.800
So I had a six-hour drive yesterday

29:31.800 --> 29:34.680
and a three-plus-hour drive today.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.520
How about you?

29:35.520 --> 29:36.760
I think we have something in common.

29:36.760 --> 29:37.440
Yeah, we do.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.880
Actually, I didn't have to drive that far.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.520
It was all the way on the other side, actually,

29:40.520 --> 29:41.200
over by the airport.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.000
Did you fly into RDU?

29:42.000 --> 29:42.500
Yep.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.000
Yep.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.720
So that was my drive in.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.760
And my name is Brent.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.200
And my name is Brent.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.900
And you didn't have a name tag, did you?

29:50.900 --> 29:51.880
No, I didn't have a name tag.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.400
But I found another guy named Brent.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.400
And it was good enough that he was able to share.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.800
So it worked out pretty well.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.840
I happened to put two layers on, and I put a name tag

29:59.840 --> 30:00.440
on each layer.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.120
And I was able to donate my name tag, which I think

30:03.120 --> 30:04.960
is the first time that ever happens.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.080
The Brents were so inseparable.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.680
I mean, it was adorable.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.280
They were great.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.120
Well, you don't find them that often.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.400
So they're all great people, I've got to say.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.280
Now, if you're wondering, why did Brent have two name tags?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.800
I'll tell you why, listener.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.000
Because Brent is a damn pro.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.920
That's why.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.080
Because Brent had multiple layers of clothing

30:25.080 --> 30:27.640
and had a name tag for each layer of clothing,

30:27.640 --> 30:29.560
so that way he could remove his jacket

30:29.560 --> 30:31.920
and he would still have his name tag on.

30:31.920 --> 30:32.840
Not my first event.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.760
Come on, gentlemen.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.920
Say nothing else about Brent.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.280
He's easily identifiable.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.680
It reminds me of there's an episode of TNG, Star Trek TNG.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.220
I don't know if it's Picard or who,

30:41.220 --> 30:44.660
but somebody takes their jacket off, their uniform,

30:44.660 --> 30:46.040
where they have their combat.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.080
They take their jacket off, and there's

30:47.080 --> 30:49.480
a combat on underneath.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.560
That was Brent.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.520
That was Brent.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.360
You know, the thing, too, that's really nice.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.360
So you get people that they deal with Linux users

30:55.360 --> 30:57.880
and they deal with Linux and other admins all day,

30:57.880 --> 30:58.960
every day.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.400
That's totally their thing.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.000
That's the world they live in, right?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.300
But then you also have people that are listening to the show

31:04.300 --> 31:06.300
or maybe they're participating in the Mumble Room

31:06.300 --> 31:08.240
or they come to these meetups because it's

31:08.240 --> 31:11.360
the only place they hear anyone else talking about Linux.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.240
Yeah, so the strange thing is I actually don't, aside from,

31:14.240 --> 31:16.000
you know, we have a lovely gathering here,

31:16.000 --> 31:17.960
I don't actually know anybody else who runs Linux.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.480
What?

31:18.480 --> 31:21.680
Yeah, no, I am a chemist in a factory.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.180
Cool.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.500
So I do industrial chemistry.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.920
It's got nothing to do with Linux,

31:24.920 --> 31:27.360
although there are some mighty fun apps for it.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.440
But it's always just been kind of a thing

31:29.440 --> 31:30.560
I've been interested in.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.120
The local group is the Try Lug.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.960
They're pretty good folks, so I kind of

31:33.960 --> 31:36.040
fell in with them a little bit, and here we are.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.120
I heard you guys were coming all the way over here.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.560
I couldn't not make the 20-mile drive over, so.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.320
We have a good crowd here, like a really good crowd.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.760
I mean, people came from New York and Pennsylvania

31:46.760 --> 31:50.160
and Virginia and Florida, too, but a lot of locals

31:50.160 --> 31:51.080
here in Raleigh.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.360
Yeah, I was impressed.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.600
I mean, Alex, you've got a good crew.

31:54.600 --> 31:55.160
Yeah.

31:55.160 --> 31:58.280
Home of the Red Hat, I mean, it's perhaps not too surprising.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.960
Red Hat, there's a, what's the other largest tech company

32:00.960 --> 32:01.480
here, too?

32:01.480 --> 32:02.720
I don't think there's as big as Red Hat.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.520
There's all sorts.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.880
So Raleigh is actually a conglomerate

32:05.880 --> 32:08.080
of three different cities, and we call it the Triangle.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.600
There's Raleigh, there's Durham, and there's Chapel Hill.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.640
And in the middle of these things

32:11.640 --> 32:12.880
is about where the airport is.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.640
And just over the road from the airport,

32:14.640 --> 32:16.960
pretty much by your crappy hotel,

32:16.960 --> 32:20.000
is RTP, Research Triangle Park.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.960
And in there, you've got IBM, Microsoft.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.600
You've got Pfizer.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.640
There's dozens of big pharma things in there.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.720
Lots of big tech, too.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.080
Yeah, some other tech companies as well.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.560
Yeah, so I mean, it makes sense in retrospect.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
It makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.920
I feel like, though, we had such a good turnout.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.600
And that was, you know, also what

32:39.600 --> 32:42.840
has taught me is the first one you do is when you get

32:42.840 --> 32:44.080
the smallest turnout.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.480
And if you do another one, you get an even larger turnout.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.280
And so we're already talking about,

32:48.280 --> 32:50.200
how are we going to do this on a yearly basis

32:50.200 --> 32:51.560
now, because this is awesome.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.360
You know, coming out here to see the people on the East Coast.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.520
Clearly, we've been neglecting a very serious audience base.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.120
I agree.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.160
And we can get a nice cadence going.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.000
If we have Linux Fest Northwest in the spring in Seattle

33:02.000 --> 33:04.640
on the West Coast, and then something on the East Coast

33:04.640 --> 33:06.680
in the fall, maybe.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.960
And Denver every now and then to sprinkle it in.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.160
And the other thing, of course, don't worry across the pond

33:11.160 --> 33:12.800
if you're listening thinking, what about over here?

33:12.800 --> 33:13.440
What about?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.400
Alex is already campaigning.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.360
I'm working the room.

33:16.360 --> 33:16.860
I'm working.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.160
I'm lobbying.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.400
So it's going to happen.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.240
But every now and then, you run into somebody.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
And I think sometimes they have like a message

33:23.240 --> 33:24.280
they want to relay to us.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.840
Like, they've been listening to the show,

33:25.840 --> 33:27.920
and there's something they want us to consider.

33:27.920 --> 33:28.520
All right.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.000
Hi.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.120
I'm Elaine Fu.

33:30.120 --> 33:33.840
In my day job, I'm a cloud and DevOps consultant.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.760
At night, I am deeply involved in the Armbian project.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.480
I've been involved for several years,

33:40.480 --> 33:43.960
working either with CI or just advocating,

33:43.960 --> 33:47.200
liaising between Eastern European folks and native English

33:47.200 --> 33:50.000
speakers, and mostly just fighting the good fight

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
to let everybody know that there's a lot of stuff

33:52.000 --> 33:55.560
out there besides Raspberry Pi on ARM.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.080
I take that one personally.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.600
I feel like he's dragging that comment to me.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.160
Yes, Lane, I realize.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.580
And Armbian is a great project.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.040
We should probably do more work around that.

34:05.040 --> 34:05.280
Yeah.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.000
I think it just means that if you ever

34:07.000 --> 34:09.640
want to try some more interesting boards out there,

34:09.640 --> 34:13.120
other types of little tiny projects,

34:13.120 --> 34:14.620
you've got a support system out there.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.720
People like Lane Fu are working hard

34:16.720 --> 34:20.440
to make it run decently on other things besides the Raspberry

34:20.440 --> 34:20.920
Pi.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.960
And they're just like, pay attention, would you?

34:22.960 --> 34:25.640
We're working really hard to do this.

34:25.640 --> 34:26.560
Message received.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.280
We'll consider.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.480
We will consider.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.920
See, you come out to these events,

34:29.920 --> 34:31.920
you get us to think about these things.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.480
A lot of Python and Ansible love at the meetup.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.640
And how about you?

34:36.640 --> 34:37.320
My name's Sam.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.720
I'm from Richmond, Virginia.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.000
I'm a Python programmer.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.800
That's my day job.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.960
I was an Ansible core maintainer for about five years.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.440
So long time Linux user.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.360
Just love everything about Linux, open source,

34:48.360 --> 34:49.800
and automation in Python.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.720
That's basically my wheelhouse.

34:51.720 --> 34:52.600
Sam's all about it.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.360
And he had a lot to say.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.440
And the thing is a lot of people had good things

34:56.440 --> 34:59.320
to say about Python and about Ansible.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.380
And Nix, there was some Nix love as well.

35:02.380 --> 35:04.360
There was also some Nix shame.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.920
Dusty came out, and Dusty made a hard pitch

35:07.920 --> 35:12.160
for trying out the Fedora core stuff, the core OS stuff.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.360
I think we've got to give that a fair shot too.

35:14.360 --> 35:14.960
It's only fair.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.480
I mean, you come to a meetup.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.800
Dusty made a good case.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.000
So Dusty said, automatic updates.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.640
I know how you like that.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.320
But also, they have these tracks you can subscribe to.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.600
And one of them is a testing channel

35:26.600 --> 35:27.720
that you can subscribe to.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.360
And you'll get your, I think you said a week or two weeks?

35:30.360 --> 35:34.140
You get two weeks heads up of all changes.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.280
So you throw one machine in this testing channel,

35:37.280 --> 35:40.120
and you get a good solid week heads up of changes.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.720
Because they're all automatic updates.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.720
You see where it goes.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.120
And if that system doesn't break,

35:44.120 --> 35:45.840
then your production system is going to be OK.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.960
But hey, who are you kidding?

35:46.960 --> 35:49.800
We're going to run testing on all our production machines.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.320
Sure.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.240
Yeah, I'll believe that when it happens.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.000
So the nice thing about core OS in particular

35:54.000 --> 35:56.520
is how it boots from one image or partition at a time.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.140
So you can update the image you're not booted into

35:59.140 --> 36:01.720
currently whilst you're booted into the previous one.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.360
Then you reboot into the new image.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.480
And if that's broken somehow, you just

36:05.480 --> 36:07.520
fall back to the old image.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.680
Like a kernel in grub.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.000
Yeah.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.200
Yeah, that does sound good.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.560
And that also sounds consumer friendly for a device.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.160
You can see where you could build in a system where

36:17.160 --> 36:19.040
if the user is power cycling or something,

36:19.040 --> 36:20.880
there's a little bit of logic that just says,

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
use the last image.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.620
Well, I mean, isn't that some of the stuff

36:23.620 --> 36:25.600
that Valve have had to invent for the way

36:25.600 --> 36:27.240
they're deploying Arch on the Steam Deck?

36:27.240 --> 36:29.280
Yeah, I actually kind of wonder.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.000
I mean, I know we're hyped right now.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.920
And I'm saying this before we've gotten our hands

36:32.920 --> 36:34.320
on Steam OS 3.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.280
Acknowledged and kind of wish we had already

36:36.280 --> 36:37.680
seen this Steam OS 3 stuff.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.080
But wouldn't it be interesting if in like five years

36:41.080 --> 36:46.200
we look back at this and go, Valve was on the right path,

36:46.200 --> 36:47.820
but they just totally implemented

36:47.820 --> 36:49.780
like their own thing when they could have used something

36:49.780 --> 36:51.360
like Nix or something like CoreOS

36:51.360 --> 36:54.260
or anything that uses OS 3.

36:54.260 --> 36:57.880
I wonder if we'll feel like good idea, bad implementation.

36:57.880 --> 36:58.560
Kind of like Munich.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.000
When Munich first did their own thing, we were like, oh, man.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.280
The whole state is switching to Linux?

37:04.280 --> 37:07.140
And then we found out their own custom distribution thing.

37:07.140 --> 37:10.160
And they spent like six, seven years flailing around

37:10.160 --> 37:11.560
trying to make that work.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.360
And the whole time we were all just going,

37:13.360 --> 37:15.080
why didn't you just use Ubuntu?

37:15.080 --> 37:16.700
Maybe that's what's happening right now with the Deck.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.200
But we're too early in the cycle.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.040
We're all too hyped right now to realize it.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.320
So you're saying just skip Steam OS 3.0 and wait till 4.0.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.160
That'll be the good one.

37:24.160 --> 37:24.960
Maybe.

37:24.960 --> 37:29.000
Then again, maybe Linus was right.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.240
Maybe Valve is going to start with Steam OS 3.0.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.360
And they're going to build a consumer product that

37:34.360 --> 37:36.120
is following some of these best practices.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.320
And it ends up being the leading largest desktop use

37:39.320 --> 37:41.040
of this kind of technology.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.160
Linus said that it was going to be Valve that brought Linux

37:44.160 --> 37:45.800
to the desktop masses.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.160
So maybe this is the start of it.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.280
And so maybe we'll look back at it

37:48.280 --> 37:49.200
and think they were geniuses.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.280
Does this mean that this is the year of the Linux desktop?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.320
Oh, Alex.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.520
You know, I was seeing a conversation about this online

37:57.520 --> 38:00.020
recently, and I'm curious to know what you guys think.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.520
But the basic premise is that whole concept

38:02.520 --> 38:05.640
of the year of Linux desktop is harmful,

38:05.640 --> 38:08.400
because it creates this set of expectations.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.780
And the reality is that it's a slow march,

38:10.780 --> 38:13.240
and that it becomes the year of the Linux desktop for each one

38:13.240 --> 38:14.600
of us individually.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.480
And by having this idea, we are doing the whole movement harm

38:18.480 --> 38:22.120
and not recognizing the actual successes we're seeing.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.440
What do you think of that idea?

38:23.440 --> 38:25.080
Yeah, I mean, I think there's probably

38:25.080 --> 38:26.080
a lot of truth in that.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.840
But partially, I also think, does anyone

38:27.840 --> 38:29.880
take the year of the Linux desktop seriously anymore

38:29.880 --> 38:30.400
anyway?

38:30.400 --> 38:31.520
No, it's a total joke, right?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.720
I think everyone might already recognize that already.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.540
I think we do.

38:34.540 --> 38:38.140
I think the Linux community realizes

38:38.140 --> 38:39.280
it's a meme at this point.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.120
But I also hear people outside the Linux community

38:42.120 --> 38:44.560
still throw it in our face as like, oh, yeah,

38:44.560 --> 38:46.120
how's that year of the Linux desktop coming?

38:46.120 --> 38:47.240
It's a very valid point.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.720
I think my year of the Linux desktop

38:48.720 --> 38:51.280
was about five or six, seven years ago when I was first

38:51.280 --> 38:52.040
getting into Linux.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.400
And since then, it's become a tool

38:53.400 --> 38:55.080
I used to do various tasks.

38:55.080 --> 38:55.800
Right.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.240
And kind of assuming that there's

38:58.240 --> 39:01.000
this minimum benchmark it must meet,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.640
it's not really how computers work, is it?

39:02.640 --> 39:05.680
Because Windows and Mac aren't great for everybody either.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.840
It also sort of tries to assume an audience or a certain scale

39:08.840 --> 39:12.760
that tries to say, like, that's what makes it matter when,

39:12.760 --> 39:15.320
especially these days with the relevance of desktops

39:15.320 --> 39:17.240
in general, it doesn't seem like maybe it's

39:17.240 --> 39:18.440
the right concept.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.320
Yeah, you don't really want to be

39:19.320 --> 39:21.840
the winner of the thing that's kind of already on the out.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.800
I mean, I'm going to use a desktop for as long as I can.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.840
I'm not saying it's gone forever, but let's look

39:25.840 --> 39:27.040
at the sales numbers.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.280
It sort of tells its own story.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.080
So we also had a special moment here.

39:31.080 --> 39:35.160
In fact, I honestly wouldn't have been offended or surprised

39:35.160 --> 39:37.320
if you said, sorry, guys, I'm talking to Wes.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.780
Sorry, guys, I'm not going to be able to make it to this event.

39:39.780 --> 39:42.780
I got stuff going on because it was Wes's birthday.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.120
So we wanted to make it special since Wes decided

39:45.120 --> 39:46.640
to spend his birthday with us.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.880
We wanted to acknowledge that at the meetup.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.000
And Alex, like a pro, seized the moment.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
All right, where's Wes?

39:54.000 --> 39:54.480
Hello.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.760
Wes, come here.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.480
Chris, come up here, too.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.360
All right.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.480
It's not my birthday.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.040
Thank you all for coming so much.

40:01.040 --> 40:01.560
Oh, yes.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.080
Yes.

40:02.080 --> 40:02.920
JP Fam, thank you.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.080
This is really, really cool.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.240
I think we're all here, pretty much.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.520
I think people are coming, but.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.760
This was a completely unplanned, accidental thing.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.520
But today is Wes's birthday.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.020
Hey!

40:12.020 --> 40:12.520
Hey!

40:12.520 --> 40:13.020
Hey!

40:13.020 --> 40:13.520
Hey!

40:13.520 --> 40:14.020
Hey!

40:14.020 --> 40:15.020
Happy birthday, Wes.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.520
I didn't know until yesterday.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.480
So we bought him a birthday cake.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.800
You're all welcome to have some.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.040
There's one proviso.

40:24.040 --> 40:27.280
Happy birthday to you.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.280
Boop, boop, boop.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.760
Happy birthday to you.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.260
Handsome.

40:31.260 --> 40:35.240
Happy birthday, dear Wes.

40:35.240 --> 40:38.720
Wes, happy birthday to you.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.220
Hey!

40:39.220 --> 40:39.720
Hey!

40:39.720 --> 40:40.220
Hey!

40:40.220 --> 40:40.720
Woo!

40:40.720 --> 40:41.720
Thank you, everyone.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.220
All right.

40:42.220 --> 40:42.720
There's a cake.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.280
You have to come cut it.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, there is cake.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.360
There was way too much cake.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.480
What do we do with all that cake?

40:49.480 --> 40:51.520
We've still got half the damn thing in my kitchen.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.280
Both of them?

40:52.280 --> 40:54.560
Yes.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.640
I think we'll be packing on the pounds this trip.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.360
Yeah.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.360
But thank you for spending your birthday with us, Wes.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.800
I can't imagine anything better.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
Aw, geez.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.280
Aw, geez.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.560
That was pretty nice, though.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.320
And everybody just was totally, immediately in on it.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.880
Like, there was no convincing.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.240
The whole crowd just immediately got in on it.

41:10.240 --> 41:10.760
It was great.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.200
Which I was very relieved of, because my singing voice is not

41:13.200 --> 41:13.640
the best.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.120
No.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.360
If it was just you and I up there singing,

41:15.360 --> 41:18.240
it would have been very embarrassing.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.960
That's what stands out so much about these meetups, you know?

41:20.960 --> 41:21.920
It's total strangers.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.280
We've never seen 90% of these people.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.680
Some of you, unfortunately, we may never see again.

41:26.680 --> 41:29.800
But it's like an instant community.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.960
We all know why we're there.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.020
We're there for the same reasons.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.560
We have the same interests and hobbies

41:33.560 --> 41:35.060
and generally the same philosophies.

41:35.060 --> 41:38.520
And so there's just like a weird and wonderful amount

41:38.520 --> 41:41.160
of implicit trust that just kind of happens.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.600
Yeah, like a lot of the basic social fabric

41:44.600 --> 41:46.800
exists, because you can immediately talk about, well,

41:46.800 --> 41:47.840
so how far away?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.920
Where'd you come from?

41:48.920 --> 41:50.940
Because everybody has that in common.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.640
And you can talk about anything in Linux.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.120
Anything you feel like talking about.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.760
You want to talk about Wayland?

41:55.760 --> 41:56.800
Go ahead.

41:56.800 --> 42:01.760
It's so much simpler from a social interaction standpoint.

42:01.760 --> 42:05.120
And so what you see happen every single time we do these events

42:05.120 --> 42:07.480
is at first, it's sort of about us.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.200
And people kind of cluster around us.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.920
And then about an hour into it, everybody's

42:12.920 --> 42:13.880
talking to each other.

42:13.880 --> 42:16.880
Like people even who maybe don't have great social skills,

42:16.880 --> 42:18.840
maybe they don't interact with people a lot.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.000
But because we all have this in common,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.840
and we all understand these terms,

42:22.840 --> 42:25.280
like if somebody is out there talking about HTOP,

42:25.280 --> 42:26.560
people know what HTOP is.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.760
Like how common is that?

42:27.760 --> 42:29.160
That's not very common in your real life.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.400
My favorite thing was to come up to a bunch of complete

42:31.400 --> 42:33.920
strangers and just hear the word Tasmota.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.840
I'm like, hey, we can talk about that.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.360
That's fun.

42:36.360 --> 42:36.960
Let's go.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.640
Right.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.520
I was impressed with some of the audience members

42:39.520 --> 42:41.160
just being so kind and generous too.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.840
You know, we had people offering to show other folks around.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.720
Or the number of times I saw someone,

42:45.720 --> 42:47.480
they were kind of standing outside the circle a little bit,

42:47.480 --> 42:49.680
maybe not sure where they wanted to go next.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.680
People are just always offering, expanding the circle,

42:51.680 --> 42:52.760
and welcome you right in.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.480
Yeah, very true.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.880
Then I also had a special moment.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.280
So we had Wes's moment, and I had a special moment

42:58.280 --> 43:00.720
which was totally unexpected.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.980
So Nixie, everybody out there is probably familiar with Nixie.

43:03.980 --> 43:05.880
She's been in the Linux community forever.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.880
And she's got a YouTube channel that she does a lot of security

43:07.880 --> 43:08.600
content on.

43:08.600 --> 43:15.240
And they have, her and her crew, have this amazing 70s era GMC

43:15.240 --> 43:16.040
RV.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.920
And if you're an RVer at all that has

43:17.920 --> 43:20.200
any kind of historical RV background,

43:20.200 --> 43:23.680
you know these GMCs were like peak RV.

43:23.680 --> 43:26.480
And I had a chance to actually see one of these

43:26.480 --> 43:28.280
that was in full operation.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.840
20 years I've wanted to see one of these.

43:29.840 --> 43:30.340
20 years?

43:30.340 --> 43:30.840
Really?

43:30.840 --> 43:32.080
Yeah.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.560
So this is actually how I got it.

43:34.560 --> 43:38.240
It was actually set up as a desk like this, and it was a?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.320
Server rack.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.640
It was a server rack, yeah.

43:40.640 --> 43:41.440
It is a server rack.

43:41.440 --> 43:41.940
Yeah.

43:41.940 --> 43:46.480
And he had closed circuit TV systems that he could plug in

43:46.480 --> 43:49.240
and had monitors up here to monitor

43:49.240 --> 43:50.960
some sort of security thing.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.720
An RV with a server rack.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.520
How cool is this?

43:53.520 --> 43:55.840
I finally see a GMC and it's got a damn server rack in it.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.080
Yeah.

43:56.080 --> 43:56.520
Where are you?

43:56.520 --> 43:57.480
Why haven't you done this?

43:57.480 --> 43:58.440
I can't believe this.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.000
So I don't know if this rig, I don't

44:00.000 --> 44:02.080
know if they pull up at clients and hook up

44:02.080 --> 44:04.040
to the security system or what they were doing,

44:04.040 --> 44:07.000
but this thing was like a mobile RV security system.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.580
I'm imagining some ethernet that you've

44:08.580 --> 44:09.680
plumbed through on the outside and you just

44:09.680 --> 44:11.000
sort of plug it into the building.

44:11.000 --> 44:11.880
Yeah, yeah.

44:11.880 --> 44:12.800
It's pretty neat.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.120
Very cool rig.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.760
You guys should Google this thing, the GMC RV.

44:16.760 --> 44:17.640
They only made this.

44:17.640 --> 44:18.640
So it's the only one they ever made.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.840
So you're not going to have any problems finding it.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.040
And it is very special.

44:24.040 --> 44:26.120
And Nixie was talking a bit about that.

44:26.120 --> 44:28.480
I mean, I just think it's really amazing how it handles.

44:28.480 --> 44:28.980
Oh, yeah.

44:28.980 --> 44:32.160
So it doesn't handle like a Greyhound bus.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.200
It handles more like a limousine.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.360
Like a limousine, baby.

44:35.360 --> 44:35.840
That's great.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.720
Yeah.

44:36.720 --> 44:38.880
It is such a cool rig because it has

44:38.880 --> 44:43.200
a super low center of gravity and air suspension in the back.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.600
And it has dually tires.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.120
And it's just the whole thing is just so friggin' awesome.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.400
Real treat for me.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.480
And also just like I love that there's

44:50.480 --> 44:52.280
people in my audience who show up

44:52.280 --> 44:54.240
at an event like this in their RV, right?

44:54.240 --> 44:55.800
That's amazing for me.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.120
So that was a good time.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.340
Beautiful rig.

44:58.340 --> 45:00.920
I think if the Jetsons designed an RV,

45:00.920 --> 45:02.920
that's the design language that we had here.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.080
This thing was just so cool.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.580
Yeah, Chris, how did you describe it?

45:06.580 --> 45:09.080
You said it was like retro future or something?

45:09.080 --> 45:09.800
Yeah, it is.

45:09.800 --> 45:10.800
Is that a weird design?

45:10.800 --> 45:11.680
But that's the thing.

45:11.680 --> 45:12.840
It's like future retro.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.000
So it is also retro.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.360
But it is also kind of how we're designing things now.

45:17.360 --> 45:17.840
Well, yeah.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.480
It was the idea from the past of what

45:19.480 --> 45:21.080
the future could be in a direction

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
we unfortunately haven't quite taken.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.080
Because as you also said, that thing

45:25.080 --> 45:27.360
had a very Star Trek shuttle pod feel.

45:27.360 --> 45:30.320
There's this curved glass in the cockpit.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.040
Just seeing photon torpedoes.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.460
They don't make them like that no more, I'll tell you what.

45:34.460 --> 45:34.960
They don't.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.320
But at that time, they wanted to build an RV where

45:38.320 --> 45:41.280
they followed what the airline builders followed.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.180
So when you're building a traveling jet,

45:44.180 --> 45:47.560
like a 747 or something like that, all the building

45:47.560 --> 45:49.200
policies, and even down to the paint.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.560
The paint they chose was airplane paint.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.640
And so as a result, the paint, it needs polished.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.200
But the RV's paint still is on and holds up

45:58.200 --> 45:59.520
after all these years.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.680
And meanwhile, modern RVs just disintegrate

46:02.680 --> 46:04.520
after 10, 15, 20 years.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.720
You know something a little bit about that.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.440
And they also don't make it out of corn wire.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.280
So that also is a very good thing.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.760
I also thought the suspension system

46:13.760 --> 46:18.320
was like a whole weird, brand new, crazy thing.

46:18.320 --> 46:22.520
Like that the wheels were able to turn slightly a little bit.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.200
Just a little.

46:23.200 --> 46:28.120
And it sounded like both sides of the rear suspension

46:28.120 --> 46:29.200
worked in concert.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.440
So that let's say, unfortunately, you

46:31.440 --> 46:33.760
were driving into Denver, for instance,

46:33.760 --> 46:35.520
and you found a large bump in the road,

46:35.520 --> 46:36.960
maybe a pothole on one side.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.240
And you hit that.

46:38.240 --> 46:41.560
They were explaining how that would actually only shift

46:41.560 --> 46:45.320
the suspension by about half of that distance,

46:45.320 --> 46:48.840
because each side can independently kind of absorb

46:48.840 --> 46:51.000
that and kind of cantilever back and forth.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
It was really fascinating.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.840
I would say, if that sounds interesting in any way,

46:54.840 --> 46:56.540
go check this thing out.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.000
I'm sure there are lots of videos

46:58.000 --> 46:59.200
of people explaining the suspension.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.080
It was really neat.

47:00.080 --> 47:03.160
I'm just picturing one day I pick one of these things up,

47:03.160 --> 47:05.240
and I build a mobile studio.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.440
Come on.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.800
In a GMC from the 70s, how cool would that be?

47:09.800 --> 47:11.000
You have to store it here, though.

47:11.000 --> 47:11.920
Totally, dude.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.360
Yeah, we'd probably have to build it here, let's be honest.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.040
If you inspire us like that, I think we might all need one.

47:18.040 --> 47:18.680
Because what?

47:18.680 --> 47:19.920
We can't all record in yours.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.040
The sound isolation is just not going to be good enough.

47:22.040 --> 47:22.680
Yeah, that's true.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.200
lino.com slash unplugged.

47:27.200 --> 47:31.280
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.820
And you go there to support the show.

47:32.820 --> 47:34.700
I mean, let's just be honest about it, right?

47:34.700 --> 47:37.040
lino.com slash unplugged.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.800
If you've got something you want for your next project,

47:40.800 --> 47:42.800
something you want to deploy up in the public,

47:42.800 --> 47:44.600
I'd be embarrassed not to put it on Linode.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.160
And I legitimately mean that.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.440
It's not just that it's super fast and has great performance,

47:49.440 --> 47:53.480
but if anything goes wrong, they also have fantastic support.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.200
I pinged their support recently.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.360
So I have a recent story to share with you,

47:57.360 --> 48:00.080
because I decided to go full baller on our matrix

48:00.080 --> 48:01.200
server before we left.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.440
I didn't want to be over here and have the matrix server

48:03.440 --> 48:04.400
fall down.

48:04.400 --> 48:08.400
So I pinged Linode, and I'm like, hey, guys, how's it going?

48:08.400 --> 48:12.020
So I know how I have this $15 a month Linode here.

48:12.020 --> 48:13.020
Here's what I want to do.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.360
And I kind of just ran them through what

48:14.360 --> 48:15.520
I'm thinking about.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.440
And they sent me back kind of a response

48:17.440 --> 48:19.800
and gave us a few ideas and gave us the green light.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.320
So I turned this thing up to 11.

48:22.320 --> 48:26.200
Our matrix box, we went from 16 gigs of RAM.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.680
We now have 96 gigs of RAM.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.360
We now have 96 gigs of RAM in that thing.

48:31.360 --> 48:35.960
We went from six CPU cores to 48 CPU cores.

48:35.960 --> 48:37.480
We now have 48 CPU cores.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.720
Going to need a lot of workers.

48:38.720 --> 48:39.440
My god.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.320
Yeah.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.000
We are cooking with gas on our matrix server now.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.320
It is so slick.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.800
It's not the final solution.

48:46.800 --> 48:47.720
But you know what?

48:47.720 --> 48:49.680
When you can throw hardware at it, why not?

48:49.680 --> 48:51.440
And isn't this the nice flexibility

48:51.440 --> 48:52.200
I have as a business?

48:52.200 --> 48:54.080
Because the last thing I want is this thing

48:54.080 --> 48:55.240
crashing while I'm on a trip.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.120
But you don't have to commit to some giant new server thing

48:58.120 --> 48:59.560
that we would have had to take a couple of weeks

48:59.560 --> 49:01.920
to get provisioned and set up before we left, right?

49:01.920 --> 49:03.000
You can just do it now.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.040
And if we figure out a solution that

49:04.040 --> 49:06.520
means we need to scale back down later, that's easy to do too.

49:06.520 --> 49:07.880
Click of a button.

49:07.880 --> 49:08.600
Click of a button.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.640
That's the thing.

49:09.640 --> 49:14.960
Is it resized an existing system we already had in production.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.400
And it resized it in minutes.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.160
And now the box has like infinite power.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.920
So I love that kind of stuff.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.760
And it's just the sort of thing I could never

49:23.760 --> 49:26.920
do with a physical box or even some janky VM setup

49:26.920 --> 49:28.360
that I'm running on my machine.

49:28.360 --> 49:29.680
So if you're a performance hound,

49:29.680 --> 49:31.240
if you're a reliability hound, if you

49:31.240 --> 49:35.000
want to be like in like slim with good support,

49:35.000 --> 49:36.280
Linode is the way to go.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.140
They got 11 data centers around the world.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.680
You're going to find something near you or your customers.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.960
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.960
And they just keep making it better and better and better.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.520
I love it.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.800
I think you're going to love it.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.200
I would suggest you try something.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.480
Go kick the tires and see it for yourself.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.360
That $100 means you can really try something.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.040
And make your own decision.

49:58.040 --> 50:00.160
And trying it out supports the show.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.380
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

50:02.380 --> 50:05.880
Get that $100 on a new account and support the show.

50:05.880 --> 50:09.360
Linode.com slash unplugged.

50:09.360 --> 50:13.520
We have a little bit of feedback this week.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.160
Rafael wrote in about NexOS.

50:15.160 --> 50:17.080
We've been getting a lot of those.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.040
And I thought it would be a great question

50:19.040 --> 50:22.000
to put to all of you since we're in the same room.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.400
They write, my dream is to be able to access

50:24.400 --> 50:27.600
a mostly persistent single version of my development

50:27.600 --> 50:30.860
environment on any machine in my local network.

50:30.860 --> 50:32.840
I do hobby app development on Flutter,

50:32.840 --> 50:36.720
which has a relatively complex install procedure in Linux.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.880
Rarely do I get enough time between dad duties

50:38.880 --> 50:41.800
to update, run git pull, and do a system update

50:41.800 --> 50:45.020
if I haven't used a particular laptop in a while.

50:45.020 --> 50:47.320
What I'd like to do is somehow host

50:47.320 --> 50:51.360
a persistent configuration of my workflow and OS

50:51.360 --> 50:55.000
that's always up to date and ready to work on my development

50:55.000 --> 50:56.640
project with minimal interruptions,

50:56.640 --> 51:01.040
such as the changes from one system to the other.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.680
He says he has a small home server that

51:02.680 --> 51:04.680
might be useful in the mix.

51:04.680 --> 51:07.320
And he wondered, is this possible with Nix,

51:07.320 --> 51:09.880
or are there any other solutions?

51:09.880 --> 51:12.200
You know, Nix does have a fair amount of facilities

51:12.200 --> 51:14.160
for setting up a development environment.

51:14.160 --> 51:16.160
And if you're using something like Vim and Emacs,

51:16.160 --> 51:17.660
I know they've got a lot of support

51:17.660 --> 51:20.080
for including configuration for those types of editors

51:20.080 --> 51:21.360
in there as well.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.040
I think if Nix is the right fit might depend on, well, one,

51:24.040 --> 51:25.840
if you like using Nix, but then two,

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
kind of what tools you're using for development

51:27.840 --> 51:30.120
and how well that fits in the next ecosystem.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.640
Because some ecosystems, I think Go is pretty well supported,

51:33.640 --> 51:36.000
MPM, there's some new exciting stuff for Clojure

51:36.000 --> 51:37.320
I just happened to notice.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.360
Those work well, but there's other ecosystems.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.440
I think Ruby sometimes could be painful from what

51:41.440 --> 51:43.880
I've heard that just maybe fewer of those packages

51:43.880 --> 51:45.520
have made it into the Nix package store.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.360
So those are the things I would check out.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.680
But there might be a lot of ways to skin this cat.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.960
Containers can be a nice way to set up development

51:51.960 --> 51:52.920
environments.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.040
Or if it's just on your local network,

51:55.040 --> 51:58.300
I know you guys really love the remote VS code set up over SSH.

51:58.300 --> 52:00.680
So maybe you don't need to copy the environment everywhere,

52:00.680 --> 52:02.360
and you can have one master install that's

52:02.360 --> 52:04.480
able to reach out to the other systems.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.600
That's a good idea.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.760
I hadn't thought about that.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.680
Yeah, if that's truly what you're looking for,

52:08.680 --> 52:13.080
you probably could get a minimum viable version with that.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.320
I was thinking you could solve this with WebTop

52:15.320 --> 52:17.400
with the container solution, where essentially it's

52:17.400 --> 52:20.160
a Docker container that creates a desktop Linux environment

52:20.160 --> 52:21.620
that you connect to over your web.

52:21.620 --> 52:24.120
It's like a self-hosted version of shells.com.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.040
Oh, very nice.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.720
So you could do something like WebTop.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.640
But you don't want to hear this.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.640
What I hear, I mean, maybe it's because I'm old,

52:29.640 --> 52:31.880
but I hear VM.

52:31.880 --> 52:35.160
I hear VM with free RDP server running on it

52:35.160 --> 52:36.520
that you just RDP into.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.600
And now that GNOME 42 has exposed options

52:38.600 --> 52:41.160
to set up an RDP server, you could set up a Fedora

52:41.160 --> 52:45.320
workstation in a VM with free RDP server running,

52:45.320 --> 52:47.720
and then you could just RDP from any machine on your network.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.360
And honestly, I'd recommend using

52:49.360 --> 52:51.280
one of the higher end RDP clients,

52:51.280 --> 52:54.000
because if you use the actual Microsoft RDP client,

52:54.000 --> 52:55.940
you get a pretty performance session.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.240
It's not bad with the new GNOME server.

52:58.240 --> 52:58.920
That's an option.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.960
I mean, I hear VM.

53:00.960 --> 53:03.760
I do get what he's trying to get at, right?

53:03.760 --> 53:07.480
Raphael wants to just sit down and get to work, right?

53:07.480 --> 53:09.080
It's like when I go to play a Steam game

53:09.080 --> 53:11.000
and I end up spending 15, 20 minutes just

53:11.000 --> 53:13.520
getting my machine capable of playing that game.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.760
Less of a problem these days, but still happens sometimes.

53:16.760 --> 53:17.240
I get it.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.380
Raphael wants to just sit down and get to work.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.200
And I'm trying to think of what would be simpler and quicker

53:21.200 --> 53:21.840
than RDP.

53:21.840 --> 53:24.120
I mean, Alex, do you have any ideas of like,

53:24.120 --> 53:26.480
maybe is this another option?

53:26.480 --> 53:28.440
Maybe just a dedicated laptop?

53:28.440 --> 53:32.240
I'm a big fan of the Westpane VS Code remote suggestion.

53:32.240 --> 53:34.240
I do that for a lot of my development, actually.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.160
And I think perhaps the one thing that

53:36.160 --> 53:39.400
makes this more difficult is the Flutter element, where you

53:39.400 --> 53:41.840
actually need some UI elements on screen.

53:41.840 --> 53:44.840
That potentially makes this more difficult,

53:44.840 --> 53:47.800
because a lot of my development is for infrastructure as code

53:47.800 --> 53:50.560
type stuff, more DevOps-y type things.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.960
So UI development, really, you need the environment locally.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.840
But if you can capture all of these requirements

53:57.840 --> 54:01.440
as to what makes your development environment yours

54:01.440 --> 54:03.760
and get that into an Ansible playbook,

54:03.760 --> 54:04.680
you should play the bell whenever

54:04.680 --> 54:06.440
I mention the word Ansible, I think.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.640
Maybe a Badger sound effect?

54:08.640 --> 54:10.240
We need an Ansible sound effect, guys.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
A quick stinger.

54:11.240 --> 54:12.280
We do, yeah.

54:12.280 --> 54:15.680
Now, for me, if you can capture all that into a nice playbook,

54:15.680 --> 54:18.280
that then becomes your repeatable deployment thing

54:18.280 --> 54:19.920
that you sync between machines.

54:19.920 --> 54:21.320
And in fact, you don't even really

54:21.320 --> 54:23.160
need to sync the Ansible itself.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.840
You just commit that to a local Git repo,

54:25.840 --> 54:27.800
sync that between the machines, and then

54:27.800 --> 54:29.440
run Ansible against all of these machines

54:29.440 --> 54:30.320
whenever you sit down.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.080
Have it as a cron job, if you like,

54:32.080 --> 54:34.040
to get more into that kind of GitOps kind

54:34.040 --> 54:36.200
of style of operation.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.560
That's a great idea.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.760
Greg Hellings also wrote in onto our GitHub.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.480
I kind of grabbed this because I thought it was fascinating.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.800
This is the GitHub for the NixOS challenge that we set up.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.920
If you want to check that out, github.com

54:48.920 --> 54:50.880
slash jupyterbroadcasting.

54:50.880 --> 54:55.000
And he writes, about four months ago for a day job,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.440
I began experimenting with the Nix package manager

54:57.440 --> 55:01.320
in order to enable developer tooling to run in Linux,

55:01.320 --> 55:03.520
as well as Mac OS.

55:03.520 --> 55:06.440
Currently, we officially only support Mac OS.

55:06.440 --> 55:08.840
Having come here from Red Hat, this task

55:08.840 --> 55:10.640
was naturally assigned to me.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.080
Nix packages will allow us to eventually unify

55:13.080 --> 55:16.200
the same packaging system across Mac and Linux.

55:16.200 --> 55:20.440
He says, bonus, it also allows us to run under the WSL2

55:20.440 --> 55:21.320
on Windows.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.560
The same package manager in all three systems.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.840
I thought that was pretty brilliant.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.640
That is something I've been hearing a couple of times

55:28.640 --> 55:29.440
from people.

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.960
I've been trying out using Nix lately on my work Mac.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.640
And yeah, so far, it's going pretty well.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.000
I've been impressed with the number of packages

55:37.000 --> 55:37.920
that are supported.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.960
It sounds like from talking with some of the folks

55:39.960 --> 55:43.600
on our Nix matrix channel that the Darwin support,

55:43.600 --> 55:45.400
as they call it, has gotten a lot better just

55:45.400 --> 55:46.720
in the past couple of years.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.120
So if you tried it before, it might be worth checking out.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.800
And it's really easy and light on the system.

55:50.800 --> 55:51.760
So if you just want an alternative,

55:51.760 --> 55:53.320
if you're already using something like Brew,

55:53.320 --> 55:55.040
I know before the show, we were kind of messing around

55:55.040 --> 55:57.280
and wanted to brew package update one of our machines.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.280
Of course, that takes a while.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.560
And when you're trying to do a live stream, it's not great.

56:00.560 --> 56:03.360
But Nix is pretty fast, and it's a nice alternative.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.280
Yeah, I actually feel like the time

56:06.280 --> 56:10.080
is right for the Nix packager to strike on macOS.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.560
I know it's been around for a while.

56:11.560 --> 56:16.520
But Brew has a lot of people that are not happy with it.

56:16.520 --> 56:19.720
And what is the new project that one of the Brew founders?

56:19.720 --> 56:24.600
I mean, it seems like there's some perhaps weakening

56:24.600 --> 56:28.280
in Brew's dominance in macOS package management.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.800
I feel quite the opposite.

56:29.800 --> 56:33.800
I actually install everything on my Mac using Brew.

56:33.800 --> 56:37.760
So I install Chrome, Spotify, Mumble.

56:37.760 --> 56:40.760
There's a package for literally everything in Brew these days.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.360
And that's where it really wins.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.760
And I have a question for you, Wes.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.600
I haven't done anything with the Nix package manager yet.

56:46.600 --> 56:49.920
But I've heard this promise before with Terraform

56:49.920 --> 56:52.320
as the example, where you write one script

56:52.320 --> 56:54.760
or you define one configuration.

56:54.760 --> 56:57.080
And then that becomes your golden configuration

56:57.080 --> 57:00.760
for all your things, except for the fact that's never true,

57:00.760 --> 57:02.960
because package names are actually slightly different

57:02.960 --> 57:05.320
on different OSes and stuff like that.

57:05.320 --> 57:08.240
Is that a solved problem with the Nix package manager?

57:08.240 --> 57:09.120
That's a good question.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.480
I don't know if I'd say that it's quite solved.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.320
And admittedly, I'm kind of just starting off

57:12.320 --> 57:13.760
on this road myself.

57:13.760 --> 57:17.120
But I have been impressed with the flexibility of overrides.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.800
I haven't quite got it dialed in.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.360
But one thing I was trying out was building cross-compiled

57:22.360 --> 57:24.120
Docker images from Mac without having

57:24.120 --> 57:26.520
to use any of the Docker tools that would spit out

57:26.520 --> 57:29.180
like a Linux container with all the right Linux binaries

57:29.180 --> 57:29.960
and stuff.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.320
And for the most part, that was just

57:31.320 --> 57:33.760
one little change at the top of the file that was like, hey,

57:33.760 --> 57:36.060
here I want to pull in packages that run on the Mac side.

57:36.060 --> 57:37.880
So these are the native packages to run.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.260
And then for the stuff that's going inside the container,

57:40.260 --> 57:44.240
I want you to pull from the x86 part of the Nix package cache.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.000
Really?

57:45.000 --> 57:46.560
So I think that there's some promise.

57:46.560 --> 57:49.620
Now, of course, as you're right, abstractions are leaky.

57:49.620 --> 57:51.160
I'm sure there are some edge cases

57:51.160 --> 57:51.960
that are going to bite you.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.680
But at least for the simple stuff,

57:53.680 --> 57:56.120
like in getting an htop and things like that going,

57:56.120 --> 57:59.520
yeah, just kind of install it by name and go have fun.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.720
I feel like at the meetup, it was a pretty good mix

58:01.720 --> 58:04.040
of people who thought we were crazy for this Nix stuff

58:04.040 --> 58:06.280
and people who were like right on board with us doing

58:06.280 --> 58:07.560
the challenge.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.840
I feel like that's about the split in this room, too.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.340
Yeah.

58:10.340 --> 58:10.840
Yeah.

58:10.840 --> 58:11.340
Yeah.

58:11.340 --> 58:11.840
Yeah.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.320
Yeah.

58:13.320 --> 58:20.000
And now, as the French say, it is time for le boost.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.440
We got a bunch of boosts in.

58:21.440 --> 58:26.960
And for 5,000 sats, bhh32 wrote, thanks for the fountain app

58:26.960 --> 58:27.840
recommendation.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.240
I've been listening to you guys for a few years now.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.800
I've never had an opportunity to attend a live show.

58:32.800 --> 58:36.000
And this is a great way for me to support you and participate.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.080
Here are 5,000 sats for you, easily funded

58:39.080 --> 58:42.160
from my Exodus wallet, since it has its own lightning wallet

58:42.160 --> 58:45.560
that I can deposit from my mining efforts.

58:45.560 --> 58:48.520
And I mine exclusively on Linux, open source funding

58:48.520 --> 58:49.840
for open source shows.

58:49.840 --> 58:52.400
That's rad.

58:52.400 --> 58:55.320
Pretty crazy to think he's using open source software

58:55.320 --> 58:58.440
to mine something that generates value that he can then

58:58.440 --> 59:01.160
send in with a message to a podcast that

59:01.160 --> 59:03.000
talks about open source software,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.680
using all open source self-hosted software

59:05.680 --> 59:09.080
on the back end for every single piece of it, right?

59:09.080 --> 59:10.960
You can't say that about a Visa transaction.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.320
Not a Windows box in sight.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.880
No, no.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.600
Michael B wrote in yesterday with 3,000 sats, hey, guys.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.960
I'm so glad that you're banging on things like Matrix

59:18.960 --> 59:21.600
to help us all getting all of this sorted out.

59:21.600 --> 59:22.620
Keep up the great work.

59:22.620 --> 59:26.400
Michael, you know, the Matrix community continues to grow.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.800
And was it, I don't know if we really

59:28.800 --> 59:29.880
touched on this last week.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.880
Like, it was implicit in the conversation,

59:32.880 --> 59:35.240
but there was like a hot minute like three months ago

59:35.240 --> 59:37.440
where I'm like, screw this.

59:37.440 --> 59:38.640
I don't want to host this.

59:38.640 --> 59:40.840
Discord is way easier.

59:40.840 --> 59:42.480
Why am I bothering with this?

59:42.480 --> 59:44.400
And I was like, let's kill the Matrix server.

59:44.400 --> 59:46.720
Yeah, we really, I mean, we thought about it.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.520
But then all these damn bastards started joining the server,

59:50.520 --> 59:51.560
and they're all so great.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.000
I want to talk to them all.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.160
And now I'm all in.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.620
Like, we've got to keep this thing.

59:55.620 --> 59:57.720
And also, I think the other thing that's

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.440
been sort of building over 2022 for me

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.160
is I have really started taking a look at centralization

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.080
in the Linux community and the negative effects.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.000
I think that centralization has brought

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.440
Linux and Linux innovation.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.360
And then I started using that perspective

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.080
to look at how we do messaging and look at how we communicate

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.440
as a community.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.860
And I realized that there's value long term

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.160
in helping build the Matrix ecosystem because

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.960
of its decentralized nature.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.760
And that's sort of where I decided

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.200
I'm going to double down on it.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.320
So that's why we now have a 48-core box

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.680
with 96 gigs of RAM running our Matrix server.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.480
Fingers crossed.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.640
We decided to go crazy.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.200
Well, Marcus boosted in with 10,000 sets.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.160
I hope these boosts and streaming sets

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.160
help allow JB to grow.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.440
And hey, by the way, Chris, I was the person that sent you

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.960
a 3DS a few years ago.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.880
That was so awesome when Marcus did that.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.720
Thank you, Marcus.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.340
Because my son and I really got into some of the 3DS games

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.080
for a little bit.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.200
And so we both had one and made for a nice moment.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.880
User 183 also sent in two days ago 12,000 sets.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.800
That seems impressive to me.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.520
Great live stream last week.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.100
Thanks for the 2,000 sets.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.360
We were sending sets to people, which I think

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.600
they really enjoyed, clearly.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.360
Yeah.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.080
I guess they sent it back and then some.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.560
Now have BTC on Blue Wallet and SATs on Fountain.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.920
So here are yours returned and a few more.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.680
If you've not mentioned it before,

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.060
worth highlighting Flat Seal, which, among other settings,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:32.000
allows confined Flatpak apps access to NFS shares

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.840
and mounted partitions.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.440
Martin?

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.380
Yeah, Flat Seal is a solid Flatpak companion.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.320
Just one of those things, quality of life,

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.400
is you try to do more complicated workflows

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.200
in your Flatpak apps.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.280
All right, so Wes, I think you probably found this one.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.500
Based on the functionality for our pick this week,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.440
it's called BORE.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.960
Yeah, a modern, simple TCP tunnel that's written in Rust.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.880
Yes!

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.160
Yeah, you might wonder, OK, why would I need this?

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.660
Aren't there already things like ngrok?

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.700
And yeah, they acknowledge that right in the readme.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.500
It's similar to a local tunnel in ngrok,

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.040
and there's a lot of tools for this.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.600
But BORE is intended to be a highly efficient, unopinionated

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.440
tool for forwarding TCP traffic that's

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.320
simple to install, simple to self-host,

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.160
with no frills attached.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.000
And yeah, it's true.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.240
I was able to take a look.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.800
It's less than 400 lines of safe, asynchronous Rust.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.480
So you can read through the code if you like.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.440
And because it's Rust, it's easy to get started.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.800
You just run BORE server on maybe a Linode system

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.300
out there.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.400
And then you can use your own to forward reports.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.760
So if you're behind some firewall,

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.040
you've got NAT in the mix.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.560
It's just really easy and simple.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.600
So let's say you're a guy who's maybe on a flight,

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.400
and they're locking down what you can get to on this flight.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.440
Is there a way I could use this to get access

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.840
to more things without pain?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.960
I mean, I'm not saying I'm doing that, but I'm asking for Brent.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.040
You know, that's a use case I hadn't considered.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.400
Could a guy do that with this?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.840
Or like, I'm trying to picture what

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.040
I would use this in the day-to-day.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.280
Well, I think it's just a nice way,

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.720
if you don't have a fancier setup,

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.680
or you don't want to invest in other persistent tooling,

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.480
you just need sort of an ephemeral port forward.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.320
That sounds like me.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:06.760
Yeah, right?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.040
You haven't got your firewall configured.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.440
You don't even know how the firewall works.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.120
Who can bother?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.620
Mm-hmm.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.040
Who can?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.760
And so that's where this is really nice, because one, you

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.840
can self-host it, or they run what

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.440
seems like a pretty beefy server on their own.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.400
And so you just run this on your local machine,

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.680
tell it what ports you want to forward,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.120
and then instead of having to set up a reverse proxy

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.200
or open that port on your firewall, it's done for you.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.740
Isn't it interesting how we talk about these picks sometimes,

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.120
and you dig into it, and you discover

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.400
the open source project is also running a server component

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.840
to help make it work better?

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.560
Like, you don't have to use it, but Magic Wormhole, Jitsi,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.280
Bore, the list goes on and on.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.280
Like, it's very common these days

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.400
to have that little kind of server-side component.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.680
And so that's an aspect you've got to take into consideration.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.000
Absolutely.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.520
Maybe, if you find it useful, you

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.960
want to support those kinds of projects.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.560
That's right.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.400
I think that's probably true, and we

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.920
don't want them monetizing that aspect of it,

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.120
because that's not good for any of us.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.560
All right, you know, it's a shorter show today,

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.280
because we didn't have a Mumble Room.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.480
Yeah, I mean, we're going to try to do something

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.320
in the post-show, so if you're a member at unpluggedcore.com

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.280
or at jupiter.party, yeah, then you get to hear the post-show,

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.320
and you're going to see if we get it to work or not.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.800
And not to mention the rather not safe for work conversation

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.560
we had today.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.480
This is why you show up live, folks, all the extra show.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.120
You're going to hear Chris rant and rave about technical

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.620
setups.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.480
That's always fun, you know?

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.160
You get the full perspective and the spectrum of emotions.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.280
I'm a little worried about that guy.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.440
You know, you can get that whole thing.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.240
That's always fun.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.480
Who doesn't want that, right?

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.640
So check that out.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.760
You can join us on Sundays.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.560
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.280
over at jblive.tv.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.760
We'd love to have you join our virtual lug,

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.440
because it's almost like it's like 99% of the time,

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.760
99.5% of the time, it makes its way into the show.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.600
It's just when something gets broken,

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.880
then it doesn't make it in here.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.240
But you can always watch live.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.560
See you next week.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.040
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.960
All right, that's it.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.240
That's our live show, all hanging out.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.640
Is this considered a living room?

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.240
What is this considered, a bonus room?

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.720
Officially, I think it's a bonus room.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.040
Yeah, the room above the garage.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.120
Yeah, hanging out in the bonus room.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.680
In this case, bonus means a totally capable for recording

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.200
a podcast.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.800
I think it's now a podcast room.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.920
I don't think I've ever seen anybody

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.840
look quite so comfortable as Wes Payne, who's

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.480
recording from my La-Z-Boy today.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.640
Yeah, this is amazing.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.040
We had to really put it in the studio to share this.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.560
That is a nice spot.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.400
All right, thank you so much for tuning in.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.360
Keep the Linux rolling at linuxunplugged.com

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.120

and get it in front of us.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.360
We read them all.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.040
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.280
of the Unplugged program.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.000
See you back here next Sunday.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.600
And remember, the Unplugged program,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.680
the new show, is brought to you by Linux.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.000
So don't forget to check us out.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.280
And hopefully, you're all enjoying it,

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.440
and we'll see you next week.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:42.960

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.160

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.680

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.120

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:57.520
Bye.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.040

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:58.520

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:00.760

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.280

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:01.960
Bye.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.480
Bye.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:02.960
Bye.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:13.320
Alright, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.480
I like, like, the chatroom's asking, like, what's the deal with the Rust love?

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.320
Seriously, why does everybody love Rust so much?

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320
Yeah, maybe I got a little defensive there, whoops.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.320
Does it feel like, I mean, I mean, besides the fact that we are getting some awesome

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.480
applications and it's making people rethink stuff, I think in part it's just sort of,

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480
sort of a show trope.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.720
WestPain loves Rust, that's why we love Rust.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.960
Yeah, maybe a little bit, plus, like, we kind of get to pick up on some of the legitimate

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.320
enthusiasm out there for, you know, devs who are just finding and falling in love with

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Rust.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.880
When's the last time you've seen something like this, where, like, a language like this

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.640
wins the hearts and minds of developers like this?

01:06:46.640 --> 01:07:06.360
Michael Dominic would tell you Objective C, but I don't know if I believe him.
