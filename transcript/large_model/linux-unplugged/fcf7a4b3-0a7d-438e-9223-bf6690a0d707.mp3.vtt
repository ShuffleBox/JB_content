00:00.000 --> 00:08.040
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 35 for April 8th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's sore in all of the

00:41.080 --> 00:46.520
wrong places but still pouring out one for good old XP. My name is Chris. My

00:46.520 --> 00:51.560
name is Matt. Hey Matt, so here we are is XP Doomsday and to celebrate this very

00:51.560 --> 00:56.040
special event I've asked Chase to join us. Hey Chase! Hey guys, how are you? Hey pretty

00:56.040 --> 01:00.680
good. So guess what? I had my first wing experience with Chase today. Tell me

01:00.680 --> 01:05.040
where we went. I took, well actually Chris really took me, but I said hey Chris we

01:05.040 --> 01:09.760
need to go to Buffalo Wild Wings in beautiful beautiful North Marysville. And

01:09.760 --> 01:14.080
we got three types of wings. We got the Parmesan garlic, we got the

01:14.080 --> 01:19.320
buffalo, buffalo dry rub, and the honey mustard. This buffalo dry rub was like

01:19.320 --> 01:24.920
wings I'd never had before. Weren't they? That's the best kind of dry rub. The crispy skin and the flavor just hit you.

01:24.920 --> 01:53.920
I love me some wings. It's wing Tuesday right? Yeah it was wing Tuesday so we had a great special. So we just got all loaded up on wings and we thought we'd come in here and, you know, I wanted to have a conversation with Chase because I think one of the biggest pools of switchers to Linux, and we're kind of using the death of XP as an excuse today to talk about this, but I think one of the, realistically if we're being honest, people who are going to switch to Linux today, you know, in the year 2014 and 2015 are likely going to often be the more technical users.

01:53.920 --> 02:21.920
People who are fascinated by technology and kind of want to take that to the next level. See what other technology enthusiasts could create a la open source, right? And maybe even become a little more involved in the human side of software development by becoming exposed to open source. And I think that's going to be a huge pool of switchers. And that's not a small group. There's a lot of Windows users out there who are very technically savvy. They are geeks. They are gamers. And guess what? Chase happens to run a podcast network called Geek Gamer. He fits that category.

02:21.920 --> 02:46.920
He's an IT guy himself, but he is a Windows user primarily. And we're going to pick his brain today and get the honest, real world answers maybe why he hasn't been particularly motivated to switch to Linux. Because I think getting a little honest opinion on maybe the barriers that are perceived and the actual barriers that exist could help us break those down in the future and move more people over now that today is the end of XP.

02:46.920 --> 02:57.920
And I felt like it would only be appropriate if we celebrated. So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to boot up my XP machine. Let me log in real quick because this is a special moment. And I don't normally run XP in the studio.

02:57.920 --> 03:18.920
But all right, I got the XP machine started. Now, Chase, you can see here I just downloaded a few. Oh, oh, let me clear that. Oh, Chris, you need to install. No, I have this. Oh, what am I? Oh, no. I feel good. I feel good now. I think this is what was supposed to happen, right? That's right. This is clearly.

03:18.920 --> 03:35.920
So goodbye to XP. We hated you. You were the bane of my existence. So many of my ass hairs were burned on solving your problem when we went from 98 to the Fisher Price interface. Oh, let's not say that. So, you know, I was it wasn't terrible.

03:35.920 --> 03:50.920
It wasn't bad when when it first came out. I was the guy at a bank deploying a bunch of x86 servers and the mainframe guys were sitting back laughing at me like, look at your toy computers with their toy Fisher XP operating system. It was a point of mockery that I had to endure for years.

03:50.920 --> 04:09.920
Yeah, but all you had to do is enable classic mode and then you're right. Come on. I told them that I told them that. But kill the theme and also make sure that you change your start button to stop. That's a very important registry hack. I mean, you know, I'm a big PC gamer. And like, for example, when Vista first came out and everybody was like, you know, I'm going to move to Vista for gaming.

04:09.920 --> 04:26.920
I got better performance on XP. I stayed with XP for a long period of time until Windows 7. Well, a lot of businesses stay with XP because the hardware requirements are lower. In fact, a lot of businesses still are. Actually, there's a lot of banks that are paying for XP support for their ATMs. Governments. Yeah, because they're paying for that exclusive premium support.

04:26.920 --> 04:39.920
I know. This is so brilliant because Microsoft has basically made up this phony expiration date for bits that they can then put a phony bounty on that is a completely made up price that they can just charge people randomly for now. It's a brilliant scheme.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.920
But should they support it indefinitely, though?

04:42.920 --> 04:43.920
Why not?

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
Why not?

04:44.920 --> 04:59.920
I mean, no, I don't actually believe that. But as a thought experiment, let's say you had 50,000 employees and you were one of the largest software companies in the world and there were a billion users of your operating system. Let's entertain the idea of continuing to support it. I mean, why not?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.920
It keeps the world safer.

05:02.920 --> 05:16.920
It only keeps them safer as long as those people are updating like they should and they don't disregard updates. So you can find OS2 still deployed in system 390 mainframes, OS2 on a 386 still getting updates from IBM.

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
Wow.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.920
So it's possible.

05:18.920 --> 05:19.920
That puts it in perspective, yeah.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.920
It's possible. I don't know if you'd want to do it, but I say good riddance.

05:22.920 --> 05:38.920
Honestly, I am so glad it's out of here. XP as a support contractor has been the source of so many wasted hours. I lost so many clients' computers to Service Pack 3. It bricked machines. It was a security nightmare. The security was boned from the very beginning.

05:38.920 --> 05:50.920
And, you know, I think in a large way, it was just enough of an operating system to keep people on Windows for a long time. But it introduced so many problems. And it got such a wide footprint now.

05:50.920 --> 06:00.920
I would even go so far as to say, literally, it was the Windows XP era that retired me from PC repair. I literally was so done with it. I had a blood pressure issue because of it. It was so bad.

06:00.920 --> 06:13.920
I feel the same way. I feel exactly the same way. It really burned me out on PC repair. And then in later years, after 7 had been out for a while, I was so frustrated that all these people weren't switching to it that I was still supporting XP.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.920
It is one of the major reasons I said, screw it. I'm done.

06:17.920 --> 06:26.920
For me, it has not been a good 13-year run. Now, I understand that for a lot of people, it has. But for me, it was a nightmare the entire time from the day that operating system shipped.

06:26.920 --> 06:41.920
But see, for me, I can't put 100% blame on the operating system. You know, part of me is, you've got to also place blame on the, I'm sorry to say, dumbass user who just says, alright, well, I'm just going to go to this not really good website.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.920
And I'm going to keep using IE when I could put Firefox on this machine.

06:44.920 --> 06:49.920
Or Chrome or whatever. Or Netscape or whatever.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.920
Picture.exe, that's my favorite.

06:51.920 --> 06:59.920
Let me open up this attachment willy-nilly. There's not enough user responsibility when it comes to these things.

06:59.920 --> 07:11.920
Even when an operating system is secure, say like OS X or you're typing in a password or authentication to install a program, people will still blindly say, alright, yeah, yeah, go, go, go, go.

07:11.920 --> 07:20.920
I feel like it actually doesn't happen quite as much on operating systems that require a password. Like you're on today, you're on the Ubuntu 14.04 for the first time.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.920
This is a brand new release. I got it loaded on my Bonobo. I'm getting ready for our big review on the Linux Action Show.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.920
What is your first impression just looking at the UI? Is it clean to you? Does it seem modern? What are your first thoughts when you look at it?

07:31.920 --> 07:36.920
Well, there's pullaways from both Windows and Mac that I feel when I use it okay.

07:36.920 --> 07:44.920
But part of the issues that I have is some of the familiarities like, for example, the menu bar, a menu bar.

07:44.920 --> 07:53.920
Right now I'm using XChat. I was also using Skype earlier. How long did it take for us to find stupid settings?

07:53.920 --> 07:59.920
There's a particular bug because there's not a little app indicator up in the tray, which will probably be fixed soon since this is a beta.

07:59.920 --> 08:06.920
But those are the kind of small intangibles where, you know, if I was making a transition from one thing to another.

08:06.920 --> 08:13.920
Well, let me actually back this up a little bit. You know, making a transition, say, from a Windows world or from a Mac world to a Linux world.

08:13.920 --> 08:22.920
One of my biggest roadblocks that I have is you have thousands. I don't know if thousands, but you have multiple flavors of Linux.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.920
Yeah, you have multiple ways of installing it. Has that been a barrier?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.920
Or have you always heard the name Ubuntu?

08:29.920 --> 08:36.920
Of course I've heard of Ubuntu. I've actually messed around with a live distro probably a few years ago on an older laptop.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.920
But it's one of those things where, what do you go with?

08:39.920 --> 08:46.920
I mean, one site that I used to go to quite often was DistroWatch. I don't know if that still exists.

08:46.920 --> 08:52.920
And I would just go and look at the list and I'd go, all right, well, I'll just take whatever's at the top and just mess around with it.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.920
And so you don't know what to go with. I mean, at least in the Windows world, you know what to go with.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
If you're in the OS X world, you know what you're going with.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.920
I'm surprised it hasn't just sort of settled on Ubuntu for a lot of Windows switchers.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.920
It seems like that's sort of the narrative that's out there, but maybe it's because we're so close.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.920
See, this is one of the reasons I wanted to have you on today because I've been following it so long now,

09:09.920 --> 09:15.920
and I've been switched over for so long that I've kind of lost perspective on what it would be like to come to it with fresh eyes.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.920
So to me, it seems like the obvious choice from the far outside is just Ubuntu because that's the one you hear the most about.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.920
So that'd probably be the one you want to use. So we're going to pick your brain about that.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.920
But why don't we first do a little follow-up, a little feedback, as we like to do here on the show from last week.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.920
That way we keep the continuity thread. We're not a syndicated Star Trek series here on the show.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
Well, it should be.

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
We have story arcs.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
It should be, absolutely.

09:36.920 --> 09:37.920
Yeah, maybe, actually.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.920
I'll be Worf. I'm putting that out there. I will do Worf.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
All right. Okay, Chase, who do you want to be?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
Oh, I've got to be Data.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.920
Well, then all right. So I either have to be – I guess I'm Riker because I have a beard.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
Yeah, do Riker. Riker, right.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.920
Can you do the Captain Morgan, please?

09:50.920 --> 09:54.920
You know what I could do is – you know what I have a little bit right here? Check this out.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.920
Oh, wait. I muted it.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.920
Because he pipes up too much.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.920
Computer, what happened?

09:59.920 --> 10:00.920
There we go. I got a little –

10:00.920 --> 10:01.920
Computer, what happened?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.920
Is that from like season one or two when he was just more of the stupidish Picard where –

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
Ah, maybe.

10:06.920 --> 10:11.920
That's what it sounds like. It sounds like from the early, early seasons where he didn't know what to do.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
Yeah, I just was talking to a guy who's rewatching –

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Hey, let's see what's out there.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.920
I was just talking to a guy who's rewatching TNG and he's like, so is this show really preachy?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
I'm like, yeah, for the first couple seasons.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Yeah.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
He's like, oh, okay. So it gets better? I'm like, yes.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
Yeah, the Roddenberry.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.920
It's very Roddenberry.

10:24.920 --> 10:25.920
Yeah, Roddenberry.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
Don't hate on Roddenberry.

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
No, no.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.920
I'm just saying – I'm just saying I'm a Deep Space Nine guy for a reason.

10:30.920 --> 10:31.920
All right.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.920
No, me too, by the way. I love DS9.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
Oh, geez.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
DS9 is my favorite. I love DS9.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
Great minds. Just putting it out there.

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
Yeah, hey.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.920
DS9 would not exist if it were not for TNG and the universe that they created.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
Fair.

10:43.920 --> 10:49.920
No, and by the way, side trivia, you know, the one guy outside the computer, Majel Roddenberry,

10:49.920 --> 10:53.920
Miles O'Brien on the most Star Trek episodes out of any of them.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
He's a Miles.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.920
Out of any of them.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.920
I would have liked to have seen him show up in Voyager once or twice.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
Agreed.

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
Didn't he?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.920
All right. So last week we talked a little bit about Mr. One Leo Laporte.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
Remember, he had a little –

11:05.920 --> 11:06.920
A tech guy.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.920
He had a little – he had a few things to say about Linux.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.920
There's all the software you'd want.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.920
And he had good things to say, but he also had to say –

11:12.920 --> 11:14.920
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
Oh, that hurt a little bit.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Oh.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.920
It hurt a little bit, and we got some feedback on that.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.920
We got a lot of feedback on that, but I didn't want to spend a lot of time dwelling on it

11:22.920 --> 11:26.920
because I think we said our piece, and I didn't really want to make this into a bashing thing,

11:26.920 --> 11:30.920
but I did – I wanted to – Ben Frank like – what is this?

11:30.920 --> 11:33.920
Ben Franklin Gates.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
Ben Franklin Gates.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Ben Franklin Gates wrote in.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
There you go.

11:36.920 --> 11:41.920
He says, I agree on how unfortunate it has been for someone in his position with experience

11:41.920 --> 11:44.920
would throw down a blanket statement about Linux,

11:44.920 --> 11:47.920
but I've noticed something about Leo over the years.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.920
My theory is that there are two Leo Laports.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.920
Wait, wait.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.920
He's cloned himself?

11:53.920 --> 11:54.920
Two Leo Laports.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.920
Transporter accident.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.920
He's Thomas Riker.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
I was going to say, do we have the evil Riker?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.920
Oh, my God.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
Where's the real Riker?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.920
He's been stuck down there for a while, and he's a little bit –

12:06.920 --> 12:07.920
You're wearing the gold shirt.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.920
I knew it.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.920
And my beard actually peels off.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.920
That was a great DS9 episode.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.920
That was so good.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.920
That was so good.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.920
Oh, man.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.920
So here's the two Leos.

12:17.920 --> 12:22.920
You have one who answers questions for noobs and plays the childish grandpa figure

12:22.920 --> 12:25.920
and articulates those sponsor commercials in his innocent golden voice.

12:25.920 --> 12:30.920
Then there's the real Leo, the real that mostly comes out on Twit when he's among his peers.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
He speaks his mind critically and in general shows more of himself than he likes to let on,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.920
like when Dover walks around to poke him.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.920
I think that Leo did not genuinely mean what he said when he discouraged Linux.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.920
He was just wearing his childish grandpa hat to explain how useful and compelling Linux is

12:44.920 --> 12:46.920
would have meant to break out of character.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
What do you think, Chase?

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
I actually agree with that.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
What do you think, Matt?

12:49.920 --> 12:50.920
Go ahead, Matt.

12:50.920 --> 12:51.920
I agree.

12:51.920 --> 12:52.920
I actually agree with that.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.920
I think – because looking back on what I said, saying that my statement was that he does know better,

12:55.920 --> 12:58.920
and he does know better, so that actually – yeah, I can see that happening.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.920
Chase, are there two Leos?

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
Yeah.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
Oh, absolutely.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.920
I mean, obviously, when he does his nationally syndicated show over the weekend,

13:05.920 --> 13:09.920
he's appealing to the, dare I say, 55-plus audience.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.920
And I've noticed that he even kind of sometimes speaks in a little bit of a southern twang.

13:12.920 --> 13:19.920
Yeah, you know, he's very slow and deliberate, and he knows he needs to convey a message

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
and also plug his network.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
But, you know, that's the thing, though.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.920
He's on the air, and he's providing stupid support calls for people.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.920
Right.

13:28.920 --> 13:29.920
And, you know, it's true.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.920
I think, yeah, he was assuming a little bit about his audience based on the demo.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.920
These people are probably not smart enough for what I'm about to tell them.

13:35.920 --> 13:40.920
And if you're an advanced user, you're not going to be listening to his show anyway, for the most part.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.920
Unless you want to pull clips to make fun of him.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.920
Right, right.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.920
I mean, I'm not a fan of that.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.920
You know, but, I mean, you're not going to go to listen to the tech guy on the weekend

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
to learn about the latest tech news.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.920
No, but this –

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
After Kim Commando.

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
Yeah, exactly.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.920
This goes back to my point where I think the most potential for Linux switchers are people like yourself

13:56.920 --> 14:01.920
who are technically qualified to install a distribution, to download an ISO and burn it to a CD.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.920
But I would say this, though, if I'm listening to his show casually over the weekend,

14:04.920 --> 14:08.920
because I'm a tech fan, you know, I listen to Leo and I follow Leo for a while,

14:08.920 --> 14:13.920
and maybe I'm considering Linux and then I hear statements from him about it,

14:13.920 --> 14:16.920
it could potentially make me go, you know –

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
That's what I was worried about.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.920
You know, maybe I won't even bother.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.920
Now, I know better, you know, I've learned and I have an open mind about things,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.920
but not a lot of people may have that.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.920
Yeah, that's what I was worried about last week.

14:28.920 --> 14:33.920
It was sort of that – the drive-by impression for people who are looking at their options right now.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
I agree.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.920
They get Grandpa Leo's advice and they go, ah, you know what, I'm going to do that Chromebook instead,

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
or, oh, you know what, I'm going to do that Windows 8 machine.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.920
Well, you know, the thing is, you know, a lot of people that probably don't even consider the Chromebook,

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
or they consider other things like that.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.920
They just stick to what they know.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.920
They'll stick to Windows because that's what the majority of people know.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.920
They're afraid.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.920
And what Leo does, it doesn't encourage that openness.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
Right.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.920
That experimentation.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.920
And it's very, very scary, and not only that, then no one learns anything.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.920
And it keeps you listening because you've got to keep getting them tips.

15:02.920 --> 15:03.920
Right after these messages.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.920
Right.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.920
In fact, why don't we take a break right here, just as Leo would do,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.920
because our next message is going to prove me wrong.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
I've been saying this for technical users.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.920
Our next email says it's not for technical users at all.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.920
It's better for brand new users, and he's got a compelling argument why.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
But first, let me tell you about my mobile phone provider.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
Yeah, my mobile phone provider, Ting.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.920
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.920
No BS mobile service provider, no contracts, no early termination fee,

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
and you only pay for what you use.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.920
This has been a lifesaver for me over the last few weeks

15:32.920 --> 15:35.920
as we've been working out of the studio having Ting,

15:35.920 --> 15:38.920
having to be able to just click or tap, I should say,

15:38.920 --> 15:41.920
a button in my Android device and have Wi-Fi come on

15:41.920 --> 15:43.920
and know that I'm just paying for what I use.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.920
Because everything on Ting is pay for what you use.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.920
You turn on hotspot, tethering, text messaging, picture messaging.

15:48.920 --> 15:49.920
You just pay for what you use.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
They take your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
They add them all up at the end of the month.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.920
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.920
And it makes so much sense.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.920
And in fact, Chase, check this out.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
So I got the Nexus 5, as you know, on the Ting network, right?

16:01.920 --> 16:02.920
Yep.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.920
So I hit this Ting button, this app right here on my phone.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.920
Watching you do that right now.

16:05.920 --> 16:06.920
And I could do the dashboard too.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.920
I mean, they have a really, like the Ting dashboard.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
Like the web app, or are you talking about the one?

16:10.920 --> 16:11.920
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:11.920 --> 16:12.920
So they have an awesome web app.

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
Whoa, hi there.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.920
Check that out.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
Ooh, it's a media.

16:15.920 --> 16:16.920
I didn't know I had the music pipe.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
It's called a multimedia.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.920
So they have the dashboard, but also right here on the phone,

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
which I'm not showing on the screen,

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
I have all of the same information available to me

16:24.920 --> 16:25.920
at the tap of a button.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
I can see, like, I've used 20 megabytes.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
Rekai has used zero megabytes for this billion period

16:29.920 --> 16:30.920
because he's always on Wi-Fi.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.920
Yeah, so you can always see which category you're in.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
Yeah, and when you have multiple devices, it's really easy.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.920
But even when you have one device, you want to track your usage.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
It's straightforward.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
It's very easy.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
I can see minutes, messages, megabytes.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
I can set alerts.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.920
I can activate, deactivate devices, set up call forwarding

16:44.920 --> 16:46.920
for both devices, all from the mobile app

16:46.920 --> 16:49.920
or from the web standards app that they have on the web

16:49.920 --> 16:51.920
where you can even just, like, I've actually never even needed

16:51.920 --> 16:52.920
to call Ting.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.920
I've always activated my phones through the Ting dashboard,

16:55.920 --> 16:56.920
transferred phones through the Ting dashboard.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.920
When Matt activated his Note 2, he did it through the Ting dashboard.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
That's right.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
The great thing is, like, if you ever got stuck,

17:02.920 --> 17:06.920
you call my 1-855-TING-FTW, and an actual person answers the phone.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
And I'll tell you something.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.920
I don't know if they want me to share this story or not,

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
but we got an email from a viewer who was like,

17:12.920 --> 17:16.920
I wasn't in a position to get Ting, but I called them up

17:16.920 --> 17:19.920
and talked to their support reps about my options on another network

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
and just, like, they helped me pick the right phone for me

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
because they were on disability and they had a very limited budget.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
Wow.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
And they were getting a government-sponsored phone,

17:25.920 --> 17:28.920
and Ting helped them, like, through the process,

17:28.920 --> 17:30.920
even though they weren't going to get a sale at the end of the day.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.920
And this is the thing about Ting is they're just an awesome company.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.920
And to that end, on their blog, they just put up a post,

17:37.920 --> 17:40.920
the top six reasons why students should never sign a cell phone contract.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.920
And this is something you really want to go through if you're a student.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.920
And by the way, if you are a student, Ting also has a promotional program

17:46.920 --> 17:48.920
for students that is awesome.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.920
They'll get you a ton of free minutes if you help spread the word about Ting,

17:50.920 --> 17:51.920
so you want to read up on that.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.920
And if you're in a contract right now, they'll help you get out of that contract.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.920
You can go to ting.com slash ETF.

17:56.920 --> 17:57.920
But do me a favor.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.920
Go to linux.ting.com.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.920
Linux.ting.com, that lets them know you heard about it right here on this show,

18:03.920 --> 18:06.920
but it also will save you $25 off your first device.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.920
If you're going to bring your own device and they've got a BYOD page

18:09.920 --> 18:12.920
where you can find out what devices you can bring, lots of good Android devices,

18:12.920 --> 18:16.920
the iPhone 4, 4S, and the iPhone 5, you can also bring those over.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
If you bring your own device, they'll take $25 off your first month.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.920
For some folks like me, that means your first month is free.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.920
When you add up the ETF, the total savings over the life of your plan,

18:26.920 --> 18:28.920
because there's no contract here, so you just keep getting the value

18:28.920 --> 18:31.920
every single month by paying for what you use.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.920
And when you consider that $25 discount, it's an incredible deal.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.920
So go to linux.ting.com.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.920
That lets them know that you appreciate them keeping us on the air

18:38.920 --> 18:42.920
and they have a savings calculator right there for you to plug in your current bill

18:42.920 --> 18:44.920
and see if maybe you could save a bunch of money.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.920
And start actually helping clean up the mobile industry,

18:47.920 --> 18:51.920
because at the end of the day, what Ting is doing is providing genuine,

18:51.920 --> 18:56.920
valid competition that the duopoly that runs the mobile industry in the US

18:56.920 --> 18:58.920
so far has not had to answer to.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.920
And finally, finally, somebody is challenging them,

19:01.920 --> 19:03.920
making them clean up the way they do business,

19:03.920 --> 19:06.920
forcing them to provide everyone better service,

19:06.920 --> 19:08.920
forcing them to expand their networks,

19:08.920 --> 19:11.920
and you can help be part of that by going to linux.ting.com,

19:11.920 --> 19:14.920
sign up for Ting, and forcing the hands of that duopoly

19:14.920 --> 19:16.920
to treat everyone a little bit better.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.920
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.920
Linux.ting.com.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.920
I've said it before and I'll say it again,

19:25.920 --> 19:28.920
once I'm out of my freaking contract and I know...

19:28.920 --> 19:29.920
We're going to have a party.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
Yeah, I'm ready to rock.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.920
Yeah, all right.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.920
So let's talk about Urban120's email.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
He wrote in and said,

19:37.920 --> 19:41.920
Linux is actually easier for new users than it is for the technically inclined.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.920
And I was like, what?

19:43.920 --> 19:44.920
What?

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
He says, hi Chris and Matt and Chase.

19:46.920 --> 19:47.920
Hi.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.920
Thanks for making awesome shows.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.920
I regularly listen to LastLinux Unplugged and TechSnap.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.920
Well, thank you, Urban120.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.920
Now go listen to Unfilter and Coder Radio and SciByte

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
and FoShow and BSD Now.

19:58.920 --> 19:59.920
Where have you been?

19:59.920 --> 20:03.920
He says, I actually think that Linux is easier to use for the average user

20:03.920 --> 20:06.920
when something goes wrong or when they don't know how to do something.

20:06.920 --> 20:07.920
It's simple.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.920
The answer is the terminal.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.920
If something goes wrong in Linux, you can usually solve it from the terminal.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.920
And if you're talking with someone on a phone,

20:15.920 --> 20:18.920
it is much easier to dictate what they need to type

20:18.920 --> 20:21.920
than how to navigate them through menus or options, which is very true.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.920
We were just trying to navigate you through Skype.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.920
If I could have just told you what to type in the terminal,

20:25.920 --> 20:26.920
that would have been a lot easier.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.920
He says, Urban says, this happened to me a while ago.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.920
I installed Manjaro on a friend's computer.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.920
My friend called me to ask me how to install TeamSpeak on Linux.

20:36.920 --> 20:42.920
I replied, press Control-Alt-T, type in PACKMAN-S, TeamSpeak 3.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
And in a minute, his problem was solved.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.920
Easy as that.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.920
If I want to tell him that in Windows or any other OS with a non-CLI method,

20:49.920 --> 20:51.920
it would have taken much more time.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.920
Thanks for making the awesome shows, Urban120.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.920
Do you think his premise there requires a Linux expert in the wings

20:57.920 --> 20:59.920
to help him out?

20:59.920 --> 21:03.920
Boy, you know, I think in some circumstances that makes sense.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.920
But for example, installing a package, certainly.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
If you're troubleshooting something, though,

21:07.920 --> 21:10.920
you know, command line is not always going to be that helpful

21:10.920 --> 21:12.920
unless you're trying to actually pull down error messages

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
and then actually send them to a forum.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.920
What I like about the terminal, though, is that, you know,

21:16.920 --> 21:19.920
like say I sent Chase home with the Bonobo, which would never happen.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
But let's say I sent Chase home.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
Wait, wait, that was part of the deal of me being here today.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.920
That is my baby. My baby.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
You have three upstairs.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
Shared custody, boys. Shared custody.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.920
All right, we'll work something out.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.920
I could open up the SSH port.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.920
I could have Chase forward SSH on his router, or I could do it.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.920
And then if Chase ever had a problem, I could SSH into his box

21:38.920 --> 21:40.920
and pretty much fix it from the command line for him.

21:40.920 --> 21:41.920
Is that code for something?

21:41.920 --> 21:42.920
No.

21:42.920 --> 21:43.920
Okay.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
Sounds a little dirty, though.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
It does.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
Sounds a little dirty.

21:46.920 --> 21:51.920
Well, I mean, so there is definitely an advantage to the terminal.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
I guess what I like about it is that there's an option there.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
There's a route there.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
I feel like everything that the user would want to adjust

21:56.920 --> 22:01.920
in the normal course of using their computer needs to have a GUI way to do it.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.920
But if you're going to get crazy, like anything,

22:04.920 --> 22:06.920
here's the Windows equivalent, Chase, and I think,

22:06.920 --> 22:07.920
tell me if you're comfortable with this.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.920
I say any time you do something that is equivalent to editing the registry

22:11.920 --> 22:14.920
or a config.ini file on Windows,

22:14.920 --> 22:17.920
it's fair to also have to open up the terminal on Linux.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
Like, they're equivalent there.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
If you're comfortable in going to the registry,

22:20.920 --> 22:21.920
you should be comfortable going to the terminal.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.920
But the thing is, it's honestly very rare for me to have to go in the registry.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
And I think it probably is.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.920
This makes it seem like more of the norm to do the terminal thing.

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
Does that scare you?

22:31.920 --> 22:37.920
Well, no, it doesn't scare me, but why should you have to go down to that level

22:37.920 --> 22:40.920
when it should be good from the start?

22:40.920 --> 22:45.920
What if it has always been better to do it from the terminal

22:45.920 --> 22:48.920
and all of the options that we've been working on to get away from that

22:48.920 --> 22:52.920
have actually been more in error and just having a more concise, easy,

22:52.920 --> 22:56.920
available way to do it via the terminal through some basic commands?

22:56.920 --> 22:59.920
Nothing overly complicated.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.920
Maybe that actually is the superior way to manage these types of things.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.920
You know, maybe if there was a show that would walk me through...

23:06.920 --> 23:08.920
To show you how to do these things on Linux?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.920
How to walk through commands and do certain things.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
Like a how-to Linux show?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.920
You know, that would be nice to do.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.920
But it's one of those things where the user,

23:16.920 --> 23:21.920
when they're walking into this world and they're moving into a Linux world,

23:21.920 --> 23:23.920
they're not even going to know anything to do.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.920
I mean, all they know is, I have this distro.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.920
I'm going to put it in my disk drive, if they have a disk drive,

23:30.920 --> 23:32.920
and they're going to try to install it.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.920
Well, you know, I'll tell you, I just installed that 14.04 install last night,

23:36.920 --> 23:44.920
and so far I've installed Chromium, Skype, and Flux, like the screen-flux app.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.920
But none of that.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.920
I haven't had to open the terminal once to do any of that.

23:48.920 --> 23:53.920
And to be fair, there are a number of GUI tweak tools that are gaining in power.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.920
They're actually becoming very powerful and quite good.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.920
So I would like, I think it was Windows tweak,

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
or I forget exactly what the Windows equivalent was,

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
but Windows power tools, I think is what it was.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.920
Very much like that, where you can really get under the hood and play with stuff.

24:05.920 --> 24:10.920
Yeah, I'm just thinking the basic common user, they're just not going to do that.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
True.

24:11.920 --> 24:15.920
Even as an advanced user, I rarely have to go to the command window in Windows.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.920
I mean, there are certain things, with the exception of the problem that I was having the other night

24:19.920 --> 24:25.920
where I sent you a Viber or whatever, and I was ready to destroy my computer,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.920
and I was ready to give up technology.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
What was going on? I don't remember. Oh, that's right.

24:29.920 --> 24:35.920
So on certain files in Windows, when I right-clicked on certain files,

24:35.920 --> 24:39.920
Explorer would crash because there was something going on with the contextual menu.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
And do you remember what my response was to that?

24:41.920 --> 24:47.920
I was like, yeah, everybody talks about Windows like, oh, it's modern.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
Oh, God, no.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.920
To this point, Windows is like, okay, this feels like it's straight out of 1989.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
There are some aspects that feel real old and busted.

24:55.920 --> 25:01.920
And I'm jumping through old system tools to find the contextual menu that is bugged

25:01.920 --> 25:06.920
so I can pull it out of there without having to reinstall my whole freaking operating system.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.920
Yeah, it can happen in Windows, too.

25:09.920 --> 25:18.920
See, what I wanted to try to float past you is the concept that I feel like almost we've been marketed

25:18.920 --> 25:21.920
to believe that the terminal is like this thing we shouldn't have to do.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.920
Like if you have to go to the terminal, it's a failure.

25:23.920 --> 25:30.920
It is a failure in a sense of providing and exposing a way to do something via a GUI.

25:30.920 --> 25:36.920
And I think in reality, and I think if you look at what Microsoft is doing,

25:36.920 --> 25:39.920
Microsoft's high-end tools, they're going command line.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.920
They're going PowerShell, server core, right?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.920
Everything that you now do when you administer an exchange box,

25:44.920 --> 25:49.920
all of that GUI is doing is executing PowerShells underneath the hood.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.920
And you could open up PowerShell, and you could actually just execute those same commands.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
Same with Latter-day.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
And Microsoft is now moving that direction.

25:55.920 --> 26:02.920
And I believe part of it was this marketing hype to get us to buy these new-fangled computers

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
and, oh, my God, you no longer have to use the command line.

26:04.920 --> 26:10.920
And the reality is, in some ways, the command line is the superior way to do it.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
It is the most efficient way.

26:11.920 --> 26:17.920
And I've also worked with users who are completely and totally computer illiterate

26:17.920 --> 26:22.920
who had no problem if you just gave them instructions using the command line.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.920
Well, you know, I would even go so far as to say I would agree with you

26:25.920 --> 26:29.920
if we were to have a Windows Wiki and a Linux Wiki,

26:29.920 --> 26:33.920
and we were telling people to basically use those as your tools to solve your problem.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.920
At that point, when I can copy and paste those commands and drop them in a terminal,

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
then I agree with you on that.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
Because then there's no room for mistyping.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.920
There's no room for mistakes.

26:42.920 --> 26:43.920
Boom, done, bam.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
Let me say this, though.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.920
The danger in that, and I've seen it so many times,

26:47.920 --> 26:52.920
where people blindly follow instructions, and they can cause some serious harm.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.920
Well, that's what happened to Leo in our last show.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.920
Right.

26:55.920 --> 26:56.920
This is true.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.920
And they just blindly copy commands based on a Wiki where someone can obviously,

26:59.920 --> 27:04.920
you know, if they edit it at the impromptu time, then all of a sudden...

27:04.920 --> 27:06.920
Or the command's old or whatever.

27:06.920 --> 27:12.920
I guess, you know, part of the thing a GUI gives the user is a sense of security

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
and a step-by-step approach.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.920
If somebody's managing the details for you behind the scenes,

27:16.920 --> 27:17.920
you're not going to mess something up.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.920
Oh, yeah, okay.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.920
Right.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.920
Or there's protectionary measures like, oh, you forgot to type this specific thing in.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.920
And when you're working in the command line, if you forget a character or you forget a dash

27:27.920 --> 27:30.920
or you forget something that you're supposed to do,

27:30.920 --> 27:33.920
sometimes it doesn't really give you full feedback of what you missed.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
I think what you can equate that to is abstraction.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.920
And I think anytime you layer on too much abstraction, it's too much.

27:38.920 --> 27:39.920
I'll give you an example.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.920
My wife had to get our sunroof repaired, and we had a rental that, you know,

27:42.920 --> 27:45.920
they just gave us while we had the work done.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.920
And they no longer had first and second and third gear.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.920
It was just L and drive.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.920
Yeah.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
I don't like that.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.920
That is too much abstraction.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
I want to know what gear the car's in.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.920
Like, to me, that is a bit of data that is relevant to how I drive.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
Right.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
And I feel the same way with the computer.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.920
I feel like sometimes too much abstraction, when I'm on the line to make something work,

28:06.920 --> 28:07.920
is a bad thing.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.920
Now, I will say this.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.920
If they took away the command line from Windows from me, for example, I would be livid.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.920
I mean, I like having the flexibility and the ability to go in and do certain commands

28:18.920 --> 28:23.920
and do certain things, you know, like I use a lot of the network tools from command line to this day,

28:23.920 --> 28:27.920
releasing and renewing an IP address is a great example.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
Trace routes, you know, things like that.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.920
I will always do that from the command line because it's the most efficient way of doing it.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.920
I don't need a GUI to do that.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.920
Well, Urban120 has joined us in the Mumble Room,

28:37.920 --> 28:41.920
and he had a little follow-up to his email about Linux being easier for new users.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.920
Urban, what did you want to add?

28:44.920 --> 28:50.920
I would just like to add that GUI is great, and I actually prefer it.

28:50.920 --> 29:02.920
But if you need to do just something simple with someone that doesn't know how to use computers,

29:02.920 --> 29:07.920
it's much simpler to just say what he needs to do in a simple way.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.920
In Terminal, it helps you do that.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.920
Right, you can explain it to him over the phone, and you don't have to be vague like,

29:14.920 --> 29:21.920
yeah, click on this thing, it should be about in the left corner, and then you should see this option, click that.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.920
I don't see that option.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.920
No, you need to click the square, not the circle, then you'll see that option.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.920
Like, that's very hard to do over the phone.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.920
And I've done it plenty of times, and that's why I've probably tried just about every decent remote desktop solution that's out there,

29:33.920 --> 29:36.920
so that way I didn't have to be stuck in that very situation.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.920
So, I agree, Urban.

29:38.920 --> 29:46.920
Yeah, and if you have text, he can tell you what he just read, and you can tell it back to him,

29:46.920 --> 29:50.920
and you say, okay, just do that, and it's much simpler over the phone.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.920
But you need someone that knows how to use networks.

29:54.920 --> 30:00.920
And on top of that, you could even email them, like, do this, you know, type this in, that kind of stuff.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.920
Alright, Chase, well, I want to pick your brain a little bit about some of the things that,

30:04.920 --> 30:09.920
I know you mentioned the mini distro aspect, but I know there's more things that, as a computer enthusiast,

30:09.920 --> 30:12.920
as a technology enthusiast, that have kept you from switching to Linux,

30:12.920 --> 30:15.920
because, I mean, you've had plenty of opportunities and thought about it,

30:15.920 --> 30:17.920
so we're going to talk about that here in just a second.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
But first, I want to thank our second sponsor this week.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.920
It is the awesome folks at DigitalOcean.

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
Who is DigitalOcean?

30:23.920 --> 30:28.920
Well, they are a company that has based their entire technology stack off of Linux.

30:28.920 --> 30:33.920
And if you use the promo code unpluggedapril, you're going to get two months of a DigitalOcean droplet for free.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.920
If you haven't heard about DigitalOcean before, they are a simple cloud hosting provider

30:36.920 --> 30:40.920
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

30:40.920 --> 30:45.920
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month

30:45.920 --> 30:52.920
for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer for $5.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.920
It's a fixed cost. You know exactly what you're going to pay.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.920
And DigitalOcean has data selling locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

31:00.920 --> 31:05.920
Boy, I'd love to go to Amsterdam and just say I'm going for sponsor reasons.

31:05.920 --> 31:10.920
But the best part, I've got sponsor problems. I've got to go. I've got to go to Amsterdam.

31:10.920 --> 31:15.920
The interface over on DigitalOcean is super simple, intuitive.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.920
Power users can also replicate on a larger scale.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.920
And what I love about it is somebody who appreciates good design.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.920
And also, Chase, I think you can relate to this.

31:23.920 --> 31:28.920
You and I both really focus on the content of our podcast.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.920
Every aspect of them. We're very particular about what we put out.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.920
All of the quality from top to bottom.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.920
DigitalOcean is exactly the same way.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.920
They come up with a concept. They come up with a feature.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.920
They make sure it fits within their narrative for what their users need.

31:42.920 --> 31:48.920
And then they just refine and refine and iterate on that until it is absolutely perfect.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.920
Their control panel reflects that. Their API reflects that.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.920
And the technology that DigitalOcean sits on top of reflects that.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.920
SSDs, KVM, tier one bandwidth.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.920
All servers come with a gigabit a second network interfaces.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.920
And you get that terabyte just fixed right there.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
They run all on top of amazing hardware.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.920
And all backed by that simple control panel.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.920
Private networking is also available.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.920
Global image transfers. There's so many great options.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.920
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code unpluggedapril.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.920
That will give you a $10 credit.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.920
So you can grab that $5 a month rig and try it out for two months.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.920
There is a Google Plus community.

32:25.920 --> 32:30.920
There's actually a couple of Google Plus community threads going right now on the Jupiter Colony Google Plus community.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.920
About what folks are using their DigitalOcean droplets for.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.920
Minecraft servers.

32:35.920 --> 32:42.920
These are a crazy great way to run Minecraft servers at an incredible value with amazing performance.

32:42.920 --> 32:46.920
You could go from $300 a month with your Minecraft server to $5 to $10 a month.

32:46.920 --> 32:50.920
You got a production website. Maybe the backend infrastructure for an app you're working on.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.920
Maybe you just need something to sync your contacts.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.920
Your BitTorrent sync files.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.920
And I don't know, maybe your Quasal IRC connector.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.920
Throw it up on a DigitalOcean droplet and it will cost you $5 per month.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.920
And if you use the promo code unpluggedapril, you'll get a $10 credit.

33:04.920 --> 33:07.920
DigitalOcean.com. Unpluggedapril.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.920
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

33:14.920 --> 33:17.920
So if you guys are looking for work out there, go over to DigitalOcean.com.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
Click that word hiring. They've got lots of gigs available.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
They're blowing up right now.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.920
It is awesome to watch this company go.

33:23.920 --> 33:28.920
And it is so cool. It is so amazing that Linux is powering this kind of growth in the industry.

33:28.920 --> 33:33.920
And it's exactly why some of the stuff we cover on this show has big, big long term ramifications

33:33.920 --> 33:36.920
for not just us, but the industry as a whole.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.920
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code unpluggedapril.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.920
Lovin' my droplet. Lovin' it.

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
Okay Chase.

33:43.920 --> 33:44.920
Yes.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
So.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.920
Yes.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.920
So I'm going to ask the distros. Because I feel like that's a bit of a cop out.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.920
Because you know you were going to go Ubuntu if you were going to do it.

33:52.920 --> 33:53.920
Not necessarily. No.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
Really?

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
Yeah, really.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
And the reason is simple.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.920
What if there's something better?

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
I mean, how do I know, right?

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
Well, there is.

34:00.920 --> 34:01.920
See?

34:01.920 --> 34:02.920
Oh!

34:02.920 --> 34:03.920
Oh no!

34:03.920 --> 34:04.920
See? See?

34:04.920 --> 34:05.920
Get in the mumble room so they can yell at me.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.920
Yeah, so I mean, that's just one thing, right?

34:07.920 --> 34:10.920
Or let's say I went with UnBootoo for a minute.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.920
Okay, there's different versions, right?

34:13.920 --> 34:17.920
Yeah, so when you go and download it, it's like, which one do I download?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
Different distops and different stuff.

34:19.920 --> 34:20.920
Right, right.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.920
I mean, there's multiple options of options.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.920
So you know too much, in a way.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.920
You know enough to be paralyzed by choice.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
Right.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.920
But not enough to make that choice.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
Right.

34:30.920 --> 34:36.920
And then there's the whole other areas of, okay, what are good resources for me to go for support?

34:36.920 --> 34:37.920
For example.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.920
Alright, some people may yell, alright, go to the Reddit.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
Go to Reddit.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
But what if I ask you the same thing about Windows?

34:43.920 --> 34:47.920
Well, the majority of my friends know Windows, so I just go to them, right?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.920
Ah, yes.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.920
Right.

34:50.920 --> 34:56.920
You know, and part of the thing is, and maybe this is a stereotype, and maybe I'm wrong on this,

34:56.920 --> 35:02.920
but as a Windows user maybe making my way into the Linux world and saying,

35:02.920 --> 35:06.920
hey, I'm wanting to step my foot in the water, I want to learn how to swim,

35:06.920 --> 35:13.920
I feel I get two different responses, either, ew, you're a Windows guy, I hate you,

35:13.920 --> 35:19.920
or then you get five or six, seven or eight different suggestions on what you should be doing.

35:19.920 --> 35:20.920
Ah, yes.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
We've run into that too.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
We've talked about that.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.920
So the community can be a bit of a barrier.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.920
Like you feel like you go down a path and then you get yelled at for going down that path.

35:27.920 --> 35:28.920
Right.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.920
And then when you do go down that path, then you have eight different options,

35:30.920 --> 35:33.920
and if you don't pick the right one, you don't open the right door,

35:33.920 --> 35:35.920
then you're going to get abused for it.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.920
We've talked about this too.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
We've wondered if that's a problem.

35:39.920 --> 35:43.920
And I wonder too if that's not just the Internet.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.920
If you got a Mac and then you got one text editor,

35:46.920 --> 35:49.920
wouldn't then a bunch of advocates of another text editor jump on you?

35:49.920 --> 35:53.920
But that's a little bit different than an operating system choice, I feel,

35:53.920 --> 35:56.920
because everybody has their preferences for apps,

35:56.920 --> 35:58.920
but now you're breaking it down to an OS level.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.920
Everybody has their preference for OS.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.920
I mean, I've seen it in the JB community.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.920
People love Ubuntu or they like BSD.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Or Arch.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
Or Arch.

36:08.920 --> 36:09.920
Or OpenSUSE.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.920
Right.

36:10.920 --> 36:11.920
There's so many different options.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
And so what do I go with?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.920
What would be the best for me?

36:15.920 --> 36:17.920
And then someone may go, well, what programs do you use or whatever?

36:17.920 --> 36:23.920
And then it's like, is there a simple resource to say, all right, well, I like using Final Cut.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.920
It works great for me on Mac.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.920
Some people said, well, you could use Premiere on Windows.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.920
And I'm like, yeah, it's true, but I want something that is solid and works great.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.920
And I don't have to worry about doing weird conversions and stuff.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.920
And then another thing for me is I'm also a gamer.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.920
I know Steam is on Linux and that's great.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.920
But like a big game that I play right now, you know it.

36:44.920 --> 36:45.920
Battlefield.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.920
That's Origin, right?

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
Yeah.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
Linux?

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
Nope.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.920
So I'd have to do some sort of emulation, right?

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
Yeah.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.920
Or if that works.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.920
Or in some cases, Wine maybe, kind of, sort of, not really.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
Or maybe, you know, Dualboot.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.920
Yeah.

36:59.920 --> 37:00.920
What about Dualboot?

37:00.920 --> 37:01.920
What is that?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
So what does the Dualboot situation look like for you?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.920
Does that seem crazy to you?

37:05.920 --> 37:06.920
Well...

37:06.920 --> 37:08.920
Like, does it seem pointless in a way?

37:08.920 --> 37:09.920
I...

37:09.920 --> 37:12.920
The only Dualbooting I do is on Mac.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.920
You know, I do Bootcamp.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.920
And the only time I do that is when I...

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
If I'm going to do any type of gaming streaming, maybe.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.920
So it would be like, kind of like that.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.920
So if you have a Mac, you Dualboot between...

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
Only via PC, you Dualboot between Windows and Linux.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
Right.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
I just don't like Dualbooting that often.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.920
I just like turning it on and just going in, you know.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.920
So gaming is definitely a big barrier.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.920
And thankfully, that's a situation that is rapidly approving on the...

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
It is.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.920
No, and I agree with that.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.920
But then also, is SLI supported in Linux?

37:37.920 --> 37:39.920
See, I don't know if that is or not.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
Yeah.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.920
I'm an NVIDIA guy, so I don't know.

37:42.920 --> 37:43.920
You use SLI still?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
I don't mean to be judgy.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.920
No, no.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.920
I'm not trying to be judgy.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.920
I have NVIDIA 580 SLI graphic cards.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.920
Oh, okay, okay.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
So you got 580s.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.920
You're trying to squeak a little life out of it.

37:53.920 --> 37:54.920
Well, they are old.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.920
They're a couple of seasons old.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.920
Well, and NVIDIA's support in Linux is actually very friendly, actually.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.920
A nice little thing.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
They've got the great GUI that's actually what I use.

38:02.920 --> 38:03.920
It's what I prefer to use.

38:03.920 --> 38:04.920
It's actually pretty good.

38:04.920 --> 38:05.920
Yeah, I agree.

38:05.920 --> 38:06.920
Potentially.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.920
I could definitely see how certain games, you know, any app...

38:08.920 --> 38:11.920
Anytime you get application specifics like AutoCAD or Premiere, I can see how it's...

38:11.920 --> 38:14.920
Yeah, I'm not worried, obviously, on the website, I think.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.920
But then you start going into other areas, like, for example, the simplicity of, say,

38:19.920 --> 38:23.920
if you call it simplicity, of setting up a printer, you know.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.920
Okay.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.920
I would actually argue that's easier under Linux.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
Well, actually, I would know that.

38:27.920 --> 38:28.920
I mean...

38:28.920 --> 38:29.920
I think distro-specific.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
On some distros, it's stupid.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.920
It's actually way easier than on Windows.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.920
And on other distros, it's ridiculously stupid hard.

38:37.920 --> 38:38.920
So, it really depends.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
It definitely depends.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
It depends on the distro.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Yeah.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
Like, if you had a brand new Arch install, it'd take you forever.

38:42.920 --> 38:47.920
Like, if I started a poll right now on the last subreddit, I bet you $100 that I'm going

38:47.920 --> 38:49.920
to get so many fragments of things.

38:49.920 --> 38:50.920
Chase, this is your first...

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
Right.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
You need to use this.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
This is the best to use.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
This is what you should use.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
Yeah.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
I think that's a big problem.

38:56.920 --> 39:00.520
I think, too, there's always those specific things.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.920
I look at it like this.

39:01.920 --> 39:07.080
If you could do 80% of your computing under one operating system, that...

39:07.080 --> 39:12.280
So I guess what I come back to is, for me, what got me onto Linux was the technological

39:12.280 --> 39:13.640
curiosity of it.

39:13.640 --> 39:17.900
It fascinated me from a standpoint that there was an operating system, not necessarily controlled

39:17.900 --> 39:22.180
by any single company, that was created by a bunch of individuals that have come together

39:22.180 --> 39:24.320
to work on something.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.840
And I like that from a standpoint of...

39:27.840 --> 39:32.720
I'm not necessarily a fan of where either large computer OS manufacturer, commercial

39:32.720 --> 39:34.000
OS manufacturer, is going right now.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.480
I don't know if you've seen the mockups for OS 10.10.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
Have you seen them?

39:37.480 --> 39:38.480
No.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.820
They look like iOS 7, and it looks horrible.

39:41.820 --> 39:44.160
It looks really, really bad.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.000
And I definitely don't like the new Windows Start menu.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.560
I don't like any of the direction Windows is going either.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
No, I don't like it either.

39:48.560 --> 39:53.520
Like, for example, I'm staying on Windows 7, and I'm staying on 10.8.5 on OS X.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.760
So let's go four years down the road.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.480
You see how there could be some...

39:58.480 --> 40:03.760
There's a problem you run into here, where both these now, 10.8 and OS Windows 7, are

40:03.760 --> 40:06.520
getting pretty old, pretty long in the tooth.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.440
Ubuntu, you're using it right now.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.440
It looks pretty good.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
It looks pretty modern, right?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.760
You've got Chrome.

40:11.760 --> 40:18.280
It's just one of those things where there's certain things that...

40:18.280 --> 40:20.020
Gaming is a big one for me, right?

40:20.020 --> 40:24.000
It's huge for me, and I know there's Steam, and I know it's getting better.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.400
I mean, you were just telling me about the green lighting.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.480
If your favorite games were on Linux, let's just...

40:29.480 --> 40:30.840
Like we're talking four or five years down the road.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.120
If your favorite games were on Linux, so it's a whole new generation, maybe one or two generation

40:34.120 --> 40:36.460
of games have come out now.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.720
They've all shipped with Linux versions, the ones you want to play.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.060
Maybe not all games, but the ones you want to play have.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.520
Let's say that's removed.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.920
What now is the barrier?

40:44.920 --> 40:46.600
What is the problem from switching?

40:46.600 --> 40:51.240
The other things that I use, for example, you know me, I do a lot of game streaming,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.240
and so...

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
Multi-media productions.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.840
So Wirecast, for example, only Mac and PC.

40:56.840 --> 41:03.520
Open Broadcaster software, XSplit, some of these other programs, PC only.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.440
So I haven't seen a Linux equivalent to that.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.520
But you don't need that on every computer.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
And that's true.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.080
I worked with Webcam Studio, which was supposed to be an equivalent for Linux, but didn't

41:15.080 --> 41:19.680
quite work out as well as we'd hoped.

41:19.680 --> 41:24.080
For example, I think for a system that...

41:24.080 --> 41:30.720
Like a Skype machine for my production, or for example, a secondary box where I'm not

41:30.720 --> 41:37.020
doing main production stuff, or an older laptop that I haven't used in a while.

41:37.020 --> 41:43.080
Those are some situations where I could see myself installing something like this.

41:43.080 --> 41:48.400
This is very snappy to me, obviously I'm not doing anything hardcore with it, but it works

41:48.400 --> 41:49.680
for me.

41:49.680 --> 41:56.160
The other thing too, some of my experiences in the past, where the distribution didn't

41:56.160 --> 42:00.680
work with everything on my laptop perfectly, so I have to jump through...

42:00.680 --> 42:03.480
Now I understand people are going to say, well, you have to do that with Windows.

42:03.480 --> 42:07.360
But at least with Windows, it feels like I can install a driver easily.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.160
Has that changed?

42:09.160 --> 42:11.400
Yeah, a lot of that's improved over the years.

42:11.400 --> 42:16.360
Like for example, I installed the NVIDIA driver, I go to one screen and I choose which driver

42:16.360 --> 42:18.080
I want, and it just goes and installs it.

42:18.080 --> 42:22.120
For the most part now in Linux, it either works out of the box or it doesn't work.

42:22.120 --> 42:27.240
Because unlike Windows, all of the drivers are included at the kernel level in Linux,

42:27.240 --> 42:31.280
so when you install a distribution, it pretty much supports everything out of the box.

42:31.280 --> 42:35.840
Now I'll say this, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like with Linux,

42:35.840 --> 42:41.840
and this is one of the parts that really excite me, is I can really take full advantage of

42:41.840 --> 42:45.240
my system resources depending on what I'm doing.

42:45.240 --> 42:51.640
I always feel that with Windows, and even with Mac, that there's some bloated overhead

42:51.640 --> 42:56.440
or there's something happening that's hindering my full potential of using my system.

42:56.440 --> 43:01.840
And with Linux, I get this impression that it unlocks something, and it gives me more

43:01.840 --> 43:04.040
power behind it.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.720
So one of the things that's interesting, and it's kind of hard to translate, you can't

43:07.720 --> 43:13.520
put it on the side of a box, but on Windows and on Mac, this is a horse that I beat all

43:13.520 --> 43:18.800
the time on this show, but the file systems on both of those operating systems are very

43:18.800 --> 43:20.080
old now.

43:20.080 --> 43:25.420
But the thing is, if you think about the politics of a company that has to ship a product, it

43:25.420 --> 43:30.400
doesn't do them any good to make something that's really low level and something that

43:30.400 --> 43:35.040
the users never see, it doesn't do them much good to spend a lot of time and money on that.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.920
It's not a sexy feature they can put a bullet point on a box, right?

43:38.920 --> 43:43.480
But open source, everything's out there in the open, and when something sucks, everyone

43:43.480 --> 43:45.240
in the entire world can see it.

43:45.240 --> 43:49.900
And there's a peer pressure about keeping your components that you're responsible for

43:49.900 --> 43:51.600
up to date and modern.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.780
And so what ends up happening in Linux is a lot of the little things, you know, how

43:55.780 --> 43:58.440
an application talks to the file system, right?

43:58.440 --> 44:01.920
All these little things that Windows and Mac and Apple, they just can't really care about

44:01.920 --> 44:05.040
because they can't advertise it as something they've spent time on.

44:05.040 --> 44:09.520
But in Linux, there's this open pressure to keep all of that lower level stuff really

44:09.520 --> 44:10.520
tight.

44:10.520 --> 44:13.560
Not only that, not only because they're constantly pushing on ARM devices and they're trying

44:13.560 --> 44:17.800
to just keep really competitive in that space, but also because so many people can see the

44:17.800 --> 44:23.060
flaws that it becomes incumbent upon the person responsible for those flaws to fix them because

44:23.060 --> 44:25.580
otherwise their dick's hanging out in the open and everybody can see that they got a

44:25.580 --> 44:26.580
small dick.

44:26.580 --> 44:31.320
So, you know, and the other things that kind of concern me too, not so much, but, you know,

44:31.320 --> 44:36.440
obviously continuation of support, I mean, with so many fragments and so many different

44:36.440 --> 44:40.520
distributions of Linux out there, you know, something might get discontinued or something

44:40.520 --> 44:43.880
might change in the very next version, you know, it seems like, to me, there's a lot

44:43.880 --> 44:46.120
of turnover and a lot of change.

44:46.120 --> 44:50.960
I mean, a lot of change that happens, I mean, even from one month to the next.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.760
So that distro will be supported for five years, the one you're on right now, which

44:53.760 --> 44:54.760
is pretty good.

44:54.760 --> 44:58.200
But there are distributions, like the one that I primarily use, where every day it's

44:58.200 --> 45:01.840
called a rolling release, where there's new stuff that's just integrated continuously.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.760
Now the flip side is, there's never a big version.

45:04.760 --> 45:08.960
There's never a Windows 7 and a Windows 8, there's never a big jump, it's every day something

45:08.960 --> 45:09.960
is updated.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.020
It's a continuing roll.

45:11.020 --> 45:12.600
And here's one other thing.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.200
For example, you know me, I have an HTC One.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.200
Yep.

45:16.200 --> 45:21.640
It's an Android device, and one of the first things I did was root it, and then, you know,

45:21.640 --> 45:23.040
I've been installing my own company.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.040
You Linux hacker.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.720
I've been installing, you know, all these custom ROMs and that sort of thing, right?

45:27.720 --> 45:33.000
So for example, I know Linux is very heavily customizable, right?

45:33.000 --> 45:36.480
And you know, one of the things that kind of I like about Windows and I like about Mac

45:36.480 --> 45:40.680
is, well, I know that you can do some customizations.

45:40.680 --> 45:44.160
For the most part, you know, the base level is always the same.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.320
I feel like I could get myself in a world of trouble.

45:48.320 --> 45:54.280
And honestly, because, and then, and then what, you know.

45:54.280 --> 45:59.560
That sounds like, I mean, some of these things sound a little bit like there's been a narrative

45:59.560 --> 46:03.840
built up around Linux, because there are some desktop environments where it could be like

46:03.840 --> 46:08.280
this custom thing, like, you know, very unique to Chase Nunes, and nobody else has a desktop

46:08.280 --> 46:09.280
like Chase Nunes.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
Sure.

46:10.280 --> 46:14.120
But right now, you are using something called Unity, which is, you can modify it, but pretty

46:14.120 --> 46:16.660
much what you see right now is what you get.

46:16.660 --> 46:19.640
If you change the background, the sidebar will change color.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.640
There's your customization.

46:20.640 --> 46:23.400
Literally, you can change the background and the side, and that's pretty much it.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.960
Now you can install apps to tweak it more, but then there's desktops, and I'm not hating

46:26.960 --> 46:31.160
on KDE, but I'm just saying there's desktops like KDE where every pixel on the screen is

46:31.160 --> 46:35.720
pretty much, you've customized it yourself, and you can choose where it's laid out.

46:35.720 --> 46:41.240
But if you were to go with the most common Linux entry point, which is Ubuntu, and it

46:41.240 --> 46:47.400
would be probably their LTS, you would have this experience, very Mac OS X-like in its

46:47.400 --> 46:50.760
customized options, with probably a little bit more options.

46:50.760 --> 46:55.040
It's not going to get you in a world of hurt, but what I'm trying to get to the root of

46:55.040 --> 47:00.100
is how to kind of push through some of these, because some of these misconceptions were

47:00.100 --> 47:04.800
right a few years ago, and I think they really took root, and they've sort of just continued

47:04.800 --> 47:09.940
to exist when the folks that are working on these distributions have really spent a lot

47:09.940 --> 47:13.880
of time to fix some of this stuff and make it better and address some of those concerns,

47:13.880 --> 47:15.280
but that message isn't out there.

47:15.280 --> 47:22.320
No, and it obviously goes back to how Leo, on his nationally syndicated radio show, pushed

47:22.320 --> 47:27.400
the narrative about Linux, and it pushed the stereotype.

47:27.400 --> 47:28.400
And you know who you are.

47:28.400 --> 47:32.400
If you're somebody who doesn't want to mess with it, I just want to buy something on Amazon,

47:32.400 --> 47:35.360
send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

47:35.360 --> 47:39.800
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it, probably not a good choice.

47:39.800 --> 47:43.120
And here's the thing, right?

47:43.120 --> 47:44.640
You know me, Chris.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.720
I'm not running Linux.

47:46.720 --> 47:54.040
I don't have a Linux laptop, but hearing that freaking cringes me as a fan of software,

47:54.040 --> 47:59.200
as a fan of furthering technology, and it frustrates me because when I'm using Linux

47:59.200 --> 48:04.200
right now and I'm using Ubuntu, Leo jumped through advanced things that he didn't have

48:04.200 --> 48:10.040
to do, and then he screwed himself up, and then what does he do when he screws himself

48:10.040 --> 48:11.040
up?

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
Well, so he doesn't look bad himself.

48:12.040 --> 48:15.320
He just deflects and he badmouths it.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
Yeah, it's not my fault.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Yeah.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
No, I didn't do anything wrong.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
Yeah.

48:19.320 --> 48:23.220
I mean, seeing something like this and messing around with this, this is solid.

48:23.220 --> 48:27.040
This is very, very nice, and I know this is beta, and this is very, very nice.

48:27.040 --> 48:32.960
I mean, the app store, if you call it the app store, where you can just software center,

48:32.960 --> 48:38.120
these are the kind of things that I would love to be able to, and I might do it, where

48:38.120 --> 48:44.520
I will say, hey, dad, I'm going to throw Ubuntu, is that okay, and throw it on there.

48:44.520 --> 48:51.380
I guess, too, what I was kind of curious, too, if you looked at it so much, when you

48:51.380 --> 48:57.220
looked at it, do you look at, is it really, I guess what I'm trying to get past, are you

48:57.220 --> 49:00.120
really afraid of what the community is going to say?

49:00.120 --> 49:01.280
Is that really a barrier?

49:01.280 --> 49:02.800
No, it honestly is.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.800
Part of it is.

49:03.800 --> 49:06.120
Because that seems like that's on us.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.760
That's why I feel really bad about that.

49:07.760 --> 49:10.480
Part of it is, but then again, you've got to realize something.

49:10.480 --> 49:17.600
I understand that for years that the community has been bashed by Windows users.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.760
They've been bashed by OSX users.

49:19.760 --> 49:20.760
They've been bashed.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.760
They're in battle, Chase.

49:21.760 --> 49:25.080
And they're also bashed within their own communities, but honestly, they're in bashed within their

49:25.080 --> 49:29.600
own communities, so you have internal factions, right?

49:29.600 --> 49:34.920
So you have all these different things, you know, what if there was a federation of Linux

49:34.920 --> 49:39.600
users, call it the Linux federation, where you have all these different factions where

49:39.600 --> 49:43.040
it doesn't matter because at the end of the day, you are still using Linux?

49:43.040 --> 49:44.760
Well, let me help you out with that.

49:44.760 --> 49:49.840
Essentially, we're the maquis, and that's the best description out there.

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
We are the maquis.

49:50.840 --> 49:55.640
We literally, in every sense of the word, go into it with a very maquis mindset.

49:55.640 --> 49:59.480
If we can't make it work, we take a little ship and throw a bomb on it.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.440
No, I mean, it's very maquis-like.

50:01.440 --> 50:05.660
I think most of the challenges you're probably facing, too, are task-centered.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.280
How do I accomplish X?

50:07.280 --> 50:08.840
How do I accomplish Y?

50:08.840 --> 50:12.840
Can I accomplish Y and X in the same level of quality that I accomplished it with the

50:12.840 --> 50:13.840
other operating system?

50:13.840 --> 50:14.840
Right.

50:14.840 --> 50:19.200
And this is why I'm super excited to be doing the How To Linux show, just because of the

50:19.200 --> 50:24.580
fact, I mean, even doing the show today and looking at the chat room, I've had literally

50:24.580 --> 50:28.360
probably five different suggestions of what Linux distro I should start with.

50:28.360 --> 50:29.360
Yeah.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.360
There is no answer.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.360
Right.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.360
And that's the thing, right?

50:32.360 --> 50:39.160
That inherently is one of the core problems, is where you have a new user or an experienced

50:39.160 --> 50:43.600
technical user like I am, and what should I be going into?

50:43.600 --> 50:46.360
What would be the easiest transitional thing for me?

50:46.360 --> 50:48.800
Well, I know Riley wanted to make a point about the community.

50:48.800 --> 50:49.800
Go ahead, Riley.

50:49.800 --> 50:50.800
Yeah.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.680
So I'd say the community does not matter.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.600
Whatever you like, you need to go with.

50:55.600 --> 51:00.120
If you're a new user, don't listen to the community at all.

51:00.120 --> 51:05.120
What I suggest is go on on Distro Watch, pick out a couple of distros that you think sound

51:05.120 --> 51:06.120
cool.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.400
If you want to use Zorin, go for it.

51:07.400 --> 51:13.960
But look at those screenshots of it and look at maybe some user reviews and go from there.

51:13.960 --> 51:19.620
Now Brett Romney wanted to bring up the point that Brett Mitt Romney said, all this Ubuntu

51:19.620 --> 51:22.000
bashing is bad for new switchers.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Go ahead, Mr. Romney.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
First of all, it's our team.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
It's fine.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Okay.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Okay.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.720
And well, I believe that a lot of people are misinformed by the other people that I truly

51:34.720 --> 51:38.960
believe Ubuntu is one of the best options for newer users.

51:38.960 --> 51:45.120
The constant bashing makes them, I don't know, more hesitant to use it, I kind of believe.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.120
Woo-hoo!

51:46.120 --> 51:52.840
Well, especially the unnecessary Unity bashing coming from, let's be honest, a lot of Netflix.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.320
I think you guys give yourselves too much credit.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.760
I don't think, I don't, Chase, have you heard a lot of Ubuntu bashing?

51:58.760 --> 51:59.760
Has this been a thing?

51:59.760 --> 52:01.520
I don't think this makes it outside our circle.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.040
No, and it doesn't.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.040
It doesn't.

52:04.040 --> 52:09.500
But when, for example, you know, some people will talk to other like-minded individuals

52:09.500 --> 52:12.560
and I'll say, all right, I'm thinking about moving to Linux.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.120
What do you think I should move to?

52:14.120 --> 52:18.040
And then you go to your friends and they'll give you some feedback.

52:18.040 --> 52:20.920
And I consider the community my group of friends here.

52:20.920 --> 52:24.320
So in that scenario, you get that person's opinion, right?

52:24.320 --> 52:26.120
And they'll say, oh, well, Ubuntu sucks.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.640
I mean, that's what Leo got.

52:27.640 --> 52:31.640
Leo went into his chat room and his chat room immediately said, oh my God, Leo, you have

52:31.640 --> 52:33.800
to uninstall Unity right now.

52:33.800 --> 52:36.720
And it sent him down a path of borking his system.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.720
Right.

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
And here's the thing, right?

52:38.720 --> 52:43.120
If I started, you know, if I installed this and I went to you or if I went to Matt or

52:43.120 --> 52:46.920
I went to any other member of the JV community and said, all right, I just installed this,

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
what should I do next?

52:47.920 --> 52:50.800
I would probably get three or four different answers.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
Yeah.

52:51.800 --> 52:55.400
It's one of those things where at least like I know in the Windows world, all right, I

52:55.400 --> 52:56.400
install Windows.

52:56.400 --> 52:57.400
First thing you gotta do, install antivirus.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.400
You know, there's a certain checklist, right?

52:59.400 --> 53:01.400
I just raised my blood pressure just saying that.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.400
I know.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.040
No, first thing I do, install XP.

53:04.040 --> 53:05.040
And then-

53:05.040 --> 53:09.640
You get five different answers to which antivirus to install.

53:09.640 --> 53:17.520
And if you asked an expert or your local expert how, you know, to help you with some problem

53:17.520 --> 53:22.360
you have with Windows, you almost certainly get a different answer than someone else.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.960
Linux is not unique in having multiple ways to skin a cat.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.960
Right.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
AWS has that.

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Yeah.

53:28.960 --> 53:29.960
The antivirus thing is a good point.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.560
Like you'll see, you'll hear a lot of debates about which antivirus scanner is the best

53:31.560 --> 53:32.560
one.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.560
Do I need-

53:33.560 --> 53:34.560
And it's gotten worse too.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.560
Like do I need one for Linux, for example?

53:35.560 --> 53:36.560
No.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
No.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
No.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
But the thing is, it's kind of like that for desktops on Linux too.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.560
Like it's the same thing with desktops.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
Like, oh man, you can't use Unity.

53:41.560 --> 53:46.560
You gotta use XFCE or you gotta use Cinnamon.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
Let's be honest.

53:47.560 --> 53:48.560
You gotta use Gnome.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
Come on.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.560
Let's be serious.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.560
Oh God.

53:51.560 --> 53:56.160
So I'm going to give you a recipe that's going to get you started really easy because it's

53:56.160 --> 54:00.680
how I actually personally made the switch because I've not used Linux as long as Chris,

54:00.680 --> 54:01.680
for example.

54:01.680 --> 54:02.960
I started on a laptop.

54:02.960 --> 54:07.320
I ran Windows for a long time on my main desktop because I wanted to game.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.320
I wanted to do my stuff.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.320
I wanted to do what I needed to do.

54:09.320 --> 54:15.640
And I found that to be a really healthy compromise because I was free to not have to dual boot.

54:15.640 --> 54:18.400
I was also free and not feeling obligated to use it.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.960
But at the same time, when I wanted to use my laptop, I was, in a sense, forcing myself

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
to use it.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.680
And I found that to be a really dynamic way of doing it.

54:24.680 --> 54:25.680
Yeah.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.680
That actually is a great way.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.920
It's like you say, okay, now I have to be able to solve it under here.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.840
And I wonder too, Chase, would you feel better?

54:31.840 --> 54:35.880
So this Bonobo here is a System76 machine.

54:35.880 --> 54:38.280
And they're a sponsor of the Linux Action Show.

54:38.280 --> 54:43.280
And this came preloaded with Ubuntu, which looks a lot like what you see now.

54:43.280 --> 54:48.560
If you were buying an end-to-end product solution, like you were buying a machine that has an

54:48.560 --> 54:53.040
OS loaded on it from a vendor, maybe they even offer you a 1-800 number to call if you

54:53.040 --> 54:54.240
get stuck.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.440
Does that solve some of these problems?

54:56.440 --> 55:00.120
Does it solve, like if you can trust, if you trust the brand of that vendor to pick the

55:00.120 --> 55:03.880
right choices, does that kind of solve the which direction do I go first problem?

55:03.880 --> 55:05.280
Is that the better approach?

55:05.280 --> 55:09.160
Well, I guess it depends on what I'm starting off with.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.160
If I'm...

55:10.160 --> 55:11.160
Let's say you're going to buy a new laptop.

55:11.160 --> 55:16.160
See, here's the thing, I'm a big do-it-yourself-er, I like to do my own thing.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.200
So I like to build.

55:18.200 --> 55:22.200
But let's say that I was starting, I didn't want to worry about it.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.960
I would probably do that sort of thing, a System76.

55:24.960 --> 55:28.280
But I also remember Dell doing Linux laptops for a while.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.280
I don't know if they still do.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.280
I think they do.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.280
I'm not sure.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.280
I can't really...

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
I know that they did...

55:33.280 --> 55:34.280
Do they still have the Sputnik?

55:34.280 --> 55:35.280
Yeah.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.280
They're all over the map on it.

55:36.280 --> 55:39.280
Don't they have the XPS 13 developer edition?

55:39.280 --> 55:40.640
Yeah, that's the Sputnik.

55:40.640 --> 55:41.640
That's the Sputnik.

55:41.640 --> 55:42.640
Oh, sorry.

55:42.640 --> 55:47.160
But you know, I will say this, when I was first starting off Windows a long, long, long,

55:47.160 --> 55:54.880
long time ago, and when I was first starting out and I called at least one time, just one

55:54.880 --> 55:59.120
time in my whole life I can remember calling Windows support for some issue, they make

55:59.120 --> 56:00.680
you feel like a dumbass.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.320
They make you feel so terrible.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.320
Really?

56:03.320 --> 56:07.600
It just felt like, you know, like, you are so stupid, let me hold your hand and walk

56:07.600 --> 56:08.600
through the baby steps.

56:08.600 --> 56:14.200
You know, now I don't know what System76 support is like, and you know, I'm just...

56:14.200 --> 56:16.020
I'm not afraid of anything.

56:16.020 --> 56:17.440
It's just that it would be nice...

56:17.440 --> 56:21.640
That would be simple to have a, you know, a real simple, easy, where I just have a laptop,

56:21.640 --> 56:22.640
it's ready to go.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.640
Some of the harder...

56:23.640 --> 56:25.440
Some of the more nebulous choices are made for you.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
Right.

56:26.440 --> 56:28.840
Well, and they do the testing for you too, you know, so that you don't have to worry

56:28.840 --> 56:30.760
about future proofing your laptop.

56:30.760 --> 56:34.880
But most importantly, my experience with their support, like back in 2008 when I got burned

56:34.880 --> 56:40.760
by Dell and ended up going to these guys, I found that even all these years later on

56:40.760 --> 56:45.540
laptops I don't even, you know, have support for anymore, I can still go to their actual

56:45.540 --> 56:49.680
forum filled with the, you know, folks from that community as well as the tech support

56:49.680 --> 56:52.800
guys and they'll still support me without making me feel like an idiot.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
That's nice too.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
See, that's good.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.800
Yeah, I really like that.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.800
That's not even an ad.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.800
That's just legit endorsement.

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
And I think that's...

56:58.800 --> 57:01.880
So I think that answers part of the problem there, but I think when...

57:01.880 --> 57:07.600
And that's why I have felt like, because sometimes techie guys and gals will want to research

57:07.600 --> 57:08.600
this stuff.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.920
Like, it's fun to dig into it.

57:09.920 --> 57:15.120
And that's why I've thought the best switchers for Linux for the next couple of years are

57:15.120 --> 57:19.760
people like yourself who are capable of using Google, right?

57:19.760 --> 57:24.040
Capable of understanding that there's some compromises that have to be made or some adjustments

57:24.040 --> 57:26.600
that have to be made on how you do something.

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
And maybe different...

57:27.600 --> 57:30.460
And you're familiar with like, you understand that sometimes the Mac does something one

57:30.460 --> 57:32.380
way and Windows does something the other way.

57:32.380 --> 57:35.760
So the concept that you might have to adjust your workflow behavior for an operating system

57:35.760 --> 57:37.320
is not foreign to you.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.400
So you're a good candidate in that regard.

57:39.400 --> 57:43.000
You're a good candidate in the regard that you know how to use resources like chat rooms

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
and Reddit and forums.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.240
So I've always thought like, if we could focus not so much on this mythical new user who's

57:50.240 --> 57:54.720
never used a computer before and is going to magically pick a unicorn PC running Linux,

57:54.720 --> 57:58.400
I thought it would make more sense to focus on a person like yourself who's fully aware

57:58.400 --> 57:59.800
of how to do this.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.480
And it could even capably do it themselves.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.320
And I've always wondered, what could we clear out of the way?

58:04.320 --> 58:07.920
And the thing that is kind of leaving me a little bummed as we wrap up is like, it kind

58:07.920 --> 58:13.880
of sounds like in some ways, some of the best aspects of Linux, like you've characterized

58:13.880 --> 58:16.120
it as two, like you didn't know which direction to go.

58:16.120 --> 58:21.200
And I look at it as a lot of market dynamics at play, picking the best things.

58:21.200 --> 58:24.700
All this choice also is, you can look at this as lots of choice.

58:24.700 --> 58:25.700
And I love choice.

58:25.700 --> 58:26.700
Like you can't have Android devices, right?

58:26.700 --> 58:27.700
I love choice, yeah.

58:27.700 --> 58:28.700
And so that's like...

58:28.700 --> 58:29.700
But what's the flagship, right?

58:29.700 --> 58:34.400
I mean, we see it in Android devices all the time where, all right, is it the Galaxy Note?

58:34.400 --> 58:35.400
Is it the HTC One?

58:35.400 --> 58:39.720
Well, I am shocked that Ubuntu hasn't sort of stood out from the outside to you.

58:39.720 --> 58:43.720
I assumed, looking out from the outside, that you would have always seen Ubuntu as that

58:43.720 --> 58:45.360
flagship standing out.

58:45.360 --> 58:50.360
I'm not saying it is one way or the other, but I just kind of assumed that was the perception.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.520
Is it, quote unquote, the flagship because there's more support behind it or there's

58:53.520 --> 58:55.440
more money behind it or whatever?

58:55.440 --> 58:58.880
It doesn't necessarily make it best if there's more money behind it.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.280
So you would want the best technical solution.

59:01.280 --> 59:06.160
I would want the best solution that takes advantage of my system hardware and that has

59:06.160 --> 59:08.320
support for the programs that I want to use.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.160
What if the best was harder than the other option?

59:13.160 --> 59:16.960
I guess what the definition of harder is.

59:16.960 --> 59:20.160
Like just a little more involved in getting set up.

59:20.160 --> 59:23.760
Are you saying if you're going to switch, you'd rather go all in, like you're all cards

59:23.760 --> 59:24.760
in?

59:24.760 --> 59:28.400
I would want something that is inherently me, right?

59:28.400 --> 59:34.160
If I have the choice, I would want the programs, obviously, that I'm going to use.

59:34.160 --> 59:37.040
I would want a nice, beautiful interface.

59:37.040 --> 59:41.800
I know some people like the live-in command line world or terminal.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.800
I don't.

59:42.800 --> 59:47.740
I like a beautiful, nice interface and something that is very easy for me to use but has those

59:47.740 --> 59:50.680
advanced features for me to jump into when I need to.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.120
But you want something that also feels like it's yours?

59:53.120 --> 59:54.120
Yeah.

59:54.120 --> 01:00:01.720
It's one of those things where, and the other things too is, obviously, if I have a piece

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.480
of hardware, I know that all my things at home, like my laptop, old laptop at home,

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:12.720
I know will run XP, sorry, Windows on there just fine.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:19.040
But if I picked a Linux distro, what if it doesn't plug into all the pieces of hardware?

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.560
Just try a live CD and find out.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560
Right.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560
You can.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560
Here's another thing.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.720
The beauty about Linux is you can always distro-hop.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.440
I distro-hop like a jackrabbit all over the place too.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440
Yeah.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440
And a lot of us do.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.440
Yeah.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.440
A lot.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.440
And that's the thing.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.320
Especially if you make a separate home directory, which I'm sure somebody could show you how

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.120
to do, then you could go ahead and just go to wherever distro you want.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.120
Exactly.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.400
Because people usually don't start using Linux because of their own decisions.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.160
But they usually have somebody to show them the way.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Right.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.160
Yes.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.680
And that's where I'm obviously very excited about how to Linux and that show is where

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.480
it's not just picking a Linux distribution for me.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480
It's about all the intangibles.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.440
And giving real answers to these questions.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440
Right.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.520
I mean, that's what I want to try to figure out is I want to try to solve these real,

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520
these are real questions.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.520
Yeah, they are.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.520
Real problems.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.520
Totally.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.520
And how do we solve them for you?

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.520
Right.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520
I'm going to put a bet on Chase being a KDE guy.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520
I'm just going to put that out there.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
I could see it happening.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:26.040
But it's one of those things where it's also the beauty, I guess I would say, of Windows

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.160
and the beauty of Mac is, you know what?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160
It works.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.960
I don't have to do much to keep it going.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.200
I don't have to tweak every other day.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.960
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.920
But at the same time, I know installing a program is pretty simple.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.560
For example, when I was looking at chat programs, now, I knew that it was at, what was it?

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.560
The app?

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.560
Oh, the software center.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.560
There was a software center.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.560
But before that, I went to Google, I typed in XChat, I went to XChat.org or whatever.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.240
And I was like, we got results for Fedora.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240
Right.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.480
And I was like, all right, so which one do I install?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.480
Right.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.480
I'm like, no, no.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.480
But see, that's the thing.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.480
That's one of the issues, right?

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.480
It's like, when you say...

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.320
I think there's an intimidation factor here, that there's too much choice that it actually

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320
scares you away.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.120
Well, it's... that's the good thing, is there's something for everybody.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.080
This intimidation factor is preventing them from even making an initial choice.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.160
But it's not just intimidation factor, there's confusion.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.880
Because for example, I went to go grab the Linux version of XChat.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880
XChat, yeah.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.240
But that Linux version is not the same as another Linux version.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240
Right.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240
That's where there's confusion.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240
Yeah.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240
It's messy.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.760
And because I'm like, wait, wait, Linux, I thought Linux is Linux.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.760
No.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.360
It's different in the sense, Linux is a general purpose technology platform.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.400
Think of it that way.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:50.560
There's a core kernel, like the Android runs on, but then there's solutions built on top

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560
of that.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.660
A lot of them are very, very, very, very similar.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.600
Like they use a lot of the same tools and stuff, but they're each their own implementation

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.240
of that general purpose platform.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240
Think of it as a lower level thing, almost.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.760
And I've learned about it, you know, firsthand in trying to set up that the...

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.760
Airtime server.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.760
Airtime server.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.560
You know, there's Zambutu and there's all these different...

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560
CentOS.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.600
CentOS and Gentoo or something like that.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.800
So you have all these different things and, you know, that's where I just...

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.840
That's where I need to learn because, you know, it gets so freaking confusing and obviously

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.840
confusion becomes...

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840
Intimidation.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840
Intimidation, yeah.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.840
Sure.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.840
Go ahead, Poppy.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.840
Yeah.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.080
I think Chase needs to break out of his comfort zone.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.840
He seems to be quite entrenched in that comfort zone and happy that the GUI gives him a sense

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.600
of security, he said earlier on, whereas, you know, a GUI on Windows, you could right

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:51.440
click a SQL database and drop it and you would ruin everyone's day within your company.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.720
The GUI doesn't give you that sense of security that you think it does.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.200
I think if you embrace the choice that you have with Linux and the option that...

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.560
The lack of lock-in almost in a sense.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560
Yeah.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560
It's open.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.560
It's...

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:13.120
Without wishing to sound too much like a hippie, you know, you can embrace that openness.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120
Yeah.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.760
But it's much harder to get support in the terminal than it is within a GUI because then

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.800
you know it can at least connect.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800
No.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800
No.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800
Not at all.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800
Not at all.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800
Not if you can copy and paste what you're experiencing.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800
Not necessarily.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800
Yeah.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800
Look at how Leo did that.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.520
That worked really well for him.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.520
Oh!

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520
That was great.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.760
So let me break it down for you like this.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.880
If I was to basically break this down into something that's just free of geek speak,

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.720
essentially Linux is like a Ford.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.560
And then you've got your model, which is essentially your desktop environment, whatnot.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.160
And then if you want to get into deeper things, you can then look at the trim.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.500
You know, and it basically comes down to that sort of thing.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.080
But I think when it comes to anything with Linux, you basically look at a base of what...

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.120
You've got your Ubuntu's and their variants.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.960
There's Cousins and everything like that.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.800
Or you've got your Arch and its variants and these types of things.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.400
You kind of settle on the base that feels good.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.640
Okay, I want compatibility.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.880
I want it to work with my printers.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.400
I want it to just get the job done.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.720
I want to make sure gaming is being paid attention to.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.440
And then you look at the variants surrounding that globe and then try those various variants.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.440
Try different desktop environments.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.500
And then I think it becomes a little less annoying in my opinion because then you have

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.800
something from which to try from I guess.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.480
So what you're really saying is be open to experimentation.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480
Try it out.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.320
Well, but within a smaller circle.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.160
Instead of this shotgun approach to try everything under the sun, which is just...

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
It is intimidating.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.160
Right, yes.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.520
Find a base you like and start within that circle eventually.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Oh, I see.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
So...

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Start within Ubuntu base.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
But how do you...

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.600
But how does he even know what base to start with?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600
I think that's part of the problem.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600
Well, that's experiments.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Compatibility.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.600
I think with...

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.600
I agree with Matt.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.600
I think this is a...

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.680
This is very much an analogy based show.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.960
And if I'm... he's going to go down the car route, I'll go down the beer route.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.400
I think if different Linux distros are like different beers, you start off with the basic

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:07.080
ingredients of, you know, hops, barley, water, yeast, and then you build upon that and you...

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.920
But you have to try them all in order to figure out what the best one is over the supermarket

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.200
brand beer.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200
That's interesting.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.200
And that makes me beer thirsty too.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200
But no...

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200
And you might be...

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200
Maybe you're into dark beers.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.200
Maybe you're into light beers.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.280
If you know you're more into light beers, you're going to stick in that realm of influence

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280
I think.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280
Exactly.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280
See?

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280
Matt gets it.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280
This is where...

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:33.240
Honestly, as a technology fan and as a community fan, you know, I'm very, very excited about

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.560
getting into this area.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.840
And I'm not afraid...

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.760
First off, when I was given the example of GUIs, I was given it from a general user's

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.480
perspective, not necessarily my perspective.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480
I want yours though.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480
Yeah.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.360
But I mean, like, for example, I don't mind either.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.160
I mean, obviously, depending on the application that I'm working with, you know, for example,

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.360
I'm going to work in command line when I'm doing network administration.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.440
It's more comfortable for me.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.040
But it's one of those things where, you know, I'm very, very excited about, and obviously,

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.640
you know, being able to work that into the How-To Linux show is going to be great because

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.400
everybody's going to be able to learn through me as this happens.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:15.760
But also, I'm hoping to be that user, that person that helps bridge the gap between...

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.680
For other people that are watching trying to figure this stuff out.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680
Right.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680
And not being afraid.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.240
You know, jumping in there with two feet, you know, it's like learning how to swim.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.240
You know, I'm not afraid.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.680
You know, I'm not afraid of the water.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.000
I'm not going to drown because I know I have people that are going to hold me up and not

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.760
let me sink to the bottom.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.240
And that's where, you know, I'm very excited about.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.360
We will go forth and impart that wisdom.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.680
And at Heaven's Revenge, I think you wanted to mention something, didn't you?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.680
Yes.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.280
Lots of people are scared of the differences or at least the amount of choice that you're

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.280
given.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:52.000
There is one crucial area in which every distro or almost every distro has, which is similar.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.440
And it's extremely important to understand because in Windows, you look outside of the

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.240
operating system to bring pieces into it.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.960
As in you go to Google, download packages as a separate package and install it.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.600
The most important thing for a new user to know is that every distro has its own repository

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.520
in which you're supposed to get software from.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.360
Make them look at the repo first, then they'll find every answer, almost every answer that

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.480
they want instead of going out to the internet and Google instead.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.480
That's a great point.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.760
And that's the biggest shift that I think Chase will, you know, so one of the things

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.520
Chase, I'll just let you know, one of the mistakes you made is that Linux distributions

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.760
come with a package management system.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.640
So instead of having to go out to the web and just download some installer for some

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.720
website, most of the time, the software you want, the system is already aware of in repositories.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.000
You just have to issue the command either through a GUI or through the command line

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.960
to go grab that piece of software.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.200
So for example, like on my machine here, I would do pacman-s Skype, enter, and then it

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.400
would go out and download Skype for me and install it.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.460
I wouldn't have to go to Skype.com and download it because this is part of the huge difference.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:11.920
So that's kind of the, you know, the entrenched learning experience of knowing how to do certain

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920
things.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.720
It's like that's what I've been used to do for years.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720
Yep.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720
Yep.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.720
Right.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720
Yes, my friend, that is a journey you are now beginning.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.720
I know.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.720
So we will be...

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720
Can't wait for that.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.400
We'll be keeping you up to date, everybody, on future editions of How To Linux.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.320
Matt, on Sunday, I'm not going to tell you what the plan is because we got two possibilities

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.800
and they're both kind of crazy.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800
Oh, boy.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.480
One of them, speaking of package managers, is waiting on some software, but we'll talk

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480
about that.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.760
But either way, Matt, I'm going to see you on Sunday, okay?

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760
Sounds good.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.760
See you then.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.600
And don't forget, everyone, we do Linux Unplugged live on Tuesdays.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600
Join us over...

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.280
Just go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, actually, to get it in your local time, but

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.240
we do it at 2 p.m. Pacific, and you can hang out in our chat room over at jblive.tv or

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.480
join our virtual log.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.280
We have a mumble room over there.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280
Okay, everyone.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.560
Well, if we don't see you on Sunday, I want to be sure we see you right back here on Tuesday

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:13.680
because Linux Unplugged comes out every single Tuesday.
