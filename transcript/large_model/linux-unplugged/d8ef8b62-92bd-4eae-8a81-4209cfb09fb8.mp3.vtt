00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Never make me no underdog, and never talk about who's going to stop me, or ain't nobody going to stop me.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
I must be the greatest. I shook up the world. I shook up the world. I shook up the world. I shook up the world.

00:18.000 --> 00:29.000
Shake things up. Shake up the world.

00:29.000 --> 00:45.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 148 for June 7th, 2016.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's about to celebrate 10 years of broadcasting Linux goodness.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Episode 148 stacks up against the Giants as a big show. Yes, it does.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Mostly just because I've got a little NyQuil on the brain, I've got nothing but last 10th anniversary in my head, and I'm ready to go on vacation.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes! You deserve it.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
But before I declare all of that, I should tell you a little bit about what we're talking about today.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
So one of the things that's been coming up since our show on Sunday is what happened with ownCloud and what can open source learn from this development?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
What can we do differently next time? And what's kind of between the lines when you read carefully?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
We'll discuss that. Then also, we've got a plethora of our favorite open source project updates.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We've got a whole bunch of project updates to go through.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
There is some major new open source code cranking out from little known projects to big known projects that are all great for the Linux desktop.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We're going to tell you about those in today's show as well.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
And then later on, later on, I can't help it, Wes. I've been slipping back into Google hard.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Ooh, dangerous.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Ooh, we're going to talk about how I just simply can't quit Google.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
And I'm curious to hear your guys' thoughts on that from a wider context.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
We're going to talk about some of the cool things that are coming out soon that work under Linux that as somebody who's from time to time just quit Google cold turkey and then kind of come back and try them in different ways.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
As a Linux user that is trying to replace certain holes in what you might call the Linux ecosystem where I find Google's offering sort of plug in really well there, I keep finding myself going back.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I keep going back.

02:27.000 --> 02:38.000
I want to talk about that a little bit because honestly, I started thinking about this from the context of the 10th anniversary of the Linux action show, which is really what's all in my mind because we've been doing a lot of work on this.

02:38.000 --> 02:57.000
And one trend that I keep coming back to is when there's proprietary services that are bundled together in a way where they're functional under the Linux desktop, I tend to allow that compromise to happen.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And I say, ah, it doesn't need to be completely open source.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
It doesn't need to be completely free software.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
And even, you know, looking back, I keep making the same mistake over and over again.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
But I don't want to beat up on myself or anyone else who's doing it.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
I just want to talk about that dynamic that exists for Linux users and sort of look back on that.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, so we'll talk about all of that.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
But before we get into anything, we got to bring in that mumble room.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Time appropriate greetings.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Hello.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Hello.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Hello.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What a cheerful bunch.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Hello, hello.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
So I'm glad you guys are here today because you can help me with some of this stuff.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I want to get into some of our first topics of the day.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
And it comes fully equipped with a pretty awesome video with a good beat.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
So if you're a video watcher, this is a treat for you.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
This is the new GNOME Control Panel with a hardcore new design and hardcore music.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This is being worked on right now.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
How would you describe this, Wes?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Like a total re-layout.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, it's like a re-layout, new UI flow, new workflow to find things.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And I could give you an example of what it looks like.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It reminds me a lot, and I don't mean this in a bad way either.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
It reminds me a lot of the old Apple Macintosh System 6 Control Panel.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And I actually think it was a pretty good design.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
You have a left-hand column of all of the major categories that you want to edit.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
And in the right-hand column, it's all of the settings specific to that particular thing.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And it flows well.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I actually always found it to be a really easy way to dig through.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It could get a little long, but yeah.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't think really GNOME is doing something groundbreaking here so much as they're just taking

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
what seemed like a concept that was based off of Mac OS X's system preferences,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
and now we're just basing it off Mac OS 6.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You know what, they got that wrong.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
They had it right the first time.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Retro is always better, right?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Retro is always better.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
It's nice to see them playing around like clearly they're not interested in just being done.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
They want to make it better.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Maybe clearly there's problems they don't think are addressed perfectly with the current setting.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, I agree.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
So we'll see if it's better.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm looking forward to seeing the update land.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Speaking of making GTK look good, I don't ever really cover new themes anymore or big theme updates,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
but this one's just gorgeous.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
The Arc theme, which I think is just great, is getting a full-on GTK theme and icons,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
the whole shenanigans.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
And surprisingly, a lot of people wrote in to tell us about this.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And I love the Arc theme, and I love that they're now getting repo set up.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It's up on GitHub.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
There's devs available.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Of course, I think it's in the AUR.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, they'll just make it even easier to get it everywhere.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And if you look at this, check this out.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
If you click this little thing here, you see where it goes to?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Wait for it to load.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
The OpenSUSE software.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Whoa.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah, look at software.opensuse.org, and you get links here for Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
and Ubuntu, which is pretty cool.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
And Mr. Brown, didn't I see in the news headlines today that the build service got an update

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
of a rather nice feature, something to do with being able to link to external data sources

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
or something.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I just saw the headline, but it looked like a nice update to the build service.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yep, 2.7.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, the big headline thing is we've always had support for linking into Git repos.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Now it's leaner, faster, continuous building.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
You do a Git commit.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
There's your package.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Brand spanking new.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, that sounds very helpful.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Mm-hmm.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
We're actually using that now for OpenQA.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
So, every time we commit something to OpenQA, bang, package gets spiked out the build service,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and then we just run the zipper up on our production systems whenever we feel like it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
So, when they say it works better with external data sources, they mean GitHub?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Is that what that headline was referring to?

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Any Git repo, but yeah, I mean GitHub already have enablement for things like triggering,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
so you can have GitHub triggering based on that, but it's all leaner, smoother, and 2.7.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Hmm, pretty cool.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm glad to hear that it's continuing on, and it looks like being used to some effectiveness.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
Do you think, Richard, do you think that that's a better solution than something like AppImage

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
or Flatpak?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Do you think the two coexist?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I think they coexist, and they cater for different markets.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Like for me, AppImage and Flatpak and stuff kind of really go for the, well, to stick

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
with OpenSUSE terms, like your typical leap user.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Like you don't want to move the whole OS.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I just want this one thing faster, newer.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
That's where Flatpak's going to be awesome.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
In a rolling distro like Tumbleweed, Flatpak's just a bunch of burden for no benefit,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
and that's where like OBS is really amazing.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, you know, I should mention before we go any further that we will be sticking to

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
tradition, and we are drinking no beer with this episode.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I should have mentioned, Wes brought in Knead Deep Brewing Company.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I got the Citra Extra Pale Ale here.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
And what do you have there, Wes?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
What do you have?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I have the big sipper.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Oh, all right.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
There we go.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Opening that guy up.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Let's make sure we don't spill it on anything as we go along.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So there's your cue right there.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I was negligent in mentioning it.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Have you heard of Linux AIO?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Have you heard of this?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
This is really something.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
This is a project that, well, maybe I could actually, I'll explain it to you in a way

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
that just tells you what it's doing.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
So imagine yourself for a moment in the position of from time to time wanting different various

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Ubuntu flavors.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't see this to be unreasonable.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Maybe one time for a machine you want Mate, maybe you want 1604 straight.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Maybe you support a lot of different offices or families.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Sure, sure.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
For yourself, you know, because you're not an animal, you're installing Ubuntu Gnome edition.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm kidding.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Right, yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
But that's a pain in the butt.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
You know, it's a pain in the butt to download all those different ISOs.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Well, check this out.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
This from the Linux AIO team is one ISO that you can write to a USB flash drive, and it's

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
all the different versions of Ubuntu 1604 that you can choose at boot which one you

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
want to run.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
That's pretty cool.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It's a little tricky right now because you have to download two different files because

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
of source forge limitations.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
And then when you extract them, they combine to one, just a seven zip.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Oh, interesting.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And then you write that to a USB thumb drive, and when you boot up, you get the option of

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Mate, Zubuntu, Lubuntu.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Kind of all that stuff.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
We should host that somewhere where it can be hosted as one file, and then that sounds

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
really helpful.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Or a torrent.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Because I could see, especially if you want to make a USB drive for some new user, maybe

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
you don't have time to install it with them, or you don't have time to really pick out

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
something for them.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Just bam, here, let them decide.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, exactly.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
It's a very nice tool, and this project we'll be watching, and I think it's pretty cool

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
because you can also pick 64 and 32, which is kind of nice.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
So check that out.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
We'll have a link in the show notes, and that is the Linux AIO project, linuxaio.net.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Pretty cool work.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, and kind of obvious, too.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm surprised we haven't seen those kind of things before.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I know, right?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Now, Wimpy's not in there today, right?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
He hasn't joined us.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Don't see him.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
I found this super neat video that he posted on his YouTube channel.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Check this thing out.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Now, again, it's pretty visual heavy.

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
It's one of these code development visualization thingies that shows you the expansion of Ubuntu

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Mate welcome development.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
So this is just the visualization for the welcome thing that they have created for Ubuntu

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Mate, which we've praised quite a bit on the show.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
And watch this thing here, Wes.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Isn't this a neat tool?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Yes, it is.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I love it.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I love that.

10:26.000 --> 10:46.000
And it shows you, so now we're into March of 2015.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
So I'll put a link to the video in the show notes if you audio listeners want to check

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
this out.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Get down with it.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Right?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Look, and there goes Martin.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Bam!

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Fixing all the things.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Look at him.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
That, wow.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Boy, that was an explosion of PNGs.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, that's pretty great.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I love these visualizations.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
This is awesome.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
There's a bunch of different projects that have them out there.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
But that is a neat one to see that.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
And there's one that's like a really famous one of the Linux kernel that you can find

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
that this would also make a good screen saver.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, it really would.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
We should do this.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We should look at different projects and do this from time to time because I think you

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
just have to look at the repo.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, I'm sure we could write up a little script to put this together.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Visualize different projects and play them here on the show.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It would be good to know, it would be good to be able to click in on these though and

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
get more information about them.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
That would be really nice.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Right, yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
It's like a visual JavaScript explorer.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yes.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You can inspect the commits if you want.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, I would totally love that.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Somebody build that.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Jeez Louise.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Get on it.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
See, I kind of was waiting to see where it goes.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I want to fast forward to see what it looks like.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So here we are in 20, oh yeah, it's way bigger in 2016.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
And it's filled with pot.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
You see that?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
It's filled with pot right there.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
So who knows what Wimpy's up to?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
What?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
No wonder he's not here to account for himself.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Hmm?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Hmm?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Very suspicious.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Very, very suspicious.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Well, anyways, you audio listeners can find that in the show notes.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
All right, so I don't really talk often about Trisco.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
In fact, I can't even remember if we've done a review recently.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Right.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm pretty sure a couple of folks here in the Mumble Room are running.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Anybody currently running Trisco in the Mumble Room?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I know we have a few from time to time that jump in there.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
And Trisco has made a pretty big statement.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
And I thought we would talk about this just really briefly.

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
So the statement from Trisco essentially boils down to it's not about ethics.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm sorry.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
It's about ethics.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
It's not about technology or innovation.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Just a friendly reminder, the post reads, for those of you that seem anxious for new

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
releases of things like Chromium, Skype, Spotify, or maybe buying the most powerful

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
computer you can buy, I recommend you watch Richard Stallman's Four Freedoms.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I think many of you should remember that the point of free software is not about convincing

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
the most shiny, or not about conceiving or getting new shiny features.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It's about your freedom.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
It's about ethics.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
I know shiny features may delight most computer users, but your freedom should be so important

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
that you can wait a little for those things.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
If you're thinking free software is not a convenience, I will not change, and I will

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
not change this.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Just remember, freedom is worth the inconvenience.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
Please stop thinking about snappy packages and begin enjoying your freedom.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Strong words.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
What do you think about that, Wes?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What's your reaction when you hear that?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Your honest reaction, is that out of touch in your estimation, or is that exactly in

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
touch for a particular market?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I think I fought more on the latter there.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
I mean, I don't use it, and I've obviously made compromises on the non-freedom end of

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
things on my day-to-day life, and I'm okay with that, but they do have a point.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
I think it comes off a little bit like they're kind of cross-talking.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
The people that are criticizing them, or that they're perceived as being criticized, aren't

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
maybe really interested, and they've already decided not to run that distribution, but

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
I do think they have a legitimate point that if you are really concerned about these things,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
then there are sacrifices you have to make.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
There are compromises, and you should be aware of it, and you should have software distributions

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
that are ready to make those choices for you and won't be pulled in by the allure of things

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
that maybe in the long run aren't worth the trade-off.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I disagree.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Go ahead.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
So I basically disagree with this statement for one reason.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Debian pretty much by default is free.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
It has the separate repositories and all the things.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
The only reason it's really not classified is because, well, it has the other repositories,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
and when you look at Debian SID, which is the unstable branch, you still get fancy new

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
features, so I'm sorry.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm really slow at it.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Okay.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
All right.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So that's a good perspective.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
I'm having a hard time not finding this as sticking your head in the sand a bit and saying,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
well, don't – I guess it's particularly odd that the one they're picking on is Snap

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Packages?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
No, that is weird.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
Because it seems like a pretty solid security innovation and a pretty solid user experience

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
innovation.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
At least the second one.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I think the security one is being worked on anyway.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I guess so.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
I guess – when I mean security, I'm thinking containerized applications in Wayland or

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Mirror, I suppose.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So I'm thinking down the road.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Sure.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Right.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You're right.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
It is weird.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It seems odd to me.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Because if you care about freedom, you probably – security should be a concern as well.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
So there is an important angle.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Right.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I guess where I draw the line is –

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And you can also distribute perfectly free open source software with Snap Packages,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
and if it makes it easier, then that's good for freedom, right?

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
See, to me, the computer ultimately has to be a tool that enables me.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And the free software is extremely important to that.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
But it also shouldn't be the thing that holds you back.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
So that's – for me, anyways, I find it to be a very sort of thin line they're walking

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
between the relevance and – but then again, at the same time, I think if you have a core

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
demo who that is the number one thing they want from their tool, I think it's right

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
on point.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Any other thoughts on Trisco before we move on?

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
It's something we don't give a lot of mention to, and I actually think it's a pretty great

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
project.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
I just don't think it really appeals to a lot of us here on the show for a lot of

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
different reasons, and so we don't talk about it a lot.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And I think there's a difference here, too, between what they're trying to do.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And you can definitely argue that their execution might not be good, right?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Maybe you don't need to wait for a lot of these things to be free as well.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
So there's that difficulty as well.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
So my last comment on Trisco, I guess it will be, considering the free software distros,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
it's pretty much the only survivor.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I'll give them credit for that.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
But other than this, probably not.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
There – I don't have much insight on this, but there seems to be a dogma of thought from

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
the Trisco project and from the Tails project that precludes them from sometimes considering

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
really good outside ideas.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Tails, you can go look into the drama yourself, but there's definitely some drama around

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
how they secure their kernel and about what outside people think they should be doing

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
versus what they should be doing.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
By the way, Tails had a new release today.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
And so I find both – I find curiousness with both these distributions' very stubborn

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
approach to something.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
But at the same time, you could argue the same thing about Mint and some of the ways

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
they do things.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Right, yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And again, it really does appeal to a certain audience.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
And do we benefit from having these almost in a Stallman-like sense, right, where it's

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
like you don't always agree with him, but he keeps making points that you see the side

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
of.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
And it might be good just in for the community to have that even if very few people end up

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
really aligning right there.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
All right.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, and he has been right to his fair point.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah, it's hard to argue with long-term results.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It really is.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
I mean, there's plenty of things you said that you could probably play back that don't

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
seem right now in retrospect.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
But I think many of them were, at least the core philosophies of them.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
So, yeah, if you're a Trisco user and you have particular thoughts on that story, let

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
us know.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, please come back.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Join our log.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Let us know what you think about it.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Let me tell you about something I think about all the time, and that's Ting.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
I think about how great it is not to have to worry that the two big providers in our

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
area keep coming up with new gimmicks.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Actually, all three providers.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And I don't have to worry about any of that stuff.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
I don't have to think about that stuff because Ting is super simple.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
And when you have a busy schedule and you just want things straightforward and simple,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
nobody beats Ting.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Nobody beats Ting.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Go to linux.ting.com.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
They have a very simple setup.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's $6 for your phone line.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
If you bring a device or you buy a device, it's $6 for that phone line.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
That's it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes on top of that.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
linux.ting.com.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
It's really straightforward.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
There's no contracts, no termination fee.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
You get something free on Tuesdays, like gimmicks.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
It's just if you want them as a dumb pipe, they'll be a dumb pipe.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
If you want them as something that is your backup data service, they're that.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
If you want them as just a cell phone carrier, they're that.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
They sell everything from just the bare SIM cards to feature phones all the way up to the

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
greatest latest smartphones.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
linux.ting.com.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Go check out how someone who's looking at the wireless industry from a new perspective

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
would reboot it with really good actual human beings for customer support.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
A fantastic, fantastic control panel.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Two networks to choose from, GSM and CDMA.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I really, really think this is something you should look at.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
linux.ting.com.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Go there to support the show and save a little bit.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
And when you go to the Ting site and you want to jump around a bit, why not check out their blog?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
They're doing customer spotlights.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They recently did some giveaways.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
They've done an Ask Zach recently about expanding customer support.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Tips on minimizing data usage.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
linux.ting.com.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Go check them out.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It's mobile that really makes sense.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Thank you, Ting.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Thank you.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So, Wes.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
Now, I'm also trying not to be inflammatory here, but we've got to talk about this.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Firefox 47.0 is out.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
So the big things that we care about in Firefox 47 is VP9 codec support is turned on for users

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
with fast machines, quote, unquote.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Quote, unquote.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Whatever that is.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
And YouTube videos now play with HTML5 video when Flash is not installed.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
That's a big, big upgrade.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
However, Windows users and Mac users also received a feature that Linux users...

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
You mean the most important users?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Maybe the most important feature, actually.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It's that whole...

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Okay, so I forget what the standard was, but basically Google was one of the companies behind it.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
And it was their effort to kill out Silverlight and things like that.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Mozilla has incorporated the HTML5 DRM CDM component.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You know what I'm talking about?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yes.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
That allows Netflix...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Encrypted media extensions or whatever.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
The encrypted...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yes.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Thank you.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
The encrypted media extension.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
That still allows you to watch encrypted media via HTML5 instead of having to use crappy

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Silverlight or crappy Flash.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Nobody wants DRM, but it seems that enough of us want to watch Netflix and Hulu or whatever

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
the crap.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Those are the trade-offs that we are making.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Apparently.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
So Google's been supporting that for Linux for almost a year now?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
It's been a while.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It's so long that I kind of forgot that Netflix used to be a hard thing to do on Linux, right?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
The only way I was even reminded that it's still a thing is whenever Noah is visiting

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and he wants to watch Netflix, it's the one thing he uses Chrome for.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
And I always laugh at him for it.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
It's adorable.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah, it's super adorable that this hardcore Firefox user has to install Chrome on every machine.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
And so, what the hell?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I mean, seriously, straight up, what the hell?

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
If Google could deliver this almost a year ago, I swear this is also not the first time

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
that Firefox has shipped with features that don't work on Linux that Chrome nailed a while ago.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Do you sense this?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I do.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
But I do wonder, given their position and the slope of said position, I wonder if they

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
just don't...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Are they spending this trying to get this out sooner?

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Would it be better to do a limited release and get Linux later than wait for the Linux

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
and do it all if they really want this to be competitive?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I'll tell you what I think.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Because if I can't watch Netflix...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, for a lot of people, that's a deal breaker.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
It's a total deal breaker.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
But if the whole Linux...

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't know how that breaks down.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Like, Linux market share on Chrome versus on Firefox compared to their other user bases.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It's interesting.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I bet you it's pretty high even though most distributions ship with Firefox as default.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I bet you Chromium is Chromium.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Here's what I think is going on.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
I don't think it's because Mozilla doesn't love Linux, although I think they could be

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
trying a little harder.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm a little disappointed, to be honest.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
But I don't think that's actually what it is.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
I think it's Mozilla getting their asses handed to them by Google.

22:36.000 --> 22:44.000
See, the things that have been happening, like the encryption extensions for HTML5 video

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
and a lot of the changes in the whole arena there, other specs as well, have all been

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
pushed by Google.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Yep.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
With Firefox playing catch-up.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
Mozilla has, in some cases, like with OpenH264 and H264 support in general, they drug and

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
drug and drug and drug and drug their feet.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And it wasn't until Cisco came along and bought up the licensing and released it under a compatible

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
license, and then worked with Mozilla, this is my understanding of the situation, that

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
we actually got a decent OpenH264 implementation in Firefox.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Right.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Thanks to Cisco doing something for the good of everyone.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
But even until 47, you didn't get HTML5 playback on YouTube.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
And still, it'll still use Flash if you have that installed.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
So why aren't they pushing the agenda forward here in a way that would seem to be taking

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
this by the lead, instead of they're always now trailing?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This seems bad to me.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
This seems like a really bad sign for Firefox.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I think there are bigger issues with Firefox than just Netflix.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
I noticed that Firefox doesn't even work properly with GDK anymore.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
So it doesn't scale together with GDK.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
So when I installed Ubuntu on my tablet, I have an x86 tablet, and I want all the fonts

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
to be bigger.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I want all the buttons to be bigger so everything works on the touchscreen, right?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
On Chrome, everything scales properly.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
On Firefox, it doesn't.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
Chrome works very well, or Chromium works very well with touch devices and touchscreens.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Firefox doesn't.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
And for me, this is a much bigger issue than something like Netflix, which is a single

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
website and support for touch devices, which there is more and more of everywhere.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
This affects everything that you do with the browser.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Ww, I want to give you a chance to jump in, too.

24:47.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't think, like, okay, video, whether it be Flash, HTML5, whatever, it's still the

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
heaviest burden on any web browser, Firefox especially included.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I have Flash installed on Firefox 46.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
I have an icon still view my preference of HTML5 videos perfectly fine, but it still

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
weighs down the browser no matter what.

25:14.000 --> 25:21.000
So, I mean, getting HTML5, hey, that's great for Linux users and Windows users and whoever

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
else.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
If you just have, you know, maybe you go from one video to the next, it just loads up the

25:28.000 --> 25:35.000
memory usage, even if you have, you know, so, yeah, we got HTML5, great, but you're

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
just trading one Flash for a different one, and you still have to pretty much watch your

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
usage of HTML5 video.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
That's true.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
I mean, the advantage, right, though, is you don't have that horrible, god-awful, zero-day

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
riddled Flash runtime.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
Well, Chrome eats your memory regardless of whether you are web users or not.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Or like the old age-old Flash bug where you couldn't have it open on one screen if you

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
clicked on the other screen, all that crap.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, Flash has been the bane of X11 users for years now.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
So, my take on this whole thing is if this continues to happen, and I'm not, and I would

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
really love for someone who really thinks I'm wrong to speak up, because what I'm worried

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
about is Firefox slowly slipping into a lot of little scenarios where Firefox just isn't

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
kind of going to work for that job.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And the more you have, right, it kind of snowballs.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
It seems like they catch up at the same time, but at the other, like...

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
One thing I have seen, like their stuff for web extensions, that seems like they're kind

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
of pushing the ball a little bit, but...

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
If Rodden Corpse is in here, I think he would be disagreeing with me because he's a Firefox

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
fan.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
Richard, I haven't heard from you, are you particular for Chrome, Chromium, Firefox,

26:43.000 --> 26:50.000
and do you feel like you disagree with the direction we're taking this?

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
I'm more of a Chromium fan lately just because it seems to work better for me, but I'm...

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
I mean, I don't use Flash.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I will never use Flash again.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Good for you, yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And I'm quite happy living without it.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Hell!

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Hmm.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
The glorious future.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Whoo!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
My beer overflew.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Well, so it sounds like you're sort of...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
That's okay.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Thanks, Wes.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Wes jumped up into action.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
So it sounds like, Richard, you're kind of in somewhat agreement with us in that the

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
trend seems to be that a lot of us have switched over to Chrome over the years.

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
Or Chromium, which is a better option probably for the Linux desktop in a lot of cases.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
All right.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, I'll save my thoughts for the rest of it as we...

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Geez, I got beer all over me.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
As we get into the rest of the Google discussion later.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
So, yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
All right.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Any other thoughts before we move on from the topic, guys?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Going once on Chromium and Firefox.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Going twice.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
All right.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Moving on.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
If you want to tell us...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
If you want to give us any feedback, you can always join us next week.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
You know, I should probably...

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Before we change complete topics, I should mention DO real quick.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I want you to go over to DigitalOcean and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Hey, thank you, Wes.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Look at that thing.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Look at that thing.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
That went crazy on me.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
That went legit crazy on me.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
We now have...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Beer all over the place.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
If I had my phone on me, I would take a picture of the...

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It looks like I piddled all over the floor.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It really looks bad.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It's really just a shame we didn't have one of Noah's laptops around to get ruined.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I know.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I know.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
I swear.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
See, this is why I don't drink beer on any other shows.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Because I end up spilling it like once every three episodes at this rate.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
This is horrible.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
So, that's why, you know what?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
For somebody like me, DigitalOcean's perfect.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Because apparently I can't even be trusted with a beer.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And that tells us how to manage their infrastructure.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
They manage the infrastructure, and I push the pretty buttons.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And they are very pretty buttons.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
They have a great interface and a great API.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Use our promo code D1Plug to get that $5 rig.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Try it out two months for free.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Did you say that right?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
$5?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
$5.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I know.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I know.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
It's really nice.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
And they just step it up from there.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
They got FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CoreOS, CentOS.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
They got data centers all over the world, including a brand new one in India.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
I think one of the better things about it, though, is the documentation.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Yes.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
They're good.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I was just over there right now.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
You know, you wouldn't think it, but they're still – like they still have – they just

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
revved an article for Ubuntu 14.04.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
There are still people out there doing that.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
An introduction to configuration management, a three-part series.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
That's great.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
My favorite part is that you can tell just by the documentation that like people like

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
you are the people that use DigitalOcean.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
You know, it's like they're not like 10-year-old people who haven't updated those.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
It's like people who use DigitalOcean, they're learning how to deploy Internet

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
because that's what you deploy today.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
You know, they have modern deployment practices.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Best guides.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
It's awesome.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, and they have the entire stack which you can deploy with everything ready to go

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
or you can set it all up from scratch yourself, which I like both of those things.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And, you know, the snapshots and the quick spin-up of the machines make trying different

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
versions of that stuff super easy too.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
DigitalOcean.com, just use the promo code DOUNPLUG to support us.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
And a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Okay, so I wanted to do that spot right there because I want to give us some room to talk

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
about ownCloud because there seems to be a lot of confusion about what the hell is going

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
on here.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
And if you didn't see Sunday's show, we had a talk with Joss and Frank from nextCloud.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
And I don't really have a particular agenda with this topic, not any more so than I would

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
typically.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
But it seems to me that people still are a little unclear on why they left, why they

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
couldn't just fix it at ownCloud.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
And it seems to me that people are a little unclear as to which lessons we should be taking

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
away from this to avoid this thing in the future.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
And like I mentioned at the top of the show, Swampy over at CIO.com has a pretty good write-up

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
that I think is worth sort of digging through and discussing a bit.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And it's titled, What We Can Learn From OwnCloud's Collapse.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
Now, I want to make it clear at this point in time, the ownCloud community and company

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
are still around.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
The U.S. division of the company has been shut down.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
But ownCloud is still there.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
You can still download ownCloud.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Theoretically, there's going to be an ownCloud 10 or whatever.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
So, ownCloud has not actually collapsed, but...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
There's been a shift in momentum?

31:02.000 --> 31:08.000
A lot of the core team has left, including the original founding developer.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
There's a lot of press.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I mean, it's...

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
NextCloud is probably the horse to bet on, I would suspect.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Anybody in the Mumble Room disagree before I...

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Yeah.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Hmm.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
You guys are so easy.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
People probably think that I just pick out yes men.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I really don't.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I swear I don't.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
We invite curmudgeons.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:36.000
So, my take on what we could learn in a moment, but first I just wanted to clarify a couple

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
of things on why it happened, I think, based on my reading of our chat with Frank and Joss,

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
and based on the reading of this post here.

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
A couple of things that stood out.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I guess it gets...

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
Let's start with what was really the obvious one was investors seem to be a problem.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
I think if you read between the lines, what they were saying is that a lot of Old Cloud's

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
features were held back because developers had to convince an investor in 30 seconds,

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
and every conversation led to a comparison with Dropbox.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Which make it sound like these lead developers, in particular the people that we're talking

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
about here, if you're constrained in that way where you feel like you can't do what

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
the community wants and what the people who are really interested want, I could say that

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
would be very frustrating.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah, basically the investors go, yeah, well, Dropbox doesn't do that, so we're not going

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
to do that.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I mean, right now, no.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
This is when MariaDB left Oracle, or MySQL.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Right, right.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Very much so.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I think there's some lessons there, too.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
Swampy writes, no matter who you talk to, from Sousa to Red Hat to CoreOS, every company

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
that has built its business around open source values the community the most.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
The community is what creates their projects.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
They have to strike a very fine balance between business needs and community needs, and that

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
balance seems to have been tripped, or I'm sorry, tipped, at Ong Cloud.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
The announcements of Ong Cloud Foundation was met with criticism from the open source

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
community, which saw it as proof that the company was still trying to be in control.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
For example, Ong Cloud Inc. had the majority control over the foundation, which gave them

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
the power to expel any community member.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Doesn't make you feel very much like a community president.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
No, it doesn't.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
Richard, he name drops Sousa there, and OpenSousa, I mean, you have to agree with that statement,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
I would imagine.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Every company that's built its business around open source values the community the most.

33:22.000 --> 33:31.000
He goes and talk about that they did not understand how to put community first, and in like a

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
dramatic sense, in a sense that sometimes would perhaps not lead to greater revenue,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
but would lead to a greater community.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Do you have any thoughts on that particular aspect of this situation, Richard?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
I think that part of Swampy's point is accurate.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
I mean, I don't know enough about the Ong Cloud situation to say, did they get that

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
totally wrong?

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
I mean, I think there's lots of different factors at play there, but the core message

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
that if you're going to be doing any kind of open source business, you can't forget

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
about your contributors.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
You can't forget about the developers.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
They're the heart and soul of the whole thing, and you have to find some way of striking

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
that balance between the two.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
If you get that mix wrong, then stuff like what we're seeing with Ong Cloud and Net

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Cloud definitely is the kind of thing you'd expect to see.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, it does.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That feels pretty genuine to me.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Joss also expresses frustrations on Google+, where he wrote that he had learned that often

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
with venture capital you have to limit yourself to doing things investors can understand rather

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
than what users, and in this case probably community, and customers ask for, or what

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
maybe could even make money.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
This doesn't always have to be an issue, but can be crippling, and it's frustrating because

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
management ends up forced to make short-term decisions that they know are bad.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
This is why business angels are better than venture capital.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah, it seems particularly that venture capital and open source are very rocky.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Sometimes at odds, yes.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
I mean, they screwed diaspora, really.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Venture capital killed diaspora.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
That is true.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah, diaspora did get the wiener.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
The situation was a little bit different with the attachment group, and therefore SUSE,

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
and therefore open SUSE, but I mean, that worked out pretty well.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
Well, but do you look at that as an investor so much, or do you look at that as a parent

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
company that sort of has strategic alliances, or alignments, I should say?

35:25.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, the attachment group was primarily VC-ish, yeah, investment group backed.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh, okay.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Not anymore.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
That's all micro-focused now.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
It's a public company in the UK, completely different structure.

35:38.000 --> 35:46.000
But yeah, for the post-Novell attachment group years, there's definite parallels there, and

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
I guess we just got lucky and got a group that understood that and had goals that kind

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
of fitted in nicely because it wasn't really an unhealthy relationship at all.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Yeah, it does seem like it's worked well.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
It doesn't seem like it's worked well.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
It did not work well out for own cloud.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
N3, you wanted to jump in here.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Go ahead.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, I mean, if you're justifying stuff to investors, you're forgetting the fact that

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
the point of open source is you're not limited by the narrow minds of your investors, or

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
profit motives, or any of these things that normally block you.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Okay.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Okay, go ahead.

36:21.000 --> 36:30.000
Most of my work has a huge base of open source, and we do release code, and our deal is to

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
make money.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Sorry.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Really.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
Most of it would depend on the people involved, because here's the scenario I see happening.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
A community comes along.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Somebody contributes something that's great for your project.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
It's just a great new feature or an obvious direction that you could go in, and maybe

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
it's something to do with sync, or maybe it is a rebuild of something that was done in

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
PHP to something more, well, different.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
And you go to the investor.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
You say, look at this great new code that somebody's brought to us.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
If we spent time expanding upon this, we could really build this into a super serious feature.

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
And you could see the investor going, take some third party's code and alter our trajectory

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
and our plans because of something that somebody in his basement put together for us?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
That's a ridiculous idea.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
You could see the way they would look at that would simply be, that's impractical.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
That would be irresponsible.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I'm sorry.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
That's not a real investor, though.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
That's not a real investor.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
I think it could depend on one.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Go ahead.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm just claiming that in the sense that investors look at free money, they look at, oh, somebody

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
gave us something to have an edge on something else.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
You would think so.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Free money.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I would think it would depend on the person, though.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
And honestly, there is the other side.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
If somebody just contributed a piece of code to your project and you have a vision, and

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
that's going to derail your vision, maybe you should be focusing on why you had the

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
first vision in the first place.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Actually, it's part of sane planning to do what you set yourself to do first.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Then you, you know, this side away from it.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
You have to have room to do that.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
And it's part of being, you know, an actual team that can produce results.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It's not just about investment.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
You as a project, you have to set goals and to meet those goals.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Otherwise, you fail to everyone you committed to.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Sure.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Sure.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Indeed.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Maybe I should have said monetary investors or, you know, VCs instead of because you can

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
invest code, too.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Sure.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Sure.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I think that it's a really good point.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
And I think this actually, this is like full blown Richard, the individual conspiracy theorist

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
going on here.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
I know nothing about this.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
But like if you, if you look at like some of the graphs that come out from the GitHub

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
from own cloud, you see a period back in like 2014 where like obviously own cloud Inc.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
was doing all of the work.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
There was no community.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
There was no momentum there.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
So in that kind of environment, I can imagine an investor going, well, we're doing all the

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
work.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
We can't trust on, we can't rely on this community.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
So, you know, it makes it this foreign, unreliable entity.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
And you think in sort of traditional software development company terms of what do we do?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
What do we control?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Blah.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
And I guess this goes back to the earlier point of with TropinalMate.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
You know, for this to all work properly, happily and healthily, you need to have that balance

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
between community and company.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Yeah.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
So if you have, so if you have the community who are, you know, doing a significant portion

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
during the majority, do it yet, you know, then that story to investor becomes completely

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
different.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.720
We have these guys who are basically giving us free stuff and we pay nothing for it besides

39:38.720 --> 39:43.100
maybe a little bit of sponsorship here and there, you know, this is awesome.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.280
It makes us millions.

39:45.280 --> 39:51.080
There's no funder in the world who isn't going to buy up that idea, but the community has

39:51.080 --> 39:58.320
to have, you know, it has to have maturity, strengths, you know, credibility that, yeah,

39:58.320 --> 40:03.240
if you look back at own cloud back in 2014, there's a clear sign that wasn't there then.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.240
Yeah.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
That's a great point.

40:05.240 --> 40:09.080
Skokie, you make a point about the corporate perspective and all of this.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.080
Well, okay.

40:10.080 --> 40:16.240
So on one hand you have, okay, there's never been a more litigious time in terms of from

40:16.240 --> 40:24.480
a corporate perspective to build in, to bring in open source libraries and code into any

40:24.480 --> 40:31.520
sort of, you know, real project that you want to package because now, you know, all of,

40:31.520 --> 40:32.520
you know what I'm talking about?

40:32.520 --> 40:35.200
Just like all the stuff around Android and all of the patent wars that we went through

40:35.200 --> 40:39.800
and all of the cross licensing and even the Oracle versus Google stuff going on.

40:39.800 --> 40:45.680
But by the same token, I think what we're kind of talking at cross points here in the

40:45.680 --> 40:53.080
sense that the power of free and open source software is that we adapt where a need is

40:53.080 --> 40:55.160
presented.

40:55.160 --> 41:06.640
You know, we fill, we move, we fix where larger corporate, you know, blah structures do not

41:06.640 --> 41:08.120
want to blah.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.120
Yeah.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.880
And also I would say we also stay focused in areas that are no longer sexy and marketable

41:13.880 --> 41:15.440
to large companies.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.440
Absolutely.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.440
Yeah.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.440
No, totally.

41:18.440 --> 41:22.520
Well, the thing is like, you know, we fix problems and what I mean is like, oh, well,

41:22.520 --> 41:25.760
you have a crazy use case, you know, X, well, fine.

41:25.760 --> 41:29.360
You know, Microsoft isn't going to fix that or come up with some sort of solution for

41:29.360 --> 41:30.360
that for you.

41:30.360 --> 41:34.240
Well, that's why free and open source, you know, blah is so powerful.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.160
And that's why it's, I mean, this is the first I've heard about on cloud, this is really

41:38.160 --> 41:39.160
depressing.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
Oh yeah.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.160
You got to check.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
Sunday's last.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.160
We covered all in there.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.520
All right.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.360
Any other thoughts from the room before we move on?

41:49.360 --> 41:50.840
Okay.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.440
So this is all interesting.

41:52.440 --> 41:56.400
It's funny how even when unplanned, there ends up being a thread that sort of connects

41:56.400 --> 42:00.640
the whole show together and I want to kind of wrap that thread up in the next segment.

42:00.640 --> 42:05.400
So let's, this is a perfectly natural spot to stop and say thank you to Linux Academy

42:05.400 --> 42:07.480
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

42:07.480 --> 42:08.600
Love this sponsor.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.200
This is a great idea.

42:10.200 --> 42:16.160
This is a, this was a brilliant way to honestly make a little money for it by producing Linux

42:16.160 --> 42:17.160
content.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
Right.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.160
Really clever.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
And the key was to actually make something useful.

42:20.160 --> 42:25.560
So they've got 2,465 self-based courses with videos and comprehensive study guides and

42:25.560 --> 42:29.760
downloadable material that you get to keep and own and they come with virtual labs that

42:29.760 --> 42:32.240
spin up as you need them and give you SSH access.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.880
You can choose the distro which will adjust the virtual machine and the courseware.

42:36.880 --> 42:41.200
I think probably the key thing to Linux Academy though is their insight into the community

42:41.200 --> 42:45.540
because they are Linux enthusiasts and users themselves and part of the reason they created

42:45.540 --> 42:48.320
the Academy was to promote Linux adoption.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.240
They follow the trends extremely well.

42:51.240 --> 42:57.380
They had, they had stuff on containers when containers were just brand new.

42:57.380 --> 43:01.080
When the big switch from IP tables was happening, some of the first courseware here at Linux

43:01.080 --> 43:05.920
Academy, like they follow this stuff super closely because they are Linux users themselves.

43:05.920 --> 43:10.760
They have instructor mentoring available which is fantastic for this level of courseware.

43:10.760 --> 43:14.440
They have graded server exercises which will help you with your test anxiety.

43:14.440 --> 43:17.720
They have some of the best courseware out there on the topics they cover.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.600
They've hired staff recently, they've gotten some funding and they are doubling down on

43:21.600 --> 43:26.040
making sure their back catalog stays relevant which I think is brilliant as well as researching

43:26.040 --> 43:30.440
future topics and building new features into the platform all the time.

43:30.440 --> 43:34.080
Your membership is constantly getting more valuable.

43:34.080 --> 43:37.240
Start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.240
That will give you our discount.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.000
They have recently restructured their pricing to a really simple, easy to understand format

43:42.000 --> 43:45.800
and you get a great deal if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.240
Whether you are looking for something like the Red Hat certified courseware to understanding

43:49.240 --> 43:53.360
Android development, they have got it and they have got great courses on it with instructor

43:53.360 --> 43:55.280
mentoring available.

43:55.280 --> 43:58.800
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.440
Thanks Linux Academy.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.440
You guys rock.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.440
It's a nice resource.

44:02.440 --> 44:03.440
It's a great resource.

44:03.440 --> 44:08.440
It's really kind of nice to have a resource out there like that and to have them want

44:08.440 --> 44:10.480
to be sponsors on our little podcast.

44:10.480 --> 44:11.480
Thank you guys.

44:11.480 --> 44:16.720
Now, I've got to talk about something that – so I'm getting all reflective because

44:16.720 --> 44:21.880
of the 10th anniversary and we were talking like, hey, should we do like – hey, let's

44:21.880 --> 44:25.600
talk about something that we thought is just the funniest thing over the last 10 years

44:25.600 --> 44:29.000
or the biggest dramatic thing or some of the big stories.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
We just would kind of do them here as a little fun to do segment and I started thinking about

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
it.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.960
You know, if there's one thing that's haunted me for the last 10 years is that I

44:36.960 --> 44:39.840
keep slipping into services.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.840
Services.

44:40.840 --> 44:45.560
I've managed I feel like to pretty much free myself from proprietary software in my

44:45.560 --> 44:51.320
daily life and in 95% of my media production.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.520
It's getting way up there now.

44:52.520 --> 44:53.920
Like I'm feeling really good.

44:53.920 --> 44:58.240
But when it comes to services, specifically ones that I'm actually a little paranoid

44:58.240 --> 45:00.600
about and you know who I'm talking about.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.040
I'm talking about the Googles.

45:02.040 --> 45:08.160
People honestly, I think we don't spend enough time conceptualizing how much they actually

45:08.160 --> 45:09.160
know about us.

45:09.160 --> 45:14.680
When I hear people talk about Google Photos, I don't know if they fully realize the amount

45:14.680 --> 45:18.380
of data that Google can get when you take family pictures and then have them back up

45:18.380 --> 45:20.380
to Google Photos.

45:20.380 --> 45:23.760
Google has the capability of analyzing the emotions on your face.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.880
They have the capability of analyzing those faces to see what other people are in your

45:27.880 --> 45:29.120
social network.

45:29.120 --> 45:34.200
Not your fake online social network, but your actual real social network because you're

45:34.200 --> 45:37.520
taking pictures of people and they're associating those with your account.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.940
They have location information in those photos.

45:39.940 --> 45:43.220
They have the phone information like what model it is so they can see how often you

45:43.220 --> 45:44.220
buy new phones.

45:44.220 --> 45:48.560
I mean there is so much information out of every single service that they get.

45:48.560 --> 45:52.540
And if you ever want to know, you can just go look at your Google Dashboard and be sort

45:52.540 --> 45:55.360
of blown away by all the stuff that's in there.

45:55.360 --> 46:02.480
My favorite one is going to the Voice Activity page because they record every voice command.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.480
That's big for me.

46:03.480 --> 46:07.480
I do a lot of dictation because I'm a horrible speller, often because I've got my hands

46:07.480 --> 46:15.980
very busy, and I also will use the OK Googs feature to search for stuff.

46:15.980 --> 46:21.640
And sometimes I even use it because if I can't find it on any of my home screens, instead

46:21.640 --> 46:26.340
of tapping the application drawer and bringing up all the apps, I'll use the Google launcher

46:26.340 --> 46:28.600
to just launch the application.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.880
And it's so creepy when you actually stop and realize that they have all of that.

46:32.880 --> 46:36.560
So here's me yesterday at 7.04 p.m.

46:36.560 --> 46:44.080
OK Google, open the new egg app.

46:44.080 --> 46:51.000
What's creepy is there's a good second before I even say OK Googs, right?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.560
And here I am again.

46:53.560 --> 46:57.720
OK Google, open the Twitch app.

46:57.720 --> 47:01.560
So you can hear my kids are watching DuckTales in the background.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.000
And here I am again.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.400
OK Google, best Twitter app for Android.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.600
I barely remember doing any of these things.

47:11.600 --> 47:12.960
Did you find that app?

47:12.960 --> 47:15.760
Here I am talking to my Android TV.

47:15.760 --> 47:19.200
Hydraulic RV slide maintenance.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.920
I was looking for YouTube videos.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.200
The audio quality is horrible on that one.

47:25.200 --> 47:29.920
You just go through your Google dashboard and it's remarkable what they know about you.

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
It's really stunning.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.840
And that means they can do whatever they want with that, right?

47:32.840 --> 47:34.400
They can break down how your voice works.

47:34.400 --> 47:38.160
They could be building samples, whatever makes sense.

47:38.160 --> 47:43.960
Another example is I have Google Now turned on, which I find to be very valuable as you

47:43.960 --> 47:45.520
start to use it more.

47:45.520 --> 47:51.000
And I have an Android Wear watch that has Google Fit.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.880
And when you enable Google Fit, you turn on an extra layer of accuracy for your GPS tracking.

47:56.880 --> 48:02.840
And so it literally tracks me so closely now that it knows when I cut across a driveway

48:02.840 --> 48:10.140
versus going down the pathway, it plays it all back through the Fit application.

48:10.140 --> 48:13.840
And to that degree now, they have noticed, Google has, that I've started taking certain

48:13.840 --> 48:15.860
side roads on my home route.

48:15.860 --> 48:22.040
And now it has begun giving me my estimated time of arrival using these side roads that

48:22.040 --> 48:24.960
it would never map you if you didn't go that way.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.040
Yeah, because the route I originally started taking was the way Google Maps sent me the

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
first time.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.000
And then as I learned the area, I started taking side roads that I prefer.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.240
And now it is automatically when I pull up my Nexus here and I look at the Google Now

48:35.240 --> 48:38.380
card, it'll automatically represent my preferred route.

48:38.380 --> 48:42.880
And that data probably goes into Waze and now they recommend it to other people too.

48:42.880 --> 48:50.000
It is weird because I find myself fascinated by some of the advances that actually have

48:50.000 --> 48:53.820
proved to be over the last, I would say, year or so that I've really been experimenting

48:53.820 --> 48:55.960
with Google Now, actually useful.

48:55.960 --> 48:59.760
Right, like about a year, two years ago, it didn't really feel, you were like, okay, great,

48:59.760 --> 49:01.440
you know I'm at the mall, fun.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
It seemed obvious.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.440
Exactly.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.000
And I think it sucks that it's mostly only on mobile.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
And so if you really want to take advantage of it, you have to be on a mobile device.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.200
However, it's now gotten, it's gotten really good at guessing what kind of news stories

49:15.200 --> 49:16.200
I like to follow.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.200
Yes, definitely.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.180
It's gotten really good at looking at my shipped packages and telling me when they're going

49:20.180 --> 49:21.180
to arrive.

49:21.180 --> 49:27.520
All of that stuff I've actually found helps me when things are really busy and I'm doing

49:27.520 --> 49:30.560
a really shitty job of being a human being and I'm just not keeping up with things.

49:30.560 --> 49:34.120
You just don't have that spare cycle at all, even to track your packages.

49:34.120 --> 49:38.320
So I had that Google Now card came up that said, hey, you know, your Amex bills do like

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
right now.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.320
Do you want to pay this?

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
Yeah.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.320
I do.

49:42.320 --> 49:43.320
I do want to pay that.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.320
Thank you.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.320
Yeah.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.320
I've been super busy.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.320
I hadn't thought about that.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.320
I was going to miss that.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
Yeah, I was.

49:49.320 --> 49:55.200
And so it does seem to be patching some holes that I find as a regular, as just a, as apparently

49:55.200 --> 49:57.040
a dysfunctional member of society.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.940
I can't keep track of these things sometimes.

49:58.940 --> 50:06.400
And so it's nice to have this big brain that is augmenting to some degree these weak spots

50:06.400 --> 50:07.880
for me.

50:07.880 --> 50:12.320
However, when I think about the amount of data they are collecting on me, all of my

50:12.320 --> 50:17.280
email, all of my text messages, all of my location information.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.080
I'm just looking at my location history right here.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.080
Yeah.

50:21.080 --> 50:25.880
And all of my docs that I put in Google docs, all of this stuff is they have so, so much

50:25.880 --> 50:29.920
on me that also at the same time feels like it's not actually sufficient to how much they

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
can actually do.

50:30.920 --> 50:35.280
It feels like it should be more than that for the amount of privacy that they have taken

50:35.280 --> 50:36.280
from me.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.280
Yeah.

50:37.280 --> 50:41.000
And so I look at this and I think, how come now 10 years into doing these shows I have,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.240
I have not gone just, why have I not become a hard liner on this?

50:45.240 --> 50:48.500
Why have I not drawn a hard line that says I just refuse to use these services?

50:48.500 --> 50:50.360
Why am I not a Trisco user?

50:50.360 --> 50:57.560
You know, why, why, what is it about, I feel like I am, I am being irresponsible in a way.

50:57.560 --> 51:03.880
Like I feel like part of me, part of me legitimately knows that they are, they are probably building

51:03.880 --> 51:07.840
a profile that is much deeper and richer of me than I can probably even conceptualize.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
Right.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.760
I mean, let's look at the resources they have and all of the information and data input

51:11.760 --> 51:15.860
they have, especially when you start using an Android device and Android Wear and it's

51:15.860 --> 51:19.920
constantly monitoring my steps, my heart rate, and my location.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.320
It's about the best tracking device you could hope to design right now.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.320
Yeah.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.720
And when I do voice commands, which I do all the time, they're capturing my emotion at

51:25.720 --> 51:28.680
the time, they're capturing my kids in the background, the voices that are in there.

51:28.680 --> 51:32.000
When I take photos on my Android device, they're automatically uploaded to Google Photos and

51:32.000 --> 51:36.520
I can type in Dylan Hugs and I can see every time I took a picture of Dylan getting a hug.

51:36.520 --> 51:40.440
So they understand what a hug is.

51:40.440 --> 51:44.080
So I don't think I'm even conceptualizing fully how much they know about me and yet

51:44.080 --> 51:50.800
even knowing that and knowing the downsides of getting locked into proprietary closed

51:50.800 --> 51:59.700
systems, even all that, I still find myself slipping into Google services all the time.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.520
I just feel like, I feel like I'm crazy.

52:01.520 --> 52:02.520
I'm a spooky sprite.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.520
Am I crazy?

52:03.520 --> 52:04.520
Of course you're crazy.

52:04.520 --> 52:07.880
Are you out of your mind?

52:07.880 --> 52:13.760
Like crazy for the fact that every, I don't know, I've been listening to Jupyter Broadcasting

52:13.760 --> 52:16.200
for like what, three, four years now.

52:16.200 --> 52:21.000
And yeah, every time you have this moment of reflection, everyone in the audience is

52:21.000 --> 52:24.080
like, yeah, Chris, you are the product.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.960
You are just realizing this and you work in the tech industry.

52:26.960 --> 52:27.960
I know that.

52:27.960 --> 52:28.960
That's the problem.

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
I mean, look at you though.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
You have the Amazon Echo.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.960
I have the Echo, but the Echo, okay, so there's a big difference.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.760
The Echo doesn't follow me around.

52:37.760 --> 52:38.760
That's one thing.

52:38.760 --> 52:43.600
The other thing is like, fine, Amazon, I buy everything through Amazon anyway.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.640
I got nothing really to hide from Amazon.

52:46.640 --> 52:51.360
Amazon doesn't follow my traffic to work and blah, blah, blah.

52:51.360 --> 52:58.720
But anyway, have you looked at how easy it is to spot two people in a cloud?

52:58.720 --> 53:01.680
This is not like anything that's tracking your heartbeat or anything like that.

53:01.680 --> 53:08.360
How easy it is to figure out two people, like 500 people in a metropolitan area who are

53:08.360 --> 53:10.200
going to meet each other surreptitiously.

53:10.200 --> 53:17.320
I mean, okay, so that's the unhappy side of this.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.520
You're still coming to grips with the happy side of it.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.520
Yeah, sure.

53:20.520 --> 53:23.520
They're using all, you are the aggregate of your data.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.600
You are an advertising product.

53:25.600 --> 53:30.080
So that's not even the thing that I was claiming to be different.

53:30.080 --> 53:35.720
I guess one of the reasons I'm able to step aside and not get so much sucked into those

53:35.720 --> 53:41.360
services is basically because I can and try my best to shut down on news.

53:41.360 --> 53:47.280
I consume my news from curated sources, which tend to have already freedom and perspective

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
and things like that.

53:48.280 --> 53:51.120
And I still participate in the show.

53:51.120 --> 53:56.040
And on the other side, because you are collecting information for the show, you are exposed

53:56.040 --> 53:59.000
to all of the cool features and the cool things that are coming out.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.600
You have to talk about it.

54:00.600 --> 54:03.080
So you're like, all right, I did the research.

54:03.080 --> 54:04.080
I did all this stuff.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.640
Let me try it out so that I have a first hand experience.

54:08.640 --> 54:13.360
That is actually, your point is pretty valid because the entire reason I went back to the

54:13.360 --> 54:18.200
Nexus platform was to try out Android N so I could have an educated opinion about the

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
current version of Android.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.760
People, I think, often consider me a Google basher.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.680
And I try to weigh the good and bad of every situation.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.480
And I think there's things that Google does that are awful.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.700
And I think there's things that Google does that are actually fairly compelling.

54:29.700 --> 54:35.640
And so I think N, honestly, if you put some of the current performance issues aside, N,

54:35.640 --> 54:39.320
and I just talked about it in yesterday's Tech Talk today, is a super solid release

54:39.320 --> 54:40.680
with really great security features.

54:40.680 --> 54:43.800
And I thought, OK, well, I got my Nexus 5 back from NOAA.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.560
It's time to give this a go.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.960
And then that one thing led to another.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.440
And now I'm all in.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.440
Now I'm all in again.

54:51.440 --> 54:53.840
We always knew you were an Android fiend at heart, Chris.

54:53.840 --> 54:58.520
You can't always take that reflection moment to cut it off completely.

54:58.520 --> 55:04.920
But you have to gain the courage to actually, when you are in that momentum, to cut it off.

55:04.920 --> 55:09.360
Not just to deactivate the account, delete the account.

55:09.360 --> 55:13.600
I think that's the problem, is I actually am feeling like maybe I'm going to continue

55:13.600 --> 55:14.600
to go all in.

55:14.600 --> 55:20.400
I think I'm starting to feel like it's worth the, I guess I'm starting to, I should say

55:20.400 --> 55:21.400
this differently.

55:21.400 --> 55:25.120
I'm trying to conceptualize what the absolute worst case scenario is.

55:25.120 --> 55:31.320
And then from that, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the cost for the convenience

55:31.320 --> 55:32.320
it brings me.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.680
Again, I'm a dysfunctional human being that apparently the only thing I can really reliably

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
do is make podcasts.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.120
And beyond that, I'm unfunctional.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.120
And so it's helpful.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.120
Thankfully we have an economy where you can outsource some of these things.

55:41.120 --> 55:44.760
It's helpful that I've outsourced part of my brain to this machine.

55:44.760 --> 55:49.800
And on top of that, it is good from a research standpoint, from a content point of view.

55:49.800 --> 55:53.480
But I find myself considering going further with it and continuing to just go further

55:53.480 --> 55:54.480
down the rabbit's hole.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.080
And that's, I think, what's really alarming to me.

55:57.080 --> 56:02.080
And not like, I tell you, I've tried to conceptualize the worst case scenario.

56:02.080 --> 56:07.280
And the way I see it is, try to avoid putting directly sensitive information into the Google

56:07.280 --> 56:08.280
machine.

56:08.280 --> 56:15.960
However, there's a ton of leakage just because of the way all the services report back.

56:15.960 --> 56:20.440
But if I had, say one day I decided to make a dirty video right here in the studio.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.920
We take the green screen and we make a nice dirty video, because why not, right?

56:23.920 --> 56:25.880
It's what everybody jokes about when they come visit the studio.

56:25.880 --> 56:26.880
Everybody.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.360
Oh, you know what this would be great for?

56:28.360 --> 56:29.360
No.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.360
What?

56:30.360 --> 56:31.360
You should do a porn set.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
Nobody's ever told you that, huh?

56:32.360 --> 56:33.360
You'd make a ton of money.

56:33.360 --> 56:37.600
You mean they don't watch JB after dark?

56:37.600 --> 56:41.640
So seriously though, if I was going to do something like that, I wouldn't put that in

56:41.640 --> 56:45.960
my Google Drive, or cloud whatever, or up on Google Photos.

56:45.960 --> 56:49.580
But I think that's where you're fooling yourself if you think you're still not leaking a ton

56:49.580 --> 56:50.900
of information to them.

56:50.900 --> 56:54.220
My worst case scenario, when I conceptualize it, what's the worst thing that could happen

56:54.220 --> 56:56.760
to me?

56:56.760 --> 57:03.220
It would seem that I could get, that information could be subpoenaed if down the road I decide

57:03.220 --> 57:10.800
to do some sort of act of civil disobedience and I get caught up by the law.

57:10.800 --> 57:15.160
They could subpoena my Google Fit data and see exactly where I was at at the time that

57:15.160 --> 57:17.780
big dong got spray painted on the side of the building.

57:17.780 --> 57:21.060
And so far we've seen, we know we've seen the Apple hacks and the celeb breaches and

57:21.060 --> 57:25.460
that kind of stuff, but I don't know, at least publicly there hasn't been that much of blackmail

57:25.460 --> 57:30.520
extortion control, but eventually these data sets, in the wrong hands, if you're in the

57:30.520 --> 57:34.580
wrong place at the wrong time or you did something, even the wrong picture, even if it's an innocuous

57:34.580 --> 57:37.180
picture, you have enough of them, you can find a picture that looks like someone's doing

57:37.180 --> 57:38.180
something wrong.

57:38.180 --> 57:39.180
Yeah.

57:39.180 --> 57:43.860
It is concerning too when you, I don't quite understand, if Google was really clear about

57:43.860 --> 57:49.940
what the policy around my data was, for example, like, Google how many times Eric Schmidt visited

57:49.940 --> 57:52.500
the White House, why is Eric Schmidt going to the White House all the time?

57:52.500 --> 57:56.560
What kind of relationship is between Google and the federal government and is that something

57:56.560 --> 57:59.220
I should legitimately be concerned about or is that just conspiracy bacon?

57:59.220 --> 58:02.380
If they would just be super clear about this is the way we use your data.

58:02.380 --> 58:04.900
So you can make the trade off yourself with full knowledge.

58:04.900 --> 58:05.900
Yeah.

58:05.900 --> 58:06.900
Yeah.

58:06.900 --> 58:10.780
It also brings up to me the larger question of as tech literate people, where do you draw

58:10.780 --> 58:15.020
the line between hosting your own stuff and outsourcing that to other services?

58:15.020 --> 58:16.020
Right.

58:16.020 --> 58:19.060
Because it's like, we all have those skills, but when is the right trade off?

58:19.060 --> 58:20.440
Yeah, go ahead.

58:20.440 --> 58:22.140
I have a crazy proposition.

58:22.140 --> 58:28.780
There's this project Ethereum, which is based on the blockchain concept, but the mathematical

58:28.780 --> 58:36.220
pretty much function that has to be solved for the blockchain to work is actually random

58:36.220 --> 58:42.020
operations, random operation of any type of software, which essentially means that you

58:42.020 --> 58:43.580
can distribute your applications.

58:43.580 --> 58:48.860
Eventually, you can get the Google compute power on all distributed machines.

58:48.860 --> 58:56.620
It's not going to be as fast, but then maybe you buy Digital Ocean, for example, and put

58:56.620 --> 59:00.060
it running a node so that you have a little bit faster response.

59:00.060 --> 59:03.180
Then you solve that type of scenario.

59:03.180 --> 59:06.060
The blockchain, that's an interesting solution.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.780
Blockchain means, you know, we talk about it, Popey shows up.

59:08.780 --> 59:10.780
Popey, you are going to make a comment about Alibi.

59:10.780 --> 59:11.780
Go ahead.

59:11.780 --> 59:16.820
So, like, you're looking at it from the negative point of view that they've got all this data

59:16.820 --> 59:23.500
and, you know, they could correlate some data about you in a particular place at a particular

59:23.500 --> 59:24.500
time.

59:24.500 --> 59:27.060
Because that could actually work to your benefit.

59:27.060 --> 59:36.220
If someone in a town near me with, fitting my description, looks a bit like Elvis, sounds

59:36.220 --> 59:41.260
a bit like a robotic device you've got on your desk, all those kind of things, right?

59:41.260 --> 59:43.820
I see you use Arch Linux.

59:43.820 --> 59:44.940
Uses Arch Linux.

59:44.940 --> 59:47.740
All these things are dead giveaways that it could be me.

59:47.740 --> 59:54.220
But I also happen to have maybe an Android device nearby that I'm using Mozilla Stumbler

59:54.220 --> 59:56.820
to report my location to help the Mozilla project.

59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.780
I'm using Ingress, the game, when reporting my location in that.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.140
I'm using Google Maps.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.100
I'm sending messages via Telegram, which I'm getting my IP address.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:13.860
So there's like 10 or more apps on my Android device that are actually my Alibi.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:19.340
So when something goes wrong, you know, I can call on potentially those people with

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:25.740
a request for my data and prove my innocence that I wasn't at the location where the crime

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740
occurred.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740
That's very true.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.180
The difference is you are in Europe and you can make data requests.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.180
Unfortunately our US friends don't have that ability.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.460
That's the problem with, you know, separating away and becoming one of the separate colonies.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.220
You know, they should have not done that.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.420
You know, I tell you, the other thing that struck me too is if I'm going to worry about

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.740
Google, then I probably should be crapping my pants about the credit card companies and

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740
the carriers.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.460
Because they've got their fingers just in there too.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.820
Yeah, and they're doing, you know, super cookies where they're monitoring all of your web traffic

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.500
or in the case of the credit card companies, they're selling your data to data brokers,

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.880
what you buy, where you buy it, how much you spend.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.940
All of these things are happening and it's a big industry around it.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:08.460
Huge industry and they do not, trust me, when it comes to respecting privacy, not the top

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.460
of their list.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.460
No.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.220
Yeah, and I might change my tune because right now the UK government are debating the Investigatory

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:21.900
Powers Bill, which will enforce ISPs to record for a year or more every website that I visit.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.660
So I'm probably going to make some changes in my life as a result of that because I'm

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:33.000
actually less worried about Google having access to all this data than I am my own government.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.100
That's actually why I worry about Google is because it seems like it's just one national

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.660
security letter away.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.180
Which is concerning for all services, really.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.060
It's not a Google specific one, it's just how much information do they have.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:50.660
Probably, what kind of changes, VPN, what would you?

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:58.180
My employer already provides me with a VPN and I could potentially enable that on every

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:04.420
device or I could do it system-wide on my network at home and route all my traffic through

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.500
that VPN.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.500
That would help.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.140
I might consider using Tor.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.540
There are some really nice Tor apps for Android, for example.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.460
We don't have any on Ubuntu phone, but I do on the desktop, so I'm certainly looking into

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.100
these things if this legislation passes.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.620
I bet.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:28.180
Before we wrap up completely, I thought, looking back at the last 10 years, this seems to me

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:33.400
for Linux desktop users to be a big... The services aspect, we could move over to a free

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.580
platform and then end up locked into a bunch of services.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.180
Not that it's not something we haven't talked about, but looking back at the last decade,

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.740
it's something that seems like a bigger problem than it's ever been right now.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.740
It really is.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.740
I feel like I'm in the middle of it.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.940
Pobie, before we go, before we wrap up, I saw in the G Pluses that you have one of them

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.940
there, Raspberry Pi Nanos?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
Is that what they're called?

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.940
Pi Zero.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940
Pi Zero, right.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Pi Zero.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940
Pi Zero.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.300
Well, I was thinking it'd be a fun little piece of kid to get it.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.460
What have your thoughts been on it?

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460
I have a couple of them.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.100
I have one, the original Pi Zero when that first came out.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:12.620
This is the second generation Pi Zero, which has a camera connector on the end.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.600
They're both destined to go in small projects.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.380
They're not really designed to be desktops.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:22.780
They're not designed to be media centers or anything like that.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.380
My goal is to put them inside something quite small, but I haven't... I have some plans

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.300
and I have some things in pieces, but I haven't quite decided exactly what to put them in

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300
yet.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.860
I say robot body parts that connect back to a Mycroft head unit.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.740
Just walking around.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.580
The only command it accepts is to watch the JB live stream.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.860
There you go, Wes.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.860
All right.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:48.220
We'll probably be screeching to a halt here because I got a telegram from Mr. Chase Nunes

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.220
a little bit ago.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.220
He, Chase Nunes?

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.220
Yeah.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.780
He is in route right now.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780
It's a big day here.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780
Wow.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780
He's only 30 minutes away, too.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.900
It's a big day here in the US of A.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900
Yes, it is.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.060
We're going to switch gears over to our on filter show here in just a moment.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:09.080
Before we wrap up, I just wanted to say that if you are around on Sunday, we would really

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.820
love if you'd come and visit us at jblive.tv.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.780
I hear it's kind of a huge show.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.020
Well, we're looking forward to it.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020
I'll tell you this.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.540
We're doing a couple of things that I've wanted to do for a really, really long time, and

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.700
I think they turned out pretty fun.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.080
We're doing that on Sunday, and there may be a few things that are worth turning up

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080
live for at jblive.tv.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.100
You can get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.020
Now, this show here, this show's on Tuesdays, Wes.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.020
Did you know that?

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020
Yes, I do.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020
Yeah, Tuesdays.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020
Tuesdays.

A lot of times, we'll look for open source spotlights.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.480
We go out and scour the web.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480

Dude, dude, dude.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.280
Mind on my cloud and the cloud on my mind.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280
That's pretty good.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.860
It's super long, but that's pretty good.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.460
NSA endorses googs.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.420
You like that one there, Wes?

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.120
Mhm.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.500
The money and my cloud.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.380
Chris Lasck goes Alex Jones, I don't think so.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.680
You just go look it up.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.680
Just go look it up.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.980
I'm not saying, I got the documents.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.020
You haven't got the croaky voice for Alex Jones.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.760
I got the documents right here.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.080
It's real.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.080
Mustaches

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.440
And you know I think about it when I did the recording of the voice for the mic off at no point

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440
Did they ask me to go?

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.920
Did they have you repeat mustaches in various different ways though cuz that's that's that's what's important

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:05.360
I am the world's biggest lightweight. You know I oh man, so I've been I've been fighting a cold

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.680
but it's been like it's been one of those things where it's

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:15.160
Instead of getting like really really bad on me like they used to it's just sort of been real mild now for about two

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:22.440
Three weeks. I haven't working crazy hours, so I think maybe I just haven't really had time to to heal necessarily so yesterday

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.160
I started to suspect well

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.120
Maybe it's allergies so right before we started tech talk today Angela's like take this Zyrtec

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.240
And I'm like this is non-drowsy right so yeah, it's absolutely non-drowsy which I believe I take it two hours later

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.200
I'm asleep. I I could not I was out so then I woke up after a few hours still felt sick

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.360
I'm like oh, I don't feel good and now I'm not tired cuz I slept right so

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.920
My lady's like here take some NyQuil. I'm like oh, yeah, okay. That's a great idea

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.880
I'm like this is got a decongestion in it right cuz I would love to be able to breathe through my nose

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:53.560
Yes, she's like yes. It does. I'm so I take the NyQuil down the NyQuil

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.480
I don't get particularly sleepy at nighttime although

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.000
I didn't sleep solid all night long, but today. I have not been able to shake that like drowsy

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.560
drowsy slow oh, I have like a NyQuil hangover. I need to have each little thought and yeah

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.280
Yeah, exactly it's a good way to put it and like I'm reading like it's not supposed to last like this long

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.280
Why does it why does it why does that happen to me?

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.560
So I tried going out going for a walk got some sunshine took a cold shower

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.680
Tried to take a nap although I couldn't fall asleep did all those things still barely made a difference

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.320
So it's good to have caffeine yeah

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:34.400
Mm-hmm so I'll probably you know I'll probably pass out during unfiltered tonight. That's fine. Yeah, that's good
