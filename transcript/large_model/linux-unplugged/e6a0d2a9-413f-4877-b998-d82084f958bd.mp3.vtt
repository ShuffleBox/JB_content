WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Google box. And it's basically cameras pointing at people in

00:03.300 --> 00:07.740
the lounge watching the TV. So you watch people watching TV is

00:07.740 --> 00:12.500
quite entertaining, mindless bullshit TV. But it's, it's the

00:12.500 --> 00:14.940
characters. It's like people sat around in their lounge watching

00:14.940 --> 00:18.820
some TV program, and the way they react to it. It's, it's

00:18.820 --> 00:20.020
crap. But I love it.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.660
John Greenewald People, wait a minute, you're watching people

00:22.680 --> 00:23.620
watching TV?

00:23.940 --> 00:25.500
Jason Valee Yeah, they know they're being watched. They're

00:25.500 --> 00:26.260
they're, they're

00:26.300 --> 00:27.940
John Greenewald Are they at home? Are they and they have

00:27.940 --> 00:28.500
like webcams?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.660
Jason Valee They're in their homes. No, it's proper cameras.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.420
John Greenewald Where do I see this? Where do I see this?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.620
Jason Valee You can probably find it on the YouTube.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.700
John Greenewald Tell me what it's called. Tell me what it's

00:36.700 --> 00:36.860
called.

00:36.860 --> 00:37.860
Jason Valee Google, Google.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.900
Jason Valee This thing called the internet, Chris, everything's

00:39.900 --> 00:40.700
on the internet.

00:40.780 --> 00:42.460
Jason Valee Oh my god, it's not it's not that good. You don't

00:42.460 --> 00:44.580
need to go and find it. It's on channel four in the UK.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.540
John Greenewald I feel like I need to find it.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.980
Jason Valee Google box. Yeah. So anyway, um,

00:48.380 --> 00:49.100
John Greenewald Oh my gosh.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.940
Jason Valee You just reminded me that these two old ladies were

00:50.940 --> 00:53.700
sat there. And they were using a Remington fuzz away just last

00:53.700 --> 00:58.580
week to get all the bubbles on a jumper. Thanks. Was was the

00:58.580 --> 01:01.380
innovation, technological technological innovation of 1986

01:01.380 --> 01:04.140
that thing? It was and then one of them was going to get all the

01:04.140 --> 01:06.260
bubbles off. And the other one was like, Oh, in that marvelous

01:06.300 --> 01:11.620
John Greenewald series 11. Episode nine is literally a

01:11.620 --> 01:15.500
couple of old ladies sitting around watching Britain's Got

01:15.500 --> 01:19.540
Talent antique roadshow, the Queen's Green Planet, buy it

01:19.540 --> 01:23.180
now, and Yorkshire vet. And so you're watching these old ladies

01:23.180 --> 01:24.100
watch those shows.

01:24.140 --> 01:26.980
Jason Valee It's not just those two ladies between lots of

01:26.980 --> 01:29.740
different families. There's like big families, there's an Asian

01:29.740 --> 01:32.660
family, there's a group who live up north. And so there's all

01:32.660 --> 01:36.020
different accents in there and different like characters. And

01:36.020 --> 01:40.900
maybe they're there's a there's a woman and her best mate who

01:40.940 --> 01:45.340
live in a caravan like a mobile home somewhere. And those two

01:45.340 --> 01:47.660
sitting next to each other quite is just quite entertaining the

01:47.660 --> 01:48.820
kind of characters.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.700
John Greenewald If anybody ever wondered if there was a market

01:50.700 --> 01:53.020
for people watching people play video games, this shows you

01:53.020 --> 01:56.180
they're totally if there's people. Can you hear the TV

01:56.180 --> 01:58.700
show? Can you hear what they're watching? Or do you just cut to

01:58.700 --> 02:01.060
they cut to it. So you know what they're watching you get the

02:01.060 --> 02:03.420
clips of whatever it is they're watching and then it cuts to

02:03.420 --> 02:05.900
them. Okay, as if you're cutting to the audience of a TV. So

02:05.900 --> 02:08.900
you're watching the reaction. I see. I can't I can't believe I've

02:08.900 --> 02:11.740
outed myself as watching this program because you'll never

02:11.740 --> 02:16.980
live it down. Not for a day. Brilliant. I love it. My guilty

02:16.980 --> 02:21.060
pleasure. Good. Oh, wow. I can hear the guilt just peeling off

02:21.060 --> 02:24.620
you. Goggles box. Well, guess what I'm adding to use that I

02:24.620 --> 02:27.020
just I gotta see it. I just gotta see it.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.020
And it's and it's actually current because they record them

02:31.020 --> 02:34.060
like that weekend. And so it's about the programs that you will

02:34.060 --> 02:37.740
have watched the previous week. Oh, that is handy. Yeah. This is

02:37.740 --> 02:54.220
Linux Unplugged episode 247 for May 1 2018. Welcome to Linux

02:54.220 --> 02:58.380
Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's still smack dab in

02:58.380 --> 03:00.900
the middle of the Linux fest hangover. My name is Chris. My

03:00.900 --> 03:04.060
name is Wes. Hello, Mr. Payne. Hello there. Are you well fed,

03:04.060 --> 03:08.340
sir? Oh, I am stuffed. Yeah, I I supplied the burgers and West

03:08.340 --> 03:11.980
supplied the caffeine. So this should be a good show coming up

03:11.980 --> 03:17.340
on this week's episode. Not one but two, two major distribution

03:17.340 --> 03:22.020
releases for door 28 is out today. Ubuntu 1804 came out just

03:22.020 --> 03:24.460
the other day. And we're going to give you our initial

03:24.460 --> 03:27.820
impressions on both of them loaded them up kick the tires.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.860
And man is there some cool stuff in both of them. I cannot wait

03:32.860 --> 03:36.300
to tell you about that. So it's a packed distro episode. Plus,

03:36.620 --> 03:40.300
Mr. Daniel foray is here from elementary OS to give us a

03:40.300 --> 03:43.220
little taste of what's just around the corner in Juneau. And

03:43.380 --> 03:47.300
some of those features speak deep to my soul. You guys will

03:47.300 --> 03:50.540
totally understand once we get there. And then later on, did

03:50.540 --> 03:54.460
you hear that Google just forked a popular GTK theme? What?

03:55.780 --> 03:59.540
And you know how NFS tables is the new hotness to replace IP

03:59.540 --> 04:03.500
tables? Yep, that's out something news coming in. And

04:03.500 --> 04:06.340
the one the only Mr. Alan Jude will stop by the show live from

04:06.340 --> 04:09.620
Linux fest Northwest and tell us all about BP F plus a new

04:09.620 --> 04:12.500
release of dark tables out and listener Brent stopping by the

04:12.500 --> 04:16.740
show to give us a walkthrough of that. And then we will do our

04:16.740 --> 04:20.860
Ubuntu 1804 roundup with a look at the flavors, the new features

04:20.900 --> 04:24.260
in Ubuntu itself, our thoughts on some of the server stuff

04:24.260 --> 04:26.940
they're introducing and much, much more. But before I go any

04:26.940 --> 04:30.300
further, before I even get to the virtual log, a special in

04:30.300 --> 04:34.740
studio log member, Mr. Brent, the very, very, we're gonna call

04:34.740 --> 04:37.580
him dark table expert now for the show is actually joining us

04:37.580 --> 04:39.700
right now. Hello, Brent. Hey, how's it going, guys? It's

04:39.700 --> 04:42.500
going good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Barbecue is

04:42.500 --> 04:45.100
good. A couple of nights on the couch. Good here at the studio

04:45.100 --> 04:47.420
Brent stopped by for Linux fest Northwest took some great

04:47.420 --> 04:50.420
pictures. He's been talking to me about dark table. We've got a

04:50.420 --> 04:52.420
new release of dark table to to sort of button it all up. So

04:52.420 --> 04:54.340
we'll be getting to that a little bit in the show. So stay

04:54.340 --> 04:58.140
tuned for that. And now, without any further ado, we got to

04:58.140 --> 05:00.340
bring in that virtual log time appropriate greetings, Mumble

05:00.340 --> 05:07.420
Room. Hello. I heard that random UbiKon. I heard that. Yeah,

05:07.420 --> 05:11.180
actually, that looked like an amazing venue Wimpy. I saw your

05:11.220 --> 05:14.340
mate roundup of the new features and it looked like you're in a

05:14.340 --> 05:18.100
church of Ubuntu. It was impressive. We were in an

05:18.100 --> 05:21.700
historic building and it was rather wonderful. Yeah. Well, I

05:21.700 --> 05:24.220
would love to chat about that in a moment. So let's get there

05:24.220 --> 05:28.300
too. But why don't we start out with the huge news of the day

05:28.300 --> 05:32.140
just to get things rolling here on the old podcast. And that is

05:32.140 --> 05:38.740
the release of Fedora 28 Fedora 28 landed today as we record and

05:38.740 --> 05:42.820
it's available as an atomic workstation image too. Yes, it

05:42.820 --> 05:45.260
is, which is the first time that's officially happening.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.500
It's not all out. They haven't really talked about it a lot

05:47.500 --> 05:50.300
yet. But if you go on the atomic development list, which I troll

05:50.300 --> 05:53.300
all the time every damn day, and you'll see that they have a

05:53.300 --> 05:55.660
release announcement over there, which is a pretty freaking big

05:55.660 --> 06:00.020
deal. But let's talk about the workstation version. I can't

06:00.020 --> 06:02.660
believe I'm about to tell you this. Let me double check. Is

06:02.660 --> 06:06.540
this? Is this actually fedora? It's real. You sure? Oh, yeah,

06:06.540 --> 06:10.300
100%. Sure. Okay, verified. Well, a new feature,

06:10.300 --> 06:13.340
apparently, I don't believe it a fedora 28 is the inclusion of

06:13.340 --> 06:16.900
popular third party software repositories that you can just

06:16.900 --> 06:22.300
turn on in gnome 328. They include applications. Nvidia

06:22.300 --> 06:31.180
proprietary graphics driver, Google Chrome, the steam client.

06:31.580 --> 06:35.620
Yes, and more like a pie charm are now all available with just

06:35.620 --> 06:41.380
a few clicks in gnome software under fedora 28. That's what I

06:41.380 --> 06:44.260
did not think I would see this day. But hey, this is this

06:44.260 --> 06:47.140
isn't anything I just I can't even right now I'm still

06:47.140 --> 06:49.780
processing this. And I think what it's got to be is fedora

06:49.780 --> 06:53.180
trying to appeal to developers who use these tools. That's got

06:53.180 --> 06:56.460
to be what it is. I don't know anybody in the Mamba room want

06:56.460 --> 06:58.820
to before we move on to the other features want to just take

06:58.820 --> 07:01.620
a moment and reflect on the fact that fedora is making it a

07:01.620 --> 07:04.140
couple clicks now to install Google Chrome or the Nvidia

07:04.140 --> 07:08.700
driver. Anybody think that's remarkable besides me? That's I

07:08.700 --> 07:10.540
mean, I think it's definitely a change from you know, the

07:10.540 --> 07:13.620
behavior we've seen in the past, but it's probably can't be the

07:13.620 --> 07:15.420
only one somebody in that mom rooms got to think that's

07:15.420 --> 07:17.340
remarkable. Somebody does they just don't want to say I

07:17.340 --> 07:20.620
understand. It's remarkable. There you go. Isn't this

07:20.620 --> 07:23.260
something that Ubuntu mate has done for a while? Oh, sure.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.460
They're definitely by no means the first. Absolutely. I just

07:26.460 --> 07:29.460
they're doing it would be the very, very last mini Mac. Did

07:29.460 --> 07:32.300
you want to throw something in there? Yeah, I tried to install

07:32.300 --> 07:36.740
Chrome into chromium browser last time and it told me that

07:36.740 --> 07:40.460
it needed 600 megabytes to install all the packages. I was

07:40.460 --> 07:44.180
pretty much surprised. So I kind of test how much the normal

07:44.180 --> 07:46.460
Google Chrome uses. This is going to be something I'll be

07:46.460 --> 07:49.940
testing to. I'll be testing all of this a lot more soon, but I

07:49.940 --> 07:52.660
want to take a spoiler alert. I'm going to round up some of

07:52.660 --> 07:54.860
the new features and new things people are talking about what

07:54.860 --> 07:57.420
initially seems really great to me. I'm not giving you my

07:57.420 --> 08:01.340
review for either Ubuntu 1804 or Fedora 28 yet. I've got

08:01.340 --> 08:03.260
initial impressions. I'm going to share those with you, but I

08:03.260 --> 08:06.700
want to run both of these for a while because I have been

08:06.700 --> 08:10.100
living in Kubuntu so deeply that I just need to take time to

08:10.100 --> 08:12.900
give them a proper quote unquote review, but I'll give you

08:12.900 --> 08:15.180
something else in Fedora 28 that seems initially pretty

08:15.180 --> 08:18.300
appealing to me. They've really sort of tuned down some of the

08:18.300 --> 08:21.380
things that suck battery life with various different hardware

08:21.380 --> 08:23.460
power saving features that they're turning on by default.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.420
Now, these are all things that scripts will turn on or some

08:26.420 --> 08:29.140
people, other distributions turn on automatically, but I think

08:29.140 --> 08:31.220
in totality, this is actually pretty impressive. So we now

08:31.220 --> 08:35.140
have a new default saddling power management policy on all

08:35.140 --> 08:38.700
the Intel mobile chip sets that is way more disk friendly low

08:38.700 --> 08:42.940
power. So like when it's idle, it'll save approximately one to

08:42.940 --> 08:47.380
one and a half watts of power on idle, which when you have like

08:47.380 --> 08:50.660
a 50 watt battery or a 36 watt battery, I will take anything I

08:50.660 --> 08:54.380
can get. Additionally, the Intel in HDA audio codec power saving

08:54.380 --> 08:58.220
is now enabled by default with a one second timeout, which I

08:58.220 --> 09:00.580
think that's pretty pretty good. One second means if there's

09:00.580 --> 09:02.580
nothing going out over the sound card for over a second, if you

09:02.580 --> 09:05.580
think about it, that's a pretty long time in computer land. And

09:05.580 --> 09:08.860
then that saves about point four watts of power on idle. Now

09:08.860 --> 09:14.020
finally, USB auto suspend for USB Bluetooth receivers has been

09:14.020 --> 09:17.020
enabled by default, which saves an additional point four watts

09:17.020 --> 09:19.180
of power. You combine all that together and it's pretty

09:19.180 --> 09:23.020
noteworthy. And again, not the only distro to do it, but I

09:23.020 --> 09:25.420
think it's pretty nice to see Fedora including this stuff by

09:25.420 --> 09:27.940
default. I think everybody would agree with that. And then of

09:27.940 --> 09:30.300
course, the headline feature, the biggest deal is that it's

09:30.300 --> 09:34.780
shipping with GNOME 3.28, which includes the new Thunderbolt

09:34.820 --> 09:37.660
Bolt D support, which is that system daemon for security

09:37.660 --> 09:39.780
connecting for the security of Thunderbolt devices when they

09:39.780 --> 09:44.060
connect and allows gnome shell to interact and alert you about

09:44.060 --> 09:49.100
that. And then finally, for RMS sake, they're including virtual

09:49.100 --> 09:52.700
box guest additions by default now, and they're shipped in the

09:52.700 --> 09:55.940
Fedora workstation install. Any installation of Fedora

09:55.940 --> 09:59.100
workstation as a guest on virtual box will have the guest

09:59.100 --> 10:01.700
edition features working out of the box.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.380
I think that really that just plays to your case that this is

10:04.380 --> 10:08.540
these are the developer aimed improvements, right? But nice.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.820
I mean, really, really, really nice. I will say they have a

10:10.820 --> 10:13.140
little blurb in here about the streamed on installation. I was

10:13.140 --> 10:15.700
skeptical. I've been something of an Anaconda hater in the

10:15.700 --> 10:18.500
past, but it's better. It's getting better. I'm glad to see

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
it. Yeah, it's pretty painless.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.860
Yeah, it was I went through an installation on a laptop earlier

10:22.860 --> 10:25.980
today, and I let it do the auto disk partitioning for the first

10:25.980 --> 10:28.740
time. And it you know, it uses LVM and it makes some it makes

10:28.740 --> 10:30.980
some sane judgments. And the other thing I've noticed is I

10:30.980 --> 10:33.140
feel like it's faster now to when it's actually throwing

10:33.140 --> 10:35.620
files on the disk. I agree. Yeah. Did you like it felt like

10:35.620 --> 10:38.100
it was already copying files before? Well, part of it is

10:38.100 --> 10:40.460
because it does like a post install to where it runs you

10:40.460 --> 10:43.820
through creating the wizard for users, and like setting a few

10:43.820 --> 10:46.540
other small details about the system. So it takes that out of

10:46.540 --> 10:48.580
the installation process. So you're really in the

10:48.580 --> 10:50.940
installation, you're setting your disk configuration, you're

10:50.940 --> 10:53.220
adding a user account, and you're setting your time zone.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.140
And then there's final details that'll ask you after the system

10:56.140 --> 10:58.700
boots. And in fact, you don't even have to add a user account

10:58.700 --> 11:00.780
necessarily. Oh, that's perfect. Yeah. And you just get to you

11:00.780 --> 11:03.340
get to blasting files on the system. It's, it's a really,

11:03.340 --> 11:07.740
it's a really good version of Fedora 28. And since Ubuntu is

11:07.740 --> 11:10.020
shipping the same version of Gnome, I'll just say this now.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.700
And maybe if anybody in the Mumble Room wants to chime in

11:11.700 --> 11:18.140
with their thoughts. This is by far the best version of Gnome

11:18.140 --> 11:24.780
I've ever used. It is cleaner, simpler, and more efficient than

11:24.780 --> 11:28.980
macOS. I think it is if Apple were to have to hit the reset

11:28.980 --> 11:32.100
button today. If macOS wasn't nearly a 14 year old operating

11:32.100 --> 11:36.620
system, but say it was nine months old. I really think this

11:36.620 --> 11:41.140
is, this is what they would have as a goal. The new system

11:41.140 --> 11:45.220
settings is just it's so good. Like the Adaptia theme now is

11:45.220 --> 11:49.700
good. Ubuntu's theme is, it feels a little old to me. But in

11:49.700 --> 11:53.820
actuality, Gnome still looks great. It still looks good. So

11:53.820 --> 11:56.540
it's such a good version of Gnome. It's not one that's

11:56.540 --> 11:59.940
pulling me back to Gnome. But if you are a Gnome user, Gnome

11:59.940 --> 12:04.020
328 really nails it. And of course Fedora's always got a

12:04.020 --> 12:05.700
great implementation. Does anybody in the Mumble Room have

12:05.700 --> 12:08.180
any thoughts on the Gnome aspect, either for Ubuntu or

12:08.180 --> 12:08.580
Fedora?

12:08.700 --> 12:11.260
So this begs the question, has it crashed for you yet?

12:11.340 --> 12:13.300
Well, I've only used it a little bit. You know, I've only, I

12:13.300 --> 12:15.020
have not, and I'm not using it in production. I don't have any

12:15.020 --> 12:17.780
intention to. So I'll see, you know, in the review after I've

12:17.780 --> 12:20.020
used it for a couple of weeks, we'll see. At least get a week

12:20.020 --> 12:24.180
into it. But if you are a Gnome fan, it definitely feels pretty

12:24.180 --> 12:26.500
fast. You know, it always feels good on a clean install, but it

12:26.500 --> 12:28.380
just is so great. It's definitely worth it.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.340
I really appreciate that. Because you know, when I'm

12:30.340 --> 12:32.540
running Gnome on Arch or something else, I'm really fine

12:32.540 --> 12:35.820
with Gnome defaults. I don't do a ton of tuning to it. They do

12:35.820 --> 12:37.660
a little bit more than even I'm willing to do on most

12:37.660 --> 12:39.420
installations. So it's just pleasant.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.060
Yeah, and Gnome Photos also is now the default in Fedora 28.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.740
That's finally coming along. It's been a long time coming.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.540
Just small things, lots of small things in there. Check it

12:48.540 --> 12:51.020
out. We'll have links in the show notes if you guys would

12:51.020 --> 12:54.860
like. But last chance if you, if you guys out there have any

12:54.860 --> 12:56.660
thoughts before I get to my review, let me know. Go to

12:56.660 --> 12:59.740
linuxunplug.com slash contact and send them in your thoughts

12:59.740 --> 13:02.260
and I'll let or something like should try on Fedora. Because

13:02.260 --> 13:05.460
since it's not my daily driver, love to know. Also, linuxunplug.com

13:05.460 --> 13:07.740
slash contact. Last chance to get in before the review comes.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.700
Because I, you know, always be down for trying something or

13:11.700 --> 13:14.220
your experiences. Also really good. Yeah. I'll share an

13:14.220 --> 13:15.780
experience with you, Wes. How about that?

13:15.900 --> 13:16.420
Please do.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.220
linux.ting.com

13:19.220 --> 13:25.020
Linux.ting.com. It's mobile. It's better than unlimited. If

13:25.020 --> 13:27.180
you just use less, you pay less. You don't have to pay for a

13:27.180 --> 13:31.540
whole bunch of minutes or a ton of SMS messages. I don't, I

13:31.540 --> 13:35.100
don't know if I used a single SMS message last month. I don't

13:35.100 --> 13:38.060
actually think I did. The only thing I might have done to

13:38.060 --> 13:40.980
trigger an SMS message would be to log into a Twitter account

13:40.980 --> 13:43.660
from like a new installation. And then it does like that SMS

13:43.660 --> 13:46.220
verify thing that I hate so much. That might have been it.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.140
And I could, there's other ways to get to that. So why pay for

13:49.140 --> 13:51.740
messages? There's no need. There's no reason. I don't even

13:51.740 --> 13:54.300
need 100 messages, let alone 1000 or whatever. It's not 2001

13:54.300 --> 13:57.140
anymore. Yeah, it's not. It's not. And you've got Wi Fi at

13:57.140 --> 13:58.980
work. So why are you paying for data when you're not using it?

13:59.140 --> 14:02.020
Or if you got Wi Fi at home, it doesn't make any sense. And you

14:02.020 --> 14:04.900
might have better signal on GSM networks in your area or maybe

14:04.900 --> 14:07.860
on CDMA. So why can't you choose? See, that's all just

14:07.860 --> 14:10.500
normal with Ting. You, you pick and choose what works best for

14:10.500 --> 14:13.060
you. There's no contract, there's no determination fee.

14:13.340 --> 14:16.980
It's really mobile the way it should be. If the whole market

14:16.980 --> 14:19.100
had to start over today, this is what they would have to do. I

14:19.100 --> 14:21.220
get messages all the time from people outside the country.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.900
They're like, you know, that's how it kind of works here.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.780
That's how, you know, the way Ting works. That's kind of how

14:25.780 --> 14:28.180
it works here. And I'm like, yeah, that's not how it works

14:28.180 --> 14:30.820
here in the States. And that's what makes Ting so great. It's

14:30.820 --> 14:33.300
pay for what you use, six minutes for the line. And then

14:33.300 --> 14:35.620
just whatever you use, minutes, messages and megabytes, boom,

14:35.660 --> 14:37.660
you're done. You don't want it. You don't want the phone

14:37.660 --> 14:39.580
anymore. You turn it off. You're done. You want to bring over a

14:39.580 --> 14:41.740
new phone, you can activate the whole freaking thing through

14:41.740 --> 14:44.220
their webpage. They got a BYOD page where you can double check

14:44.220 --> 14:46.700
everything. You put in the ESIN or whatever it is through the

14:46.700 --> 14:48.980
website, boom, activate, you're done. You never even had to talk

14:48.980 --> 14:51.660
to a human being. But here's the crazy thing. If you need to,

14:51.860 --> 14:54.500
they've got really nice ones. Friendly support people that

14:54.500 --> 14:57.660
are actually phone geeks. Crazy concept. Control panel to manage

14:57.660 --> 14:59.980
everything and then great support to back it up. You can

14:59.980 --> 15:01.860
buy a device directly. It's not loaded with like the Ting

15:01.860 --> 15:04.900
experience. They're not going to prevent updates because they

15:04.900 --> 15:07.860
need to get their new Ting video store on your phone. They

15:07.860 --> 15:10.420
don't do any of that stuff. You just want to use them for simple

15:10.420 --> 15:12.340
services or you want to use them as your main internet

15:12.340 --> 15:14.620
connection. Ting don't care. And you can get started at

15:14.620 --> 15:19.420
linux.ting.com. Take $25 off a device or get $25 in service

15:19.420 --> 15:23.660
credit if you bring one. That's linux.ting.com. And a big thank

15:23.660 --> 15:27.820
you to Ting for sponsoring this here program, linux.ting.com.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.380
Now, did you hear the story that we covered in Linux Action News

15:31.380 --> 15:36.140
this week? Google has just forked a popular GTK theme. And

15:36.140 --> 15:38.500
what are they doing? What are they doing?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.340
I really want to know.

15:39.380 --> 15:43.780
It's like Adaptia, but it's Googlified, paperized and

15:43.780 --> 15:47.740
blued. And it's a new GTK theme that's got a material design

15:47.820 --> 15:51.980
and it looks pretty good. It's called Cross Adaptia right now

15:51.980 --> 15:54.700
and it's up on Google's Codehub. And commits show that their

15:54.700 --> 15:57.100
designers are already busy making changes and adjustments

15:57.100 --> 16:00.500
to the theme. And it looks like it's something that'll be used

16:00.500 --> 16:03.380
on Chrome OS as part of their new Linux application

16:03.380 --> 16:06.260
containers, which starts to suggest that we're not just

16:06.260 --> 16:10.180
going to be seeing a terminal for SSH, but perhaps the

16:10.180 --> 16:14.260
ability to run things like Eclipse or other GTK

16:14.260 --> 16:18.460
applications inside Chrome OS. And you got to figure Google's

16:18.460 --> 16:21.940
designing this for end users if they're going in to the trouble

16:21.940 --> 16:25.420
of creating their own theme that looks like other Google

16:25.420 --> 16:25.620
properties.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.580
This is a lot of specific work for something else, right? It's

16:28.580 --> 16:31.100
not just a whim. There's people being paid to work on this.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.820
So why does Chrome OS have its own theme now, Wes? What do you

16:33.820 --> 16:35.820
think's going on here? We're gonna start seeing Linux desktop

16:35.820 --> 16:36.700
apps on Chrome OS?

16:36.700 --> 16:41.140
I'm kind of concerned. I'm kind of excited. What does it do to

16:41.140 --> 16:43.740
their, you know, their sort of mantra of these are like simple

16:43.740 --> 16:46.100
machines that you, you know, can't mess up that aren't

16:46.100 --> 16:49.380
complicated for people to use. I know they're implemented, you

16:49.380 --> 16:51.420
know, with containers and other technologies to sort of keep

16:51.420 --> 16:54.380
things isolated and controlled, but it's still, it might seem

16:54.380 --> 16:56.940
like a different sell to, you know, a simple user.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.940
Yeah, yeah, I wonder if it's not just, it could just be about

17:00.980 --> 17:04.180
adding additional value to Chromebooks to make them more

17:04.180 --> 17:07.060
appealing to businesses or system administrators and

17:07.060 --> 17:10.100
developers could totally be all of that. But I do also have some

17:10.100 --> 17:11.140
conspiracy bacon.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.100
Fry it up, fry it up for me.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.260
We do have, we've been eating a lot of meat these last few days

17:15.260 --> 17:17.620
here at the studio. So why not fry up a little bacon and I'll

17:17.620 --> 17:20.660
tell you what I think it is. And I hope I hope I'm wrong. But I

17:20.660 --> 17:23.540
think Fuchsia OS is going to replace the underpinnings of

17:23.540 --> 17:26.060
Android as the core operating system. They're going to boot

17:26.060 --> 17:28.740
Linux out of Android and it could be semi devastating for

17:28.740 --> 17:31.260
Linux. I'm not the only person that thinks this obviously, but

17:31.260 --> 17:33.180
some people I really respect recently have been talking more

17:33.180 --> 17:36.140
and more about it. And it seems like Fuchsia OS could be the

17:36.140 --> 17:40.060
perfect little wedge to get Linux out to take care, to just

17:40.060 --> 17:43.380
get rid of all of that pain in the arse LTS issue, pain in the

17:43.380 --> 17:45.900
arse GPL stuff, have their own OS in there that's been

17:45.900 --> 17:50.100
purpose-built to power mobile devices. And they essentially

17:50.100 --> 17:54.860
would dump Linux for their Android platform. And at the

17:54.860 --> 17:58.300
same time, double down on Linux on the Chrome OS platform. So

17:58.300 --> 18:00.940
Chrome OS will stay Linux, Chrome OS will have the ability

18:00.940 --> 18:05.220
to run Linux applications. Chrome OS will have the ability

18:05.220 --> 18:07.180
to run the terminal. You know, you'll have complete Linux

18:07.180 --> 18:09.460
environments in these containers. They may even go the

18:09.460 --> 18:13.060
direction of Windows 10 and start offering different distro

18:13.060 --> 18:15.820
environments that are similar to like the Windows subsystem

18:15.820 --> 18:18.180
where you can pull down Ubuntu or you can pull down SUSE.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.260
They're going to have probably, you know, the same thing, CentOS,

18:21.260 --> 18:23.300
Ubuntu containers, maybe not initially.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.900
Right. This has reminded me also kind of got like a like a Mac

18:25.900 --> 18:27.820
feel. They've got their separate phone controlled

18:27.820 --> 18:29.380
environment and then maybe something a little more

18:29.380 --> 18:32.020
developer, power user friendly on the desktop.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.860
Yeah. Yeah. You could see how that would be appealing to them,

18:34.900 --> 18:38.740
right? And I don't know about that because I feel like if

18:38.740 --> 18:42.740
Android switched away from Linux, Linux development could

18:42.740 --> 18:45.460
lose quite a bit of momentum. But it does seem like this was

18:45.500 --> 18:47.100
this is where this is going. Anybody in the Mumble Room have

18:47.100 --> 18:48.220
any thoughts on my bacon?

18:48.420 --> 18:53.500
Well, we're just about a week away from Google I know. So we

18:53.500 --> 18:55.300
could hear some stuff next week.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.900
Yep. Yeah, we may have answers sooner than later. I'm planning

18:58.900 --> 19:02.060
to cover bits of IO that are interesting in Tech Talk today.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.820
And I'll probably if there's anything very Linux specific,

19:04.820 --> 19:07.620
I'll cover here in this show. Well, regardless of my bacon

19:07.620 --> 19:10.700
and regardless of Android, I think this is great for Chrome

19:10.700 --> 19:14.260
OS, because it means more desktop Linux apps in way, way

19:14.260 --> 19:19.180
more users hands at a lower point of entry for cost. And in

19:19.180 --> 19:21.580
some cases, like my kids, they get these books via school, the

19:21.580 --> 19:23.580
Chromebooks, they just boom, here you go, here kid, here's a

19:23.580 --> 19:26.180
here's an entire laptop with the Google Chrome browser on it

19:26.220 --> 19:26.820
have at it.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.740
That makes me a lot more excited, right? There's a

19:28.740 --> 19:30.620
terminal there they can actually play with and learn from.

19:30.660 --> 19:31.180
That's great.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.540
I think you are a session everybody now is paying for

19:36.540 --> 19:41.660
laptops that are made to seduce for selling services, not for

19:41.660 --> 19:42.540
you to own them.

19:42.860 --> 19:45.860
That's a fair point. Yeah, their goal here is to get more people

19:45.860 --> 19:48.700
locked into Google services. And they're going to use Linux apps

19:48.900 --> 19:51.700
as the way to sweeten that pot.

19:51.700 --> 19:56.860
That makes me feel horrible now. Not even that, not even not

19:56.860 --> 20:01.820
even just the Google services is the apps will be services.

20:01.940 --> 20:04.580
Yeah, and I see what you're saying too, because in real,

20:04.940 --> 20:08.660
realistically, you may have to have like, certain Google

20:08.660 --> 20:10.700
account to get these things or you may be controlled through

20:10.700 --> 20:15.020
the admin control panel of the community or the industry of

20:15.020 --> 20:18.860
the business administrator. So yeah, okay. Well, I want to

20:18.860 --> 20:20.300
change topics now, because that's really that's the

20:20.300 --> 20:25.820
question. Yeah. We had an interesting chat at Linux fest

20:25.820 --> 20:30.380
Northwest with one Mr. Alan Jude about BPF. Now you may have

20:30.380 --> 20:32.260
heard and there's an article that I'll link to that was

20:32.260 --> 20:34.780
posted just a couple of days ago, why is the kernel

20:34.780 --> 20:41.060
community replacing IB tables with BPF? And this is a pretty

20:41.060 --> 20:44.220
complicated little system that will be living inside the

20:44.220 --> 20:47.220
kernel. There's a great talk that just came out recently that

20:47.220 --> 20:50.020
really explains that this is essentially an entire virtual

20:50.020 --> 20:53.300
machine that will be running inside the Linux kernel. Now I

20:53.300 --> 20:57.180
know that sounds like a really bad idea. But there's other

20:57.180 --> 20:59.860
virtual machines that already exist that we just don't really

20:59.860 --> 21:02.860
talk about very much. It's, it's already happened that damage

21:02.860 --> 21:05.260
has been done. This will be one of many and they really on the

21:05.260 --> 21:06.980
right track. They look like they're securing this thing

21:06.980 --> 21:11.660
well. And Jed, Wes and Alan Jude were sitting down at the

21:11.660 --> 21:14.580
booth at Linux fest Northwest. And the topic came up and I

21:14.580 --> 21:17.140
thought it'd be great to get the clarification on what BPF is

21:17.140 --> 21:21.340
right here on the show. Successor to IP tables is NF

21:21.340 --> 21:25.660
tables, right? Okay. So there's a successor to that now too. I

21:25.660 --> 21:28.020
was reading a little bit about that. Yeah. Is that EBF

21:28.020 --> 21:33.500
tables? EBPF is the tracing framework. I think this is just

21:33.500 --> 21:37.420
a BPF based firewall thing. So do you know what BPF stands

21:37.420 --> 21:42.260
for? Berkeley packet filter. So, you know, you're like, oh,

21:42.260 --> 21:46.380
look, if we compile the firewall rules down to a BPF, we can

21:46.380 --> 21:49.980
match them fast. Like TCP dump does. You know what firewalls

21:49.980 --> 21:57.980
been doing that for 20 years? Yeah. It turns out there's a

21:57.980 --> 22:02.020
fast way to do a firewall. It's because, oh, look, this machine

22:02.020 --> 22:05.260
language is specifically designed to match packets is

22:05.260 --> 22:09.580
really good at matching packets. Yeah, totally. Well,

22:09.580 --> 22:16.980
writing the writing rules can be difficult. Just the syntax

22:16.980 --> 22:23.500
between TCP dump and Wireshark, they don't use the same syntax

22:23.500 --> 22:26.420
and I find it continually confusing. I'll jump from one to

22:26.420 --> 22:32.060
the other. I have to go back to the web page and look up more

22:32.060 --> 22:34.820
examples because I can't remember them all. Yeah. Back in

22:34.820 --> 22:38.500
school, for our firewall class, we learned three firewalls, IP

22:38.500 --> 22:45.300
tables, IPF, which is the predecessor to PF on FreeBSD and

22:45.300 --> 22:53.860
OpenBSD, and Cisco PIC. The Cisco we had was literally like a

22:53.860 --> 22:58.620
486 based appliance. Like the old one. Before they made it a

22:58.620 --> 23:02.100
dedicated, it was like a regular 486 with some firewall cards in

23:02.100 --> 23:05.700
it or something. But the Cisco PIC, that's been dead for a

23:05.700 --> 23:09.860
decade. Or it should have been. Yes. So it was pretty much dead

23:09.940 --> 23:14.100
when we were learning it. But the syntax is pretty similar to

23:14.100 --> 23:16.940
what you would get on a newer Cisco like an ASA or whatever.

23:18.060 --> 23:22.860
Even ASAs are out of fashion. In particular, we had one client

23:22.860 --> 23:27.300
who was doing some streaming video. It was TV Ontario had

23:27.860 --> 23:31.620
this system called Homework Help, where after school, they

23:31.620 --> 23:34.740
would pay some teachers to be available via like an internet

23:34.740 --> 23:38.020
chat thing to help you with your math homework. And every

23:38.020 --> 23:42.380
student in like grade 7 through 10 got it for free if they were

23:42.380 --> 23:47.460
enrolled in a public school. But they would have a streaming

23:47.460 --> 23:50.700
video part, too. And they were pushing up to like 600 megabits

23:50.700 --> 23:54.180
out of the network. And their Cisco ASA couldn't handle that.

23:54.180 --> 23:59.060
Couldn't keep up. Yeah. So we replaced that with, we turned

23:59.060 --> 24:03.380
their dev server into a PF sense. And now we can push a gigabit

24:03.380 --> 24:06.060
with no problem. Yeah, that's Alan's way of saying it's

24:06.060 --> 24:08.460
because of performance. It's because you can compile it down

24:08.460 --> 24:11.380
to this machine language and the rules can be executed wicked

24:11.380 --> 24:14.820
fast. He goes into some bottleneck troubleshooting that

24:14.820 --> 24:19.580
he did for a 40 gigabit. I think it was actually two. So it was

24:19.580 --> 24:22.500
in total 80 gigabits worth of transfer bottleneck

24:22.500 --> 24:26.100
troubleshooting he did on a free BSD system in this week's

24:26.100 --> 24:28.300
episode of tech snap. Yeah, go check that out. Yeah, tech snap

24:28.300 --> 24:32.060
dot systems. But BPF is coming IP tables is out. And speaking

24:32.060 --> 24:34.100
of other things that are just coming down the pipe, not too

24:34.100 --> 24:38.300
far away is the next version of elementary OS. And I am getting

24:38.300 --> 24:40.620
a little hyped. I got to be honest and not might be because

24:40.620 --> 24:42.900
Mr. Daniel for a keep stopping by and tell me about all the

24:42.900 --> 24:46.580
great stuff. And this one speaks to me, Dan, deeply, deeply

24:46.580 --> 24:49.980
speaks to me. I love this stuff in the new update you guys

24:49.980 --> 24:53.660
posted about notifications. And I didn't realize how much

24:53.660 --> 24:55.860
frickin work you guys have put into it, like the heuristics

24:55.860 --> 24:59.300
that you had in place. But now we're coming out. Can you kind

24:59.300 --> 25:03.500
of recap what's going on here? Yeah, so kind of historically,

25:03.500 --> 25:07.300
what happened was last cycle, we introduced this notifications

25:07.300 --> 25:11.060
indicator, right? So that when an app sends a notification, and

25:11.060 --> 25:14.180
you miss it, the notifications indicator will catch it and you

25:14.180 --> 25:16.940
can review it later, same as you have on like notifications that

25:16.940 --> 25:22.580
are on your phone. The problem is that only some applications

25:22.580 --> 25:27.340
are actually sending their ID with the notification. So some

25:27.340 --> 25:29.780
notifications come through, we didn't really know which app

25:29.780 --> 25:32.140
it's from. So we had this heuristic in place to try to

25:32.140 --> 25:37.060
guess. And it sometimes was wrong. And so we get people

25:37.060 --> 25:39.740
saying, hey, you're a notification, notifications

25:39.740 --> 25:42.660
indicators broken, it doesn't work, it, you know, it does it

25:42.660 --> 25:46.020
wrong. And we're saying, well, you know, the problem was that

25:46.020 --> 25:49.740
these applications never sent an ID. And so it was kind of hard

25:49.740 --> 25:55.180
to say, you know, hey, this is not really our fault. While we

25:55.180 --> 25:59.140
still had this heuristic it. So now we're pulling the heuristic

25:59.140 --> 26:02.740
out. And any application that doesn't send its ID is just

26:02.740 --> 26:06.940
going to be categorized as other. But at the same time, we

26:06.940 --> 26:10.620
went and we submitted patches upstream to electron into

26:10.620 --> 26:15.140
Firefox and into lib notify to make sure that application

26:15.140 --> 26:18.860
developers had an easy way to make sure their applications are

26:18.860 --> 26:22.020
reporting their ID correctly and didn't have to use like the raw

26:22.020 --> 26:26.140
D bus API. And I would imagine electron apps are probably the

26:26.140 --> 26:30.420
most frequent offender of this missing ID. Yeah. And the

26:30.420 --> 26:32.940
electron patch has actually been committed upstream as well.

26:32.980 --> 26:36.140
Oh, great. Yeah, that's hopefully that that'll fix it

26:36.140 --> 26:39.820
for all electron apps. And this isn't just specific to

26:39.860 --> 26:43.340
elementary OS and Pantheon. This is actually how I did

26:43.420 --> 26:45.900
notifications identifying gnome shell as well. Oh, that's

26:45.900 --> 26:49.660
awesome. So that'll be great for gnome users. Everybody wins.

26:49.660 --> 26:53.580
Now, what's the lib notify part for time? It sounds like it's

26:53.580 --> 26:55.540
involved with notifications. But what specifically is lib

26:55.540 --> 26:59.420
notify responsible for? So we have a problem because way back

26:59.420 --> 27:02.700
in the day, there was a specification proposed that was

27:02.700 --> 27:06.780
the free desktop notification specification. But it only kind

27:06.780 --> 27:10.820
of lived on the gnome wiki. And it was kind of adopted de facto

27:10.820 --> 27:12.940
by a bunch of different desktops, but it never really

27:12.940 --> 27:17.140
made it into free desktop. And lib notify kind of represents

27:17.140 --> 27:24.100
that spec. Well, gnome added G notification to their stack. And

27:24.140 --> 27:28.340
this is kind of a new version of the spec. But it is not really

27:28.860 --> 27:32.700
compatible with the old lib notify version. And all of the

27:32.700 --> 27:38.580
gnome apps use G notification. And so it's like different

27:38.580 --> 27:42.260
libraries that kind of do the same thing, but don't all kind

27:42.260 --> 27:45.460
of respect each other. So there's a bigger story. And

27:45.460 --> 27:48.620
we're trying to work closer with upstreams to make sure that we

27:48.620 --> 27:50.900
all kind of agree, like, what should the spec be? And what

27:50.900 --> 27:53.540
should it support and try to make sure that things work good

27:53.540 --> 27:57.820
across desktops. But this is kind of a first step, right on.

27:57.900 --> 28:02.660
And also just honorable mention here, files is looking so good.

28:02.660 --> 28:05.020
And it sounds like so clean. Yeah, look at that. I mean,

28:05.020 --> 28:06.620
beautiful. We're looking at a picture of it here in the

28:06.620 --> 28:10.260
studio. We'll have a link at linuxonplug.com slash 247. If

28:10.260 --> 28:12.340
you guys want to read dancehall post and see the picture of it.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.780
It is great looking, Dan. And I gotta say, it sounds like a lot

28:15.780 --> 28:18.780
of the back end is sort of getting retooled to match the

28:18.780 --> 28:21.300
more modern development processes on elementary OS.

28:21.780 --> 28:25.740
Yeah, absolutely. I think that some people might know that

28:25.740 --> 28:30.220
files is our oldest app. And we started way back in the very

28:30.220 --> 28:34.620
beginning with a Nautilus fork. And then we eventually kind of

28:34.620 --> 28:37.580
outgrew that and then wrote this file manager Marlin in the

28:37.580 --> 28:40.620
modern day elementary files comes from that background. So

28:40.620 --> 28:45.260
it was a C app. It was before we adopted Vala. So we're kind of

28:45.260 --> 28:49.140
still migrating that code base. And this cycle, we were able to

28:49.180 --> 28:53.260
do way more of that and a lot of cleanup and migrating to better

28:53.260 --> 28:56.420
versions of utilities from upstream libraries like GTK and

28:56.420 --> 28:59.780
GIO instead of using our own internal libraries. So that's,

28:59.820 --> 29:01.420
you know, performance improvements, stability

29:01.420 --> 29:04.540
improvements, more maintainable code, it's just getting way

29:04.540 --> 29:05.380
better all around.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.540
That does sound really good. Well, I will definitely kick the

29:08.540 --> 29:10.540
tires when it comes to any other honorable mentions you want to

29:10.540 --> 29:14.180
toss out from the post before we leave the rest to the listener

29:14.180 --> 29:14.780
at home to read.

29:15.340 --> 29:18.020
One thing actually I'm really excited about is improvements

29:18.020 --> 29:23.060
going into elementary code. Oh, yeah. And, and we, so we landed

29:23.060 --> 29:26.820
support for editor config by default in elementary code last

29:26.820 --> 29:30.540
month. And this month, we have it turned on and enabled out of

29:30.540 --> 29:35.380
the box. And now the guys over at elementary code drew a nice

29:35.380 --> 29:37.940
little icon for us somewhere on their homepage. Now,

29:37.940 --> 29:40.980
that looks so good. We're seeing, we're seeing some steady

29:40.980 --> 29:44.940
updates to code this cycle. Like this has gotten a lot of

29:44.940 --> 29:45.460
attention.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.900
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. We're definitely trying to

29:47.900 --> 29:50.900
get more feedback from developers about the tooling on

29:50.900 --> 29:53.540
our platform and documentation and find out like how we can

29:53.540 --> 29:56.460
meet their needs and make it really easy to write

29:56.500 --> 29:58.620
applications for App Center and elementary OS.

29:58.660 --> 30:01.740
I love the focus, you know, there's so much focus on on

30:01.740 --> 30:04.580
application developers, you're actually curating this really

30:04.580 --> 30:06.380
great environment for people to do that. So all these

30:06.380 --> 30:08.220
improvements, people are just going to be happier to be

30:08.220 --> 30:08.580
there.

30:08.780 --> 30:11.500
That's how we got up to 87 new.

30:15.020 --> 30:18.900
87. That is really good. That's that's gonna be a that'll be a

30:18.900 --> 30:22.220
strong amount in the App Center when Juno releases. That's

30:22.220 --> 30:25.940
really cool. Yeah, how how close are we getting to a beta

30:25.940 --> 30:28.780
release here? Because I know there's just what under 10 bugs

30:28.780 --> 30:30.300
left to get squashed.

30:30.380 --> 30:35.860
We are so super close. So we're kind of we're kind of looking at

30:35.860 --> 30:39.460
like if we can maybe punt a couple of those issues to the

30:39.460 --> 30:42.780
second beta so we can get a public beta out sooner and like

30:42.780 --> 30:44.980
what are the kind of the other release tasks we have to do with

30:44.980 --> 30:47.980
the website and things like that. So I'm trying to get it

30:47.980 --> 30:50.500
pushed out ASAP and I'm working with our teams to make that

30:50.500 --> 30:54.180
happen. But as it stands right now, we just have the seven

30:54.220 --> 30:55.700
issues left on our tracker.

30:55.740 --> 30:59.620
Seven. Okay, I'm excited. That's I like that that's it's not a

30:59.620 --> 31:03.620
date. It's it's when the issues are closed or when the issues

31:03.620 --> 31:07.940
can be at least punted to the next beta. That's great. Well,

31:07.940 --> 31:10.340
Dan, keep us posted because it's it's a fascinating case

31:10.340 --> 31:13.380
study to watch this for the show. And it's it's fun to see

31:13.380 --> 31:16.260
how you guys work the thought you put into all of this how it

31:16.260 --> 31:19.140
all is kind of been coming together over the last year. And

31:19.380 --> 31:22.740
we're so close now that you got to keep us posted because we're

31:22.740 --> 31:26.820
almost to the goal, which is the release. All right. Well, we

31:26.820 --> 31:29.940
have much much more to talk about as the show goes on. I'm

31:29.940 --> 31:33.460
really looking forward to covering some important news and

31:33.460 --> 31:36.420
and and then talking a little dark table because this is I

31:36.420 --> 31:39.620
think going to be one of my new tools in my bag. But before we

31:39.620 --> 31:42.260
get there, I got to mention the tool that I've had for years

31:42.260 --> 31:45.140
now. And that's the tools over DigitalOcean. And you can be one

31:45.140 --> 31:48.820
to do dot co wait, hold on. Let me get that prop out. Sorry,

31:49.380 --> 31:52.580
Russell. There we go. Oh, yeah, it's so fresh. It's not to

31:52.580 --> 31:57.700
really know. I've done a lot of wrestling at do dot co slash

31:57.700 --> 32:01.460
unplug to go there to get a $100 credit when you sign up with

32:01.460 --> 32:05.300
a new account. Yeah, I said $100. Yeah, I know we usually

32:05.300 --> 32:08.820
say $10. I said $100. And with the three cents an hour, my

32:08.820 --> 32:12.340
favorite rig. I mean, you're going to go nuts. Do dot co

32:12.340 --> 32:16.500
slash unplug DigitalOcean is simple infrastructure that you

32:16.500 --> 32:19.620
can deploy and use it in production, use it for testing,

32:19.620 --> 32:23.220
use it for learning in less than 55 seconds. And everything

32:23.220 --> 32:26.100
is SSDs. Every single machine, they have 12 data centers

32:26.100 --> 32:28.740
around the world. They got 40 gigabit connections coming into

32:28.740 --> 32:31.780
those hypervisors. The whole stack runs Linux KVM for the

32:31.780 --> 32:35.140
virtualizer that they put an amazing interface that no one

32:35.140 --> 32:37.380
else in the industry can touch on top of all of it. They call

32:37.380 --> 32:39.620
it the dashboard. It's a dashboard for days. And then to

32:39.620 --> 32:42.180
make things better, they've got an API that's well documented,

32:42.180 --> 32:45.620
clear, easy to read. And I'm pretty sure that dashboard is a

32:45.620 --> 32:47.620
client of that API, because everything the dashboard

32:47.620 --> 32:50.100
supports, you can do in the API. That's great, because that

32:50.100 --> 32:51.860
means there's a ton of open source code that's already

32:51.860 --> 32:53.860
written that you can take advantage of good to go just

32:53.860 --> 32:56.580
have added Haas or build something yourself from the

32:56.580 --> 33:00.500
ground up do.co slash unplugged, but it gets even

33:00.500 --> 33:05.620
better. Even now, what is 1804 been out, but just just a few

33:05.620 --> 33:10.180
days. They are rapidly updating their documentation. I just

33:10.180 --> 33:15.300
today read a guide on how to configure Apache with this with

33:15.300 --> 33:18.900
an SSL cert on 1804 in just a few minutes. Easy to read,

33:18.900 --> 33:21.540
clear documentation. They're updating everything for the new

33:21.540 --> 33:24.260
releases. You can spin up whichever version of Linux you

33:24.260 --> 33:29.540
like, or you can even deploy that free BSD. I know, I know.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.340
And they also recently announced flexible droplets

33:32.340 --> 33:34.900
where you can mix and match the different things that you

33:34.900 --> 33:37.620
need. So maybe you need a lot of CPU for your application,

33:37.620 --> 33:39.860
more CPU. You don't need much disk. Yeah, just put it all in

33:39.860 --> 33:42.260
CPU. Or you want a ton of disk because you're doing some

33:42.260 --> 33:45.060
logging and you don't need a ton of RAM or CPU or whatever

33:45.060 --> 33:47.860
you need, you mix and match flexible droplets $15 a month

33:47.860 --> 33:50.660
with that $100 credit, you can get pretty far. Just go to

33:50.660 --> 33:55.460
do.co.plugged. That's do.co.plugged. And a big

33:55.460 --> 33:57.700
thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

33:57.700 --> 34:02.180
program. Random excessive paper flopping and oops, just tore a

34:02.180 --> 34:06.660
little more. Look at that. I don't know how much longer

34:06.660 --> 34:09.780
that's holding up. Do.co.plugged. I think once that

34:09.780 --> 34:12.180
paper is ripped, they're going to end the $100 deal. I think

34:12.180 --> 34:14.580
that's because you better go soon. Okay, let's just talk

34:14.580 --> 34:16.980
about a little serious news before we get to the dark table

34:16.980 --> 34:21.460
stuff because this is just a heads up. If you are a void

34:21.460 --> 34:24.820
Linux user, you need to be paying really close attention

34:24.820 --> 34:29.220
to a situation that's been going on for a while and isn't

34:29.220 --> 34:31.700
really moving anywhere and you could end up getting

34:31.700 --> 34:34.180
misinformation. So I want you to just kind of track this in

34:34.180 --> 34:37.140
the show. We'll keep links in the show notes. I may even try

34:37.140 --> 34:41.380
to retroactively update the show notes for 247 down the road

34:41.380 --> 34:45.540
if anything changes. So linuxunplugged.com slash 247 for

34:45.540 --> 34:52.660
those, but right now the void Linux maintainers have lost

34:52.660 --> 34:56.180
contact with the guy that used to be the head manager of

34:56.180 --> 34:58.420
void. I don't know how to put this. It's really awkward.

34:58.420 --> 35:01.300
Basically, the project leader has disappeared and they have

35:01.300 --> 35:04.580
no contact with him since the end of January. They've had no

35:04.580 --> 35:10.180
meaningful contact really for over a year with him and he's

35:10.180 --> 35:13.460
he's got you know the keys to several things like the GitHub

35:13.460 --> 35:18.260
page, the IRCs, the domains. They've tried to contact

35:18.260 --> 35:22.180
GitHub and GitHub told them to go f a duck that they

35:22.180 --> 35:24.580
weren't interested in this dramatic situation. They've

35:24.580 --> 35:28.260
contacted free note support, but they really haven't gotten

35:28.260 --> 35:31.620
very far with that yet and they've gotten partial control

35:31.620 --> 35:35.700
over voidlinux.com, but they don't have control over the one

35:35.700 --> 35:39.380
that people use the most, which is voidlinux.eu, which is the

35:39.380 --> 35:41.860
one they really want and they're in limbo. They say

35:41.860 --> 35:44.020
trying to get back on track and they don't see any possibility

35:44.020 --> 35:46.660
of regaining access to the GitHub organization. So they're

35:46.660 --> 35:49.300
gonna have to move to a new GitHub organization. They feel

35:49.300 --> 35:52.260
like it may be the same for domains and for the IRC

35:52.260 --> 35:54.260
channels, they're still trying to get in contact with free

35:54.260 --> 35:57.780
note. Now this has been going on since January and I didn't

35:57.780 --> 36:00.580
really know what to what to do with this because I thought is

36:00.580 --> 36:04.180
somebody sick is somebody you know are they missing. I didn't

36:04.180 --> 36:06.580
know what was going on with the project leader, but I've heard

36:06.580 --> 36:10.340
from a few folks who say that they just kind of went AWOL and

36:10.340 --> 36:14.020
that it might be like he's fine health wise, but no longer

36:14.020 --> 36:15.620
interested in doing the project or something like that.

36:15.620 --> 36:20.100
You know, and isn't this always the concern about these mom

36:20.100 --> 36:21.300
and pop small distros?

36:21.300 --> 36:23.460
Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, and if you're going to

36:23.460 --> 36:26.340
make it, if you're going to involve the community and you're

36:26.340 --> 36:28.260
going to have other people that feel responsible for the

36:28.260 --> 36:30.580
project, then it's probably essential to set up some sort

36:30.580 --> 36:33.860
of minimal governance process or at least, you know, make it

36:33.860 --> 36:36.420
so that one one bus accident can't take out the whole

36:36.420 --> 36:36.820
project.

36:36.820 --> 36:41.620
Yeah, and you don't want to undermine the Linux community's

36:41.620 --> 36:45.300
faith in small distros because if nobody's going to be willing

36:45.300 --> 36:48.660
to give a small distro a try, they'll never become a big

36:48.660 --> 36:51.060
distro. And then we have a chicken and the egg problem.

36:52.100 --> 36:56.740
And the only solution I really see for this is something

36:56.740 --> 37:01.540
similar to Canonical's Ubuntu Flavors, where, you know, you

37:01.540 --> 37:06.820
kind of you kind of graduate into an official member of the

37:06.820 --> 37:07.860
Ubuntu community.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.180
And, you know, there's some governance.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.220
I believe you have to hear, too.

37:11.220 --> 37:13.940
Obviously, Wimpy or Popi could speak much more coherently to

37:13.940 --> 37:14.100
this.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.780
And, you know, there's at least some assurance of a structure

37:17.780 --> 37:18.740
as an end user.

37:18.740 --> 37:21.940
Like, it feels like some some test must have been passed.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.300
Maybe, Wimpy, why don't you start with you have so much

37:25.300 --> 37:26.100
experience with MATE.

37:27.940 --> 37:28.900
Is my read on that right?

37:28.900 --> 37:30.740
Like, is that is there some sort of assurance?

37:30.740 --> 37:33.860
If it's becoming of an official flavor that it's not just going

37:33.860 --> 37:34.900
to go away one day?

37:35.540 --> 37:36.020
Yeah.

37:36.020 --> 37:39.860
So the first thing is, in order to become an official flavor

37:39.860 --> 37:43.540
of Ubuntu, you have to demonstrate that you have some

37:43.540 --> 37:48.580
sort of long term maintainership of the packages that are

37:48.580 --> 37:51.060
specific to the flavor that you want to create.

37:52.020 --> 37:56.020
So in the case of Ubuntu MATE, back in the day, I had to

37:56.020 --> 37:58.900
demonstrate that I had been maintaining those packages in

37:58.900 --> 38:03.860
Debian for six months before we were granted flavor status.

38:03.860 --> 38:05.540
And that's for the flavor itself.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.180
Following that, then you can become an Ubuntu member, which

38:10.180 --> 38:14.260
also is a demonstration of a long term commitment to the

38:14.260 --> 38:15.380
Ubuntu project.

38:15.380 --> 38:19.140
And that buys you some additional rights within the

38:19.140 --> 38:22.180
Ubuntu project, such as voting powers for the councils and

38:22.180 --> 38:22.820
what have you.

38:23.700 --> 38:27.140
So there is some process there to ensure that people coming

38:27.140 --> 38:30.820
into the project have already got a track record of being

38:31.620 --> 38:34.900
long term contributors to the thing that they want to work

38:34.900 --> 38:35.220
on.

38:35.220 --> 38:35.940
OK, that makes sense.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.620
So I want to bounce around here a bit.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.300
I want to go to Dan.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.460
He has a point about open governance, and then I want to

38:41.460 --> 38:42.180
go to Eric after that.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.420
So Dan, why don't you bring up your point about open

38:44.420 --> 38:46.740
governance, and not just even for open source, but just

38:46.740 --> 38:47.460
in general?

38:47.460 --> 38:50.500
Yeah, there's a point that was made earlier about bus factor,

38:50.500 --> 38:50.820
right?

38:50.820 --> 38:54.180
And so it's not just necessarily if someone

38:54.180 --> 38:56.660
voluntarily steps down, but you never know what's going to

38:56.660 --> 38:57.540
happen in their life.

38:58.580 --> 39:02.340
But I remember there's a thing in the canonical code of

39:02.340 --> 39:06.100
conduct or Ubuntu code of conduct about gracefully

39:06.100 --> 39:07.060
stepping down, right?

39:07.060 --> 39:10.020
And I think everybody should kind of have this idea built

39:10.020 --> 39:12.820
into their governance of what happens when someone needs

39:12.820 --> 39:13.540
to step down.

39:14.340 --> 39:15.300
Yeah, OK.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.380
And Eric, you've had some familiar you've had some

39:17.380 --> 39:20.020
experience with this with Ubuntu Studio recently.

39:20.020 --> 39:20.660
That's correct.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.060
It's been a whirlwind.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.940
Basically, what's happened is set Hallstrom.

39:25.940 --> 39:28.980
He's the project leader for Ubuntu Studio.

39:29.620 --> 39:35.220
He just completely ran out of physical time in his life to be

39:35.220 --> 39:36.660
able to be dedicated to the project.

39:37.220 --> 39:41.140
So about six months ago, they were kicking around the idea of

39:41.780 --> 39:43.620
making an Ubuntu Studio Council.

39:44.180 --> 39:46.820
Well, there were a handful of people that got into it, but

39:46.820 --> 39:48.660
nothing really ever came of it.

39:48.660 --> 39:54.980
So in February, they reassessed and said, hey, we want to try

39:54.980 --> 39:56.180
to make this go forward.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.700
But nobody was really stepping up.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.100
So I finally like, hey, I'll step up.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.140
I'll join the council.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.660
I'll help to lead this thing.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.020
I became the council chair since I was the one running

40:08.020 --> 40:09.220
the meetings already.

40:09.220 --> 40:13.700
And then Ross Gammon, who is the release manager, he had to

40:13.700 --> 40:15.620
step out due to timing reasons as well.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.900
So then I stepped in to be the release manager.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.740
So it's been a real whirlwind.

40:20.740 --> 40:24.900
But this is one of those things where if you can open it up

40:24.900 --> 40:28.180
to like a council type idea where you have a bunch of

40:28.180 --> 40:32.420
people helping to lead the project, the bus factor gets

40:32.420 --> 40:34.020
significantly lower.

40:34.020 --> 40:36.900
I believe there's another better strategy that nobody

40:36.900 --> 40:38.100
really mentioned.

40:38.100 --> 40:38.500
Go ahead.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.020
Money.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.300
You know, if you buy something, there's a contract there.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.660
And if you're actually willing to pay for the development of

40:46.660 --> 40:50.020
the distro you use, you incentivize the person.

40:50.020 --> 40:54.820
And if something else fails, like you lost control of the

40:54.820 --> 40:56.580
well, the person just disappeared.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.580
There's no control of the website.

40:58.580 --> 41:01.540
You can actually prove legal ties to that project.

41:01.540 --> 41:05.460
You can actually, as a collective ownership, get that.

41:05.460 --> 41:08.740
And that actually is a better, I believe, better business

41:08.740 --> 41:12.580
model for the creator to have an incentive to stay for the

41:12.580 --> 41:16.340
people using the software to have actually demonstration of

41:16.340 --> 41:17.940
possession of the product.

41:17.940 --> 41:21.540
And ultimately, that should simplify the whole thing.

41:21.540 --> 41:24.340
And why does Canonical Flavors work?

41:24.340 --> 41:27.860
Because Canonical has money to maintain it.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.060
No, no, it's not about money.

41:31.060 --> 41:34.820
The project when it first started off, it's about people.

41:34.820 --> 41:35.700
It's about community.

41:35.700 --> 41:39.700
It's about the fact that there are people willing to step up

41:39.700 --> 41:41.540
and look after things.

41:41.540 --> 41:47.300
And as Dan said, the community came together and made a code

41:47.300 --> 41:50.180
of conduct that said, look, if you can't do this anymore,

41:50.180 --> 41:51.140
everyone has real life.

41:51.140 --> 41:53.620
People have children, get married, take a sabbatical,

41:54.340 --> 41:58.660
change direction, buy a Mac, whatever it is, it might move

41:58.660 --> 42:01.140
away from your open source project.

42:01.140 --> 42:04.580
And if they do, as long as they hand over gracefully,

42:04.580 --> 42:05.300
then it's fine.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.980
And one of the things we've done in Ubuntu, which I know a

42:08.980 --> 42:12.580
lot of other projects do as well, is when you create

42:12.580 --> 42:15.780
something, you create it in a way that it's not just you

42:15.780 --> 42:16.580
that looks after it.

42:16.580 --> 42:20.580
So for example, if you create an IRC channel on Freenode,

42:20.580 --> 42:24.740
just as a simple example, if you create an official Ubuntu

42:24.740 --> 42:28.660
channel, so that means it starts with hash Ubuntu dash

42:28.660 --> 42:29.460
something, right?

42:29.460 --> 42:33.220
So you create a new IRC channel, we recommend that you give

42:34.100 --> 42:38.020
rights to that channel to the Ubuntu IRC council.

42:38.020 --> 42:41.700
So that in the event that you got hit by a bus or your IRC

42:42.980 --> 42:45.860
account was compromised, or you had a baby or bought a Mac

42:45.860 --> 42:49.540
or whatever it is, someone else could take over and then

42:50.340 --> 42:51.940
hand that on to the next person.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.780
It's not that you're a bad person for moving on.

42:53.780 --> 42:57.300
It's not that any money changed hands in any way, shape or

42:57.300 --> 42:57.460
form.

42:57.460 --> 42:59.060
There was nothing about money.

42:59.060 --> 43:02.340
It's just about people and process and having a simple

43:02.340 --> 43:05.220
process in place which allows things to move from one person

43:05.220 --> 43:07.460
to the next person down the line.

43:07.460 --> 43:12.740
I do kind of agree about if you have this as your primary

43:12.740 --> 43:16.260
form of income, though there is kind of more of an obligation,

43:16.260 --> 43:16.580
right?

43:16.580 --> 43:19.860
Like if you depend on this open source project to put food

43:19.860 --> 43:22.740
on your table, you're much less likely to buy a Mac.

43:23.620 --> 43:26.100
Yeah, and not only that, actually, there's the other

43:26.100 --> 43:29.540
part, which is when you are stepping down, I'm talking

43:29.540 --> 43:32.580
about, let's say you get hit by a bus and you really wanted

43:32.580 --> 43:33.940
to control things on your own.

43:33.940 --> 43:36.180
You didn't really trust anybody at the time you started

43:36.180 --> 43:38.660
the project because this counseling thing is very pretty,

43:38.660 --> 43:39.860
but it requires trust.

43:39.860 --> 43:43.220
Like you're talking to other people that you may have seen

43:43.220 --> 43:43.620
or not.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.740
And this takes time to build that trust.

43:46.740 --> 43:49.620
Until then, you're really not assigning things you paid for

43:49.620 --> 43:53.060
where your name lies on to other people.

43:53.060 --> 43:55.220
So ultimately, it's a process.

43:55.220 --> 43:58.180
And until that time, if the monetary incentive is there,

43:58.180 --> 44:01.460
it facilitates the number one, you being incentivized to

44:01.460 --> 44:05.140
actually be responsible to the stuff you're putting out.

44:05.140 --> 44:08.180
And secondly, there's legal ways for people to get to you

44:08.180 --> 44:11.380
if you're not putting it out, if there's a commitment to it.

44:12.020 --> 44:15.540
And ultimately, even if you disappear, it is easier to

44:15.540 --> 44:19.140
prove because there's transaction records and to get

44:19.140 --> 44:20.260
something done.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.660
While if nothing exists, you really don't.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.740
That might be true, but that's not how it worked in Ubuntu.

44:26.740 --> 44:30.580
Now, this is also really kind of a benefit of an organization

44:30.580 --> 44:32.660
like the Software Freedom Conservancy.

44:32.660 --> 44:35.220
Now, you don't really see a lot of distributions underneath

44:35.220 --> 44:38.420
it, although I don't know if that's entirely true, but you

44:38.420 --> 44:40.660
do see a lot of large projects underneath it.

44:40.660 --> 44:44.820
And the Conservancy provides a infrastructure to open source

44:44.820 --> 44:47.300
and free software to focus on what they do.

44:47.300 --> 44:51.060
They do the code and they do all of the legal stuff and the

44:51.060 --> 44:54.820
operational stuff and take care of the getting, make sure your

44:54.820 --> 44:57.380
donations are legal and stuff and documentation for certain

44:57.380 --> 44:58.260
aspects of the business.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.500
And that's sort of what some of the services that the

45:00.500 --> 45:01.460
Conservancy offers.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.660
And I don't know, maybe one day the Conservancy would extend

45:04.660 --> 45:06.340
that to more and more distros.

45:06.340 --> 45:06.820
I don't know.

45:06.820 --> 45:09.940
I don't think the solution is really easily attainable for

45:09.940 --> 45:12.820
how to make sure these small distros don't go away because

45:12.820 --> 45:16.020
you're still dealing with, you know, perhaps potentially tens

45:16.020 --> 45:19.860
of thousands of end users that just kind of get caught in

45:19.860 --> 45:22.260
whatever drama is going on behind the scenes.

45:22.260 --> 45:24.900
But additionally, I think it does an untold amount of damage

45:24.900 --> 45:28.980
to the reputation of Linux, of open source development, and

45:28.980 --> 45:34.180
I heard a term the other day that I just really got me mad.

45:34.180 --> 45:40.420
And it was a derogatory term for the reliability of open

45:40.420 --> 45:41.300
source developers.

45:41.300 --> 45:44.420
And the podcaster said, well, you know, he's just really

45:44.420 --> 45:45.220
open sourcey.

45:45.940 --> 45:47.140
He's just open sourcey.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.500
I don't like the sounds of that.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.700
And I'm like, what does that mean?

45:49.700 --> 45:51.540
You know, like, he just doesn't do a good job.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.420
He just sort of flaked out.

45:52.420 --> 45:53.300
He's open sourcey.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.900
I was like, I don't know.

45:56.900 --> 46:00.020
It really got me upset.

46:00.020 --> 46:01.940
Were you going to say something wimpy?

46:01.940 --> 46:02.820
I was about to.

46:02.820 --> 46:06.180
I was saying what open sourcey like Linus Torvalds, who's

46:06.180 --> 46:09.060
been doing what he's doing for 26 years.

46:09.060 --> 46:09.540
Yeah.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.140
Oh, I'm actually angry right now.

46:11.140 --> 46:12.180
My heart rate is up.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.900
Just even remembering, recalling it, I got so upset by it.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.180
So, all right.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.900
Let's change gears to something that makes me happy.

46:18.900 --> 46:22.180
There is a new release of Darktable this week.

46:22.180 --> 46:26.340
Version 2.4.3 comes out and it's perfect timing because I'm

46:26.340 --> 46:28.820
just kind of getting my Darktable on.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.900
And Brent, your timing was really good.

46:30.900 --> 46:33.140
Brent is a professional photographer by trade.

46:33.140 --> 46:35.540
We're going to have some of his photos linked in the show notes.

46:35.540 --> 46:38.020
And you've been using Darktable for how long?

46:38.580 --> 46:42.340
I've been using Darktable since about, I believe it's 2012,

46:42.340 --> 46:43.300
maybe even 2011.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.980
So you've been watching the development for a while.

46:44.980 --> 46:45.380
Yeah.

46:45.380 --> 46:47.060
And you use it for a professional workflow, like you

46:47.060 --> 46:49.380
were working here today at the studio and you were touching

46:49.380 --> 46:51.300
up photos all day in Darktable.

46:52.420 --> 46:55.220
I would say for me professionally, it's 80%, maybe

46:55.220 --> 46:56.820
even 90% of where I do all my work.

46:56.820 --> 46:57.780
Really?

46:57.780 --> 46:58.100
Okay.

46:58.100 --> 47:00.660
Well, see, this makes me pretty excited because I always

47:00.660 --> 47:04.020
thought Darktable was for only individuals like yourself,

47:04.020 --> 47:06.660
but Brent stopped by the booth at Linux Fest Northwest.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.380
That's where we met him.

47:07.380 --> 47:10.980
And he told me an anecdote that made me realize that even

47:10.980 --> 47:12.260
I could probably figure out Darktable.

47:12.260 --> 47:16.740
Maybe I think it was about actually a week ago, I was

47:16.740 --> 47:20.420
invited to do a workshop at a Makers Fest, which was a first

47:20.420 --> 47:21.780
thing for me and really great.

47:21.780 --> 47:24.420
And I thought, okay, how do I introduce some sort of Linux

47:24.420 --> 47:25.540
or open source into this?

47:26.100 --> 47:27.940
Because I actually didn't see very much of that in there.

47:27.940 --> 47:31.780
So I thought, okay, I'm going to do a workshop based on

47:31.780 --> 47:34.020
using Darktable because people get easily attracted to

47:34.020 --> 47:35.860
photography and that's my specialty.

47:36.980 --> 47:39.940
But I'm going to introduce it in a way that applies to

47:39.940 --> 47:40.820
any user.

47:40.820 --> 47:46.420
So I ended up with a class full of people that were ranging

47:46.420 --> 47:49.220
from enthusiasts all the way to kids.

47:49.220 --> 47:51.460
And actually the kids were the ones that picked up on it

47:51.460 --> 47:52.020
the fastest.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.380
And so there's the beauty about Darktable, I think, is that

47:55.380 --> 47:58.820
it can be extremely powerful and extremely flexible, but it

47:58.820 --> 48:00.500
can also be very, very simple.

48:01.380 --> 48:04.500
So if you just determine a workflow that is one, two, three

48:04.500 --> 48:07.700
steps, then your adjustments and your cropping is just

48:07.700 --> 48:08.340
slider bars.

48:08.340 --> 48:09.140
So that's the way to go.

48:09.140 --> 48:10.180
It's super simple.

48:10.180 --> 48:10.660
Start like that.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.140
Oh, yeah.

48:11.140 --> 48:14.580
Ignore like Photoshop and GIMPs and stuff like that for

48:14.580 --> 48:15.700
regular, everyday stuff.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.100
What would you say are three things that you should touch on

48:18.100 --> 48:19.220
every photo you take?

48:19.220 --> 48:20.500
So I can tell you that easily.

48:20.500 --> 48:24.820
So every single photo, I would say, A, cropping in camera.

48:24.820 --> 48:27.300
You know, sometimes you don't always do it well, or you get

48:27.300 --> 48:29.220
a different idea once you see it on the large screen.

48:29.220 --> 48:30.660
So cropping is number one.

48:30.660 --> 48:33.220
And in a cropping tool in Darktable, there's some like

48:33.220 --> 48:35.460
skewing of angles, which kind of comes into play as well.

48:35.460 --> 48:36.740
And they make it super, super easy.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.740
You just right click and go, this should be straight.

48:38.740 --> 48:40.180
And it fixes everything for you.

48:40.180 --> 48:41.220
So that's one.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.540
Two would be exposure.

48:43.540 --> 48:46.420
They have an exposure slide bar with blacks level.

48:46.420 --> 48:50.500
And so that can get you pretty darn far.

48:50.500 --> 48:53.300
And then color is the third one, I would say.

48:53.300 --> 48:54.340
Boost it a bit or what?

48:54.340 --> 48:55.780
Like, what do you mean when you say color?

48:55.780 --> 48:57.140
Like white balance kind of a thing.

48:57.140 --> 48:57.380
Right.

48:57.380 --> 49:00.580
So if you shot in various environments, sometimes your

49:00.580 --> 49:03.460
camera can't, it's not as good as our eyes at adjusting to

49:03.460 --> 49:04.500
color differences, right?

49:04.500 --> 49:10.100
So anyone who starts to be able to learn to see color can then

49:10.100 --> 49:12.340
determine that, oh, wait, this photo would actually be a lot

49:12.340 --> 49:15.220
more dynamic if the colors were actually corrected to true.

49:15.220 --> 49:17.860
So for instance, behind you, you have this crazy green light

49:17.860 --> 49:18.740
that keeps changing.

49:18.740 --> 49:19.780
I noticed.

49:19.780 --> 49:22.020
Yeah, it makes it impossible to set our camera.

49:22.020 --> 49:22.340
Right.

49:22.340 --> 49:25.140
So then necessarily, and that's the beauty of raw is that you

49:25.140 --> 49:26.820
can adjust that later on.

49:26.820 --> 49:29.460
So every 30 seconds, you have a different color going on and

49:29.460 --> 49:30.660
you can just correct that later.

49:32.660 --> 49:33.700
Yeah, that would be nice.

49:33.700 --> 49:33.940
Yeah.

49:33.940 --> 49:34.500
All right.

49:34.500 --> 49:35.300
You did.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.340
You convinced me to try it.

49:36.340 --> 49:38.100
So I'll install.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.100
Actually, we installed it on one of the machines here in the

49:40.100 --> 49:41.620
studio already to give it a go.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.860
And Chris, tell me how easy it was to do that.

49:43.860 --> 49:45.140
We were talking about that.

49:45.140 --> 49:47.780
That actually, I think, was a big takeaway for me when I was

49:47.780 --> 49:48.500
looking at it.

49:48.500 --> 49:51.540
And it must be something you appreciate, too, is we didn't

49:51.540 --> 49:56.020
have to go log into some proprietary vendor's website

49:56.020 --> 49:58.580
and authorize anything.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.020
Find your license key.

50:00.020 --> 50:00.500
Yeah.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.340
Brent was like, before I go, I could just take care of these

50:02.340 --> 50:03.380
right here.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.740
Do you want me to just do that now?

50:04.740 --> 50:05.540
And I'm like, OK.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.900
Apt install darktable.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.180
And he was off and working.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.420
But then you have an extra step that you take.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.620
Do you want to share that secret?

50:11.620 --> 50:12.180
Absolutely.

50:12.180 --> 50:15.620
So yeah, I'm not even using the same distribution as you.

50:15.620 --> 50:16.340
I'm on Arch.

50:16.340 --> 50:18.180
But that doesn't seem to be a problem anywhere.

50:18.180 --> 50:19.860
It seems to be a little bit everywhere.

50:19.860 --> 50:24.340
But what I've done for myself, because I was thinking

50:24.340 --> 50:26.980
something like this may happen in the future, and just

50:26.980 --> 50:30.340
for my own, to make things easier in my own system, I

50:30.340 --> 50:34.420
actually keep my favorite darktable, like a settings

50:34.420 --> 50:34.900
database.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.820
It's like a whole profile?

50:36.820 --> 50:39.860
Yeah, the entire profile that you find under.config.

50:39.860 --> 50:43.460
And that includes your common colors that you change things

50:43.460 --> 50:45.380
to, like your common presets for photo editing?

50:45.380 --> 50:46.420
Yeah, I've got a bunch of presets.

50:46.420 --> 50:48.580
So every single module in darktable can have its own

50:48.580 --> 50:50.900
presets or multiple presets.

50:50.900 --> 50:53.300
And you can also define defaults for when you import

50:53.300 --> 50:54.420
images, what gets applied.

50:54.420 --> 50:59.060
So I was able to, despite never having used the laptop that I

50:59.060 --> 51:01.060
was on, in five minutes, I had my own home

51:01.060 --> 51:02.580
environment right there.

51:02.580 --> 51:03.460
That is slick.

51:03.460 --> 51:04.420
It's so great.

51:04.420 --> 51:05.140
It's so great.

51:05.140 --> 51:09.460
And it kind of means you're not married to anything.

51:09.460 --> 51:11.140
You're not married to any one hardware vendor.

51:11.140 --> 51:13.620
You're not married to any one particular OS or even

51:13.620 --> 51:15.140
distribution.

51:15.140 --> 51:16.500
And darktable's free software.

51:16.500 --> 51:19.140
So you don't even, that's great.

51:19.140 --> 51:22.020
And they just recently had an update to GIMP that we covered

51:22.020 --> 51:22.980
in Linux Action News.

51:22.980 --> 51:23.540
Oh gosh, yeah.

51:23.540 --> 51:26.580
And GIMP is now working with darktable, so you can send

51:26.580 --> 51:28.340
from darktable to GIMP, and they're going to understand

51:28.340 --> 51:28.900
each other.

51:28.900 --> 51:31.060
And it's like a big kumbaya now between the two.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.820
And it's a new version of GIMP that looks pretty great.

51:32.820 --> 51:33.780
It does look really nice.

51:33.780 --> 51:35.380
First big update in six years.

51:35.380 --> 51:38.020
You can't see that, but I have this giant smile on my face.

51:38.020 --> 51:38.580
Oh yeah?

51:38.580 --> 51:39.540
You like it?

51:39.540 --> 51:41.140
Are you a GIMP fan?

51:41.140 --> 51:43.700
So the other 20% is I'm doing in GIMP.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.220
And I haven't quite launched into credit yet.

51:47.220 --> 51:49.380
But GIMP, for me, for many, many years,

51:49.380 --> 51:52.900
has been doing the simple, offering the simple features

51:52.900 --> 51:57.540
that I really need when I need that extra 20% of doing some

51:57.540 --> 52:01.460
really specialty photography-specific adjustments that

52:01.460 --> 52:04.980
need to be done that darktable just isn't designed for

52:04.980 --> 52:07.220
and I don't think should include anyways.

52:07.220 --> 52:12.740
We have a bunch of great photos that have been tweaked by,

52:12.740 --> 52:16.100
and taken, too, by Brent in darktable from Linux Fest

52:16.100 --> 52:18.420
Northwest, 158 of them.

52:18.420 --> 52:19.980
And they're great.

52:19.980 --> 52:22.900
And the cutest pictures of Levi ever.

52:22.900 --> 52:23.460
Yeah, ever.

52:23.460 --> 52:24.860
So cute in there.

52:24.860 --> 52:25.540
It's ridiculous.

52:25.540 --> 52:27.860
If you like puppies, you've got to go check out the link

52:27.860 --> 52:30.380
in linuxunplugged.com slash 247.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.820
I'll drop a link to the album in the IRC, too,

52:32.820 --> 52:33.900
if you're watching live.

52:33.900 --> 52:37.220
Some really great photos of our party at Lady Joops

52:37.220 --> 52:38.620
that we had out in the parking lot.

52:38.620 --> 52:42.380
So Saturday evening of Linux Fest Northwest,

52:42.380 --> 52:45.820
we decided to have a tailgate-style party.

52:45.820 --> 52:49.300
System76 brought a ton of meat.

52:49.300 --> 52:53.980
I brought two barbecues, and a table, and some camping chairs.

52:53.980 --> 52:56.380
I stuffed them all into the bays of Lady Joops.

52:56.380 --> 52:57.980
The advantages of having a class A

52:57.980 --> 52:59.980
is you have some big storage bays.

52:59.980 --> 53:03.620
And brought two bags of charcoal and a chimney starter.

53:03.620 --> 53:07.860
And we put the awning out and started cooking.

53:07.860 --> 53:10.820
And we cooked for hours in the parking lot.

53:10.820 --> 53:14.180
And Brent was there snapping photos the whole time.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.380
It was a lot of fun.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.380
We were flying drones and geeking out

53:18.380 --> 53:19.300
in the parking lot.

53:19.300 --> 53:22.100
And oh, geez, some good pictures right there.

53:22.100 --> 53:23.860
And there's a good time.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.660
Yeah, we had a really good time.

53:25.660 --> 53:27.260
And I just thought that was maybe

53:27.260 --> 53:28.660
the highlight of the whole thing.

53:28.660 --> 53:29.620
So thanks for taking those pictures.

53:29.620 --> 53:32.540
And thanks for making them available to the whole audience

53:32.540 --> 53:33.100
to check them out, too.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.060
That's really nice of you.

53:34.060 --> 53:34.900
Yeah, I'm happy to.

53:34.900 --> 53:37.380
And give people a little info maybe

53:37.380 --> 53:39.820
if they want to know more about your photography services

53:39.820 --> 53:40.300
and whatnot.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.580
Because I got to tell you, I'd like to bring you

53:42.580 --> 53:43.500
out to future events.

53:43.500 --> 53:44.380
Absolutely.

53:44.380 --> 53:46.740
Especially keep taking these cute pictures of Levi.

53:46.740 --> 53:47.820
Where should they find you?

53:47.820 --> 53:49.140
Levi's an easy win, right?

53:49.140 --> 53:51.780
So website BrentGervais.com.

53:51.780 --> 53:57.300
So I'll spell that out, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S.com.

53:57.300 --> 53:59.380
That's just where you can see a little bit of my work.

53:59.380 --> 54:01.960
And I'm not super active on social,

54:01.960 --> 54:04.900
but you can find me on Twitter, Brent, at Brent Gervais.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.100
And I guess around the network.

54:07.100 --> 54:07.700
Cool.

54:07.700 --> 54:10.060
Yeah, you may hear from him some more in the future.

54:10.060 --> 54:12.420
And check out the link in the show notes

54:12.420 --> 54:15.460
if you want to see the cutest puppy pictures ever.

54:15.460 --> 54:16.780
I mean, that's just indisputable.

54:16.780 --> 54:17.300
It's just a fact.

54:17.300 --> 54:18.620
Yeah, it is not even my bias.

54:18.620 --> 54:19.920
It's just purely indisputable.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.540
All right.

54:20.540 --> 54:24.580
Well, we do have a roundup to get to of Ubuntu 18.04,

54:24.580 --> 54:28.740
the flavors, the new features, the server stuff,

54:28.740 --> 54:33.100
and maybe even a pretty cool feature

54:33.100 --> 54:37.940
that I didn't even think about until I heard about it from Ian at System76.

54:37.940 --> 54:40.660
And I went, why is nobody else doing that?

54:40.660 --> 54:44.140
So we'll play a clip from Ian from System76 about something that Pop!

54:44.140 --> 54:49.260
OS is adding that blew my mind, really made me just really impressed.

54:49.260 --> 54:54.100
So we'll get there, but let's talk about Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

54:54.100 --> 54:56.380
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

54:56.380 --> 55:00.780
And coincidentally, just surprise, surprise, support this show.

55:00.780 --> 55:05.060
Yeah, keep us on the air, maybe even get us to 300 freaking episodes.

55:05.060 --> 55:08.860
Linux, maybe this show will have even more episodes than last.

55:08.860 --> 55:10.220
That would be amazing.

55:10.220 --> 55:12.940
Well, people go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

55:12.940 --> 55:15.220
They'll help us get there, and you'll get a free seven-day trial.

55:15.220 --> 55:19.900
It's a platform to learn more about Linux, a full-featured training library

55:19.900 --> 55:24.220
with everything you want to get new skills and advance your career.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.300
Now, I love the self-paced video courses.

55:26.300 --> 55:27.900
This is the sweet stuff.

55:27.900 --> 55:30.180
And Linux Academy, I happen to have first-hand experience,

55:30.180 --> 55:32.820
is investing in great recording hardware.

55:32.820 --> 55:34.660
They've really put a lot of effort into this.

55:34.660 --> 55:37.860
They also offer hands-on scenario-based labs.

55:37.860 --> 55:40.420
They spin up the system on whatever infrastructure you need.

55:40.420 --> 55:45.660
So if it's AWSs, or if it's an OpenStack system, or if it's just a Debian box.

55:45.660 --> 55:48.500
They spin that up for you, you log in over SSH, you get to work,

55:48.500 --> 55:51.460
you get a real scenario, something you can take and do in production.

55:51.460 --> 55:55.260
And if you ever get stuck, they have full-time human instructors that are happy

55:55.260 --> 55:57.260
to help and answer your questions.

55:57.260 --> 56:01.220
So you get actual hands-on experience, and you got the humans.

56:01.220 --> 56:05.380
That's pretty much as good as it's gonna get, because that's all they do is Linux.

56:05.380 --> 56:08.940
So they build features in that help you get there, like Learning Pass,

56:08.940 --> 56:12.300
which are a series of content and courses planned for instructors that get you into

56:12.300 --> 56:13.700
specific career tracks.

56:13.700 --> 56:15.340
Or if you're ready to take some big tests,

56:15.340 --> 56:18.980
they have courses created specifically to prepare you for certifications.

56:18.980 --> 56:22.580
And practice exams too, which I gotta tell you, if you don't practice,

56:22.580 --> 56:25.300
you probably won't pass, so that's a great feature.

56:25.300 --> 56:28.700
And they have a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members who are

56:28.700 --> 56:30.460
surprisingly supportive.

56:30.460 --> 56:34.340
It's ridiculous, it's like an educational support group.

56:34.340 --> 56:36.660
And they do it all on their own, they're just great people.

56:36.660 --> 56:40.100
Try it out, seven days for free, linuxacademy.com.

56:40.100 --> 56:45.100
Oh, and a big thank you, Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

56:45.100 --> 56:48.700
So this 1804 release is big, I think it's gonna be a big release.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.420
I don't know if you've heard about Ubuntu, but

56:50.420 --> 56:54.020
it's a pretty big distribution, and they got all kinds of different flavors.

56:54.020 --> 56:55.700
We never talked about it before on the show, so

56:55.700 --> 56:59.580
I can understand if you'd be unfamiliar with this, but there's a bunch of them.

56:59.580 --> 57:03.580
And let's talk about some of the main changes that are coming in Ubuntu 1804

57:03.580 --> 57:06.100
itself, cuz we're gonna talk about the flavors here, but

57:06.100 --> 57:09.260
you're gonna get Linux kernel 4.15, it's pretty nice.

57:09.260 --> 57:12.100
You're gonna get five years of support, of course,

57:12.100 --> 57:15.380
this is also the first LTS to support and ship GNOME.

57:15.380 --> 57:19.420
Where you get X11, you get the new minimal installation feature,

57:19.420 --> 57:22.460
which is a little different across the flavors, but

57:22.460 --> 57:26.460
it is the best thing that has come to Ubuntu in a really long time.

57:26.460 --> 57:29.420
And Ubuntu's live kernel patch service,

57:29.420 --> 57:33.420
which I don't think is getting enough play in this release, is now front and center.

57:33.420 --> 57:37.220
It's part of the welcome screen when you log in for the first time,

57:37.220 --> 57:42.060
there's a GUI to turn it on, live kernel patching is here, it's available.

57:42.060 --> 57:46.580
And I think it's kind of a big deal, and the fact that they've now wrapped

57:46.580 --> 57:50.620
a GUI around the whole thing to make it accessible to workstations,

57:50.620 --> 57:53.700
I think deserves a little more credit than it's getting.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.780
Files is getting a revamped user, or has now,

57:56.780 --> 58:00.660
a revamped user interface as well that looks really compact.

58:00.660 --> 58:03.380
There's also other things that are just nice to have,

58:03.380 --> 58:05.460
because it just makes it back to normal.

58:05.460 --> 58:09.100
Close, minimize, and maximize buttons are back on the right side of the window.

58:09.100 --> 58:12.660
And I do prefer GDM over LightDM, and

58:12.660 --> 58:16.700
1804 has shipped GDM as the display manager.

58:16.700 --> 58:21.540
It's big, it's bulky, it's weird, but I just happen to like it better than LightDM.

58:21.540 --> 58:22.540
It does work.

58:22.540 --> 58:24.460
Well, I just, I find it to be smoother.

58:24.460 --> 58:27.060
I don't know what it is, it's like my lock screen and all of it.

58:27.060 --> 58:31.220
I just, I find LightDM to be clunky, and I find GDM to, I don't know,

58:31.220 --> 58:32.820
just suits my needs better.

58:32.820 --> 58:38.260
So those are some of the core big things that are coming in Ubuntu 1804.

58:38.260 --> 58:40.780
And that's what I would look forward to.

58:40.780 --> 58:43.620
Also, you've got the other things like the Thunderbolt 3 support.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.340
You've got Gnome 328.

58:45.340 --> 58:46.380
There's other really nice things.

58:46.380 --> 58:50.140
LibreOffice 6.0 is in there, but that's the main things I'd be looking for.

58:50.140 --> 58:54.460
And then you have a brand new LTS flavor.

58:54.460 --> 58:58.300
For the first time, Ubuntu Budgie 1804 LTS.

58:58.300 --> 58:59.980
This is the first LTS,

58:59.980 --> 59:02.500
first official time they've been a flavor during an LTS release.

59:02.500 --> 59:05.660
It's gonna be supported until April 2021.

59:05.660 --> 59:10.060
And it ships with the latest Budgie desktop, 10.4 Irish Summer.

59:10.060 --> 59:13.260
And it's accompanied with the Gnome 328 application.

59:13.260 --> 59:14.260
So that's kind of a big deal for them.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.700
Kind of a big deal, yeah.

59:15.700 --> 59:16.700
Congratulations.

59:16.700 --> 59:17.540
It's real now, that's awesome.

59:17.540 --> 59:19.940
Friend of the show, Dustin, and teamwork on that.

59:19.940 --> 59:23.380
And then, of course, you've got all of the flavors that are available for

59:23.380 --> 59:30.460
download, Zubuntu, Kobuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Proper itself, Kylin.

59:30.460 --> 59:34.420
And the flavors come in at three years of support instead of the five years that

59:34.420 --> 59:35.780
the main line gets.

59:35.780 --> 59:41.220
Kobuntu, as I've mentioned many times, is shipping Plasma 512 LTS.

59:41.220 --> 59:43.300
So you've got a whole LTS stack there.

59:43.300 --> 59:48.460
Producer Michael has contributed several tweaks like Plasma Dark by default,

59:48.460 --> 59:49.820
or I'm sorry, Breeze Dark.

59:49.820 --> 59:51.420
Nice.

59:51.420 --> 59:53.100
Yeah, it's actually really, really well done.

59:53.100 --> 59:55.660
VLC is the default video player, which I know a lot of people like.

59:55.660 --> 59:59.700
Latte Dock is in the archives and KDE Connect is pre-installed.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.780
Excellent.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.380
Yeah, also one of the other things it does is double click is the default

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.180
behavior to open files and stuff.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.940
So Ubuntu 18.04 comes out now with a mostly high DPI support theme,

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.260
which is good for them.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:15.020
And Studio has an 18.04 release, but it's only gonna be supported for nine months.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.380
But they do have a new release.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.140
It's there.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.020
It's just not an LTS at this time.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.860
And then look at that Ubuntu Kylin release coming in at three years,

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.780
ideal for Chinese users.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.020
But damn, if that doesn't look like Windows 7.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:27.900
It sure does.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.060
I'd say anybody that just prefers the Windows 7 UI and layout,

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.940
you might just check out Kylin or Chillin.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.980
Wonderful Ubuntu user.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.060
Is it Chillin Wimpy or is it Kylin?

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:41.220
It's Chillin and it's based on Mate.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.020
Yeah, yeah, it really, it looks, what do you think of this?

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.420
Is this, this is...

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.980
Well, it's delightful, right?

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.220
Because it's really nice to see what we're making being used elsewhere

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.620
in a very different way.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:58.500
I mean, they've layered their own tools and utilities on top of it

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.140
to give it a very distinctive look.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.940
And yeah, well, they're making what their users want and it's good to see.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.740
It does look pretty sharp.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.820
Do they share the size of the user base?

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:16.580
Do we have, I mean, they must be large enough to have gotten flavor status.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.420
I have no idea how big their user penetration is.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.900
I think it's considerable.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.700
Yeah, I imagine.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.860
Be interesting to talk to someone.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.860
Yeah, that would be.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:31.100
And then, of course, our friends over at Mate, Ubuntu Mate 1804,

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.100
which ships Mate Desktop 120.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.820
It's got that new keyboard-friendly HUD.

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.980
Global menu if you want that mutiny desktop layout.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:45.460
High DPI support that we know Wimpy's been working towards for about two years now.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.780
Hardware acceleration in Marco.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.500
Just like Wes always wants, color emoji support.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.220
Heck yes.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.540
Got the brisk menu in there.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.420
You got the improved Mate tweak tool, the new software boutique updates.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.900
I mean, I might be a little biased here, but this is one of the strongest flavors by far.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.900
1804 Ubuntu Mate looks like some of your best work, Wimpy.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.380
Thank you.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.900
That's very kind of you to say so.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:16.340
And my own assessment is it's the best release we've put out by some margin.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.980
I was really pleased with 1710.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:25.220
And when we released that, I felt like that was good enough to be the 1804 LTS.

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:29.620
But it's amazing how much we've got done in the six months.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.700
Because in 1710, there was no high DPI, and there is now.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.980
So it just goes to show how much of a hustle we've had on in those last six months

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:45.420
to really, really make this LTS something for the next three years.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.500
It is really impressive.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.180
It's fantastic.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.780
I think a congratulations to the whole team is in order for that, because it's really nice.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:56.740
I want to also talk about, in Ubuntu proper, the new welcome screen.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.140
Because I might be wrong, I haven't dug deep into this.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:04.780
But when you're all kind of done with the new walkthrough,

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.780
it brings up a new screen that says, install some new apps.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.980
And you got Spotify on there.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.220
You got a lot of really well-known apps like Skype and Slack and more.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:21.180
So is this, maybe you should answer this.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:21.820
I don't know.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.060
Is this a Snap screen?

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:24.900
Are these all Snaps?

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.820
Are these all Snap apps if I click one of those?

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.300
They are.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.380
Every single one of them is a Snap.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:34.340
They're a selection of applications that we thought

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:40.220
people who are coming from other platforms might like the familiarity of.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.900
So people who are coming from Windows or Mac or anywhere else

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.460
might like to see, oh, I can get Spotify on here.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.340
I can get Slack.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.580
Or I could chat to my friends on Discord.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.460
Or my kids can play Minecraft on here.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.380
Or if I'm a developer, I can easily get Android Studio.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:59.700
So there's a whole set of applications, plus your favorite open source

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.260
things like Brave Browser and GIMP and all kinds of other stuff in there.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.740
Well, I just noticed that I recently seemed

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:11.060
to be able to tell the installation spread across the different versions

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:11.940
of Ubuntu.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.220
I don't know if that's something that's recently

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.220
being published in the Snap Store.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.620
All of a sudden, I'm seeing comparatively how many 1804 users over 1604.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.020
And it seems like this must be having subtraction

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.420
because the 1804 numbers are skyrocketing right now.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.740
The view you're seeing there in the Snap Store

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:34.700
is a logarithmic scale of which platform those Snaps are being installed on.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.340
And it's to represent that you can install these Snaps in lots

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.260
of different places.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.500
And here are some of the places that you might find users

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.100
who are using those things.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.860
OK.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.980
That's a nice stat to have.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.500
I really do appreciate having that.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.420
And when I saw the 1804 numbers, I mean,

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.860
it's already like the number one on some of those Snaps.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.380
It's really.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.220
Oh, it's gone mad.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.740
Yes.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.620
I think it's all, if it hasn't already, it's

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.580
probably close to overtaking the 1710 numbers already.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.060
Yeah.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.900
Yeah, I looked a couple of hours ago.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.540
And yeah, it's just nudging the 1710 numbers.

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.180
Yeah, I'm looking at VLC right now and exactly, exactly that.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:16.180
And then after that, it'll be on to 1604, which is remarkable.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.540
And it tells you that I think that welcome screen is a great idea.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.700
I'm glad that was added.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.260
I think we'll see those numbers move a bit more soon

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:27.260
because we haven't turned on the prompts for 1710 users

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.060
to get the prompt to upgrade to 1804.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.660
So that will be later this week.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.220
And then, of course, around June, July time,

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.900
the 1604 users will get the prompt when we release 1804.1.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.860
So the ramp up of 1804 at the moment

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.580
is all people clean installing or deliberately

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.460
choosing to do the upgrade.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.420
So we'll see that rock on a bit more

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.780
as the upgrade prompts kick in.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.460
I wonder, does anybody have a guess?

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.420
If you take out 1804, 1710, and 1604,

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:04.500
the next top distro is not an Ubuntu distro for the Slack snap.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.340
Does anybody have a guess what distro it is?

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.620
It's not an Ubuntu distro.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.460
Arch Linux.

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.740
That's a good guess.

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.180
I see Neon on here.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.380
I see Linux, Mint, Zorin.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.100
Arch is a little bit further down the road.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:23.460
No, elementary 0.41 is the next distro after Ubuntu 1804

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.060
right now for the Slack snap.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.740
Those elementary users, they love their Slack.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.140
Yeah, they certainly do.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.420
They're getting their work done.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.420
That's why they need to get their notifications done right.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:36.420
It's a good thing you're getting that done, Dan.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.420
That's pretty cool.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.700
It's pretty neat to see that.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.260
Debian 9's doing pretty good.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.860
Neon 1604 is doing good.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.820
Fedora 27 on the list.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.900
Pretty cool.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.540
I like that you guys are releasing that.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.460
I'm going to keep an eye on that from now on.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.980
It's interesting to compare the different apps

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.100
and see what different distros shake out.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100
Same with MailSpring.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.420
It's the same kind of spread on MailSpring.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.460
Yeah, people on elementary OS are just

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.540
getting some damn work done, apparently.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.860
What it's there for.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.180
Now, we can't really have an 1804 release discussion

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.020
without getting to some of the cloud stuff,

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.700
because that's just a huge part of what Ubuntu does now.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.580
But I know that Wimpy might have a story that someone

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.420
like myself could appreciate.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.700
Yeah, so we've inherited a couple of features

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.900
from Debian's current developments

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.020
that I think might be up your alley.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:27.900
The first is if you install FFmpeg

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.340
and you've got an NVIDIA card, when

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.860
you install the NVIDIA proprietary drivers,

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.140
that will automatically enable NVENC capability

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.580
on the FFmpeg on the host.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.860
And also, if you install OBS, that

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.580
will automatically pick up the fact

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.860
that you have NVENC-enabled FFmpeg

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.780
and turn on the hardware acceleration for you.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.540
Wow, I was literally just talking to Wes

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.420
about this before the show, about how we were reviewing

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.340
if we really needed to have the NVIDIA card

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.780
during this last Linux fast rebuild.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.380
And we landed on firmly, yep, we still

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.340
have to have the NVIDIA card.

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.580
We still got to have that acceleration.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.940
So that is so great that you just made that easier.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.740
Yeah, so no more building from source.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.100
Just install those two things, and you're off to the races.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.740
Yeah, boy, it's getting good there.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.180
Because this new GIMP release I just mentioned earlier,

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.700
one of the things they're including now

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.060
is GPU acceleration, too.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:23.060
So having a good working GPU setup on an Ubuntu desktop,

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.420
I think, is going to become more and more important.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.580
And I don't need to tell you guys that,

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.620
because I'm sure machine learning and all kinds

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.020
of workloads like that are a big part of why

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.140
that's been done, right?

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.780
I mean, these contributions come from being

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.380
based on top of Ubuntu, but Canonical

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.740
have done a heap of work with NVIDIA

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.060
to unlock compute performance for deep learning and AI

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.260
and all that sort of stuff.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.340
Oh, right, you said it came from Debian, right.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.060
So let's talk about the new multi-cloud reality

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.340
that Canonical finds themselves in.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.100
And this seems to be a point that Mark

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.900
wants to hit in his interviews about Ubuntu 18.04.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.060
He says that they've done boot time and performance

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:06.460
optimized images of Ubuntu 18.04 on every major public cloud.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.840
And they made sure to be the fastest and most efficient

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.420
OS for cloud computing.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.460
I would hope he thinks that way.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.500
He says, having an OS tuned for far advanced workloads,

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.060
such as AI and machine learning, is

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.100
critical to a high velocity team.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.580
And that's from, actually, the product manager

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:24.220
at Cloud at Google, who says that they're looking forward

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.260
to deploying 18.04 on the Google Cloud infrastructure.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.580
And Microsoft came in with their quote saying,

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.540
this was Craig, their program manager, says,

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.500
we're going to have Hyper-V optimized images

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.340
that we've developed in collaboration with Canonical.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.620
These will be enhanced experiences

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.980
of Ubuntu and Windows.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.980
In our upcoming release this spring,

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.300
Hyper-V's Quick Create VM Gallery

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.620
will now include an image for the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.820
release, officially stamped straight from Canonical.

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:56.060
And I read this because it kind of underscores a theme I'm

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.780
noticing in this 18.04 release is Canonical

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:04.200
is working with AWS and other large partners,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.620
like Microsoft, with Azure and Microsoft Hyper-V,

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.180
and I presume many others, to say,

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.540
well, what do you need us to custom build into these images

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.060
for you?

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.380
And it's something that they seem

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.180
to be taking to a much larger scale with this release.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.020
I mean, that matters a lot, right?

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.100
Not every shop and everyone doing this has time

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.420
or even makes sense for them to do that sort of tuning.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.740
So if you can get that out of the box,

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.620
it makes Ubuntu a natural choice.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.060
Yeah, it's definitely an incentive.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:33.460
So in Ubuntu podcast, season 11, episode 8,

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.100
we interviewed David Britton, who's

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.260
the lead for the Ubuntu server team.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.620
And he talked about the customizations and performance

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:49.140
optimizations that Canonical do for the major cloud providers.

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.460
So for each of their clouds, they

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.140
get tailored images that are Ubuntu,

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.100
but specific to their environment

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.820
and their boot processes and their hardware.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.060
Which episode again?

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.180
As we're recording this, the current episode.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.300
So it's season 11, episode 8.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.700
Oh, very good.

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.180
I look forward to listening to that.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.900
Now, that seems like all of that is all good and fine,

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.100
but we haven't talked about Pop!

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.180
OS, which isn't a flavor, not an official flavor,

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.540
but it is one of the more well-known Ubuntu

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.340
derivatives at this point.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.780
And Ian sat down with us at the Linux Fest Northwest booth,

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.300
and he told me about a feature they're adding in there

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.860
that I think is pretty clever.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.360
And I wonder if we're going to see it

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.780
in other places pretty soon.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.180
The new installer sets up a recovery partition.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:34.780
Oh, OK.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.060
So that's something new that I haven't seen in Linux.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.220
I might have missed it.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.940
I was just thinking about that today, actually.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.040
Yeah, so basically there's an extra partition on the drive.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.820
It's about 4 gigabytes, enough to hold two ISOs conveniently.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.300
And it basically just holds the latest ISO

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.780
so that you have media to reinstall your OS,

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.780
even if you don't have a flash drive or a CD drive available.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.260
Wow.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:58.980
Love that.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.740
Yeah.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.100
So can you do a fresh install, configure install,

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.480
or does it give you a, when you install a machine,

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.580
does it come, does Pop!

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.140
OS itself come pre-configured with all of the System76

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.060
repositories, assuming that you're using System76 hardware?

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.940
Or is it come just as like a stock distro,

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.820
and then you further customize Pop! OS?

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.260
You have to add like a PPA later and stuff like that.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:19.260
Right.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.700
For the hardware that's specific to System76.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.580
How does that work?

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.380
So the new installer should be automatically installing

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:31.060
the System76 package for all of the hardware support stuff.

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.580
That's in the main Pop! OS repository now,

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.980
in addition to being in the System76 repository

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:37.900
for other OSs.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:38.400
OK.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.140
So it should be installing that.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.640
That may not be set up yet, though.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.020
I'd have to double check on that.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.340
But I can message Jeremy on Slack at some point

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.100
and figure that out.

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.140
Yeah, because we are talking like down the road here.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:49.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.660
But yeah, it's pretty well set up.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.140
And it's a whole entire distro.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.820
And it will be doing the hardware integration

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.380
for System76, but it will work great on everything.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.060
It doesn't require a System76 computer.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.820
It's not lost on me that when you say the installer,

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.180
that is something that most System76 customers won't even

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.860
see.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.100
Actually, no, because another thing the installer does

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.340
is full disk encryption.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:16.820
Oh.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.780
And so now.

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.520
There's like a user interaction process.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.020
Right.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.500
So the first run for a new System76 computer,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.260
it's actually going to run the installer.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.980
And it's going to do a couple steps in the installer.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.260
And it's going to ask you if you want to encrypt.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.140
And if you choose you don't want to encrypt,

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.620
it'll just say, cool, we're done, and it'll.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.260
Now, it'll say you're done, and then it

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.140
goes to the user creation.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.180
I got cut there because there's a lot of noise

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.420
in the background, and somebody jumped on the mic.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.500
Because there were people having a really good time

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.180
at Linux Fest.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.740
They sure were.

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.820
But, Pobie, you were noting in the chat room

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.780
that there's other ways this can happen, maybe

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.900
other companies that do this.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.900
Yeah, Dell have been doing this for a few years.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.540
They ship their systems with a little Dell utility

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.940
that when you first install it, it

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.420
says, do you want to create recovery media, basically?

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.060
Stick a USB key in, and it'll make that.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.980
But if you don't, that's OK.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.820
Because they've done the same kind of thing,

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:10.940
where they've got a recovery area, a partition,

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.900
and you can just reboot and make it nuke the system back

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.060
to clean.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.140
And when I reviewed the Dell laptop that they sent us,

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.220
I just did that and reverted it back to factory defaults,

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.420
and then put it back in the box and sent it back to them.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.140
Right.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.060
That is really nice.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.220
I think I've always traditionally just nuke

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.700
and paved the entire drive when I get a new machine.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.860
And I've always kind of regretted it in the end,

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.540
because it's a nice convenience.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.140
So I like that they're essentially bringing that

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.180
to everybody with Pop!

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:42.660
OS.

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.060
Yeah, more people should do this.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:48.140
And I wish we could do that more easily in Ubuntu,

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:53.060
so that the default Ubuntu install had a recovery

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.940
partition and could do all of this magic voodoo.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.540
But we'd get a bit of pushback, I think, from some people.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.740
It's a lot of work to do.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.460
And it's easier for System76 to bake this in,

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.460
and for Dell to bake this in at the factory

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.540
when they're putting the images on the hard drives.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.460
It's a little less easier for us to do it as a USB stick.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.500
But it could be done.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.140
But it's a lot of engineering work.

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:14.540
Yeah, right.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.080
And you know in that case that it's

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.460
going on a laptop, whereas Ubuntu goes lots of places.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.540
So I've been pretty impressed.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.900
My initial impressions, this is all they are at this point

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.340
with 1804, is that it's shipping just such a great version

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:28.980
of Gnome.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:32.220
And it iterated on top of 1710 in a lot of great ways.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.140
The choice to go with X11, I think, was a safe one.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.500
And I can see where maybe a few things are going.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.020
I can see perhaps a new theme that I think it's called.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.140
People have talked about it.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.560
It might be coming on the horizon.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.900
But I could also see interesting directions

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.940
that new Ubuntu welcome screen goes, perhaps more

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.100
in the direction of Ubuntu MATE's welcome.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.620
That could be really interesting.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.600
I would love to see that develop more in 1810.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.700
And I would like to see just more of what they're doing.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.480
So far, my initial impressions have been pretty solid.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.500
We'll see what the stability story is.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.100
We'll see what third party application integration

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:10.900
and support is.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.780
But right now, I can see where things are going.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.540
And I'm liking it.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:17.720
It seems like 1710, they pulled it off.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.740
And the 1804, they would have had to really blown it

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:22.980
to mess up 1804.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:23.600
And they didn't.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.220
They didn't blow it.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.060
They just iterated on top of it.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.540
So both Fedora 28 and Ubuntu 1804

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.220
might be, so far, my initial impression,

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.820
some of their best releases I've ever seen out of either group.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.720
It's a super exciting time to be a Linux user.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.300
I mean, there's so much going on.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.520
And 1604, I felt like it really shook up the landscape.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.540
It was kind of a monumental release.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.140
And 1804, it's like, now we're on that first just strictly

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.300
better polish LTS.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.340
I'm so excited.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:57.020
Yeah, and I'm really, I guess, I can't even

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.580
remember how long it's been since I've

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.020
been tracking an Ubuntu release and a Fedora release

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.420
around the same time, where they're

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.220
shipping at the same time.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.100
And they're both shipping the latest and greatest GNOME.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.940
And so we're back to, well, who kind of has the cooler GNOME

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940
implementation?

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.620
It's been a long time since we've been there.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.660
And it feels kind of nostalgic.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:17.180
I love it.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.300
I'm really excited about the whole release cycle.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.420
So I think just a couple of solid releases.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.420
I got Fedora 28 on the machine.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.740
I got Ubuntu 1804 proper on a machine.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.660
And then I have a mess of systems on Kubuntu 1804.

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:37.780
And I would be negligent if I didn't just say, hot damn.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.460
We put it in the belly of the beast,

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.460
a trial by the greatest fire.

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:47.100
There is one thing we can do at Jupyter Broadcasting

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.660
to break a machine every single year.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.100
Every year, we've broken a machine.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.940
And we sometimes had to run out and grab parts

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.260
in the middle of the fest and rebuild our system right there

01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.260
on the table at our booth.

01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.180
We've had to reload operating systems,

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.300
reinstall OBS, set up NVIDIA drivers,

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.260
reimport all of our scenes.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:13.060
This year, we decided if Kubuntu 1804 could survive Linux

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.620
Fest Northwest without crashing, it

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.500
would become our de facto production operating

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.740
system at Jupyter Broadcasting.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.780
Because there is literally no better way to break a system.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.620
And we built one really great OBS system.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.580
We Frankensteined a couple of systems together.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.620
But they're all really solid parts.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.820
Six cores really fast, 32 gigs of RAM, MV&E drives,

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.860
multiple MV&E drives, brand new fresh power supply,

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.300
cleaned it all out, everything.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.900
It's just a gorgeous system.

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.580
And we installed Kubuntu 1804 Minimal Install on it.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.940
Minimal Install is so perfect for the studio.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.100
It's so perfect.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.220
Nothing's missing.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.980
Nothing's missing.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.900
Nothing extra.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.460
They nailed it.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.340
It's so great.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:57.660
And so we loaded that on this new OBS Frankenstein machine.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.420
And Noah and I sat around for hours.

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.260
Because last year didn't go so well.

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.260
We had a lot of crashes.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:05.020
Every episode of Linux Unplugged would suffer a crash.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.300
And both Noah and I just felt super bad about that.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.380
And he's like, Polar Bear, I don't

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.060
want to leave and have that thing crash on you the next day.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.580
And I said, Brown Bear, I don't want to have to go buy a Mac.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.900
So we've got to make sure this works.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.420
We're getting real talk here.

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.460
If this fails on us, what am I going to do?

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.180
Because I'm at a point where I've tried Unity.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.180
I've tried Arch.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:24.940
I've tried Gnome.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:25.740
I've tried Zubuntu.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.820
We tried Zubuntu during this whole transition.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:28.700
I've tried it all.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.460
Fuchsia, that's probably it.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:32.140
Like, what am I going to do?

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.260
So we have to know this works.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.620
We have to be 100% solid on this.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.140
We'll build it.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:38.780
We'll set it up.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.700
We'll do some testing.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.620
We'll run through every single show.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.940
And we had Alan by this time.

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:43.780
Alan had joined us.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.180
So it's me, Noah, and Alan all working this problem.

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.860
And then we got the new Kubuntu rig set up.

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.260
We went through every single show.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.300
We did a mock version of every show on the network, the three

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:54.620
of us.

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.620
It was a lot of fun.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.100
That's amazing.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.380
And we were able to be ridiculous because we

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.420
weren't streaming any of it.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.220
So we didn't.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.340
I hope you recorded this.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.300
No.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:01.940
I mean, I did.

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.580
But I don't know if I kept the files.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.380
We did an unfilter.

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.340
We did a Linux unplug.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.180
We did a BSD now.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.300
We did all of them.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.020
And made sure everything worked.

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.220
We certified it as good and said, OK, now we're going to

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.180
take it up to Linux Fest.

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.740
If it survives that weekend, we'll put it back in the

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.980
studio, and we'll lock everything

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.420
down to Kubuntu 18.04.

01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:24.840
And it performed so well that Chase Nunes, who was running

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.380
the board, ended up loading up a pinball application on his

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.180
laptop and playing pinball while the machine just ran and

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.340
did its thing.

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.380
Just ran and did its thing.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.460
That says so much.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.100
He played pinball.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.700
And afterwards, he went up to Angela and said, this was the

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.820
smoothest, easiest year we've ever had.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.100
It's never ran better.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.660
Did not crash once on us.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.220
Beautiful.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.740
Did not have a single issue.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:49.140
Now we've recorded three shows through it since we've been

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.700
back from Linux Fest running Kubuntu.

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.060
We have it installed on five systems in the immediate room

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.380
that we're sitting in right now.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.260
It's on another system outside.

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.500
And it's just been rock solid.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.980
So I really can't say enough good things

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.660
about Kubuntu 18.04.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.420
And I've really started to just take to plasma.

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:10.860
I tweak my defaults.

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:14.260
Takes me about a day of just sort of putzing here and

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.900
there, like the first time I open up Dolphin, I change a

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.020
few settings.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:20.860
The first time I log in, I open up settings, and I change

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.300
a few things.

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.100
But after the first day or two of just doing that on and off,

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:26.820
I'm pretty much done.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.420
And it's set.

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.460
You've got it dialed in now.

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:28.900
Yeah.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:29.900
And loving it.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.900
The performance overhead is less than it was on some of

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.060
the other desktop environments.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.620
And I was surprised every time I saw that.

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.820
We have an active monitor right here as I'm watching.

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.900
I'm still watching the system.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.260
CPU and memory usage is lower by quite a bit than it was on

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.580
some GTK desktops.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.780
You were mentioning earlier, it feels like a professional

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:51.300
workstation.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.300
Yeah.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.580
I was teetering on what am I going to do.

01:21:55.580 --> 01:22:00.740
I need a professional grade workstation environment that I

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.940
can put on powerful hardware that feels like it's designed

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.220
for people to get worked on as professional.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.700
And that's how Plasma feels for me.

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.060
It just feels professional grade.

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.940
It's just really well done.

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.460
Kubuntu is a really great release.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.820
I wasn't the biggest fan of the one that was

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.500
based on Plasma 5.5.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.420
This one, they nailed it.

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:21.780
So my most experience, because I've been installing it on

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:24.900
systems for two weeks now, is with Kubuntu 18.04.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.780
God knows I've tried it in every which way, different

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.020
configuration.

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.580
And I even got to see how it performed with failing

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.540
hardware, which was pretty entertaining.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.780
It was, we had a disk that was going bad in a system, and

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.420
KWin disappeared.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.020
Goodbye.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.980
Just completely disappeared from the system.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.580
And then after we got that fixed, VLC disappeared, just

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.620
completely gone.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.140
I closed the window, and it was gone.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:46.820
The entire application.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.740
Never to be seen again.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.780
So it was funny to see how Plasma handled it.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:53.820
And we telegrammed producer Michael, and we're like,

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.300
Rotten, is there any way that KWin could disappear while

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.300
we're using the system?

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.820
No, that's impossible, he writes back.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.220
We're like, um.

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:01.940
It just happened.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.860
That's when we knew we had some trouble.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.100
But it even did fine there.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.940
You almost wouldn't have even known, except for KWin

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.820
disappeared, and then VLC disappeared.

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.300
But it actually did pretty well for quite a while.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.740
I've been really, really thrilled with it.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:18.740
I think it's maybe my favorite Linux release maybe ever.

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:19.580
Maybe.

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.220
We'll see.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.180
I mean, we'll see.

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.380
Maybe a blow up in my face, and I'll change my tune.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:23.780
But right now.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.500
I mean, it's early days, right?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.460
But that's the most exciting part, is you have so much more

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.420
to go, and it'll be with you for a long time, I expect.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.340
Yeah, it is one of those releases where I'm excited

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.460
again to spread the word.

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:35.380
I got it installed on Hedia's computer.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.980
I'm excited to play with it.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.340
But I'm not getting distracted by tweaking it too much.

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.700
It's just, it's so good.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.260
It's so good.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.060
And there's little things it does, like remembering the

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:45.500
right spots for my windows to open up.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.260
So when we're in the studio and we have to launch things

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.780
really quickly, they all go in the right place.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:51.420
And little things like that that make it efficient to use

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.260
that I just really super appreciate.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.260
And I still got Neon on a couple of systems.

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:55.860
Still pretty great.

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.260
I'm really enjoying KDE Neon on my workstation upstairs.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.420
And I have it on a laptop.

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.060
But everything else is KWin2H04.

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.300
It just matches my production systems.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.300
And then on both, you're still in Ubuntu, right?

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.060
It's mostly the same.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.500
Just a little difference on the skin.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:10.700
Yeah, I was tempted by Arch a little bit over Linux Fest,

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:13.300
just because I love that AUR.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.500
I'm Brent's an Arch user, so I know he understands.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:21.100
But that idea of the whole stack, the whole stack being

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:24.500
LTS, and my machines just become appliance-like as close

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.740
as possible.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.260
And then you've got Livepatch in there too.

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.820
So I can even reduce having to reboot there.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.620
It seems like it's just the right time for you

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.540
to have this be stable.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.380
Yeah, because it's really come to a point

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.220
where we were considering, do we hire an IT person?

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.720
Because we've got a lot of systems.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.220
Rekai used to help pick some of that up.

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.460
But we've decided, if we can just get these systems

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.940
manageable to a point where I can manage them,

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.700
and folks can help me out here and there

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.740
when they're at the studio, that's perfect.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.780
And that's where we kind of moved away from Arch.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.540
We'd look at something getting 300 packages behind on updates

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.460
before we could get to it.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.700
And that's where you start rolling the dice,

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.460
with Arch, in a pretty big way.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.620
Arch will run great as long as you stay on top of it.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.760
But when you spread that across six systems,

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.220
and those six systems are there to serve

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.740
the purpose of doing work, not to do anything else,

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:12.420
it's hard to stay on top of that.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.060
So we'll see.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:13.940
Very happy with it.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.460
Very, very happy with Kubuntu 18.04.

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.540
I really recommend people give it a try.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.860
But go get more of our friends over at the Ubuntu podcast.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.940
Sounds like they have a doozy that just came out.

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:23.820
I'm looking forward to hearing that.

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:25.360
And our friends over at Late Night Linux

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.620
just did their review of 18.04 as well.

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:29.940
And I thought that was pretty great.

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:31.660
So you can go catch out more of that.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.460
And also, you may have heard recently

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.940
that Ubuntu 18.04 got loaded on the Nintendo Switch, which

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.020
is pretty cool.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.820
The touch screen works.

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.220
Well, Wes and I did a technical breakdown

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:49.380
of how that's done at a hardware level, the exploit,

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.140
some of the ways that people are going to make it easier,

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.460
and the software in the Tegra that was actually vulnerable.

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.660
All that's covered in our TechSnap program,

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.180
TechSnap.systems, that would be it.

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.060
It's 365.

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:00.700
Thank you, sir.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:05.340
Episode 365, which, how can you forget that?

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.640
Now, if you're watching live, which is, I mean, come on,

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.140
right?

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:09.740
You should join.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:10.260
It's too much fun.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:10.820
Everybody's doing that, right?

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.940
It's so obvious.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.220
Well, then you stick around, because the Ask Noah program's

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:14.620
coming up.

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.940
And you've got your Linux sandwich.

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.280
You start out with the unplugged program.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.700
We've got our live show.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.220
That's where things really start.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.020
Then you've got the main show.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.220
We've got our post show.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.300
And then that Noah Choliah guy comes in.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:25.300
Messes everything up.

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.340
Takes a whole other round.

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:26.840
Woo.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.380
Woo.

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:30.060
Yeah, I was on his program just a couple of episodes ago.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.900
And we talked about encryption and how

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.280
some of the different laws that could affect encryption

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.220
could affect open source.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.420
I thought it was a pretty good chat.

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.220
So look for that.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.580
But we'll be back here pretty soon.

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.820
Thank you so much, Linux Unplugged, slash 247 for links.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.980
See you next Tuesday.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:27:09.380
See ya.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:21.580
So many good distro choices this week.

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:24.880
This is really, it's a good week to be a Linux user.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.480
It's almost like it's the year of the Linux desktop, isn't it?

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.480
It's feeling like it.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.240
It is in a lot of ways.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.800
Not as we foresaw it, but...

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.240
You mean because it's Chromebooks?

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.240
You look at Chromebooks adding Linux application support, you look at Microsoft adding the

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:44.060
Linux subsystem to Windows, you look at these really solid releases from Ubuntu and Fedora,

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.780
and we've never been in better shape.

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.780
It is looking really good.

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.780
Although the doubters are still going to doubt.

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:49.780
Yeah.

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.780
Well, yeah.

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.780
Yeah.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:52.780
That's true.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:53.780
Yeah.

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.780
But what do they know, right?

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.780
All right.

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.780
We got to name this thing before we get out of here.

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780
Yeah.

01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.780
Banks and Jess.

01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.780
JBtitles.com.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.780
JBtitles.

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.780
Oh, God.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:02.780
Did you guys see this?

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:03.780
Facebook dating was announced just recently.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.780
Yeah.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.780
Oh my God.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.780
Just for you, Dan.

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.780
Yeah.

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.780
Yeah.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.780
I'm off Facebook these days.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.780
Oh.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.580
I've been thinking about it a lot.

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.580
Yeah.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:17.340
I saw that and I nearly included it as a news item for the Ubuntu podcast.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.340
Smooth.

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:23.060
I've been thinking about doing the Facebook account delete thing.

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.060
I'm not sure.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.060
It's just a few family members that I would lose touch with.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.060
No.

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:31.780
I just unfriended all of the randos that I'd collected.

01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.900
OCD shone through.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:39.060
And it was like, where are all of the people I knew when I was at primary school and connected

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:42.260
with people that I haven't seen since I was 10.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:46.580
And then some years later, I realized I'd got hundreds of friends that I didn't really

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.580
know.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:53.160
And I just unfriended all the randoms and just coalesced around the people that I actually

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.160
know.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.160
So Facebook is just me now.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.160
I actually know.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.420
It's basically you and my wife, Poppy.

01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.420
Yeah.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.780
Are you not worried about the data tracking aspects of it, the monitoring you on other

01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.220
sites via the Facebook like buttons and whatnot?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:13.300
I am, but if I am not on Facebook and like everything my wife posts within a maximum

01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:17.180
of a 37 minute time frame, then she thinks you're mad at her or something.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.180
Yeah, exactly.

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:24.100
So I have to be on Facebook to sort of, you know, have a harmonious, you know, marriage.

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100
So that's why I'm on Facebook.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100
Yeah, I do for family.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.420
I need I need to create a bot that every time Louise posts something, it likes what she's

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.420
posted within 37 minutes.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:37.260
And if I could do that, then I wouldn't have to be saying, yeah, that's worth every cost.

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.380
Do you have a Facebook brand?

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.380
Do you have a Facebook?

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.380
I do.

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.780
And I've been having this exact conversation.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:45.300
It's like you're repeating what has been happening in my mind wondering if it's time.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.300
Well, yeah.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:50.460
And I've, you know, maybe one of the solutions to some of these problems is that new Firefox

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.740
plug in that came out to isolate the containers.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.740
Yeah.

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:54.740
Oh, here we go.

01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.900
I can I can w w up on this.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.460
So I'm using the Facebook.

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:03.660
Well, I'm using Firefox containers generally, but I use the Facebook one.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:08.360
Now on my phone, I've removed all of the actual Facebook app.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.540
So I've removed Facebook Messenger and Facebook itself.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540
Yes.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:16.440
And and the pages administrator, whatever it's called.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.900
And I have installed there's a there's an application called I forget the exact name.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:26.820
I think it's just called notifications or notifications FB or something, but it's called

01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820
notifications.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.700
I can't find the exact name in a moment.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:35.900
I have that installed, which polls the web service to see if you've been sent a message

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:39.220
or if somebody's liked something or whatever.

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:47.060
And then I have another app installed called Slim Social, which is a web wrapper around

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:54.860
the Facebook website and the notifications thingy integrates with the Slim Social.

01:30:54.860 --> 01:31:01.180
So now everything on my phone to do with Facebook is constrained to this web app that is in

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.860
its own little sandbox.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:09.740
So I I still get the notifications so I can still like everything Louise posts within

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:15.560
37 minutes, but I don't get all of that invasive shit that the Facebook applications have hooked

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.180
up to the rest of your system.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.180
Wow.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:19.180
I'm going to totally look into that.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.500
That is so neat.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.460
I just installed the sorry, go ahead.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:26.820
I was just I was going to say I'll get the actual names of those apps that are available

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:30.380
in F-Droid and they're also available in the Android app store.

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:31.380
Neat.

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.380
What were you going to say Brent?

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.540
I'm just going to give a thumbs up there.

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:38.980
I just installed Slim Social for Linux Fest Northwest to get my Twitter up and going,

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:43.620
but I'm kind of anti or trying to be anti Google store.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.500
So yeah, F-Droid it's in there and it actually works really well.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.500
Super responsive.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.500
Double plug.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:49.500
Hey Dan.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.500
Hey.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:56.140
So what's going to be the recommended retail price for the next version of elementary?

01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:01.660
Are you going to like, you know, what would you say would be a reasonable amount for someone

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.020
to pay when they download the ISO?

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.340
The default is currently at $10.

01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:10.500
Are you going to keep that or change that or what are you going to do?

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.820
I don't think we're going to change it.

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.860
We always talk about, oh, we should, you know, run some kind of A-B test or some crap or

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:16.860
whatever.

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:17.860
Right.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.860
Make it $10 equals Alan, then make it $50 or something.

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:21.860
There you go.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:22.860
That's a good idea.

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.660
Actually, that'd be a good feature.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:31.260
I mean, really what it is, is it's like what you can afford is the appropriate price to

01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.260
pay.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:38.140
So if you're, you know, destitute, like don't pay, but if you're Bill Gates, like pay a

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.140
lot.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:40.140
Pay a lot.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.140
Yeah.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.140
That'd be nice actually.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.140
I look forward to that.

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140
Well, Brent, thank you for being on the show, man.

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140
Yes.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140
Yeah, this is awesome.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.140
A lot of fun.

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.780
How long, how many hours you guesstimate for that drive back?

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:53.780
Well, I have luckily planned ahead, so I've cut it up.

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780
Oh yeah.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.780
Good.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:00.740
So I'm meeting a friend almost halfway, so taking a ferry going to Victoria for a little

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:01.740
bit.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.740
Good for you.

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:03.940
That's a great ferry ride.

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:04.940
I've never taken it.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.940
Yeah.

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.220
Are you doing a walk on or are you going to drive on?

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.220
I'm going to walk on.

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.220
That's the way to go.

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.220
The price is just.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.220
That's the way to go.

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.220
Good for you.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.880
And then I'm hitting up my brother in BC as well.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.980
And then are you flying from BC to Ontario?

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:17.980
Yeah.

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.980
Good.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980
That's not too bad.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.980
Good for you.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:21.980
That's a good way to do it.

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:22.980
Well, thank you for being here today.

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.980
Thanks for having me this week.

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.980
It's been awesome.

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:25.980
Yeah, trekking to our side of the world.
