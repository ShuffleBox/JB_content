WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
All right well before we get the show started there is one topic I thought

00:03.840 --> 00:07.480
this is probably gonna be one of the top news stories in the Linux action show on

00:07.480 --> 00:11.060
Sunday but maybe we kick it around the virtual lug first did you guys see the

00:11.060 --> 00:15.480
story that broke this morning that factory for openSUSE is moving to a

00:15.480 --> 00:21.200
full-fledged rolling release distro full-on rolling distro now what do you

00:21.200 --> 00:30.960
guys think says the canonical guy we're in a year you know Ubuntu is gonna be

00:30.960 --> 00:36.960
doing the same thing here's what I wonder is you know how they announced

00:36.960 --> 00:39.560
that this next release was kind of just gonna be a maintenance release while they

00:39.560 --> 00:42.440
worked on the back end stuff I'm wondering if this was a one-two punch

00:42.440 --> 00:45.520
all along like well they knew they were gonna do this and so they had a lot of

00:45.520 --> 00:49.200
replumbing to do and so they were working on this and and the way they're

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
gonna do this now is it's kind of an interesting system where there's still

00:52.000 --> 00:55.440
gonna be some automated testing that goes in before it lands and instead of

00:55.440 --> 00:59.280
having to do like big release candidates and and stable beta snapshots before a

00:59.280 --> 01:02.640
big release is essentially they're just gonna firm this thing up as a release

01:02.640 --> 01:12.240
gets closer and then just carve it off and say here you go well only you don't

01:12.240 --> 01:18.680
make the the daily the rolling version of it like like a sanctioned what would

01:18.680 --> 01:22.320
you guys call it a respin like I you know like from a yeah we do we do on the

01:22.320 --> 01:26.160
phone this is exactly what we do right right right I'm interesting will come to

01:26.160 --> 01:30.080
the desktop in the future so how does it work so on on Ubuntu there's not like on

01:30.080 --> 01:34.240
Ubuntu phone there's just new builds all the time there's not like this is rc1

01:34.240 --> 01:38.400
rc2 it's like nope this is just the latest building is every build then QA

01:38.400 --> 01:44.680
tested yeah automated testing on desktops and devices in the lab like

01:44.680 --> 01:49.040
physical phones in the lab probably much the same way as openSUSE we're doing it

01:49.040 --> 01:55.920
and and then you you bless one that passes you know 100% clear testing well

01:55.920 --> 01:58.680
here's what they said in the old development model an army of packages

01:58.680 --> 02:02.560
would shoot new packages and updates to factory with a relatively small team of

02:02.560 --> 02:05.160
factory maintainers taking care of the integration process of all those

02:05.160 --> 02:09.360
packages this took a long time to stabilize and rip for release in the new

02:09.360 --> 02:13.400
rolling release development model package submissions cannot go to factory

02:13.400 --> 02:17.080
directly first they have to prove to be functional and trustworthy in a staging

02:17.080 --> 02:21.120
project staging projects are projects in our open build service where groups of

02:21.120 --> 02:25.200
submissions are collected reviewed compiled and tested with open QA after

02:25.200 --> 02:31.160
the packages survive the staging project they go directly into factory so they're

02:31.160 --> 02:36.560
using open build service and open QA to bang on it first and then that system

02:36.560 --> 02:41.120
then I guess releases it into factory so when you're doing on your rolling open

02:41.120 --> 02:45.960
SUSE release when you're doing a daily update you're theoretically pulling down

02:45.960 --> 02:50.840
updates that the open QA process has already banged on this to me and what's

02:50.840 --> 02:53.520
interesting I don't know if you guys have picked this up I got a couple links

02:53.520 --> 02:57.520
in the show notes like the muck and a few other places are really really

02:57.520 --> 03:01.080
really pushing as this is a comparison to arch they'll say well in arch they do

03:01.080 --> 03:04.960
it this way or in a response to arch do you guys think this is really openSUSE

03:04.960 --> 03:14.040
it trying to respond to arch no it's just is them responding to the way the

03:14.040 --> 03:16.760
application developers are doing this if you look at the way that Chrome and

03:16.760 --> 03:25.320
Firefox are pushing out updates to their applications they they have a very rapid

03:25.320 --> 03:32.400
release cycle and you can you can very quickly get the very latest crack on

03:32.400 --> 03:36.800
your machine by subscribing to a particular particular channel being like

03:36.800 --> 03:42.200
the beta channel or canary or whatever and I don't think arch matters one iota

03:42.200 --> 03:52.260
to openSUSE because opens the open build services supported arch packaging for a

03:52.260 --> 03:57.360
good while now so they've embraced the arch community some time ago and I think

03:57.360 --> 04:03.160
arch has claimed a lot of longer term power linux users now but I do wonder

04:03.160 --> 04:06.660
how many of them are simply there because like Popey says they want the

04:06.660 --> 04:10.440
freshest crack but if you could give them super fresh crack without some of

04:10.440 --> 04:15.880
the arch hassle or you know arch intimidation that some people still see

04:15.880 --> 04:20.600
arch hassle well the setup right and not having things pre-configured for you so

04:20.600 --> 04:24.320
like that's only once you only do that once don't you once you've done that you

04:24.320 --> 04:27.640
get the daily crack every day well who you telling you're a winner well you

04:27.640 --> 04:31.400
tell me I know that but I'm just thinking from people outside that you're

04:31.400 --> 04:35.200
kind of lying that you have to go through some magical hoops to get to

04:35.200 --> 04:43.440
that goal it's only once yeah yeah I don't think that openSUSE's decision to

04:43.440 --> 04:49.000
do this matters one I don't think arch was a deciding factor to be honest yeah

04:49.000 --> 04:53.160
probably not I don't suspect it was more to do with fedora spinning off their

04:53.160 --> 04:57.720
core and desktop next and all the rest of it initiatives I mean kind of like

04:57.720 --> 05:00.080
Popey was getting to too though doesn't it just make more sense from a

05:00.080 --> 05:04.800
development standpoint shouldn't this be how yeah oh absolutely but it's kind of

05:04.800 --> 05:09.560
funny because that testing spart spot is the new factory the and factories the

05:09.560 --> 05:13.080
new tumbleweed yeah is the way I see it it does see like I think so and tumble

05:13.080 --> 05:17.640
weed I guess kind of goes into like it's still being used but it's not as

05:17.640 --> 05:22.800
directly involved anymore I am kind of confused on yeah well Greg Crow Hartman

05:22.800 --> 05:29.400
did write something in our it a kind of response to it yeah he at this point

05:29.400 --> 05:32.080
doesn't know what's gonna happen to tumbleweed as a result of this but it's

05:32.080 --> 05:35.200
not like a huge thing for him anymore it's kind of sounds like he just been

05:35.200 --> 05:38.680
nursing it along for the last couple of months he says yeah so yeah that's

05:38.680 --> 05:42.960
that's the gist I got from that if he consolidates them both into one then

05:42.960 --> 05:48.080
less work for everyone and more benefit for everyone else yeah I know you know

05:48.080 --> 05:52.720
soos has a kick-ass system manager and also they've got snapper that better for fs

05:52.720 --> 05:56.600
snapshot tool right into the system manager so they've got a lot of maybe

05:56.600 --> 06:01.800
just got the other PR kind of sucks and you know the other thing that's

06:01.800 --> 06:04.400
interesting on the opposite of they have the evergreen which is essentially their

06:04.400 --> 06:08.720
LTS so now they've got rolling I guess they've got something in the middle the

06:08.720 --> 06:12.560
stable versions that they'll release still which will have which will have

06:12.560 --> 06:16.920
support windows and then they've got the evergreen LTS style releases so now

06:16.920 --> 06:20.920
there's the whole gambit there that they're spanning I really think this is

06:20.920 --> 06:24.720
interesting because we were just talking what does open suits are really have to

06:24.720 --> 06:31.160
offer the Linux community and this I think we're starting to see that come to

06:31.160 --> 06:35.320
fruition manager maybe we need to step up the PR though you know get their

06:35.320 --> 06:39.520
team going and like reporting and shit if they put the name out of open suits a

06:39.520 --> 06:42.920
little bit more so then we're not just talking about it as if it's some you

06:42.920 --> 06:51.360
know loner in the corner it might actually be good seems like everybody's

06:51.360 --> 06:55.400
always talking about open system but nobody actually uses it well I wonder if

06:55.400 --> 06:59.000
this isn't sort of isn't this sort of a tuck and roll to make them like to sort

06:59.000 --> 07:02.800
of adapt to the changing way things are done in Linux and say okay we're where

07:02.800 --> 07:06.280
we want to kind of pivot and become a great distribution for those of you who

07:06.280 --> 07:09.560
want to really be working on the edge of open source software you want a system

07:09.560 --> 07:12.600
that's been well engineered and that some real thought has gone into that has

07:12.600 --> 07:16.320
some tools to make your daily Linux driving use a little bit easier like you

07:16.320 --> 07:19.440
know things like yas and actual graphical update management utilities

07:19.440 --> 07:22.040
because let's remember I mean yes we're up we've been talking about arch but on

07:22.040 --> 07:25.320
arch everything's command line some people don't like that that sometimes

07:25.320 --> 07:27.780
is enough for some people they just want a graphical front end to some of these

07:27.780 --> 07:31.040
tools plus you got a big company behind it which makes some people feel a

07:31.040 --> 07:33.940
little bit better so now you can say okay I'm a developer I'd like to have

07:33.940 --> 07:37.080
cutting-edge software but maybe have it'll be a little more stable and tested

07:37.080 --> 07:41.920
assuming that they can keep things fresh and tested and I want something that's

07:41.920 --> 07:45.560
well designed and that could be people could be looking around going well open

07:45.560 --> 07:48.480
Sousa could be the way to go and I think this is why it is more of a response to

07:48.480 --> 07:52.920
fedora than anything else so then maybe this is really what they're bringing to

07:52.920 --> 07:57.800
the table I think it's a response to the world everybody wants stuff faster they

07:57.800 --> 08:03.880
have to do something to keep the market share up yeah do you think that maybe

08:03.880 --> 08:08.200
the perception about open Sousa and its marketing and its message is regional

08:08.200 --> 08:12.880
because certainly in Europe open Sousa is a big big thing everyone knows that

08:12.880 --> 08:21.440
message gets through quite loud and clear yeah yeah I think it is somewhat

08:21.440 --> 08:25.360
regional but then again I mean what we were talking about in the context of

08:25.360 --> 08:30.080
last week is if you wanted not necessarily like in like it's great you

08:30.080 --> 08:33.000
know the open Sousa does really obviously has markets it does really

08:33.000 --> 08:36.160
well and what we were kind of making the case was is if you were going to sort of

08:36.160 --> 08:42.040
introduce a brand new game-changing technology to Linux like systemd or some

08:42.040 --> 08:46.480
standard desktop application container technology across the board or a

08:46.480 --> 08:50.680
universal package format something crazy pie in the sky right if you were going

08:50.680 --> 08:54.560
to do something like that could it be the open Sousa group that would be able

08:54.560 --> 08:57.600
to introduce it and have it take off and I would argue we've seen some things

08:57.600 --> 09:02.000
they've done that are really cool like like OBS or the gallery that you would

09:02.000 --> 09:04.640
think other that were built for other districts distributions to take

09:04.640 --> 09:08.080
advantage of that are you know like they're they're even paying the bill for

09:08.080 --> 09:14.120
it and still it really hasn't gone outside of their ecosystem that's where

09:14.120 --> 09:16.560
we were talking about relevancy before and I don't know if this changes that

09:16.560 --> 09:22.040
position or not the problem with open Sousa is that they have a ton of awesome

09:22.040 --> 09:26.320
ideas and they create like the OBS in the studio all these things are just

09:26.320 --> 09:31.520
like concept wise they're awesome but they never fully finished them and never

09:31.520 --> 09:36.560
polish them so there's a ton of breakage with the OBS I mean it's so much of a

09:36.560 --> 09:41.640
pain to use the OBS that's why people just ignore it hmm I wonder if to by

09:41.640 --> 09:45.560
being rolling and faster and more nimble like this if they introduce a cool

09:45.560 --> 09:50.840
technology that maybe it gets faster adoption because people can get their

09:50.840 --> 09:55.960
hands on it quicker and start playing with it sooner maybe also getting

09:55.960 --> 10:03.880
packages into the factory it's a lot easier as well

10:03.880 --> 10:08.440
welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show the rocks of beard and

10:08.440 --> 10:13.240
knows how to use it my name is Chris my name is Matt I just you'll get the

10:13.240 --> 10:15.600
beard reference later on I'm just gonna leave that out there now we got a big

10:15.600 --> 10:19.440
show today because we got back from OS con and we're like well we have a huge

10:19.440 --> 10:22.720
Linux action show and we still have more stuff to play so we have some exclusive

10:22.720 --> 10:27.880
interviews from the floor of OS con coming up as well as our takeaway from

10:27.880 --> 10:34.040
the trip some interesting trends we observed and also a plea if you will

10:34.040 --> 10:37.760
plus we'll recap the trip itself and then later on in the show we got a

10:37.760 --> 10:41.260
little stuff that's coming up that we could use the community's input on so if

10:41.260 --> 10:45.160
you are a crux user or have looked at the crux distribution stay tuned towards

10:45.160 --> 10:48.700
the end of the show we got a special call out for you guys Matt big show

10:48.700 --> 10:53.040
today big show so let's bring in the mumble team so that way they can

10:53.040 --> 10:57.720
assemble and join us mumble room prepare your minds for the feedback because last

10:57.720 --> 11:03.600
week we dared to boldly venture into productivity land I had no idea you know

11:03.600 --> 11:07.660
what people use Linux for getting work done turns out that's right not video

11:07.660 --> 11:13.160
games no no no silly video games we like to get things done yeah yeah so when we

11:13.160 --> 11:17.680
talked on the topic of productivity we apparently we sparked some feedback so

11:17.680 --> 11:20.200
I'm gonna cover just a couple of them because I don't want to like the people

11:20.200 --> 11:22.760
who don't care about productivity stuff under Linux I don't want them to tune

11:22.760 --> 11:28.120
out so we got two two I wanted to start with our first email this week it came

11:28.120 --> 11:32.080
in in regards to my Thunderbird quest which I didn't get like a great answer

11:32.080 --> 11:35.800
but this one was a really great extension I'm by the way I'm looking if

11:35.800 --> 11:38.960
you have great extensions to make Thunderbird really rock I'd love to hear

11:38.960 --> 11:43.440
about like I got some of the basics like I have one that lets me see the mail

11:43.440 --> 11:49.600
agent that people used to send me emails so I know when they're on Outlook and

11:49.600 --> 11:53.120
I've also got you know like of course the GPG encryption for Thunderbird and

11:53.120 --> 11:56.240
stuff like that but Mark wrote in with an interesting one it's called

11:56.240 --> 11:58.800
conversation threads and he says I highly recommend the Thunderbird

11:58.800 --> 12:02.440
conversations extension it displays email as a chronological thread rather

12:02.440 --> 12:06.680
than a single message even if the emails themselves are spread across folders like

12:06.680 --> 12:11.680
you know between inbox and sent which is pretty cool Matt I seem to remember this

12:11.680 --> 12:15.360
since you said conversation thread I instantly flashed back to my Thunderbird

12:15.360 --> 12:19.160
days yes it is an awesome application I have it does not care where the email is

12:19.160 --> 12:22.640
it works great that's nice I like that it goes across the inbox there I have a

12:22.640 --> 12:25.360
link to it in the show notes if you're a Thunderbird user and watch it I

12:25.360 --> 12:29.320
actually I put this one on there the one thing that it does that I don't like and

12:29.320 --> 12:32.680
you could probably turn this off and I haven't looked into it is it also

12:32.680 --> 12:37.920
changes the way Thunderbird displays your email so it looks like Gmail and

12:37.920 --> 12:40.680
the reason I'm using Thunderbird is to get away from the way Gmail displays

12:40.680 --> 12:44.880
some things so yeah yeah there's a little bit of getting used to if I

12:44.880 --> 12:48.560
remember correctly it does like little mini panes kind of overlapping and you

12:48.560 --> 12:53.880
can collapse and expand and what right I was okay with it I was okay yeah the

12:53.880 --> 12:57.360
benefit is that you can also use Enigmail for like encryption and whatnot

12:57.360 --> 13:01.160
that Gmail can't do yeah so there's plenty of and some people like the way

13:01.160 --> 13:06.480
Gmail does it right so that's then it's a win-win if you do I use it with

13:06.480 --> 13:09.920
Thunderbird when I'm using Thunderbird when I just feel like it and yeah it's

13:09.920 --> 13:15.280
amazing it just organizes it it gets rid of that huge thick header bar yeah

13:15.280 --> 13:19.960
that's true that is nice Matt and I were scratching our heads on

13:19.960 --> 13:23.640
Sunday one of the I think Matt you mentioned Nitro tasks I meant to mention

13:23.640 --> 13:29.120
wonder tasks we also mentioned to do dot text for task managers under Linux

13:29.120 --> 13:32.480
Randy writes in with a really great suggestion he says love the show so my

13:32.480 --> 13:36.520
first time commenting on last 323 you had listener asking about a task manager

13:36.520 --> 13:40.960
application as someone who is always searching for the perfect task manager

13:40.960 --> 13:45.000
this caught my attention so I have a suggestion to offer of course here he

13:45.000 --> 13:47.680
says its selection always depends on your particular requirements that's a

13:47.680 --> 13:50.840
standard disclaimer but here's what he wants from a task manager and I think

13:50.840 --> 13:53.840
we'll probably all agree with this cross platform so you can use it on any OS

13:53.840 --> 13:57.280
work or home synchronized across multiple machines specific task

13:57.280 --> 14:01.200
management features I like such as subtasks oh that's nice allows me to

14:01.200 --> 14:05.080
print out my task list and scribble on it during the day oh that's nice too and

14:05.080 --> 14:09.400
accessible from an Android device all right so this is this sounds perfect he

14:09.400 --> 14:14.640
says the solution I found and I'm pretty happy using is task unifier pro task

14:14.640 --> 14:18.440
unifier one word pro as a task manager which is very full feature gives me the

14:18.440 --> 14:22.840
kind of interface I want it syncs with to doodle to doodle which gives me cross

14:22.840 --> 14:26.440
machine syncing access on Android and as a backup I know some of the audience

14:26.440 --> 14:29.520
might find this helpful he says I was able to finally settle down on one task

14:29.520 --> 14:34.080
manager after a long search keep up the great work Randy so there you go it's

14:34.080 --> 14:38.320
called task unifier pro I haven't tried it out yet but that list sounds killer

14:38.320 --> 14:42.080
oh it sounds like because I've been kind of looking for something like that that

14:42.080 --> 14:46.380
might actually scratch my itch yeah yeah and you can find it at task unifier dot

14:46.380 --> 14:52.920
com it looks like here's a it looks like maybe it's a Java app actually

14:52.920 --> 14:56.760
potentially yeah I'm looking at it right now I don't yeah it works for Mac

14:56.760 --> 15:00.680
Windows and Linux task unifier yeah it's any operating system supported by Java

15:00.680 --> 15:04.880
so there you go I won't judge it based on the Java thing I'm not a big Java guy

15:04.880 --> 15:09.680
but I would check it out yeah had me until Java yeah I mean there is that but

15:09.680 --> 15:14.760
you know I already I just what I just put job oh I got a new game I got a new

15:14.760 --> 15:18.320
game that requires Java so now I've got Java on my computer so I already got

15:18.320 --> 15:25.360
Java minecraft isn't new no not minecraft it's like a fallen sky I

15:25.360 --> 15:28.720
think is the game have you guys seen this it's on Steam right now you guys

15:28.720 --> 15:32.760
follow gaming on Linux remember we had the one the the main writer from gaming

15:32.760 --> 15:38.640
on Linux on the show a few weeks ago he did let me go find it he did it he did

15:38.640 --> 15:42.880
it he's been doing a really interesting kind of like from time to time he's been

15:42.880 --> 15:46.840
emailing popular Linux game developers and getting them to actually release

15:46.840 --> 15:52.720
their Linux sales numbers to him and yeah yeah and it's really it's not

15:52.720 --> 15:58.920
awesome it's really not awesome usually isn't no he just he just posted part 3

15:58.920 --> 16:04.840
on gaming on linux.com and the game that I picked up after this list that I

16:04.840 --> 16:08.520
realized I didn't have he's got a whole bunch on here and some of them are

16:08.520 --> 16:17.720
pretty good Linux like spy chameleon 5% Linux installs rust rust says that 0.4

16:17.720 --> 16:25.160
and 0 1% in July so rust sales are 1% in July the fall represents 4.5 sales for

16:25.160 --> 16:31.160
Steam and when you and humble if you if you factor all those in flash out to 16.1

16:31.160 --> 16:35.160
percent of Steam sales are Linux well that's not bad 16% almost noticeable

16:35.160 --> 16:42.400
quest of dungeons 1% Linux 5% Mac 94% Windows far sky with oh that was the

16:42.400 --> 16:47.520
game I got 0.89% Linux that was that surprised me because far sky is actually

16:47.520 --> 16:52.080
a pretty cool-looking game where you go underwater

16:53.720 --> 17:00.000
and you get to explore an underwater world and find like cool stuff and it's

17:00.000 --> 17:03.080
got pretty good graphics too and there's like underwater facilities I don't know

17:03.080 --> 17:07.480
I guess it takes place in the future I just got it but it requires Java but you

17:07.480 --> 17:12.920
have to survive underwater find food find items find money you have to grow

17:12.920 --> 17:17.360
stuff in like hibernation chambers under the water obviously there's fish you

17:17.360 --> 17:21.840
have to battle with so for the kid like the boy was like oh yeah I want that

17:21.840 --> 17:25.760
game I was like yeah we could easily he's got less than 1% Linux sales let's

17:25.760 --> 17:30.680
boost that up a little bit I think it would be an obvious game but maybe it's

17:30.680 --> 17:33.560
just the fact that people aren't aware of it enough on the Linux platform that

17:33.560 --> 17:36.600
yeah that's what I was wondering because after I got it I'm like yeah why is this

17:36.600 --> 17:40.080
not more popular to be honest with you because it just gets cooler and cooler

17:40.080 --> 17:46.360
as you play it too so it's called far sky and it's see it's it's maybe this is

17:46.360 --> 17:51.160
why I don't know it's 15 bucks on Steam yeah I guess I might be a little high

17:51.160 --> 17:54.600
for some folks but I feel like we've all gotten a little out of whack and what

17:54.600 --> 17:58.680
our game pricing is it's been out since April so if you want to check it out you

17:58.680 --> 18:01.800
can maybe boosters anyways and then the game go check out gaming on Linux where

18:01.800 --> 18:07.000
they have have more stats for Linux sales it's it's getting better we're not

18:07.000 --> 18:11.600
competitive yet with the Mac and I would say the Mac isn't quite on par with what

18:11.600 --> 18:15.460
the sales need to be at so I continue to buy and I just like to remind folks too

18:15.460 --> 18:18.000
that if you do if you do want to buy steam games you should do it under Linux

18:18.000 --> 18:21.080
because then it counts always always yeah don't don't ever buy under windows

18:21.080 --> 18:23.920
because at that point you're really sending not only mixed messages you're

18:23.920 --> 18:28.040
sending the wrong message yeah exactly I think I think it's pretty so I mean

18:28.040 --> 18:32.240
$15 for a game that's gonna give you hours of entertainment how I don't I

18:32.240 --> 18:36.400
don't get why people aren't willing to fork that over I mean have they gotten

18:36.400 --> 18:40.320
so spoiled by like the humble bundle and all these free-to-plays that they're not

18:40.320 --> 18:44.720
willing to fork out $15 really people I think so and app stores have skewed our

18:44.720 --> 18:48.840
perspective too I think it's app stores and I also think it's a matter of

18:48.840 --> 18:52.600
something that the folks on the Windows platform will do often as they reach out

18:52.600 --> 18:56.600
to be folks that do let's plays if you're a if you're a game developer and

18:56.600 --> 19:00.440
you're not doing that you're an idiot I'm sorry yeah I mean it's like you are

19:00.440 --> 19:03.080
really screwing yourself on that one because at the end of the day that's how

19:03.080 --> 19:06.160
you get your word out for maximum cheap they got to learn how to market to the

19:06.160 --> 19:09.040
Linux community because they've never really had to reach out to us before and

19:09.040 --> 19:14.880
spread the word and you know I also I look I look at it this way too I think

19:14.880 --> 19:18.720
that if if maybe it's one of these things where people start to it's gonna

19:18.720 --> 19:21.520
take a long time to kind of warm over the crowd because it's been it's there's a

19:21.520 --> 19:24.720
culture built up around it now and even when we talk about it on the show people

19:24.720 --> 19:26.680
hate it even though it's like one of the biggest things to happen to Linux

19:26.680 --> 19:30.360
desktop people hate it when we talk about games and we'll see what happens

19:30.360 --> 19:34.940
with it keep watching it I hope their sales improve I really do because I'd

19:34.940 --> 19:38.720
love to see Steam OS really take off and maybe it will once Steam OS itself

19:38.720 --> 19:43.000
actually actually ships in in in more homes maybe like cuz you know you can

19:43.000 --> 19:46.120
get Steam OS now but you have to roll it yourself hey I want to talk about

19:46.120 --> 19:50.480
something huge that's happening on the GTK side that we have lambasted them

19:50.480 --> 19:55.040
for right here on this very show because you know Gwadek's going on and so of

19:55.040 --> 19:57.820
course we got to get some gnome news and I think some people are gonna be happy

19:57.820 --> 20:01.760
about this be curious to get wimpy's reaction to first I want to tell you

20:01.760 --> 20:07.200
about an awesome opportunity head over to Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged

20:07.200 --> 20:09.520
right now go over to Linux Academy dot-com slash

20:09.520 --> 20:12.840
unplugged because they got a special promo going just for you guys it's the

20:12.840 --> 20:16.080
summer of learning and you know there's sunshine out there and you need a good

20:16.080 --> 20:19.600
excuse to avoid that sunshine absolutely right I mean who wants to get stuck

20:19.600 --> 20:23.520
actually out in the nice weather not me my friends Linux Academy dot-com slash

20:23.520 --> 20:27.500
unplugged but on a serious note this is a genuine resource for you to go and

20:27.500 --> 20:31.400
take your Linux skills up to the next level they have so many really awesome

20:31.400 --> 20:35.480
courses and you can see why you'd want to subscribe to this for example you

20:35.480 --> 20:39.560
could just take the basic Linux level 1 exam 101 type stuff but then you can

20:39.560 --> 20:43.520
move up through the stack everything up to introductions to Android developments

20:43.520 --> 20:47.240
they they span the entire gamut plus they have seven plus Linux distributions

20:47.240 --> 20:50.000
you get to choose from and the courseware then is automatically adjusted

20:50.000 --> 20:53.920
based on the distro that you pick and they have downloadable comprehensive

20:53.920 --> 20:57.920
study guides audio and video that you can watch and learn and listen to while

20:57.920 --> 21:01.400
you're say driving or sitting at the computer doing the courseware they have

21:01.400 --> 21:05.960
a ton of self-paced labs which is really cool because then later on you can go

21:05.960 --> 21:09.260
back and quiz yourself and see what you've picked up this is for me I have

21:09.260 --> 21:12.640
found a great resource to kind of see what do I have a into it for what can I

21:12.640 --> 21:16.640
kind of pick up what's in my wheelhouse do I have an interest in this particular

21:16.640 --> 21:20.960
technology do I want to learn Python these kinds of questions are so easy to

21:20.960 --> 21:24.440
be answered just by going to Linux Academy dot-com slash down plugged and

21:24.440 --> 21:28.920
get that 33 percent discount that's only $50 per quarter the other really cool

21:28.920 --> 21:32.280
thing is they're doubling down on AWS infrastructure courses as well so if you

21:32.280 --> 21:35.880
need to do a little Linux and AWS stuff they have scenario based training you

21:35.880 --> 21:39.440
can go through and actually implement something so you walk away with an

21:39.440 --> 21:42.720
actual usable product a skill set you could apply to a job something you could

21:42.720 --> 21:46.100
put on a resume something that you can learn yourself to see how that system

21:46.100 --> 21:51.180
works Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get that nice deal so let me get the

21:51.180 --> 21:54.000
straight if I'm in a hard place and it's like look I'm looking at gaining some

21:54.000 --> 21:57.440
new skills and I've got three months to kill and I can pop 50 bucks forward I

21:57.440 --> 22:01.520
get three months 50 bucks and I get a new marketable skill that's awesome oh

22:01.520 --> 22:04.800
absolutely and there's a community there that helps like people to go out and get

22:04.800 --> 22:07.600
testing and gives them support and answers and you know it kind of keeps

22:07.600 --> 22:10.600
you going because there's people that genuinely care they're also doing a lot

22:10.600 --> 22:13.960
of live stream events now so you can interact with the folks that are doing

22:13.960 --> 22:17.400
the teaching so there's a good back and forth there it's an amazing resource

22:17.400 --> 22:20.920
mat and what's really cool is it's essentially three Linux advocates are

22:20.920 --> 22:24.960
like you know we need to have we have between all of us here we've got web

22:24.960 --> 22:28.880
development skills we've got years of training experience we can build this

22:28.880 --> 22:32.680
right and we know exactly what other Linux users would want from a service

22:32.680 --> 22:36.520
like this and I think that's really remarkable because what you walk away

22:36.520 --> 22:40.040
from is a new understanding of perhaps how a different distribution does

22:40.040 --> 22:44.280
something how to deploy something I mean it is genuine tangible benefits that you

22:44.280 --> 22:48.600
get to walk away from with a service like this Linux Academy comm slash

22:48.600 --> 22:51.680
unplugged go take advantage of the summer of learning and you get to keep

22:51.680 --> 22:55.520
all of the courseware the study material all of that stuff they have tests where

22:55.520 --> 22:59.560
you can check yourself how far you've gotten it's such a cool service and I'm

22:59.560 --> 23:04.600
so happy they're a sponsor Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and thanks

23:04.600 --> 23:08.840
everybody who supports the show by visiting our sponsors okay I teased it a

23:08.840 --> 23:14.600
little bit you guys might have saw this it was a blog post blogs.nome.org

23:14.600 --> 23:18.800
client-side decorations is getting a revisit and they've posted some

23:18.800 --> 23:24.360
screenshots now of different scenarios where you can have the GTK software

23:24.360 --> 23:27.960
detect if you are in a client-side decoration environment and automatically

23:27.960 --> 23:31.480
display those big header bars or if you're an environment perhaps it isn't

23:31.480 --> 23:34.920
friendly to client-side decorations it'll drop them now and go back to a

23:34.920 --> 23:39.860
more traditional look kind of on the fly this is sort of them saying all right so

23:39.860 --> 23:43.640
the client-side decorations thing wasn't that well received we still think it's a

23:43.640 --> 23:48.000
good idea we'll implement it in certain scenarios and we'll automatically remove

23:48.000 --> 23:50.600
it in other scenarios and if you're watching the video version I'm showing

23:50.600 --> 23:55.520
you some screenshots right now it kind of it's kind of a kind of like what we've

23:55.520 --> 23:59.000
seen with gnome itself when they make these dramatic changes there's a ton of

23:59.000 --> 24:02.600
blowback and then you start seeing things like classic mode and extensions

24:02.600 --> 24:06.120
that kind of bring back functionality now you're seeing this people were

24:06.120 --> 24:09.160
really responding like whoa whoa whoa whoa if GTK is going off crazy like this

24:09.160 --> 24:11.560
I don't know if I want to be using this this seems like it's something just for

24:11.560 --> 24:14.920
gnome and now this seems to be them coming back and say all right guys well

24:14.920 --> 24:18.800
look no we still want you to use this in other environments wimpy you're you're a

24:18.800 --> 24:22.680
mate guy I'm a tag guy you're using GTK and all kinds of different environments

24:22.680 --> 24:26.920
is this good news in your perspective it is because it's gonna save us a ton of

24:26.920 --> 24:32.360
work really how so well at the moment we've had to put some patches in to kind

24:32.360 --> 24:36.320
of adapt client-side decorations because there are ways to override them at a

24:36.320 --> 24:41.440
system level but they can still be overridden at the application level so

24:41.440 --> 24:46.360
if you look at the new GA client-side decorations I mean actually it's quite

24:46.360 --> 24:49.680
it's quite nifty the way they've integrated the menus into the title

24:49.680 --> 24:54.320
bars there but you can't override those at a system level because it's kind of

24:54.320 --> 24:58.720
intrinsic to the way the application is designed to work now but this approach

24:58.720 --> 25:05.640
it does mute the critics and it does make GTK a platform that anyone can use

25:05.640 --> 25:12.440
and and certainly go some way to silence in the critics saying that GTK is sort

25:12.440 --> 25:18.200
of becoming a lib no library Popey did we just jump on him too soon were they

25:18.200 --> 25:21.020
gonna do this all along when we just didn't let white out to see the final

25:21.020 --> 25:28.280
version maybe maybe they've seen what Apple are doing with Yosemite and

25:28.280 --> 25:33.440
they're following up and very quickly posting what what they've been planning

25:33.440 --> 25:37.400
all along I'm sure you think so so why not come out from the very beginning and

25:37.400 --> 25:41.880
say we're working on this but for non gnome 3 environments we're gonna have an

25:41.880 --> 25:46.200
answer for you soon why not say that from the beginning there under no

25:46.200 --> 25:48.960
obligation to do that it's an open source project you know there's no

25:48.960 --> 25:53.520
there's no reason why you know you stamping your feet and demanding that

25:53.520 --> 25:57.200
they tell you what their future plans are means that they have to do that but

25:57.200 --> 26:01.720
doesn't this doesn't this go to what we have so often see in the community where

26:01.720 --> 26:06.400
there's this abrasive sort of way of presenting the future from the known

26:06.400 --> 26:09.200
project and then the community reaction says oh once again

26:09.200 --> 26:12.760
gnome is shoving something down our throats and doesn't care what we have to

26:12.760 --> 26:16.000
say there's just like this visceral reaction that you see on on reddit and

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
and and on on on discussion forms all over the web and it's kind of like if

26:21.000 --> 26:23.920
they would just come out and maybe communicate slightly differently and say

26:23.920 --> 26:28.600
our long-term plan is to solve something for everyone I do wonder if maybe those

26:28.600 --> 26:32.280
initial reactions wouldn't be so much oh gnome is once again cramming something

26:32.280 --> 26:36.600
down our throats I think if no spend all their time responding to reddit and the

26:36.600 --> 26:41.400
rest of the gallery then they wouldn't actually get anything done I think I

26:41.400 --> 26:44.520
think they're doing the right thing yeah and they definitely are I mean it sounds

26:44.520 --> 26:47.520
like it's a good change regardless of they're gonna do it all along or if

26:47.520 --> 26:51.640
this isn't about face this seems like a great change it's it's one of these

26:51.640 --> 26:55.400
things to where I look at and go this is perfect because I really genuinely have

26:55.400 --> 26:59.480
some GTK applications that I'm gonna use regardless of what desktop I'm on and

26:59.480 --> 27:02.720
this has been a problem and you we've seen some of those horrible screenshots

27:02.720 --> 27:06.320
of like archiver on cinnamon before cinnamon supported client-side

27:06.320 --> 27:12.320
decorations really much better well they had to start somewhere as well true yeah

27:12.320 --> 27:15.260
I suppose so I suppose they could have done this from the beginning but yeah I

27:15.260 --> 27:19.940
suppose so all right even if it wasn't their idea that I mean like if there if

27:19.940 --> 27:24.840
it wasn't their long-term solution and then you know they meant to just do what

27:24.840 --> 27:28.920
they did and then people had backlash isn't it kind of a good sign that the

27:28.920 --> 27:31.760
known project is showing that the listening and they're actually trying

27:31.760 --> 27:36.880
to solve the problem that they are you know being informed about yeah that's a

27:36.880 --> 27:42.520
great point is it does seem like either way they're listening more I have to go

27:42.520 --> 27:47.080
ahead I have a house for no sorry to be fair to the name developers they've

27:47.080 --> 27:51.160
communicated quite well what their intentions were with regards to

27:51.160 --> 27:54.800
client-side decorations with the development community through through

27:54.800 --> 27:58.280
their blogs and through their documentation effort and although it

27:58.280 --> 28:03.440
wasn't received with open arms let's say through some projects that are dependent

28:03.440 --> 28:08.860
on GTK the the developers that were affected by these decisions didn't throw

28:08.860 --> 28:12.040
their toys out the prime and didn't get too worked up about it it was quite a

28:12.040 --> 28:17.640
pragmatic reception and certainly from Marte's point of view in addition to

28:17.640 --> 28:24.160
adapting to the system overrides we also abstracted some of the toolkit to change

28:24.160 --> 28:30.780
the way that that GTK three works to suit better the style that Marte works

28:30.780 --> 28:37.560
with but most of the backlash and vitriol that you see isn't from people

28:37.560 --> 28:43.560
that know what they're talking about I think I think I think our favorite K

28:43.560 --> 28:47.280
win developer probably was the most vocal about it and he's very technical

28:47.280 --> 28:51.040
and very experienced in that area I agree that there are technical

28:51.040 --> 28:56.480
commentators that have a point of view but the overwhelming feedback comes from

28:56.480 --> 29:01.800
people that will read something that Martin has posted or other people that

29:01.800 --> 29:07.240
know what they're talking about and then repeat bites of that about the place as

29:07.240 --> 29:10.520
if they're expert on the subject and don't really know what they're what

29:10.520 --> 29:15.120
they're espousing at all and it comes down to something we were we were kind

29:15.120 --> 29:19.400
of discussing on the live stream on Sunday is there's a bit of sometimes it

29:19.400 --> 29:23.920
happens is drive-by technologists that can come in and kind of fire shots over

29:23.920 --> 29:29.080
this but I I kind of looking back at this now there was it was there was

29:29.080 --> 29:34.160
certain people in the community that did very bloudly condemn it and what we

29:34.160 --> 29:39.800
don't know now is if it was that vocal pushback that maybe for before I get on

29:39.800 --> 29:43.480
Martin for going to the blog and going to Google Plus and sort of ramping up

29:43.480 --> 29:47.640
sort of an anti client-side decoration campaign perhaps it was that very effort

29:47.640 --> 29:51.840
that sort of convinced the known project to make these changes we don't know well

29:51.840 --> 29:59.280
when when GTK 3.11 which was one of the development cycle it was one of the

29:59.280 --> 30:03.960
point releases for 3.11 I know that a couple I think three of the developers

30:03.960 --> 30:07.640
from the Marte project we're talking to some of the developers from name and

30:07.640 --> 30:12.720
explaining some of the the difficulties we're seeing and and how it it could be

30:12.720 --> 30:16.920
better implemented yeah and we and we already got a feeling that they were

30:16.920 --> 30:20.080
like yeah okay we're going to address this in a later release somewhere and

30:20.080 --> 30:24.240
we're good we're going to change the way that this is applied so you know from

30:24.240 --> 30:27.840
our point of view we kind of knew that that wasn't a step down as such but a

30:27.840 --> 30:31.680
change of direction to be more accommodating to other projects yeah and

30:31.680 --> 30:35.280
I also I also noted when they originally started talking about the whole

30:35.280 --> 30:38.440
client-side decoration thing it was couched with a lot of this is in

30:38.440 --> 30:41.760
development this is a work in progress this is something we're moving towards

30:41.760 --> 30:44.960
what do you think about us putting the buttons here you know there wasn't like

30:44.960 --> 30:49.360
it wasn't it wasn't an ironclad this is how it will be designed it was this is

30:49.360 --> 30:52.560
what we're thinking about I remember specifically like blog posts or like

30:52.560 --> 30:56.440
here's a mock-up of how we could do it and it was very I actually think it is

30:56.440 --> 31:01.160
an indication of how the gnome project has changed you're not just with

31:01.160 --> 31:04.980
client-side decorations but really starting with about gnome 3.10 the way

31:04.980 --> 31:09.720
they have been communicating their future changes to me is much more open

31:09.720 --> 31:12.560
it's much easier to like sort of grok some of the new stuff coming towards

31:12.560 --> 31:15.840
gnome and I think they're firing a lot better on the communication cylinders

31:15.840 --> 31:19.400
now and I think it's definitely improving yeah I mean I think this is

31:19.400 --> 31:23.360
another another thing another bump in that direction another another trend

31:23.360 --> 31:27.240
bump you could call it definitely been my experience it's good news it's good

31:27.240 --> 31:30.600
news everybody and also it's good news because arch and gnome are gonna take

31:30.600 --> 31:37.880
over Linux in a couple of years so I mean what all right hey we have some

31:37.880 --> 31:44.000
OSCON stuff to follow up on got some more goodies from OSCON and both that

31:44.000 --> 31:48.080
Eric and Noah went down there with me so I I have a few photos I wanted to show

31:48.080 --> 31:51.160
so if you're watching the video version you can grab you can just watch that or

31:51.160 --> 31:55.080
I will have the link to the photo album in the show notes you don't worry we're

31:55.080 --> 31:58.040
not gonna do like a big slideshow but I just want to talk a little bit about our

31:58.040 --> 32:03.080
trip and say it right off the top a really special thank you to Noah Noah

32:03.080 --> 32:06.600
went all out for this trip not only did he and his family fly out here a week

32:06.600 --> 32:10.400
before they needed to be out here for a wedding they were going to but they also

32:10.400 --> 32:14.880
rented an SUV so that way they could haul our butts around Noah FedExed out

32:14.880 --> 32:21.480
camera gear and microphones like overnight so this is no and I driving

32:21.480 --> 32:25.840
down Noah took me down to the train station where we where Eric and I went

32:25.840 --> 32:30.540
to the yes what is it a Union Station Eric that is King Street Station in

32:30.540 --> 32:34.240
Seattle Kings we went down to King Street Station which was really nice

32:34.240 --> 32:38.960
riding the train is so much more chill than riding on the plane because you

32:38.960 --> 32:42.600
just walk up like there's a there's a gal at the front she's like what where

32:42.600 --> 32:46.760
are you going and I tell you where I'm going all right go sit over there and

32:46.760 --> 32:50.640
then they they announced over a horrible speaker when it's time to get on the

32:50.640 --> 32:55.360
train and then you just walk up to the train and get on after like like stamp a

32:55.360 --> 33:00.320
thing and you go past a guy so it's pretty casual because you can just you

33:00.320 --> 33:02.920
know it's like I don't know you just like we just walk right up and get on

33:02.920 --> 33:08.280
there the train was nice too I think this is underrated way to travel and

33:08.280 --> 33:11.880
plus you get a nice view the whole way you go Eric got the the seat view both

33:11.880 --> 33:18.440
ways both ways okay did you get any good pictures you know I did I should

33:18.440 --> 33:23.080
probably post those but I got some great views like the train goes right under

33:23.080 --> 33:27.600
the Tacoma Narrows bridge which is a huge suspension bridge in Washington

33:27.600 --> 33:32.200
State and it's I got some really neat pictures of that I got some pictures

33:32.200 --> 33:35.200
like what Chris is showing on the livestream right now the st. John's

33:35.200 --> 33:44.080
bridge in it turns out Eric is like a walking Wikipedia of road trivia highway

33:44.080 --> 33:47.680
and bridge trivia out the wazoo it's ridiculous which makes it when I was

33:47.680 --> 33:51.480
picking you up from the train station what about that what about what about

33:51.480 --> 33:54.280
so here's Eric and I at the train station where we had an opportunity to

33:54.280 --> 34:01.760
spend about an hour and 45 minutes well to be fair it wasn't really Noah's

34:01.760 --> 34:05.960
fault so I mean to give Noah credit so Eric and I we get on a train right and

34:05.960 --> 34:10.200
we're all being super like cash train has Wi-Fi the whole way down there so

34:10.200 --> 34:13.880
that's really nice and easy it's kind of spotty but you get Wi-Fi meanwhile Noah

34:13.880 --> 34:18.760
and the family unbeknownst to us are going through like a special like

34:18.760 --> 34:22.800
welcome to Washington hell trip where like the mall they go to gets evacuated

34:22.800 --> 34:25.840
when all they want to do is just eat and pee so then Noah drives the whole

34:25.840 --> 34:28.760
family from Seattle down to Portland Oregon while Eric and I are on a train

34:28.760 --> 34:34.520
then he goes an hour yeah and then he goes to pick us up and Google Maps sends

34:34.520 --> 34:38.480
them like 25 miles in the wrong direction oh no well see that's your

34:38.480 --> 34:43.040
first problem you weren't using ways this is the night before I saw and so

34:43.040 --> 34:46.200
Noah's like Noah finally after a while like I'm like I first I don't want to I

34:46.200 --> 34:48.480
didn't want to bug him because I wasn't sure like you know he's got the whole

34:48.480 --> 34:52.160
family maybe you know like there's some stuff to settle before he leaves you

34:52.160 --> 34:56.120
know so I'm like about 45 minutes go by and I'm like so how's it going and he

34:56.120 --> 34:59.200
like writes me back he's like just so you know man this is nowhere near the

34:59.200 --> 35:03.080
hotel I'm like oh dude it's like seven minutes from the hotel what are you

35:03.080 --> 35:06.200
talking about so then we start like sending each other map screenshots back

35:06.200 --> 35:12.640
and forth to compare notes all over vibrate no I got a nice tour of the

35:12.640 --> 35:16.040
Portland Oregon area let's well I think he was driving too fast to see most of

35:16.040 --> 35:21.680
it to be honest with yeah when he got there he came to a screeching halt yeah

35:21.680 --> 35:32.760
like when he got there that the vehicle smelled like burned rubber cuz he was

35:32.760 --> 35:36.640
funny that what put us behind the curve to begin with was we wanted Indian food

35:36.640 --> 35:44.080
and we went to the Indian food that was probably so we go to this we go to go to

35:44.080 --> 35:47.120
this restaurant and the restaurant is closed so we go down to this mall which

35:47.120 --> 35:50.560
is nothing like ten blocks in in a different direction then yeah somebody

35:50.560 --> 35:54.200
pulled the fire alarm so they evacuated the mall the funny thing was on Sunday

35:54.200 --> 35:58.680
when we got back into Seattle we went back to eat to eat Indian food again and

35:58.680 --> 36:03.320
we found an Indian restaurant literally like three blocks from where that mall

36:03.320 --> 36:10.040
was go figure yeah yeah so we stayed at the Red Lion Hotel and which was nice

36:10.040 --> 36:12.920
because it was only it was you know five minutes walking distance from the

36:12.920 --> 36:16.280
convention center not a great hotel you can see here this is my curtain this

36:16.280 --> 36:19.480
looks like something that Sound of Music would make dresses out of they were like

36:19.480 --> 36:24.040
just it was like really distracting but you know what was what was chiefly

36:24.040 --> 36:28.600
important OSCON day one I figure I'm in Linus Torvalds territory it's safe to

36:28.600 --> 36:35.160
rock socks and sandals I proudly rock socks and sandals at OSCON it's super

36:35.160 --> 36:38.880
comfortable it's the way to go and then we got some food there's a Noah rocking

36:38.880 --> 36:42.880
his Google glass and Eric taking phone calls there at the food table making

36:42.880 --> 36:48.000
business deals of course yeah and we saw one of the coolest things at OSCON what

36:48.000 --> 36:51.760
was the hardware alley and I got some more of that in a little bit but this

36:51.760 --> 36:55.680
here is Noah do you remember the details of this split keyboard where the guy had

36:55.680 --> 37:00.360
handwritten all of the info and they felt so good yeah so essentially it's a

37:00.360 --> 37:03.440
customizable keyboard so you can take the keys and you can arrange them any

37:03.440 --> 37:08.520
which way you want it you have a picture of the metal one I know that board those

37:08.520 --> 37:12.200
keys those keys what he's showing on the wooden they're not stuck in that pattern

37:12.200 --> 37:16.280
like you can slide those keys any which way you want there's not in the picture

37:16.280 --> 37:18.800
it almost looks like there's their specific spots where they have to go but

37:18.800 --> 37:22.760
they can put them anywhere on the board yeah I'm somehow they work yeah they're

37:22.760 --> 37:27.200
really neat and they feel really good we saw some custom like little arm Game

37:27.200 --> 37:32.240
Boy like machines the guys were super excited about making them aren't we know

37:32.240 --> 37:35.800
yeah yeah we saw the open so I think I had a little bit I have the open source

37:35.800 --> 37:39.640
laptop and of course Erica Noah so there's Noah's camera and there's Eric

37:39.640 --> 37:42.200
they're getting set up because we had an interview with Krista Bona I think that

37:42.200 --> 37:45.400
was one of our highlights of the trip was getting to chat with Krista Bona and

37:45.400 --> 37:50.480
yeah it's funny man because when you walk up to these places the way the

37:50.480 --> 37:55.060
conversation goes is who are you who are you with if they don't recognize you how

37:55.060 --> 37:58.720
many subscribers do you have and then you give them the answer and either you

37:58.720 --> 38:05.640
pass the test or you fail the test and and thankfully we passed the test yeah

38:05.640 --> 38:09.940
and here's a here's a great example like Zen you know the virtualizer they had a

38:09.940 --> 38:13.920
booth and they had well funny enough they had like an iMac mounted in the

38:13.920 --> 38:17.720
booth and then they had like Linux stuff being displayed on the iMac but they had

38:17.720 --> 38:21.800
a pretty cool booth to sit at and Linode was there rocking some cloud hosting

38:21.800 --> 38:25.720
information and then we saw like all kinds of funny like makeshift things

38:25.720 --> 38:28.480
like there was this was a four node cluster that was built out of these

38:28.480 --> 38:32.280
little machines Red Hat had a pretty good booth we stopped we'll have a

38:32.280 --> 38:35.800
we'll have a chat with one of them here in just a minute there's me rocking the

38:35.800 --> 38:39.060
OSCON boy towards the mid bit of the first day I was starting to feel a

38:39.060 --> 38:43.240
little ragged because it's a lot of walking around it's hot but then you

38:43.240 --> 38:46.200
know we started to see the fun side of OSCON like this giant chess set that

38:46.200 --> 38:49.600
they have on the floor there there was a ping-pong table and then we got to chat

38:49.600 --> 38:53.040
with Karen from the Software Freedom Conservancy which was exciting because

38:53.040 --> 38:57.100
she's really like she's passionate so that got us all fired up again and then

38:57.100 --> 39:01.440
we walked around we saw the open source laptop this is such a cool I mean I

39:01.440 --> 39:06.440
think no is this maybe your favorite stop that we did which the hardware

39:06.440 --> 39:10.040
laptop yeah the hardware laptop with these stegnographers keyboard that you

39:10.040 --> 39:15.080
wanted to switch to over Devora it's really cool I'm not gonna deny that but

39:15.080 --> 39:17.720
I have to say my favorite booth which I don't even think we have pictures of

39:17.720 --> 39:24.680
what was the orange of s the blue right the appetize social that that right now

39:24.680 --> 39:27.580
we don't have any shirt we don't have any pictures from that but they're

39:27.580 --> 39:32.600
working on a really cool open source post to all social networks at once kind

39:32.600 --> 39:36.000
of like your hootsweets out there but totally open source and free that you

39:36.000 --> 39:39.440
can self host so if you're a company and you you have to manage a social media

39:39.440 --> 39:43.280
account like a lot of distros do and things like that they have essentially

39:43.280 --> 39:45.520
just go to their github repo check it out and you throw it up on your own

39:45.520 --> 39:49.160
server and now you can you can manage multiple social networks with this one

39:49.160 --> 39:52.960
open source suite and they also do other stuff like a parallel file system and

39:52.960 --> 39:56.000
all kinds of other stuff but that was what we were really excited about I'm

39:56.000 --> 39:59.400
gonna look at the file system too it looks actually pretty cool there's

39:59.400 --> 40:03.920
another shot of the open source laptop really neat I just love a wood laptop I

40:03.920 --> 40:08.840
mean it's it's no macbook air or ultra pro but it's you know it's pretty sweet

40:08.840 --> 40:11.720
and the guy was really passionate talking about the different hardware and

40:11.720 --> 40:15.280
stuff Noah got a great interview with Simon St. Lauret we're gonna have that

40:15.280 --> 40:19.280
here in just a minute he is a senior editor at O'Reilly and also one of the

40:19.280 --> 40:24.320
chairmen's of OSCON and then Noah drove us back I think this is almost it right

40:24.320 --> 40:28.480
here here's the oh this was cool I really liked this at the Libre office

40:28.480 --> 40:32.720
booth up on the projector they had in a Libre office document projected up on

40:32.720 --> 40:35.320
the screen guess what this morning the UK government announced that they're

40:35.320 --> 40:40.040
standardizing on ODF the same more the same format Libre office uses natively

40:40.040 --> 40:43.840
that was a pretty fun thing to be there to see them celebrate that when that was

40:43.840 --> 40:49.120
announced so they were so excited about that I cannot tell you I mean we had

40:49.120 --> 40:51.960
like a five-minute conversation before I drug you guys over so we could get an

40:51.960 --> 40:57.320
air view of them yeah so it was so excited and why Noah was talking to the

40:57.320 --> 41:00.560
Libre office folks I was talking to one of the guys from the software

41:00.560 --> 41:04.440
conservancy they the one of the developers of PHP my admin and I was

41:04.440 --> 41:08.440
like man I love your project thank you for making it easy for my clients to

41:08.440 --> 41:12.160
back up their sequel databases like you've enabled them to use my SQL thank

41:12.160 --> 41:15.720
you that's kind of neat that's just who you bump into while you're there and we

41:15.720 --> 41:23.440
just start chatting up again I love the Linux action show also Michael Dexter

41:23.440 --> 41:27.960
of the Portland Linux Unix group yep he was pointing us in the right

41:27.960 --> 41:31.160
direction for people to be interview I just want to give him props to nice

41:31.160 --> 41:34.400
such a good such a nice guy it's always fun he's always at these events that I

41:34.400 --> 41:36.920
go to and it's so great to bump into him because it's like seeing an old friend

41:36.920 --> 41:40.480
and it was also he also got us to hook up when we did the live stream of the

41:40.480 --> 41:44.940
Linus Torvalds chat at the Portland Linux users group so let's get to we

41:44.940 --> 41:51.160
interviewed Ruth I think her name was from Pi Dora and you know this is a

41:51.160 --> 41:55.200
really fascinating project to see Fedora get into the whole arm space get into to

41:55.200 --> 41:58.000
get into making a serious distribution for the Raspberry Pi they're writing

41:58.000 --> 42:00.640
books about it now they're really getting they're getting really serious

42:00.640 --> 42:04.080
about it so I want to talk about that but first let's thank our next sponsor

42:04.080 --> 42:08.120
on the Linux unplugged show and that's the awesome folks over at Ting Linux

42:08.120 --> 42:13.080
dot ting.com Linux dot ting.com will get you $25 off your first device if you've

42:13.080 --> 42:16.200
already got a device well good news you can bring that over to ting check their

42:16.200 --> 42:21.320
BYOD page and they'll just give you a $25 credit everywhere I went when I was in

42:21.320 --> 42:26.640
Portland I was rocking LTE coverage and even more to the point which is really

42:26.640 --> 42:31.320
unique is while I was on the floor at OSCON I was able to take pictures and

42:31.320 --> 42:35.480
send them back to Angela who was sitting back at jbhq and then posting like the

42:35.480 --> 42:38.200
guys are on the floor interviewing Chris Tabona the guys are on the floor

42:38.200 --> 42:42.000
interviewing Chris Christian Hellman like all of that was happening while I

42:42.000 --> 42:45.880
was on the floor and actually be able to get LTE or sometimes 3G depending on

42:45.880 --> 42:49.360
the because it's just crazy in these conventions I had to give mad props to

42:49.360 --> 42:54.000
ting Linux dot ting.com go find out why ting is awesome here the highlights no

42:54.000 --> 42:58.240
contract so no early termination fee and you only pay a flat six dollars per

42:58.240 --> 43:02.720
month no data caps no minutes you have to use up or don't get to take advantage

43:02.720 --> 43:07.920
of it's just what you use every single month add it up six dollars for the line

43:07.920 --> 43:12.160
and then whatever the tax man's got to take to give yourself a little taste go

43:12.160 --> 43:16.000
over to Linux dot ting.com and click on that savings calculator now for purposes

43:16.000 --> 43:21.560
of demonstration enter in exactly what you actually use not what you pay for

43:21.560 --> 43:26.280
right because which one of the hardest things about switching to ting is you

43:26.280 --> 43:30.680
have to kind of change the way you think about wireless you don't have to buy like

43:30.680 --> 43:33.800
a certain set amount of minutes that you might use in a certain set amount of

43:33.800 --> 43:38.680
data that you may or may not use or text messages you only pay for what you use

43:38.680 --> 43:41.920
and it it's if you think about the way the mobile industry should have been

43:41.920 --> 43:46.400
structured this is it what ting has done is hit the reset button and it makes so

43:46.400 --> 43:49.920
much more sense once you kind of change the way you think about things so I've

43:49.920 --> 43:54.520
plugged in actual usage here so minutes used per month let's say 400 that's kind

43:54.520 --> 43:58.640
of that'd be very generous for me but let's say it's 400 text messages 500 I

43:58.640 --> 44:01.760
say that's probably about right megabytes use let's say this month I met

44:01.760 --> 44:05.160
you know I'm about three gigs so I'll just put three gigs in there now before

44:05.160 --> 44:07.480
I switch to ting my bill would have easily been a hundred and forty nine

44:07.480 --> 44:12.000
ninety nine before taxes one forty nine ninety nine US if I click calculate

44:12.000 --> 44:15.920
savings I can see that if I would switch to ting over a two-year period I would

44:15.920 --> 44:23.680
save $1,919 linux.ting.com go try out the savings calculator put your info in

44:23.680 --> 44:26.720
there and see how much you would save and see why switching to ting might just

44:26.720 --> 44:29.880
make a lot of sense for you plus no old customer service means when you got a

44:29.880 --> 44:33.040
problem they're gonna solve it for you they're awesome dashboard also means that

44:33.040 --> 44:35.920
if you want to take care of it yourself you can because their dashboard makes

44:35.920 --> 44:40.680
sense and yet it's extremely powerful linux.ting.com and a really big thank you

44:40.680 --> 44:48.360
to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged it was it was awesome having LTE down

44:48.360 --> 44:52.440
there okay so let's cover some of our first interviews this was this first

44:52.440 --> 44:56.200
one just something fun didn't quite fit into the show but one of my favorite

44:56.200 --> 45:01.160
booths at OSCON was the github booth yeah the github booth because they had

45:01.160 --> 45:06.120
an actual DJ and they weren't like crazy with the music it was it wasn't too loud

45:06.120 --> 45:08.840
but it was good like you knew when you were near the github booth because they

45:08.840 --> 45:12.080
had music going so I chatted with one of the guys from github I said okay why

45:12.080 --> 45:18.000
github and music so I noticed here that you have a very handsome looking DJ booth

45:18.000 --> 45:23.240
over here is github gonna be rocking music all day all day so tonight during

45:23.240 --> 45:26.000
the booth crawl you'll find us we're basically blowing the place out and

45:26.000 --> 45:29.160
we'll throw out the breaks and whatnot today yeah that's awesome so why github

45:29.160 --> 45:32.080
and music we have a lot of creative people at github you know that's one of

45:32.080 --> 45:36.880
the attributes we hire for so music is one of the parts of our culture we have

45:36.880 --> 45:42.800
a lot of code-based parties around the city and whatnot so yeah and it was it

45:42.800 --> 45:46.960
was pretty cool it was pretty neat to have it's the different take on every

45:46.960 --> 45:51.480
every booth that's major tries to do something interesting so we had to stop

45:51.480 --> 45:55.640
by the red hat booth and Ruth was there and Ruth has talked to Noah in the past

45:55.640 --> 45:58.960
in fact Ruth and Noah are like best buds like they just started catching how you

45:58.960 --> 46:02.200
doing Ruth oh I'm good Noah like they just started catching up like old pals

46:02.200 --> 46:07.880
so Noah talked to Ruth about piedora and all those goodies at OSCON we're here

46:07.880 --> 46:13.640
walking around at OSCON 2014 here in Portland Oregon and we ran into Ruth

46:13.640 --> 46:18.080
from the red hat project how are you Ruth I'm great how are you doing all

46:18.080 --> 46:22.360
right now Ruth I had the opportunity to hear you a couple months ago talk about

46:22.360 --> 46:26.520
the Raspberry Pi and all the interesting things I think you had a you had a suit

46:26.520 --> 46:30.680
that you had you had you had made you know it was all powered by Raspberry Pi

46:30.680 --> 46:33.320
now I understand that there are some major changes that have come out

46:33.320 --> 46:37.080
hardware-wise on the Raspberry Pi can you tell me a little bit about that yeah

46:37.080 --> 46:41.600
just last week they released the model B plus and the reason it's not model C is

46:41.600 --> 46:45.080
because it's still the same chip the same RAM and all of that but it has

46:45.080 --> 46:49.040
some significant improvements there are four USB ports now instead of just two

46:49.040 --> 46:52.440
the corners are rounded you know some easy things like that it's a nicer form

46:52.440 --> 46:56.680
factor the composite jack is gone the option is still there through the audio

46:56.680 --> 47:00.560
jack but it just kind of streamlines things the other significant changes

47:00.560 --> 47:04.800
they've switched it from an SD card to a micro SD card and the biggest thing

47:04.800 --> 47:09.280
about that for me is the SD card holder was plastic and if you depending on your

47:09.280 --> 47:12.800
case or what you were doing it had a tendency to break off and so the the new

47:12.800 --> 47:16.320
micro SD card holder is metal which is a really nice improvement that's

47:16.320 --> 47:19.760
outstanding now does that SD card does it still stick out a little bit or with

47:19.760 --> 47:22.840
micro SD is it completely encased it looks like I don't have one yet they've

47:22.840 --> 47:25.560
only been out for about a week and of course they pretty much instantly sold

47:25.560 --> 47:28.520
out they're getting easier to come by now but it looks like it's gonna be

47:28.520 --> 47:32.920
flush up in the system and not have that that piece sticking out yeah that's one

47:32.920 --> 47:35.160
thing that always bothered me particularly when you're trying to

47:35.160 --> 47:38.880
deploy a Raspberry Pi as an appliance base you know device where you don't

47:38.880 --> 47:41.840
want it to be so much hackery as you want it to be you know look more

47:41.840 --> 47:46.120
professional now on that note I wanted to ask what some people would say that

47:46.120 --> 47:49.200
the Raspberry Pi is really primarily meant as a learning tool and not really

47:49.200 --> 47:53.160
meant for anything remotely related to production even though many people are

47:53.160 --> 47:56.760
says the guy with Google Glass on his face using I think I even saw maybe a

47:56.760 --> 48:00.800
year ago or so somebody was using it in in in biomedical for a biomedical

48:00.800 --> 48:04.520
purpose so what what's your opinion I mean can the Raspberry Pi be used as a

48:04.520 --> 48:09.360
serious production tool the Raspberry Pi was designed for education that is its

48:09.360 --> 48:13.520
original intent it was inspired by the BBC micro which was a computer back in

48:13.520 --> 48:18.160
1981 that was designed for educational use but that said the reason we all love

48:18.160 --> 48:22.600
it is because it is so infinitely useful and the new model B plus has 40 GPIO

48:22.600 --> 48:27.000
instead of the old 26 you can do so many things with it and on top of that it's

48:27.000 --> 48:31.120
cheap and so it's not the fastest it's not the greatest there's so many other

48:31.120 --> 48:35.320
of these small boards but a lot of them are 80 or 90 dollars and the pie is 35

48:35.320 --> 48:38.640
dollars and that makes it infinitely useful and so if it meets the needs of

48:38.640 --> 48:42.560
those projects and sure it's perfectly sufficient for all sorts of things as

48:42.560 --> 48:46.280
long as you have the right power as long as you have the right power can you tell

48:46.280 --> 48:49.480
me so you've you've spent a lot of time looking and not only doing your own

48:49.480 --> 48:53.320
projects but looking at what other people have done with Raspberry Pis if I

48:53.320 --> 48:56.320
were to ask you what's the first coolest project that comes to mind what would

48:56.320 --> 49:01.560
you say I think my favorite is still the bilingual functional r2d2 that thing is

49:01.560 --> 49:04.560
so awesome and it's it's a year or two old now but it's still one of my

49:04.560 --> 49:07.600
favorite projects and I think part of it is that a guy made it for his

49:07.600 --> 49:11.480
girlfriend he decided to make this life-size functional takes commands in

49:11.480 --> 49:15.600
Japanese and English r2d2 and then she married him so clearly it was a

49:15.600 --> 49:21.240
successful project you you obviously you work for Red Hat and I understand that

49:21.240 --> 49:25.680
that Fedora has a distribution that runs on the Raspberry Pi is there anything

49:25.680 --> 49:28.720
you can tell me about Pi Dora specifically my favorite thing about

49:28.720 --> 49:32.120
Pi Dora and and I tell people obviously as I work for Red Hat and I work on

49:32.120 --> 49:36.400
Fedora a lot Fedora and Pi Dora are my preferred distributions but when you're

49:36.400 --> 49:39.560
working with the Raspberry Pi you should choose the distro that most suits your

49:39.560 --> 49:43.700
needs but my favorite thing about Pi Dora to that end is that so many of the

49:43.700 --> 49:48.400
fun hackery projects are headless if they they're too small they don't you

49:48.400 --> 49:51.520
know they run away from you they don't have a monitor attached and so my

49:51.520 --> 49:55.200
favorite fun Pi Dora fact is that you never have to connect it to a monitor at

49:55.200 --> 49:59.400
all if you add this little file when you flash the SD card you can have it flash

49:59.400 --> 50:02.440
the IP address out the LEDs and then it reads them out the speakers in a

50:02.440 --> 50:07.100
delightful British accent voice out the speakers huh yeah I knew about the

50:07.100 --> 50:10.280
lights I knew that the lights flash but I didn't know about the speakers now is

50:10.280 --> 50:14.080
that something that's something that that script is specific to Pi Dora I

50:14.080 --> 50:17.940
believe that you can't you can grab the files off of github and I think you

50:17.940 --> 50:21.900
could probably use it I've never tried using a distro why would I why would I

50:21.900 --> 50:26.280
use something besides right why why ever straight from Red Hat so people wanted

50:26.280 --> 50:30.560
to find out more about the Raspberry Pi or about your projects with the Raspberry

50:30.560 --> 50:36.200
Pi or about Pi Dora where could somebody go for Pi Dora you would go to Pi Dora

50:36.200 --> 50:40.960
PID ORA dot CA that is the site for Pi Dora for Raspberry Pi stuff Raspberry Pi

50:40.960 --> 50:44.840
dot org if you're interested in other Red Hat community projects besides Pi

50:44.840 --> 50:50.120
Dora herbicides fedora rather community dot Red Hat comm is our place for all of

50:50.120 --> 50:53.920
the Red Hat upstream community projects well thank you so much for taking time

50:53.920 --> 50:59.920
to speak with the truth Oh pi Dora that's cool that was a cool

50:59.920 --> 51:04.200
interview no I'd like to hearing about my door haven't followed that much the

51:04.200 --> 51:08.400
other interview that Noah managed to grab right on our second day right

51:08.400 --> 51:13.160
outside the opening of the Expo Hall and this is a little behind the scenes

51:13.160 --> 51:18.880
Simon's who Noah got to interview it was a great big thinker in the community

51:18.880 --> 51:25.440
Simon st. laureate he's Simon STL on Twitter he's senior editor at O'Reilly

51:25.440 --> 51:31.760
he's one of the chairpersons of OSCON and so Noah being like instinctually the

51:31.760 --> 51:35.480
great interviewer that he is is like I know what I'm gonna do we didn't even

51:35.480 --> 51:39.120
discuss it we were just on the same wavelength like we were just sharing the

51:39.120 --> 51:42.800
same brain wavelength Noah's like this is the chairman I'm gonna set this up as

51:42.800 --> 51:46.040
the opening interview we'll roll this as the first interview in the Linux action

51:46.040 --> 51:50.160
show it's gonna be great it'll be the setup and you'll hear Noah do a great

51:50.160 --> 51:53.640
job of setting it up as like we're here at OSCON and right outside the Expo Hall

51:53.640 --> 51:57.880
about to go in and right in the interview the guy kind of blows it and

51:57.880 --> 52:00.880
what I love is if you watch Noah's face you can see Noah's like god damn it I

52:00.880 --> 52:06.040
worked really hard on that all right so here is Simon st. laureate a great chat

52:06.040 --> 52:11.600
and a thinker welcome to OSCON 2014 we're here right outside the Expo Hall

52:11.600 --> 52:16.060
where many exciting things are about to happen outside here we have Simon who

52:16.060 --> 52:20.300
you are affiliated directly with O'Reilly the company that is putting on

52:20.300 --> 52:23.680
OSCON thank you so much for taking time to be here with us today how are you I'm

52:23.680 --> 52:27.920
great it's the show's about half over everything's going smoothly the pieces

52:27.920 --> 52:31.640
are coming together outstanding so tell me a little bit about what it is that

52:31.640 --> 52:35.840
you do for O'Reilly and what and I know this might be a loaded question but what

52:35.840 --> 52:39.960
exactly took to get OSCON to come together okay so most of what I do

52:39.960 --> 52:44.920
historically has been editorial so I've been an editor I started out bringing in

52:44.920 --> 52:49.600
books I focus on a couple of different areas but mostly these days it's web

52:49.600 --> 52:55.280
stuff I'm also co-chair of our fluent conference which is the web show I so I

52:55.280 --> 53:00.200
have two shows that fluent I have OSCON and then I'm also helping us figure out

53:00.200 --> 53:03.560
what stories we should be telling about the web whether it's in print or in

53:03.560 --> 53:11.360
conferences or online so that yes there are many things there OSCON is special

53:11.360 --> 53:16.240
for me and that it goes outside of my usual boundary zones this works really

53:16.240 --> 53:21.440
well that I have two co-chairs Sarah and Matthew make that much easier and we

53:21.440 --> 53:25.600
also are trying to connect things to more of the stuff we're doing internally so

53:25.600 --> 53:30.720
the web stuff I know really well this stuff beyond that I know less and less

53:30.720 --> 53:34.560
well but there are also pieces that make me really excited so we mix it up so

53:34.560 --> 53:38.760
tell me a little bit how the web connects to to to OSCON I mean I you

53:38.760 --> 53:42.160
know there's it's not it's not it's not necessarily live coverage of OSCON or

53:42.160 --> 53:46.340
anything like that right it's so the web the web is sort of the background in

53:46.340 --> 53:50.280
lots of the talks here people are doing you know Python this or PHP this and the

53:50.280 --> 53:54.200
result is a web app we have we have a track that does cover front-end stuff

53:54.200 --> 53:57.820
but it's a fairly small part of it because of the historic programming

53:57.820 --> 54:03.760
languages and the open source in general is really compatible with the web but

54:03.760 --> 54:07.760
you know a different thing so that it's sort of a piece of it we have a lot of

54:07.760 --> 54:12.240
we have a lot of things that are more specifically programming we also are

54:12.240 --> 54:17.080
starting to get really into the open hardware stuff and we're also there's a

54:17.080 --> 54:20.880
lot there's a lot that you can do at a conference that hasn't been done enough

54:20.880 --> 54:24.680
yet with like what we're calling geek lifestyle right now so you know

54:24.680 --> 54:28.400
combining these different pieces to look at the way we we live in a different way

54:28.400 --> 54:32.540
so I would consider myself in the truest sense the word to be a geek tell me a

54:32.540 --> 54:37.200
little bit about this geek like lifestyle it's it's varied year by year

54:37.200 --> 54:43.000
and it's a it's a very flexible category we it could be everything from home

54:43.000 --> 54:45.720
automation there was actually a great talk a few years ago on garden

54:45.720 --> 54:51.560
automation it involved like making sensors and then the the speaker was a

54:51.560 --> 54:55.200
Linux kernel developer so everything was in C++ and you know using that to

54:55.200 --> 55:00.280
control garden hoses you know it's become more normal I mean the nest

55:00.280 --> 55:03.640
obviously is doing a lot of these things and we're seeing these things happen

55:03.640 --> 55:11.000
it's still people at OSCON still tend to be a few years ahead of what's normal

55:11.000 --> 55:15.160
out there so we try to bring in as much of that as we can so and as I've walked

55:15.160 --> 55:17.920
around I've certainly seen a couple of those booths I mean they had the open

55:17.920 --> 55:21.200
hacker laptop you know it's absolutely fantastic and projects like that you

55:21.200 --> 55:24.760
know just it really just lights a spark in my eye right but one of the things

55:24.760 --> 55:27.720
that I guess I was a little disappointed with and maybe you can speak on is why

55:27.720 --> 55:32.220
at a at a conference that is primarily geared towards open source do we see so

55:32.220 --> 55:35.080
many closed source solutions we walk around about you know the operating

55:35.080 --> 55:38.120
systems that some of these people using are not open source operating systems

55:38.120 --> 55:41.800
I'm wondering why do you think that is and what can we do to change that so

55:41.800 --> 55:46.760
this is a lot harder of a question to ask than it sounds when Noah asked that

55:46.760 --> 55:49.440
question it almost seems natural but if you think about it this is one of the

55:49.440 --> 55:51.760
chairman of a convention we're saying hey we've noticed a lot of the people

55:51.760 --> 55:55.240
coming here are not necessarily practicing open source themselves in

55:55.240 --> 55:58.780
some regards and I want to touch on this more in a few minutes we have an

55:58.780 --> 56:01.920
interesting conversation I want to get into so listen to his answer and then

56:01.920 --> 56:04.840
keep that in mind as we go forward well there are a couple of different stories

56:04.840 --> 56:10.120
on that so one is that you know when Apple was first coming out with OS X it

56:10.120 --> 56:13.920
just it was they had an open source story at the core of it there still is

56:13.920 --> 56:16.480
an open source story at the core of it it's just become less and less of the

56:16.480 --> 56:22.080
story and that and the Unix tools gave developers a sense of hey I can do this

56:22.080 --> 56:27.320
yeah I'm shifting the other direction these days I'm running Linux at home I'm

56:27.320 --> 56:32.080
you know moving moving further and further away from that the other thing

56:32.080 --> 56:36.080
that's happened though less with Apple more with Microsoft is that I'm seeing

56:36.080 --> 56:41.000
the companies that used to be these completely closed systems opening up

56:41.000 --> 56:44.720
more and more and more of it so like Scott Hanselman gave a talk yesterday on

56:44.720 --> 56:49.580
like the Visual Studio ecosystem and how that was changing I was like really

56:49.580 --> 56:53.400
happily surprised to see that like Windows is actually like part of their

56:53.400 --> 56:57.320
open source story here not as much as I'd like but they're they're coming down

56:57.320 --> 57:00.720
the road with us finally that's a pretty good answer too and I something I

57:00.720 --> 57:04.960
noticed too is even companies like Microsoft are integrating a lot of open

57:04.960 --> 57:10.120
source services now and and making it more maybe it may be the right approach

57:10.120 --> 57:14.160
is making it more making their software more accommodating to play in that field

57:14.160 --> 57:17.880
so it was a pretty good answer so we'll continue on so I always look at those

57:17.880 --> 57:22.440
things it's like a wolf babysitting your child do we really trust do we really

57:22.440 --> 57:25.640
trust these companies that have been so wrapped up in proprietary closed source

57:25.640 --> 57:29.760
software do we really trust them even if they are willing to venture out into

57:29.760 --> 57:32.320
the open source world I mean is that really what we want to see or would we

57:32.320 --> 57:35.240
rather see like you were talking about before you know these these real

57:35.240 --> 57:39.280
grassroots hacker type projects where it's it's somebody doing something you

57:39.280 --> 57:42.440
know themselves I'm always gonna be happy with a grassroots hacker project

57:42.440 --> 57:48.120
unless it doesn't work but you know right the trust question is hard I mean

57:48.120 --> 57:52.880
for me like a lot of the sting I have a natural tendency to cheer for the

57:52.880 --> 57:58.440
underdog and when I see companies that are no longer in the powerful positions

57:58.440 --> 58:04.680
that they used to be and they're adapting open source I feel it's odd I

58:04.680 --> 58:09.880
feel sort of I it's not just that I'm happy that they're changing or happy

58:09.880 --> 58:13.520
that they've fallen it's that they're less powerful right and that makes me

58:13.520 --> 58:20.560
feel a little better that it's probably a nice wolf maybe yep once so much of it

58:20.560 --> 58:25.360
comes down to you know what people think they can get away with right and even

58:25.360 --> 58:30.720
the best companies these things can change suddenly when people change so as

58:30.720 --> 58:35.520
power gets a little better distributed in this system I think we're going to

58:35.520 --> 58:40.960
see more and more okay we don't have to control everything yeah well let's hope

58:40.960 --> 58:43.840
that the direction moves that way because that that would be a fantastic

58:43.840 --> 58:47.640
world I think that we'd all like to see walking around the Expo Hall you've been

58:47.640 --> 58:50.800
in there what what has been your favorite present or not presentation but

58:50.800 --> 58:54.240
what has been your favorite booth exhibit so far I'm really really fond of

58:54.240 --> 58:59.400
the hardware showcase I you know I do some soldering I do make some things but

58:59.400 --> 59:03.960
I've never made anything like what they're doing and the combination of

59:03.960 --> 59:10.220
open with things you can touch and play with and you know just having the

59:10.220 --> 59:15.520
creators there to explain what they're doing has really been the most exciting

59:15.520 --> 59:20.180
part easily for me yeah it really is and it's a fantastic conferences is there

59:20.180 --> 59:23.840
anyone is there any place that you would point people to or anyone you would

59:23.840 --> 59:27.760
point people to directly if they wanted to become involved with OSCON find it

59:27.760 --> 59:31.320
more information about OSCON or maybe a plea for people to join us here next

59:31.320 --> 59:35.520
year 2015 OSCON well we're just getting started on what OSCON 2015 will look

59:35.520 --> 59:40.480
like it'll be here we know that it'll be similar timing but the program you know

59:40.480 --> 59:43.720
we'd love to get input what did you love about OSCON what didn't you love about

59:43.720 --> 59:48.760
OSCON we're starting that conversation not quite tomorrow but pretty close to

59:48.760 --> 59:53.160
tomorrow so we're trying to get as much lead time into figuring out what the

59:53.160 --> 59:57.320
shape of OSCON should be before we start asking for specific proposals so by all

59:57.320 --> 01:00:03.680
means let us know oscon.com is the easy place to find us but you know to contact

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.080
me contact our co-chairs we're just happy to have the conversation about

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.760
what's working what more do you want perfect well thank you so much for

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.000
taking time to speak with us we really appreciate it great thank you very much

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
yeah really thank you very much to Simon for joining us it was a great chat and so

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.680
I he touched on a lot of stuff there that I want to kind of circle back on I

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.240
know heavens you had some thoughts on the sort of Microsoft going to all of

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.880
these Linux and open source conventions and really trying to have a presence

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.800
there what do you think it's about well considering Microsoft has been a little

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.720
bit more they're not so desktop focused anymore and more putting a lot of their

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:49.080
development and money into Azure and Azure is generally for the web so node

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.720
is one of the big things that they focus on for their Azure platform they've

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.760
finally tasted node and how the node package manager works and they've got

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.640
their own little new get package manager they're starting to build their own

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.480
software repo went in Windows inside Visual Studio to get all their package

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.320
updates library updates all that crap yeah they're tasting open source they're

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.160
like who I see what the hell they're why everyone's starting to like this it's

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.280
got good stuff yeah in fact just recently they moved their their

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.040
TypeScript development from their sort of isolated code plex website to

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.520
github which is um you know pretty yeah they were talking about that they were

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.040
talking about how they're how they're gonna be putting more stuff on github

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.640
now it is interesting we asked them and we said so how many people at Microsoft

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.560
work in the open site I think they call it the open source division and you know

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.680
before the Nokia acquisition Microsoft has a headcount I think of around 50,000

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:49.600
before the acquisition and she said a hundred a hundred people at Microsoft

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.480
are working on open source now but she did she did point out she emphasized

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.800
that it's because in a lot of ways they're using open source in different

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.760
areas throughout Microsoft now so where it used to be contained to a singular

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.200
group now more and more of the departments and divisions of Microsoft

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.040
are looking at how they can use it so it she's like that that hundred number

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.760
doesn't really quite equate to anything anymore but that's the group that's like

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.920
their core focus is you have a budget to go to these events demo you know

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.680
interface with communities that's that's what that core group does so it's kind

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.880
of it's kind of an interesting deal oh I we had an interview with Krista Bona in

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.160
the Linux action show last Sunday and he touched on pretty big interview and I

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.680
didn't see a lot of response from the community on some of the things that he

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.360
said so I wanted to pull out a couple of quotes and then bounce it around with

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.160
our virtual lug to get your opinion on it so the first thing that the bonus

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.480
said that I thought was it's obviously it's a Google way to look at it but I

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.840
want to ask you guys if perhaps the concept isn't potentially worth

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.840
considering he mentioned that the fragmentation that Android now faces is

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.240
simply a problem because winners have fragmentation and the reason why we

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.840
think it's a problem is because open source itself is used to losing here

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.440
I'll play it but yeah Android though it's just a whole different world I mean

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.160
the thing about the billion devices that's under mentioned at Google I own a

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.320
during his keynote that a lot of people sort of didn't parse was that he was

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.520
just talking about the devices that register with Google you know that's not

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.280
counting the hundreds of millions of other devices that ship and infractional

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.800
shares from China you know Chinese factories you know the Amazon Kindle

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.400
fire those things are all Android too right and it's like you know this is how

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.120
you know that Android is really open source this is how you know that

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.200
chromium is really open source because other people ship it right and we're not

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.680
going oh no you can't ship it you know because we're not that company we really

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.160
shipped it under a real open source license that people could use and it's

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.040
kind of cool you know now do you think that that providing that level of

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.160
freedom also provides the ability for companies to abuse it so for example

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.160
when I bought my Verizon Samsung phone I have a lot of Verizon apps I have a lot

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.440
of stuff I didn't really want on the phone that isn't really part of the

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.800
Android experience it just Verizon wanted that stuff on it and the and and

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.120
and the ability for those OEMs to modify that operating system could be seen as a

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.360
detraction for some users right yeah I guess I mean I hate to say it but that's

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.480
a problem winners have you know you know your platforms winning when you have

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.160
those kinds of problems fragmentation is a problem winners have and and I think

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.800
that open source was so used to losing losing the desktop losing this losing

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.800
that even though we had you know something done such a great job winning

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:37.960
in the server that you know feeling the win in a consumer market felt like

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.040
betrayal for some people okay so let's take that on is is is the Android

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.240
fragmentation simply a result of its popularity and is maybe the reason why

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.320
we react to it as a bad thing is because open source is so used to losing that's

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.720
a pretty that's a that's a pretty big concept so before we get into that I

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.360
want to thank our last sponsor this week and that is the awesome folks over a

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.600
digital ocean a digital ocean is rocking it these days you guys go over to

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.960
digital ocean right now because we've got a promo code for the month of July

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.440
and I would love to represent for Linux unplugged use the promo code unplugged

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.760
July when you check out and you'll get a $10 credit now what is digital ocean

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.040
digital ocean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.320
and easy way to spin up a cloud server and boy is that not the case they have a

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.840
brand new data center in London where some of the folks in our subreddit are

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.680
getting new cloud servers spun up in 21 seconds now what they're really gonna

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.760
say is look you can expect to have a cloud server spun up in 55 seconds

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.160
that's amazing and pricing plans start only five dollars a month for 512

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:43.480
megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of tier

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.040
one bandwidth and digital ocean is data center locations in New York San

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.640
Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London brand-new London their interface is so

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.760
simple and so intuitive the control panel really gives you the ability to

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.400
deploy a server in under a minute and have complete control over that it

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.200
doesn't feel like you have reduced functionality and the best part is they

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.560
have a straightforward API the power you just can replicate on their own on them

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.720
so you could have you could have an interface to the digital ocean droplet

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.400
system that is all through a bash script using their API deploying servers as you

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.880
need them scale up scale down using digital ocean infrastructure starting

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.520
only five dollars per month but when you use unplugged July you get the ten

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.160
dollar credit I've been talking to folks this morning about how they're setting

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.040
up own cloud 7 on a digital ocean droplet running Ubuntu 1404 and I'm

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.440
thinking I'm gonna do the same thing why not right five dollars I have my

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.520
dedicated droplet I can move it around I can back it up I can snapshot it I just

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.080
have it's it's so straightforward and that is so worth five dollars a month

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.440
for me there's other things you can use digital ocean for two that you might not

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.640
have thought of but because digital ocean has seen such incredible growth

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.320
specifically in the developer and Linux communities you're starting to see

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.440
awesome solutions built around digital ocean that are just sort of a result of

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.560
their success in fact here's rolling your own CDN build a three continent CDN

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:07.060
for $25 in one hour now this isn't necessarily a digital ocean thing but

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.840
this is a blog post that shows you by how using digital ocean engine X and

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.960
Docker you can set up your own CDN that does distribution content all over the

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.040
world now if you're a podcaster you know if you have a podcast right now and

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:23.760
you're serving up your mp3 files from a single web server stop it that's a bad

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.640
experience for your users it's bad it's just bad all around because every time

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.160
somebody's downloading that mp3 file that's hanging up one of your web server

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.480
sessions so it's not responding to serving up a web page and also makes the

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.820
download slow it's just inappropriate it makes you look unprofessional but for

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:43.040
$25 you could set up a worldwide CDN using digital ocean droplets your end

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.480
users get their podcast faster your web servers more responsive and during peak

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.720
download times you don't have that chugga lug that happens on your web

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.360
server and everybody's either loading web pages or downloading mp3s for $25

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.840

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.960
Linux unplugged show okay so let's uh let's kick it around to the mumble room

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.600
is is Android fragmentation simply a result of it being success I want to

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.540
start with you Noah since you were talking to the bone and what was going

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.600
through your head when he gave you that answer were you agreeing or were you

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:48.200
like this kind of sounds a little bit like spin okay so my problem with

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.600
Android I think it's I think it's one of your gripes too is that Android because

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:57.600
it was late to the game had to make compromises in their operating in what

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.760
they would have liked to have seen as an ideal user experience in order to cave

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.300
to what the carriers wanted and I think that makes for and yes it makes it much

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.640
more prolific than I'm sure that he says what does he say 85% or whatever of all

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.520
devices are running Android and that's great but it's a crappy Android

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.440
experience there's a lot of really crappy Android devices out there so I I kind of

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.080
think it's a crap answer he acknowledged to that it falls down when it comes to

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.440
the security aspect of it but the way so I want to take particular like I

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.880
actually kind of agree with it is a problem that winners have in the sense

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.840
that when you reach a certain mass adoption there's so many people are

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.640
going to start experimenting with your operating system or just going with it

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.800
like when I had a chat with Aaron Sigo about challenges of building the

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.280
Vivaldi tablet one of the thing he's one of the things that really stood out to

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.620
me that he said was when we talk to these manufacturers if we tell them it

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.520
needs to be Android compatible it clicks they know they know exactly what we want

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.520
to give us all the specs but when we tell them it needs to be Linux

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.160
compatible they have no idea what we're talking about right and so part of that

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.440
so you just see there's this adoption level that's through the entire stack

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.960
from people making software all the way down to the people assembling in it on

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.920
the manufacturing line so there's just this mass adoption level where Android

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.840
almost can't help but have all kinds of weird incarnations of it because it's

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.320
almost a de facto operating system it's like it has become one of the general

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.440
purpose platforms at least for low power devices so that part I agree with the

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.800
part that I take issue with is I don't agree that open source is used to losing

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.440
and he gave kind of a mention to well except for in the server but let's be

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.160
honest Apache crushes the competition nginx is rock-solid there is so much

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.520
open source technology that is winning Android itself is open source

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.620
technology that is winning so to say that open source is used to losing I

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.980
think that is a mischaracterization I think you could argue perhaps the

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:55.040
desktop is used to losing but to say open open source is not just used to

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.660
winning open source has won well yeah here's my perspective on it is when I

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.560
look at this and I've interviewed Chris before so I kind of get where his

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.440
mindsets coming from he's looking at it as if I walk up to Joe blow on the

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.160
street and say oh yeah you're really you're using an open source product

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.400
they're gonna look at you with a blank stare they have no idea what you're

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.200
talking about if you say Android or something they recognize then in fact

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.360
you've actually made that connection so I think he is talking about the desktop

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.760
and I also think he's also expanding on the the branding the recognition do

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.880
people understand that they're benefiting from this thing called open

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:34.080
source people don't I understand I agree if we're only talking about Linux

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.720
enthusiasts who critique Android but in reality it's not just Linux users who

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.040
critique some of these problems with Android but it's actually the entire

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.640
technology industry who really you know doesn't even follow the Linux desktop

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.200
necessarily so I don't know if that's influencing the way they see it I do

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.640
agree that you know maybe we're not used to seeing what success looks like in

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.920
some regards on the desktop I don't I think it's also how we define success I

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.640
mean I think geeks and casual folks definitely when it comes to technology

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.800
we just do we define success very differently I use my myself and my

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.240
mother-in-law as an example for her success in technology is when the

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.720
button she pushes on the remote works properly and for me it's when I saw this

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.920
amazingly complex problem that took a lot of work to do you know so usually I

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.880
think it just differs from person to person all right well I know the mumble

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.680
room has a couple other thoughts on that but I want to move on because here was

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.520
Chris's response to why fragmentations actually gives Android its edge and he

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.920
thinks yeah okay if we accept there's fragmentation I'm not even sure if it's

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.800
a problem and the thing is if you look at the the Verizon builds if you look at

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.480
the you know it's funny actually I I don't want to sound like I'm betraying

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.760
my people but I actually prefer the Moto X build to the stock Nexus build right

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.960
now because it has this really cool feature where you can shake it and take

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.000
a picture yeah you know so you don't have to worry about unlocking it in

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
other ways so I can whip it out of my pocket while shaking like you know look

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.800
I'm having a seizure but it's fine though and then I can take my picture

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.040
really fast and I really like that feature and I really like the the

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.640
Bluetooth trust feature in the Moto X and those are things that Motorola

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.720
brought to it and Motorola is not part of Google anymore so I'm not just

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:07.640
kissing corporate butt here and and I think that it's not wrong to try to

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.960
excel by adding new things to an operating system now I would hope I would

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.960
love if those are open source and brought back into the platform or they

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.320
were available through an app or whatever I can accept that so he's saying

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.720
you look sometimes the way you get some of these new innovations is by having

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.440
different people try stuff and don't we see that in just Linux distros itself

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.800
you know you look at things that have come through like different installers

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.680
where one distribution really lands on a good way to do an install and you see a

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.280
lot of other distributions pick that up or things like that so sometimes they're

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.840
in the fragmentation there can be sort of this organic slow evolution of a

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:49.080
consensus so that I can buy on to but he goes on to kind of say you know if you

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:55.000
think about it in some sense on he's he calls it open source but I really think

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.240
he means Linux when he's saying this he's like you guys are forking all day

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:01.560
long so you got to check yourself before you come all up on Android's territory

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.240
that's why I'm also pretty unimpressed by fragmentation arguments and that kind

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.760
of thing and I'm like you know what you know in the open source world everything

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.360
is a fork every time you ship a distribution every time you ship a

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.900
program you're forking it you're putting a moment in time and you're

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.960
sticking with that moment right until they upgrade again or until they app get

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:27.020
update or you're forking every time you do that so the measure of us as

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:31.560
programmers or as app developers or as carriers or handset manufacturers is how

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.840
we keep up with those updates how we keep bringing in the future of software

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:42.520
development to our users and and that's why Android's at 84% boom so he says hey

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.240
if you look at it this way when Ubuntu LTS 1404 ships that's a fork yeah I

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.800
think he's splitting hairs on that one I can't defend that one at all I disagree

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.680
I think that I see what he's saying but I and he is definitely including software

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.480
in addition to Linux distribution so he's kind of using the true open source

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.320
broad term but I disagree with him I think that he's wrong in stating that

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.220
merely by putting the open an open source license on a product that you've

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.280
instantly forked it because magically someone else is gonna come along and do

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.440
something else with it not necessarily hmm yeah he's messing up with

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.680
terminology a little bit same with how in programming we say that monads are

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.280
the most evil or they're really weird little named things and no one ever

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.200
likes to talk about them I kind of see his point to a sense though I've always

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.120
kind of felt like when you take I've always felt like maybe one of the

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:36.120
reasons rolling distributions make the most sense is because when you carve off

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.320
a stable Linux distribution you're introducing sort of a fake structure

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.280
where none inherently exists and this is something that just us humans do all the

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.960
time we always have to go in and create structure everywhere gotta set up a

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.720
system gotta gotta make sure we follow a process everywhere we go we got to

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.760
organize it and I feel like perhaps it's kind of like trying to set up a dam in a

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.320
river like you can hold back the water for a little bit but eventually it's

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.480
got to break through and whenever you stable snapshot something essentially

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.320
it's a race against time as it deviates further and further away and like if you

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.120
look at what Red Hat Enterprise Linux does is they literally have to back

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.080
port stuff from future fixes to the old stuff because they are in a sense

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.800
maintaining their own fork of the Linux kernel in Red Hat Linux and then all the

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.080
other stuff to Debian as well yeah all of them all of them yeah they really

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:25.320
actually fork but sometimes it's just a snapshot of time instead of a fork

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.720
see I think that's where you can play semantics is it a snapshot in time or is

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.000
it a genuine fork that's maintained for like ten years and that's where Red Hat

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.240
just gonna you also fit you also think about this way like for instance you know

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:42.600
he was talking about how fragmentation is a it shows how much success is a

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:48.520
winner Android yeah well one thing I was thinking was that's true to a certain

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.200
extent because if you look at Debian it's got to be the most forked yeah

01:16:53.200 --> 01:17:00.040
distribution on the planet yeah and it is the biggest in terms of packages so

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.880
and it's probably the biggest in terms of development as well I mean you've got

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:09.360
Ubuntu it's kind of a quasi fork of it and it's got all sorts of forks of its

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.920
own so it's yeah very true right yeah you know it's interesting it didn't it's

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.480
in the full interview but one of the other things he said that jumped out at

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.560
me as he said the way I look at all of this the way I look at Android on that

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.880
phone the way I look at Android on Noah's Google Glass and the Android

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.960
that's gonna be on your watch he this is the bone he says to me I see those as

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.120
different distributions those are different distros in my world that's an

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.560
interesting way I don't again I think you could play semantics there you're

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.720
redefining what it means but it's an interesting way to think about it now

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.560
the elephant in the room for Noah and I at least there was one there was one

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.520
topic of conversation our entire trip at OSCON that really sort of dominated

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.000
basically anytime we stopped to take a breather no and I would kind of turn to

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:03.000
each other and and talk about the unbelievable undescribable amount of

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.680
Macintosh laptops we saw at OSCON and yeah yeah and to give you an example

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.120
kind of funny when we were walking up to OSCON and there's to this hallway and

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.200
this hallway is lined with tables and chairs and every table and every chair

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.320
had at least one or two people working on a MacBook all facing us so as we

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:29.240
walked into OSCON we walked down this hallway that was end to end lined up

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:36.040
with Macs and that white glowing Apple logo as we walked into OSCON and I can't

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.520
put a I can't underscore this enough literally almost every computer there

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.680
was a Mac now there were for sure some PCs but most of those were like at the

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.440
registration booths provided by OSCON or like somebody's work Lenovo that they

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.760
brought with them to the booth but more often than not I mean Colonel Linux

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.640
jump in here with me right I mean it was unbelievable that the ratio right and so

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.680
here's and this is what I've been waiting the entire episode to dig in on

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.480
it I'm sure you're this is what this is what bothers me right so we have we went

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.340
to a convention that's called OSCON Oh the open source convention the place

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.080
where I'm supposed to be able to go as an open source user and feel like I'm at

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.440
home I'm at home with open source software and here is what here's what I

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.360
took away from the conference and it's a lot like like Linux con their mentality

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.960
is that Twitter was there for example Twitter uses I guess because they're at

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.720
OSCON they use open source software who cares who cares I don't care what

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.920
Twitter's using on the back end I cared ten years ago because I thought ten

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.960
years ago that if these big companies picked up Linux and adopted it and put a

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.960
bunch of money into it then it would eventually trickle down to the desktop

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.480
and as I see that not happening it infuriates well I think you're

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.440
conflating two things so let me back up I think think of OSCON a little bit like

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.080
this this is something I came to it's as much as for us the community to go see

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.720
how business is like the the end product of open source are these companies like

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.880
everything we talk about you go there and see the end results of how they

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.240
actually use it I think that's beneficial for the community itself to

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.240
see but you can flip that around to Noah like if you noticed when we talked to

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:17.040
some of these folks like we are also it's them reconnecting with the open

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.120
source community so I think it's by going to these events like OSCON that

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.920
they kind of connect back to the original roots that everything starts

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.160
from so I think it's a two-way street in that regard and I kind of tip my hat to

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.300
the OSCON folks but what I think you're the core thing you're getting at here is

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:35.000
essentially supposedly here's a bunch of people making money off of open source a

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.280
lot of developers were there a lot of people there from their profession and

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:44.240
they're all pretty much at least I would say a ratio of 20 to 1 using max and

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.880
probably a ratio of 7 to 10 using iPhones to Android devices and that's

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.800
being and that's being generous on the one side but and the thing that really

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.080
irks me is that these the companies that that benefit the most from the backs of

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:07.160
the community in open source then those people that are in the community are the

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.920
first to get shafted when when the when desktop clients come out for things like

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:17.880
Netflix or Google Drive right I just I feel like you should eat your own dog

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.440
food if you're going to come to a conference and talk about how everyone

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.640
should use free and open source software and open source is the best use it and

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.440
not just not just on your server and on your back end boot into it use it as a

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.600
desktop daily here's what I think the problem is is and it comes down to a

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.160
little bit of market dynamics so Apple just released their quarter quarterly

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:41.280
results a couple of days ago by Friday or something like that their Mac sales

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:49.000
grew 18% in the last quarter the rest of the entire PC industry is down 2% overall

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.760
Apple is up 18% and everybody else on all on average is down 2% they are seen

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.960
because honestly they're well-built machines I think they're seeing a huge

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.320
adoption curve right now and this is a trend I've noticed over the last seven

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.720
years as I've gone to these conferences it's more and more max and it started

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.680
with some max to now it's all max it's all max in the booth it's max and in the

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.440
users it's ridiculous and I think part of the problem is a lot of times in

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:21.000
professional uses people are using Linux on the server so all they really need is

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.440
an SSH session to that Linux box so they get a Mac because it's trouble-free it

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.120
runs Netflix it runs Photoshop it's got all the commercial software all the it

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.000
honestly has all the open source software too you put brew on a Mac now

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.880
you got a package manager Bob's your uncle you're installing stuff from the

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.280
command line then you SSH into your Linux box you do your development all

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.000
day long and sublime text yeah you're happy you go home and for them they just

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.840
buy this laptop it's got 10 hours of battery life it's fairly trouble-free

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.520
and it gives them SSH right out of the box I know it sounds trivial but I

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.800
really think that's what's selling these things and I think as a community what

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.680
we've got to do is nut up and I'm not using that sexually I mean in the terms

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.720
of like let's seriously come to a realization that our boat is sinking and

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.880
that these people are jumping ship to the Mac like crazy but the reality is

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:12.080
eventually they're gonna get bored they're gonna want something better but

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.280
we're not there when they're ready to jump Linux runs like but on these Mac

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.140
books these freaking Mac books are selling more than any other PC in the

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.120
industry right now and we can't manage to get Linux working on them oh you want

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.360
Thunderbolt go F yourself sorry oh you want a high HD a high DPI resolution

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.400
hey it kind of works on depending on which desktop you choose oh you want

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.040
thermal management sorry Apple has an SMC controller we can't do that we won't

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:38.720
we won't even bother like trying to reverse engineer it obviously it's not

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:44.440
an ideal solution but the problem is a huge huge number of our community is

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.560
buying these machines and we do not as Linux have a solution to make it great

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.060
out-of-the-box experience on these Mac books it's it's half-assed you got

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:57.920
trackpad problems after sleep you have no Ethernet support you've got crappy to

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.640
zero thermal management and it's still a pain in the ass to make it work in the

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.880
first place so what are we gonna do I think the problem is actually even

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.240
bigger than what you're talking about because that is assuming these people

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.280
want to come to Linux in the first place and the reality is I don't see a lot of

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.840
Mac OS users complaining about their Mac OS experience and wanting to come to

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.380
Linux and the the best way to get those people the best way to get those users

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.840
is right now while they're on Windows when they're looking for something to

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.960
jump off the instability and and and the bugginess of Windows that's the time to

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.720
get these users because once we lose them to the Mac it's gonna be twice as

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.160
hard three times as hard five times as hard to get them to come to Linux well

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.120
there as somebody who came from Mac as somebody who came from Mac I gotta say

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.520
what's going to might be the major driver is when they have to upgrade

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.920
their computer every two years just to keep current software I can't I had that

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.720
problem I was like I cannot spend that much money on computer hardware I'm

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.200
switching to Linux because I know that I'll future-proof my machines would be

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:01.600
you think the targets move right out from underneath us well I just listening

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.280
to your discussion it strikes me that you know a few years ago we might have

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.840
been having this discussion about people using Windows machines and now we're

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:14.080
talking about people running Mac OS 10 on Apple hardware so is is now the

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.440
principal target for Linux adoption the Apple Mac audience I feel like what Noah

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.000
was worried about will apply to probably the majority percentage of people who

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.280
switch however there will be still a large number let's just let's for fun

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.960
say 20% of people who switch that are technically inclined switch switch after

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.160
a year or two from Mac OS to Linux I don't think this is actually all that

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.800
unusual I've seen threads about coming from Mac to Linux because people get

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.160
bored after a while and I feel like when that happens and I for a lot of

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.800
technically inclined people who are intellectually curious I believe that

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.680
does you arrive to a point in Mac OS 10 without after that long of usage where

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.000
you've essentially mastered the operating system and if you realize

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
okay I'm now seeing the walls of the holodeck I would like a better program

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.200
than this and you go look for Linux and maybe you start as a dual boot and then

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.000
you could switch over if if we were there and ready to to supply this

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.760
hardware and I think what's at the end of the day what's selling is the Mac

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.480
book I think the Mac book air I mean Linus Torvalds use a Mac uses a Mac book

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.240
air for God's sakes right I think this is hardware no I think he still has one

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.400
yeah no he still uses him yeah he still has it I think he just has he just has

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.040
like more than one machine but he also has a pixel right so I mean he's got a

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.080
few machines but I guess what the point I'm trying to get at is I feel like the

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.880
target like wimpy said the target has moved and we are not responding we need

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.640
to be working like on better Thunderbolt support better hide high DPI support we

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.320
need to get you know we need to reverse engineer the SMC controller in

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.440
these Macs that way there's thermal management and then the battery life

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.600
will be better too and all of this stuff and it definitely set off like the the

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:01.360
red alert we we have a major problem and nobody's talking about it and I guess I

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.560
kind of also feel like until you go to one of these events and you see it for

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.200
yourself when you go to an event filled with your peer groups and none of them

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.840
are using Linux I mean it really it's one thing to hear about it through a

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.600
podcast it is another thing entirely to be standing there and seeing it and

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:25.840
realize oh man we have a huge problem well I would expand I think go ahead

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.800
Matt go ahead oh I was gonna say one thing I would expand on and this is

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.080
something with a wife that uses a OS 10 and actually uses a Mac that I

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.680
experienced is the number one reason why people use Macs and she and I bet

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.080
Angela probably attest to this as well is it's called Apple care it's not an

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.600
extended warranty we the logic board pops because Mac logic boards are crap

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:50.480
I'm sorry they are they're garbage and so but the user doesn't care because

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.200
they know they can go to the Mac store like we did it's under Apple care she

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.000
exchanges it they fixed the logic board didn't cost us anything took three days

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.640
and she never missed a beat she didn't the experience was completely seamless

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.840
her data was safe she didn't have to care the other that phrase right there

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.680
the other thing especially for folks who are not technically inclined is they

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.360
you know they really need a brand that they feel like well at least I know this

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.840
brand puts out quality at a certain level and I don't know I don't know

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.720
about RAM I don't know about megahertz I don't know about SSD but I know that

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.040
Apple is known for a certain kind of machine and if I'm willing to spend the

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.000
money I can get that and I think a lot more people are willing to spend the

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.240
money than we realize because a lot of these folks now are buying a machine and

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.640
they're using it for like five plus years so it's not a deal I mean I have

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.960
an old I mean I don't use it hardly but I have an old iMac that I'm running off

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.600
an external hard drive the point is as people are buying these things because

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.800
they understand the experience they don't give a flying crap if it runs on

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.200
hamsters they know what it does they understand it they're able to wrap their

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.320
brains around it max have now gained in global market share for 32 of the last

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.760
thirty three quarters in a row I'm not saying they're the largest machine but

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.000
I'm saying we're just ignoring them go ahead heavens no it's not even an

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.560
experience it's a company that people can blame or sue that is the backing

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.200
thing that will make most people or companies decide on what to use they

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:15.360
just want someone to blame no one wants to get like to have the X what the hell

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.760
the responsibility to need to own up to your own hardware that's why Apple or

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.120
that's why a lot of companies which sell a lot of software or OS's are good that

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.880
that's crap the reason they disagree the I completely disagree the point of it is

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.160
that people that value their time that aren't willing to are interested in

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.760
spending their time doing that maybe they're a chef an artist I don't know

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.840
maybe they make music whatever it is the point is is they don't want to geek out

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:43.080
they don't care they want that experience I've worked closely with

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.880
Chris Perillo he'll tell you the same thing he buys these machines because of

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:50.800
their experience he does he knows how the stuff works that he doesn't care you

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.560
know Chris Fisher for example runs it because it does certain tasks well I'm

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.520
not a Mac person I freaking hate them with a passion but I'm not I'm not naive

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.800
enough to think that it's this you know we look at it from a very technical

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.680
point of view and Joe average doesn't care right just don't give a rat well

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.440
what I'm finding though and what I guess struck a chord with me because I I

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.880
wholeheartedly agree with your assessment there Matt what what struck a chord with

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.640
me is now we're going to OS con and and also by the way I'm coming from like a

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.960
multi-year trend to this whole sure sure now we're going to like the geeks like

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.760
the people writing software the people that are creating server platforms and

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:29.600
you know like you go to rack space and rack space has the rack space cloud and

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.320
they're deploying bare metal servers with core OS and everybody there has a

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:41.360
MacBook yep I really don't see why that is an issue though I mean if they're

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.360
developing open source software software I could go out in the world and say even

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.840
if it's gpl3 and download and use I don't give two craps what they are using

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.480
on they could be developing on Windows 8 I don't think they care either yeah I

01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:01.480
think you nailed it of Apple most of the time it's like what you said before

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.400
there because someone is they just want the ecosystem I always explained or

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.440
tried to compare Apple to be this metaphor of being a stick or a steak in

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.440
the ground on a chain you're on this chain and in this bubble of happiness

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.960
that's Apple that's it's a nice environment it's a beautiful little

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.320
bubble everything is desired or given to you and you're very happy whenever you

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.520
want to get outside that bubble you're screwed you cannot leave that place I

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.760
think why and I like I think the point that hey at least these people are

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.680
making open source software is a valid one we should underscore that my point

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.480
is what I want to try to begin to push on to the community at least to think

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.880
about is if we want these people to someday switch because I would think I

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:47.840
mean I as a desktop Linux user really want more desktop Linux users because

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:51.400
I want more of what I need to do on Linux to be more available to me and I

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.920
want it more available to everybody I know kernel Linux feels the same way

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:58.200
very passionately more people using Linux is better for everybody and I just

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:02.200
want to win these MacBook users who are professionally technical and decide they

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.600
do want to try something else wouldn't it be amazing if we could make that

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.320
transition actually work because right now that MacBook in some ways is a

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:13.040
prison they're the only other direction they have that's even kind of halfway

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.560
supported is Windows and I think colonel Linux would actually agree with this

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.200
assessment and that the direction to get people to begin to use Linux starts with

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.960
the PC repair text when they come in with a broken Windows machine send them

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:30.640
out with a Linux install if give them the option say look you're doing this

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.480
this this and this nothing that can't be done on Linux give this a try let me

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.000
know how it works I'll go ahead and mirror your drive with it fixed if you

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.880
don't like it we'll put it back on but give this a shot that's where change

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.040
happens we could talk about it all day long but unless we're knocking on doors

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.800
or something you know and we've seen that way I see that on a daily basis

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.360
exactly what you're talking about Matt but what I just posted in the chat and

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:54.040
I'll reiterate it I would rather be running all software like Steam and

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.880
Netflix and all this proprietary stuff on my Linux box I would rather have that

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.160
flexibility then have the flexibility of running all open source programs but I

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.600
have to do it on a Mac right so I do care I do care what those developers are

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.880
using I do care what operating system they feel is most valuable and they

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.760
think the market owns if everyone has a Mac they're gonna write software that

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.440
works well on a Mac if they all right I think that's a completely closed-minded

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:25.880
mindset to be honest with you it is a good one though if everybody's using a

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.120
Mac and they're writing software then it's gonna work better on the Mac than

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.600
it does on your Linux desktop and that's a valid concern don't you think

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.400
Josh oh I always see them all around the place on most of the conferences I look

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.220
at ice watch tons of conferences and they all have Macbooks all over the

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.800
place well maybe apparently really good apparently we should be launching the

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.760
Macbook action show apparently based on the demographics that I'm saying but

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:55.280
stay tuned for future developments yeah go ahead but absorb on is that you know

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.560
let's instead of just talking in circles about it what do we do to fix this and

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.320
I was pointing out to know it's like Noah nailed it so it's like okay let's

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.000
introduce this to our customers let's introduce this to our family members

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.800
let's introduce this to people that might be interested before they take the

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:15.680
Mac bill you know what I mean yeah all right hey Noah I wanted to tell folks

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:18.640
maybe you could give us a little info there's this great place especially if

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.160
you're in the Grand Forks area called AltaSpeed.com where people could find out

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.960
all kinds information about Noah and his company in the services they provide so

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.200
check out AltaSpeed.com give them a look I've had the pleasure of working with

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.840
Noah out in the field I've seen how he works with his team as somebody who's

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.960
done IT contracting in the past I could tell you that I spotted a good one and

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.680
no one his team could definitely handle it AltaSpeed.com check them out they've

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.840
also got products available to buy there too all right the plug we go ahead I'm

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.400
just gonna say we run every technician that works for a company runs some form

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.880
of Linux every software piece every piece of software views runs on Linux

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.560
and that is the primary desktop we install for any customer that comes to

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:02.720
us with a PC problem yep and Noah's Noah's even like all right here's your

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.840
work machine this is Linux you feel free to break it I don't care if you break it

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.600
just have fun and if you break it we'll fix it together I like that yeah yeah

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.280
all right well let's wrap it up there I just a couple of a couple of bits and we

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.440
can maybe talk about this more in the post show too but on Sunday we're gonna

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.640
do a review of Crux Linux and I would love to also maybe enlist some of you

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.480
out there so mumble room stay tuned after the show we'll talk about this in

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.120
the post show about helping us do a review because on Tuesday's Linux

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:33.880
unplugged following Sunday's Linux action show the next upcoming episodes

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.400
on Tuesday we'll have a developer from Crux Linux join us so I'd like to get

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.520
the mumbles room thoughts on it so we can kick it around so tune in on Sunday

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.680
for last we'll do the review of Crux Linux we're also gonna have Frank on

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.920
from own cloud to talk about the new own cloud 7 they've just released and then

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.720
on Tuesday we'll do a community review of Crux Linux and talk to the developer

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.080
and we if you are interested if you're a Crux user or if you have questions about

01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:01.680
Crux go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com we're gonna have a Q&A thread up there

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.320
stick it probably right there at the top where you can ask your questions to the

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.920
Crux developer for Tuesday's show and if you're a Crux user I'd love to get your

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.760
insights or anything you recommend we try look for that thread or probably be

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.200
posted soon if it's not already linuxactionshow.reddit.com to get in on

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.120
the Crux action and last but not least a quick plug we'd love your feedback go

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.840
over to jupiterbroadcasting.com click that contact link and choose Linux

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.400
unplugged from the drop-down I know it's so confusing but it all makes sense

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.000
because what we have is an automated system where you can send in your

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.480
feedback our robots process it and they send us to it they send it to us humans

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.920
for reading right here on the air all right Matt all right well that's gonna

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.880
wrap us up today I want to say I'm gonna see you on Sunday go download Crux Matt

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.560
if you haven't already because get ready we're gonna do the action review I've

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:52.920
never tried Crux before never tried out yeah so I'll be curious to hear what you

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.040
think on Sunday so I'll see you on Sunday Matt all right see you then all

01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.280
right everyone well thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.320
unplugged don't forget you can join us live on a Tuesday go over to

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.480
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get the show times jblive.tv is where

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.320
you'll find the in bed for the chat room you can also get the mumble info there

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.440
if you'd like to join our virtual log all right everyone thanks so much for

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.200
joining this week's episode of Linux unplugged we'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:37:41.440 --> 01:38:04.000
the show cannot prosper if people listening don't tell other people about

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.880
it I think part of the problem is that people mistake Jupiter broadcasting as

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:15.120
passive entertainment that's incorrect this is active participation you are

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.560
encouraged and in some ways like gently encouraged with a poker to get involved

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.960
share content ask questions disagree agree share ideas and just yak in

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.800
general do something well and I guess I kind of feel like I don't know because

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.640
people see some sponsors they assume oh well they've got plenty of money they

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.960
don't need my help and it really was like yes spread the word tell people

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.160
about it help us grow I mean I mean I'm not you know at the end of the day we

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.840
still make great content that's what matters but I was just a little

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.280
disappointed because we do need to help really bad it's not like you know some

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.000
PR yeah we need some PR help you know there's the patreon page patreon.com

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.320
slash today there's funding there to help cover costs like this anything

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.280
resharing it helps all that kind of stuff being here live you know I

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.600
appreciate everybody who shows up live that's really great to get there get the

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.560
instant feedback and stuff like that too so and the mumble room you know all this

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.360
stuff is incredibly helpful so I'm very very very grateful in so many so many

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.800
ways in so many ways I just kind of felt like this last week we went above and

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.640
beyond and it kind of fell flat and I felt bad I take it very personally you

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.840
know because I follow this stuff very closely what do we think of the new

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.960
final Mozilla CEO Chris Beard the man doesn't have a beard but he's got a

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.920
great last name he's been the Mozilla project since before what Firefox 1.0

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.120
shipped he seems to have worked in almost every aspect of the project it

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:33.560
seems to be a good change right well I think my number one positive on this is

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:38.360
that finally you know your facial hair has gotten a job that's fantastic you

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:41.120
know because I think that's been overdue no I know all seriousness I think I think

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.880
he sounds like a good candidate I think he could potentially be a performer

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.000
that's why we're the show that has a beard knows how to use it that's right

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.740
in a way I'm unhappy that someone even needed to fill in for the CEO Brendan

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:57.200
Ike was fucking awesome he was a really great guy Chris Beard was the interim

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.680
CEO during this whole mix-up too so he he's kind of was already doing the job

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:08.320
yeah as long as someone's took took the helm yeah take take the helm as it is

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.760
that's it you know fresh blood yeah all right let's go see what our title is and

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:22.160
then we'll get out of here well we'll get what's the guy's qualifications

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.840
compared to Brendan like I mean obviously he didn't invent JavaScript but

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:35.920
yeah I mean like server script and server I think about hex code in my head

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.640
you know as in the binary and backtrack doing the bug the debugging that's what

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.320
gave him the idea to make a tracing JIT compiler I am backtracking through hex

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.120
I am or you know just look through on the cover his qualifications in today's

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.440
tech talk today he does have some good qualifications so that would be one to

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.280
watch if you want to
