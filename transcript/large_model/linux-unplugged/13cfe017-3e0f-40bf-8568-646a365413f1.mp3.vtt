WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
I wouldn't want to judge you for using Outlook, Wes, but rumor has it you have a little Outlook

00:04.960 --> 00:05.960
rant for us.

00:05.960 --> 00:06.960
A little pre-show Outlook.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.600
It was just a weird experience.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.000
Yeah, at work we have Outlook 365, and honestly it's fine.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.640
It works with Linux, obviously, because it's a web client.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.720
It meets my needs.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.720
And they pay for it.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.720
How practical of you.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.720
Yeah.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.040
Not what I would set up for myself at home, but I don't have to.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.560
I was trying to send a SQL dump, right?

00:26.560 --> 00:31.080
So I gzipped it to save space, getting ready to email it, send it off.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.880
A couple hours later I get a, you know, come back and say, hey, could you send that again?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.880
This looks like a binary data file.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.320
And I was like, all right, maybe I made a mistake.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.480
I know how gzip works.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.720
So I didn't think so.

00:40.720 --> 00:45.700
It turns out anything with a.gz extension, Outlook gzips.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.440
Like it will just, so it was a doubly gzipped file.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.280
Why would you do it on something that has a.gz?

00:51.280 --> 00:52.440
I don't know.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.400
So I tried with.xz,.bz2.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
Like none of those.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
Doesn't touch them.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.520
Doesn't touch zip files, but it wasn't even after sending it, all I had to do was attach

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
it.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.960
So like once it uploaded through the browser, it even was to the point where if you, if

01:05.960 --> 01:11.200
I made a tar and I named it tar.gz, just change the file name and then upload it, it would

01:11.200 --> 01:13.800
then decompress it for me.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.800
And it doesn't add an extra gz.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
No.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
So that was just bizarre.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.080
And it took me way too long to figure out what was going on.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.640
I was like, why can't I send this guy a file?

01:21.640 --> 01:24.760
And then how was it, how was the checksum different after all I did was upload it to

01:24.760 --> 01:25.760
them?

01:25.760 --> 01:30.400
I don't know if it's a consequence of them trying to do virus scans or just a bug on

01:30.400 --> 01:31.400
their end.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.400
Hey, you know what?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.400
Notify them about it.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.120
You got to make sure that those PST files don't get too big, Wes.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.120
That's true.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.120
We got a pixel 2 leak.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
This is funny.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.280
Did the doorbell ring or did I just imagine that?

01:41.280 --> 01:46.440
No that, well, I am pulling the case out of the box and I accidentally punched myself

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
in the nose.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
Oh my God, Ben.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.440
Oh my God.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.320
That's not great.

01:52.320 --> 02:09.440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 215 for September 19th, 2017.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show, or at least part of it's getting

02:13.000 --> 02:15.240
ready to ship out to New York.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
My name is Chris.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.240
My name is Wes.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.240
Hello, Wes.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.240
Hello, sir.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.760
And as always these days, it's the beard, what's up beard?

02:22.760 --> 02:23.760
Not much.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
Good.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
Good.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
I'm glad because you know what?

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
I got a little podcast I need you to help me with right now.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.760
That would be great.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.760
I'm down.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.760
All right.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
Well, we've got a great show coming up on this week's episode.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.600
We're going to cover some community news that I figure we should talk about.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.120
That's what we'll do at the top of the show.

02:37.120 --> 02:41.040
Then just a little bit into the show, we have a special guest joining us from the newly

02:41.040 --> 02:43.540
announced PipeWire project.

02:43.540 --> 02:48.840
Very excited to jump into this project, explain what it's about, clear up some misconceptions

02:48.840 --> 02:53.680
and hopefully get to the bottom of why Linux needs a little something like this.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.160
Then I hope you'll stick with me to the end of the show because I got something I got

02:58.160 --> 02:59.720
to get off my chest.

02:59.720 --> 03:03.640
It is an issue that is near and dear to my heart.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.960
It's not really unfamiliar to some of you on this show.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.640
I hope you'll stick around because it's something that's super important I want to talk to you

03:08.640 --> 03:09.640
about.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.160
And I think it has major ramifications for the entire open source community.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.240
So we'll dig into that towards the end of the show.

03:17.240 --> 03:22.200
But before we can do any of that, there's one ritual in which we must always follow.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.160
And that is saying hello to our virtual log.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.960
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
Hey babe.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Good day.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
Hey there.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.960
Hello guys.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Hello.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Hello.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
Look at that.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
You guys all came to say goodbye to me.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.960
You guys all come leaving right after the show and they all knew that they knew that

03:36.960 --> 03:40.280
they're going to storm the studio try to take over and then I'm driving to see poppy.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
That's my plan.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.960
That's really why I'm going because poppy is going to be there.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.960
There's some others.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.960
Big draw.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
There's some other people there.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.760
I mean, I heard Ike is going so I almost considered not going obviously, of course, but stay in

03:49.760 --> 03:50.760
North Dakota.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.760
Yeah.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
Is that why you're bringing Noah's insurance?

03:52.760 --> 03:53.760
Yeah.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
Well, I got to have my muscle.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.480
You know, I heard Ike wants to throw things at me from windows.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
So I got to be ready.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
I got to be.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.000
I'll admit I'm fairly jealous.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm looking forward to it.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.680
Anyways, let's let's get into some of the news today.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.420
I think this first story is pretty big for a lot of us more and more so for me these

04:09.420 --> 04:12.360
days because I found myself on public Wi-Fi a lot.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.840
Core has a new release that I think is pretty interesting and it is specifically version

04:16.840 --> 04:21.360
3.2.1 alpha with support for the next generation onion services.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.440
This is, I think, inspired after some recent trouble that they've had.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.760
It uses the new version three of the onion service protocol and it adds a new circuit

04:29.760 --> 04:30.760
scheduler.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.480
Hey, that sounds good.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
It does sound good.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.180
That's like that sounds good for more responsive forwarding decisions from relays, which also

04:37.180 --> 04:38.540
seems like a great thing.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.800
There's a bunch of other changes in here, too.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.480
I'm actually just telling you just the super, super highlights of it.

04:43.480 --> 04:49.080
They have new major features that I can only barely understand, but it's called the kernel

04:49.080 --> 04:51.280
informed socket transport.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.520
Yeah.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.520
How about that?

04:53.520 --> 04:54.800
It's available on Linux system.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.120
It uses feedback from the kernel to prevent the kernel's TCP buffers from growing too

04:59.120 --> 05:00.120
full.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.120
Oh, nice.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.120
Okay.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
Yeah.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.520
Which I would imagine probably has big improvements for Tor network speeds.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.520
Yeah.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.960
So that's the new version 3.2.1 alpha.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
That's a great step in there.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Yeah.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
Yeah.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Are you much of a Tor user?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.360
I feel like I'm a criminal when I'm on Tor, but I've been thinking more and more about

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
it.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.200
I've been using a VPN a lot these days.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Using that.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
I have certain...

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
I don't use it a lot currently.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.720
I have certainly used it in the past and I'm glad it exists and glad that they're making

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
good progress.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.920
I'm sure, Beard, when you're hanging out on the dark web, you're probably using the Tor

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
as well.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
Yeah.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
All the time.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.920
Yeah.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.920
Yeah.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
I'm only on the dark web.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
Yeah.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.920
That's...

05:35.920 --> 05:36.920
Yeah, exactly.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
I mean, I guess you stream on the regular P web, but you just...

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
Because that's where the eyeballs are.

05:38.920 --> 05:39.920
Yeah.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
I use dark Twitch.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
Oh, dark Twitch.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.920
Gotcha.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.920
Dark Twitch.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
Good, good, good.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
It's got a lot of illegal things on it.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
Yeah.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
It's far more interesting than regular Twitch.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.520
Well, when you're using your dark web, you can also use Keybase teams to kick Slack in

05:51.520 --> 05:52.520
the balls.

05:52.520 --> 05:59.480
It is a new app to replace Slack and it uses their famed security and encryption by default.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.160
It's got channels like Slack or your Discord out there.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.960
It's end-to-end encrypted, which means you don't have to worry about their server reading

06:05.960 --> 06:07.640
it, they say.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.760
And you can lay awake at night fearing the breach of your company.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.360
You don't have to lay awake, I guess.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.980
They say that's either use their system or lay awake at night.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.080
That's pretty hyperbole.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.580
But anyways, they say Keybase accounts are simpler.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.760
You don't have to switch at the top level of an app.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.320
Teams can be casual and small.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
Nice.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.720
That is kind of a cool idea.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.960
It's quaint how we try to do this.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.000
I mean, good luck to...

06:29.000 --> 06:33.320
I like Keybase.io, respect the people over there.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.560
Good luck to you.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.320
Good luck to you.

06:36.320 --> 06:42.380
Looking in the good footsteps of Skype competitors and Facebook competitors and everyone who

06:42.380 --> 06:46.720
likes to launch an alternative to a platform, Goliath, I say, good luck to you.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
I think...

06:47.720 --> 06:54.480
You know what I've been saying, gosh, Rocket Chat and Matrix, and just not enough.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
Not enough.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
It matters most.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
Yeah.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
Not enough.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
Not enough.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.400
And Nextcloud is also kind of squaring in on this, too.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.760
And not enough.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.560
And I'm glad the guys at Keybase recognized this need as well that none of us had and

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
decided to set up a...

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
Set up a affiliate.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
Now...

07:12.560 --> 07:15.960
It's not like we also had a specific one from Amazon or anything.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
No.

07:16.960 --> 07:17.960
This is not enough.

07:17.960 --> 07:18.960
Just not enough.

07:18.960 --> 07:19.960
So that's good.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
And I hope them...

07:20.960 --> 07:22.880
I wish for them the best because it seems like they're a great team over there.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.300
And if nothing else, I'd rest a little more comfortable thinking open source projects use

07:27.300 --> 07:32.160
something like this or at least your Isises and your Alcataz.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
This would be nice for them.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.220
Oh, yeah.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.080
I like the no upsell about message history.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
That's...

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
Yeah.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
That makes it nice for me.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
That is nice.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
That is nice.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.360
And you know, as your terrorist cells have to migrate off of Telegram, they got to go

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
to something else.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
They got to go to something.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.520
Governments got to lean on something new.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.160
So I think this makes a lot of sense.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.600
And you can find out more at Keybase.io slash blog, and we will have a link in the show

07:52.600 --> 07:53.600
notes.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.880
I want to talk about something serious that happened yesterday, September 18th, 2017.

07:58.880 --> 08:04.120
And it was the EFF formally resigning from the W3C.

08:04.120 --> 08:09.960
And now the W3C is the, quote, unquote, standards body that has standardized the recent encryption

08:09.960 --> 08:13.040
media extensions that all browsers happily lapped up.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.960
Well, I guess not all.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.280
And as you can imagine, Cory Doctorow and his colleagues at the EFF were very disappointed

08:21.280 --> 08:22.920
and they challenged this decision.

08:22.920 --> 08:27.080
There's a lot of controversy about how that challenge was handled.

08:27.080 --> 08:32.960
And now that things have run their course as a result of the way things have ended up

08:32.960 --> 08:39.960
on behalf of the EFF, Cory Doctorow has resigned from the W3C and has also publicly said here

08:39.960 --> 08:45.000
in his post that they will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle

08:45.000 --> 08:48.280
on defects in EME implementations.

08:48.280 --> 08:55.400
In other words, the EFF is publicly stating they will defend people who try to crack EME.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.640
This is a really complex issue because you have what are the expectations of what the

09:00.640 --> 09:06.800
W3C actually is expected to do in this day and age, especially the way browsers are actually

09:06.800 --> 09:09.200
developed and the reality of the actual market.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.600
What were the EFF's expectations?

09:12.600 --> 09:15.360
And you could debate EME as a topic itself.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
Right.

09:16.360 --> 09:23.260
Then there's a separate tertiary debate on how the W3C handled the challenge to this

09:23.260 --> 09:24.480
entire thing.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.280
So this is a deeply complex issue.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.360
And as usual the dialogue is just mostly consisted of people shouting at each other so far and

09:31.360 --> 09:32.360
making rage quit posts.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.880
I thought that's how arguments work, Chris.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.880
Don't you know?

09:34.880 --> 09:35.880
That's how you get to the bottom of everything.

09:35.880 --> 09:40.760
Now I will give Cory Doctorow, the man writes, the best rage quit post of them.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.840
This is an example for the internet on how to write an eloquent rage quit.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
Really well done.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.600
I'll keep that in my back pocket for the future.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.520
Definitely gives the umplexed dab of approval there.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.200
So that was a big movement story that we're following here and I think it's one of those

09:56.200 --> 09:58.880
where we have to wait for a lot of the hype to settle too.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
Yes.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.080
Speaking of hype, speaking of hype, let's see, we're going right through the news because

10:03.080 --> 10:05.200
I'm very, you can tell I'm excited to talk about pipeline.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
Oh yeah.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.560
So we're just busting through this stuff.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.480
1804, speaking of hype, Ubuntu 1804.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.480
You're ready.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
You're ready already.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
Oh my body's super ready.

10:15.480 --> 10:20.600
And as you know, Popeye's good buddy Dustin Kirkland was out scouring the web to get

10:20.600 --> 10:24.880
users feedback on what default application should be in 1804.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.200
In fact, here's from the horse's mouth.

10:27.200 --> 10:32.320
We asked the community across three different forums, when I posted the previous thread

10:32.320 --> 10:38.840
about what do you want to see in 1710 to Hacker News, I immediately got emails from the editors

10:38.840 --> 10:44.640
of both Reddit and Slashdot saying, you know, our users want to contribute to this thread

10:44.640 --> 10:45.640
as well.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.800
And so I said in the future we'd certainly make this, we'd open up the feedback to Reddit

10:50.800 --> 10:52.420
and Slashdot.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.920
And so we posted this in July and it was a coordinated effort as opposed to the first

10:55.920 --> 10:59.620
one, which was something that we just sort of shot from the hip.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.360
This was one that we put together.

11:01.360 --> 11:07.120
I worked with Will Cook, who's the desktop manager at Canonical and some of his team

11:07.120 --> 11:12.320
to put together what amounted to a survey for the desktop apps.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.120
What desktop apps do you use on Ubuntu?

11:16.120 --> 11:20.240
Out of curiosity, did anyone here contribute to that survey?

11:20.240 --> 11:25.080
So Dustin goes on to provide some of the data that people suggested for default applications

11:25.080 --> 11:32.100
in 1804 and you might be shocked, I say shocked at the conclusion.

11:32.100 --> 11:36.760
Desktop users like to use the same old boring crap that they've always liked to use.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.920
It seems overwhelmingly the data revealed that people would like to see Firefox as the

11:39.920 --> 11:45.380
default web browser, Thunderbird is the default email client, VLC is the default video and

11:45.380 --> 11:50.320
music player, LibreOffice is the default office suite, geedit as the default text editor,

11:50.320 --> 11:52.760
and Nautilus as the default file manager.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.120
Everybody shocked because they also would like to see Gnome Terminal as the terminal

11:55.120 --> 12:01.320
emulator, GIMP is the image editor, Pigeon is the chat messenger, Gnome Calendar, etc.

12:01.320 --> 12:07.140
Now, not too surprising, I was a little disappointed in the VLC on this whole list and Thunderbird

12:07.140 --> 12:11.600
a bit, but VLC mostly because it feels like a list of people that are stuck in the mud.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.360
Sorry, but Gnome MPV clearly better.

12:13.360 --> 12:18.400
Anyways, moving on from that, perhaps realizing that the vast majority of people taking the

12:18.400 --> 12:20.200
survey had no taste.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
I'm totally kidding.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
I'm teasing.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
VLC is great.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
I use it.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
I mean, it's totally fine.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.880
Yeah, I use it as well, but it's kind of frustrating that we can't have something you might love

12:28.880 --> 12:29.880
and share some respect.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.640
I would prefer to have Chrome.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.260
I would prefer to have Gnome MPV.

12:33.260 --> 12:37.720
But Gnome MPV seems like an even stronger argument to me because we should also be excited

12:37.720 --> 12:42.560
and we don't want to hype and we want to still love on VLC, but there's a cool new open source

12:42.560 --> 12:45.980
option that maybe people aren't hearing about or don't consider.

12:45.980 --> 12:49.640
So to this end, this means Dustin says that they are investigating a potential approach

12:49.640 --> 12:53.480
to make Ubuntu desktop experience perhaps a little bit more like choose your own adventure

12:53.480 --> 12:57.020
where you could plug in the different applications you want.

12:57.020 --> 13:01.700
That's pretty probably out there, but it is something they're considering is maybe in

13:01.700 --> 13:09.480
the future you'll just plug in Gnome MPV and plug in Vim and Emacs for all the things.

13:09.480 --> 13:14.360
Poppy, you were sitting in the room there, I saw your magnificent head a few times.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.160
Is there anything, any takeaways from that talk that Dustin had that you wanted to share

13:17.160 --> 13:18.160
with the class?

13:18.160 --> 13:22.820
Yeah, I think one of the things you've got to be aware of is a lot of people don't actually

13:22.820 --> 13:25.480
use desktop email clients or desktop music players.

13:25.480 --> 13:29.840
A lot of people use the cloud for their calendar and everything.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.160
So I mean, the graph was a long tale.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.800
He showed graphs of how many people responded to each of those categories.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.680
And yeah, sure enough, Thunderbird was on the far left hand side and a very tall graph.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.680
But there are a ton of people who just wrote Google or Google Calendar because their calendaring

13:43.680 --> 13:46.760
is synced to their phone and is done in the browser.

13:46.760 --> 13:52.400
And similarly, there are a bunch of people who use Spotify for their music or Pandora

13:52.400 --> 13:55.680
or something else.

13:55.680 --> 14:03.680
There's a significantly sized trend of people who just don't use desktop applications for

14:03.680 --> 14:08.760
doing their daily stuff and the vast majority of it is done in the browser.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
Look at a Chromebook.

14:09.760 --> 14:13.080
The vast majority of people who use Chromebooks are perfectly happy and can listen to music

14:13.080 --> 14:14.840
and can look at their calendar.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.880
They just don't use big fat applications to do it.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.200
Yeah, I did notice that.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
There was a very long tale.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.680
Just about everything you could imagine or name was on there to some degree.

14:25.680 --> 14:31.540
And to your point about GNOME MPV, I think a sizable proportion of the open source community

14:31.540 --> 14:39.000
had no idea that exists, like VLC is in everyone's head, the stupid little icon that everybody

14:39.000 --> 14:44.120
recognizes that everyone has fondness at Christmas when it's got snow and a hat on it.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.160
That's what GNOME MPV needs to compete and really take over.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.160
Right.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
Yeah, that's what you need.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.920
You need a comedy icon is what you need for your application.

14:50.920 --> 14:55.580
But I think a significant people just don't know GNOME MPV exists and don't realize that

14:55.580 --> 15:00.640
it may or may not be better than VLC because VLC for many years has been the go to application

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
for that.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
Yeah.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.920
And if you're coming from Windows, too, it's much more likely to be something used on Windows.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
It's probably easy.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.920
Oh, shoot, great.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
It's got VLC.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.920
Woo.

15:10.920 --> 15:19.120
My favorite was the guy who replied for every single application category, Emacs, except

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
text editor.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.040
Vim is for the text editor, yeah.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.600
One of the things that was actually just side note, too, really kind of interesting is not

15:28.600 --> 15:35.400
only was it obvious a lot of people were doing software as a service, but Rhythmbox was surprisingly

15:35.400 --> 15:37.600
well represented in the data, which-

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
Interesting.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.080
Yeah, that surprised me a little bit, but I'm trying to...

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
There was one pop-in.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.360
You might remember what it was where, oh, it was VLC actually, wasn't it?

15:46.360 --> 15:51.120
Nobody was really using Totem, even though Totem was the default out of the box in Ubuntu

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
desktop.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.040
Most people switched to VLC, which was sort of an unusual trend.

15:55.040 --> 16:00.920
Yeah, I think there's a sizable number of people who just default to VLC, and that's

16:00.920 --> 16:03.440
just what they use.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.560
But also, we've tried to make Totem so that it can play anything.

16:07.560 --> 16:13.920
I know the upstream developers and the people on GStreamer and Upstream Gnome have all tried

16:13.920 --> 16:17.800
to make it as slick as possible that when Totem can't play something, it does the right

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
thing.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.600
It goes and gets the right codec package or whatever, and it should.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.440
But sometimes that fails, and people have got it ingrained in their head that when Totem

16:26.440 --> 16:27.440
fails, I install VLC.

16:27.440 --> 16:33.480
And I think it's got to the point where people preemptively install VLC just to avoid having

16:33.480 --> 16:34.480
that situation.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
It works.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
Yeah, yeah.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.360
VLC, MPV, I have the codecs built in automatically and you don't have to worry about it.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.360
I haven't actually tried Totem in a couple of years solely because every time I tried

16:44.360 --> 16:45.920
it, it was like, hey, you want to install this thing?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.400
No, I'll just install another application.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Yeah.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.400
That whole thing, years and years ago, I remember when I used to run Windows before Linux came

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
along.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.200
There was all these little special packages of codecs that you would install and you'd

16:58.200 --> 17:01.040
get these codec packs from here and a codec pack from there.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.760
And then when I moved to Linux, there was still like, oh, you got to go and get this

17:04.760 --> 17:08.840
codec pack and you got to get I just never do any of that anymore.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.520
It's just not a thing.

17:10.520 --> 17:15.780
And I'm frankly surprised that people still consider the fact that one distro ships codecs

17:15.780 --> 17:21.440
over another one that doesn't is still a thing as well, because, you know, I just never install

17:21.440 --> 17:22.440
it.

17:22.440 --> 17:28.680
And I, you know, view some ropey, dodgy MP4 and strangely encoded stuff all over the place

17:28.680 --> 17:30.160
and it all just works.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.560
So maybe that's a solved problem.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.560
I think it is.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.840
We should certainly be grateful anyway.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.600
The whole talk's pretty good.

17:36.600 --> 17:43.120
It's a little like a little bit of getting inside the head of the semi silent majority

17:43.120 --> 17:44.400
that runs Linux.

17:44.400 --> 17:49.160
It's not like the total silent majority because they obviously fill out the survey.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.720
But it was over 10,000 respondents across multiple sites.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.440
It was a huge one of the number one threads on Hacker News for a long time.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.480
So you got quite a bit of data.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.640
They did some language processing against it, did a lot of reading.

17:59.640 --> 18:03.200
And Dustin just does like a high level overview of what some of the team has pulled out.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.460
And that video is embedded in the show notes.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.000
If you'd like to watch the whole thing and get inside the head of the average Linux user

18:09.000 --> 18:13.360
or quote unquote, I don't know about average because they're on Hacker News and other sites.

18:13.360 --> 18:21.060
But maybe your typical DevOps, IT, sysadmin, cloud worker, what do we call these people

18:21.060 --> 18:23.240
that they're trying to target these days?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.400
That category of user, that's who they got to hear from.

18:25.400 --> 18:32.080
So if I were a System76 or a Dell or an Intraware, I think I'd be watching that talk by Dustin

18:32.080 --> 18:35.700
and just getting a little insight into what the users are doing with the system once you

18:35.700 --> 18:36.700
ship it.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.700
All right.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.700
We got to talk about pipeline.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.440
Well, we'll get into why I think it's going to be great.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.880
Let's take a moment right here and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the show.

18:45.880 --> 18:52.600
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to support the show and sign up for a free seven day

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
trial.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.120
And that's sweet because you can kick the tires and get an idea of what the platform

18:56.120 --> 18:57.120
is capable of.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.140
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

19:01.140 --> 19:02.640
advance your career.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.880
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic with hands on

19:06.880 --> 19:10.680
scenario based labs give you real experience and confidence to work with it.

19:10.680 --> 19:15.200
Stream paths, which are a series of courses and content planned by instructors for a career

19:15.200 --> 19:19.000
track you're trying to get into, human beings when you need them, which is unique and great

19:19.000 --> 19:22.960
for an online platform like this, exams and practice quizzes and things like that to get

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
you ready for the test.

19:23.960 --> 19:29.280
And they also have certification training, which are courses that are created specifically

19:29.280 --> 19:32.540
to prepare you for the exam.

19:32.540 --> 19:35.600
One of my favorite features is you choose your distribution.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.240
The courseware matches that and the cloud servers that they spin up for you on demand

19:39.240 --> 19:42.560
when you need them and then you can SSH into to work all match.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.560
And they have nuggets when you're busy, they have course schedulers when you need to stick

19:46.560 --> 19:50.040
to a time when you're just crazy busy, like maybe you're going to New York or something

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
like that.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.320
They got course schedules for that.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
It's great.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.920
It's one of my favorite features.

19:54.920 --> 20:01.480
And also I loaded up their iOS app on the old iPad and tried that out on the road trip.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.480
That seems very convenient.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.480
Yeah.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.480
Yeah.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.480
I'm excited about that.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.320
If you want to sign up for a free seven day trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy

20:09.320 --> 20:13.640
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.880
So PipeWire, a game changer in Linux multimedia possibly.

20:17.880 --> 20:23.360
I'm very, very excited to, I'm going to say Wim.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.720
Is that how you say your first name?

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
Wim Tamus?

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
How do you say it?

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
Give me your whole name.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
I sound like a jackass.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.520
It's pronounced Wim Tiamans.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.520
Okay.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.560
And you're going by W-Tay here in the mumble room.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.040
So thank you for joining us, Wim.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.600
It's great to chat with you.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.960
I'm glad to be here.

20:41.960 --> 20:48.200
I've been kind of tangently covering PipeWire, but I don't really, obviously I don't know

20:48.200 --> 20:50.280
much about it because it's so new.

20:50.280 --> 20:55.120
So could you kind of give the audience a basic overview of what PipeWire is?

20:55.120 --> 21:00.560
Because a lot of them are going to be familiar with things like Gstreamer, PulseAudio and

21:00.560 --> 21:04.440
those types of technologies, but I don't think they're familiar with PipeWire yet.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.440
Yeah.

21:05.440 --> 21:14.560
So it's a new attempt to try to combine the good things that you can find in Gstreamer

21:14.560 --> 21:21.520
and in Jack and a bit in PulseAudio and also in the CRAS audio server.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.280
That's a Chromium audio server.

21:25.280 --> 21:32.360
So yeah, it's kind of like Gstreamer, but different, built differently.

21:32.360 --> 21:40.320
So there's plugins that is more like modeled around real-time plugins, the kinds that you

21:40.320 --> 21:50.720
find like in lots power LV2, they do very little, but they are very, you can achieve

21:50.720 --> 21:53.120
very low latency with them, stuff like that.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.560
Let me ask you, let me double check to see if I'm tracking you.

21:55.560 --> 22:03.000
So essentially PipeWire is eventually a replacement for PulseAudio and it would also be a video

22:03.000 --> 22:10.360
pipeline or API that applications could use to make sound or get sound or create video

22:10.360 --> 22:11.360
or send video?

22:11.360 --> 22:12.360
Yeah.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.260
So to understand that you have to think a bit about the history.

22:16.260 --> 22:22.200
So at first I wanted to write video sharing or video camera using Gstreamer.

22:22.200 --> 22:28.360
So using a multimedia framework to do these things, which worked.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.360
It was called PulseVideo.

22:29.360 --> 22:35.280
But then I started to think, okay, I can do audio with this as well.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.240
There is no reason why I couldn't do that.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.440
And then I started to think, okay, I could start to do something like PulseAudio.

22:42.440 --> 22:48.680
I could write it in Gstreamer, but then I started to bump against limitations such as

22:48.680 --> 22:52.960
low latency, which were difficult to achieve.

22:52.960 --> 22:58.880
So then I set out to build something better that is still a multimedia framework that

22:58.880 --> 23:07.200
would allow me to build these things like PulseAudio and I'm also targeting Jack.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.480
Yeah.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.800
And the plugin aspect, I don't want to chat more about, but I guess to kind of keep with

23:13.800 --> 23:19.800
the background here, is it also a major factor in this Wayland and applications sharing audio

23:19.800 --> 23:22.920
and video inside a sandboxed Wayland world?

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
Yes.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.920
Yes.

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
So exactly.

23:25.920 --> 23:31.600
Well, currently all video applications that capture from a camera, they directly access

23:31.600 --> 23:34.720
your device, video zero.

23:34.720 --> 23:41.880
So from a sandbox point of view, you just have to make that node visible to the sandbox

23:41.880 --> 23:44.160
with zero security.

23:44.160 --> 23:49.760
So any app can just open the camera and start capturing whatever you're doing.

23:49.760 --> 23:54.600
So you need some way to move that outside of the sandbox, which we've already done with

23:54.600 --> 23:55.600
PulseAudio.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.280
There's a demon running outside of the sandbox.

23:58.280 --> 24:03.040
The sandbox goes to the demon to access the device and we implement policies to restrict

24:03.040 --> 24:04.200
what you can do.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.200
So we need something similar for video.

24:07.200 --> 24:12.920
So you need to have a demon sitting there that accesses the camera and restricts who

24:12.920 --> 24:14.880
can do what with it.

24:14.880 --> 24:20.000
So that is one aspect to make this work in a sandbox world, we need a demon that sits

24:20.000 --> 24:27.260
there and does the control of access, which we don't have for video at all.

24:27.260 --> 24:34.200
So this is the first priority that PipeWire was built.

24:34.200 --> 24:39.720
So if we didn't have something like PipeWire in the Wayland universe, you would have exclusive

24:39.720 --> 24:43.520
application access to say the webcam and then no other application would be able to get

24:43.520 --> 24:44.520
access.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.520
Am I tracking that?

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
Yes.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.520
Yes.

24:47.520 --> 24:52.080
Well, if you're doing a demon that controls access to the camera, you can start implementing

24:52.080 --> 24:53.080
share.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.080
That makes sense.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
Okay.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.080
All right.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.080
Yeah, that does make sense.

24:57.080 --> 25:01.200
So let's talk a little bit about the difference between this and GStreamer because if I'm

25:01.200 --> 25:06.880
understanding you, it does support GStreamer audio plugins to an extent for the audio capabilities

25:06.880 --> 25:11.260
and plugins, but it's not GStreamer.

25:11.260 --> 25:25.320
So there is a plugin system, which is way, way, way more low level than GStreamer plugins.

25:25.320 --> 25:31.320
So yeah, it's really more low level, you have to do everything yourself, the memory management

25:31.320 --> 25:33.040
of the buffers and all of that.

25:33.040 --> 25:39.760
And on top of that is actually the PipeWire layer on top of that, that does all the negotiation

25:39.760 --> 25:42.560
and manages these plugins.

25:42.560 --> 25:52.920
So it's not exactly like GStreamer, which is one big, because it's everything.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.640
I would like a little clarification.

25:55.640 --> 26:01.280
I've heard discussion around PipeWire about getting latency down on the audio in Linux

26:01.280 --> 26:04.080
for recording purposes and mixing purposes.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.080
Is that a goal of PipeWire?

26:05.080 --> 26:07.000
And can you talk a bit about that?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.080
Yeah, absolutely.

26:09.080 --> 26:18.400
So currently the only thing that is reasonably low latency on Linux is Jack.

26:18.400 --> 26:26.800
So the way Jack works is very to the point, I would say.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.320
It's very efficient, the way it's implemented, but it's also very insecure.

26:31.320 --> 26:36.920
You can't really use it in a sound box.

26:36.920 --> 26:43.800
It has a huge, it has 100 megabytes, sorry, yeah, something like that, a huge file in

26:43.800 --> 26:50.960
shared memory that is mapped by all applications where you actually have the whole data exchange

26:50.960 --> 26:51.960
happen.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.920
So any client can look at anything else from everything else.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.360
You can actually write in that memory and destroy it.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.360
Oh, wow.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.360
Yeah, that's pretty interesting.

27:00.360 --> 27:07.440
Yeah, from a security point of view, that doesn't work, but it's very efficient.

27:07.440 --> 27:12.960
But essentially the way it works is you get your sound card, there's a sample ready, and

27:12.960 --> 27:17.680
then it does a few texts, it wakes up an application, and from the shared memory, the application

27:17.680 --> 27:23.360
can immediately read the memory, process it, and put it in another piece of shared memory

27:23.360 --> 27:26.240
where the daemon then picks it out and plays it back again.

27:26.240 --> 27:33.680
So there is super, super low latency there to compare that, for example, with pulse audio.

27:33.680 --> 27:38.080
It has the same kind of wake-up mechanism, but then it goes through different threads

27:38.080 --> 27:48.160
to signal applications, then it goes through another thread, which lots of data structures

27:48.160 --> 27:53.640
goes back to the server where it gets picked up, gets a copy, and then it gets copied and

27:53.640 --> 27:54.800
stuff like that.

27:54.800 --> 28:03.840
So it's a bit less efficient and it is not exactly, you can't achieve the same kind of

28:03.840 --> 28:04.840
low latency.

28:04.840 --> 28:09.680
It's also not designed for doing these things that Jack does.

28:09.680 --> 28:16.640
Like Jack, it wakes up every two milliseconds, let's say, and all the applications that are

28:16.640 --> 28:23.560
part of the graph, they get woken up, they do their little thing, so it's like lockstep,

28:23.560 --> 28:26.440
every two milliseconds something gets done.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.440
I see.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.440
Yeah.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.440
That is fascinating insight.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.760
That explains a lot of the audio end.

28:31.760 --> 28:36.560
Can you talk a bit about, for my personal interest, I'm curious more about the video

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
end.

28:37.560 --> 28:43.600
Is this a means to an end to efficient video-accelerated GPU-decoded video?

28:43.600 --> 28:47.400
Is that part of Pipewire or could be part of Pipewire in the future?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.400
Yeah.

28:48.400 --> 28:55.080
That is definitely something that I want to do eventually, but currently that is pretty

28:55.080 --> 28:57.680
well handled by Gstream as well.

28:57.680 --> 28:58.680
Ah, okay.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.680
Okay.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.680
Yeah.

29:00.680 --> 29:06.760
So in the future, will Gstreamer then be able to leverage Pipewire?

29:06.760 --> 29:07.760
Yeah.

29:07.760 --> 29:17.880
So currently I have a couple of Gstreamer elements where you can get data from a Pipewire instance

29:17.880 --> 29:25.040
and send data to a Pipewire instance, so there is a communication mechanism there.

29:25.040 --> 29:32.400
You can upload stuff and download stuff, and that works with compressed formats video.

29:32.400 --> 29:39.240
So when do we start seeing this land in our Linux distros near us?

29:39.240 --> 29:42.360
When does this stuff actually start shipping?

29:42.360 --> 29:48.960
So currently it's in Fedora 27, so we will be shipping Fedora 27.

29:48.960 --> 29:54.760
The idea is to use this for screen capture.

29:54.760 --> 30:00.040
So there is a bit of stuff going on behind the scenes to get this working with the screen

30:00.040 --> 30:01.040
capture.

30:01.040 --> 30:07.820
There's a portal API to start it, and then what basically happens is that the GNOME Shell

30:07.820 --> 30:15.400
mutter creates a new Pipewire stream, which is basically the screen as it is being rendered,

30:15.400 --> 30:19.640
that you can then fetch from several different programs.

30:19.640 --> 30:26.640
So you can start a program, for example, to stream this to a remote desktop, or make an

30:26.640 --> 30:30.480
RTSP server, or encode it to a file or something like that.

30:30.480 --> 30:35.540
I am very excited about that functionality, and that's going to give us remote desktop

30:35.540 --> 30:40.440
on Wayland, which I am really thrilled about, because it's been a number one complaint,

30:40.440 --> 30:42.760
I'd say, by the audience when they talk about switching to Wayland.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.040
Audience, Reddit, everywhere.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.320
That's a great feature that Pipewire is going to bring.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.920
I know Eric in our mumble room had a question for you, Wim.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.920
Eric, do you want to...

30:51.920 --> 30:52.920
Go ahead.

30:52.920 --> 30:58.600
Yeah, among other things that I do for a living, I'm actually an audio and video engineer,

30:58.600 --> 31:03.520
and I'm just curious as to how...

31:03.520 --> 31:08.200
If this would be one of the goals, perhaps the ability to do multi-track audio recording,

31:08.200 --> 31:10.000
say via USB or something.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.080
I mean, I have the same mixer that Chris does if they're in the studio, and it's capable

31:15.080 --> 31:17.840
of doing 32 tracks in and out via USB.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.360
Is that something that this could maybe one day be capable of?

31:21.360 --> 31:25.120
Yeah, that's one of the goals, yeah.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Excellent.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.120
That should be.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.120
That's great.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.080
It's going to be a beautiful Linux multimedia future.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.080
That is really great, Wim.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.440
Is there anything else you want to mention about Pipewire before we chug along?

31:35.440 --> 31:41.480
I could talk on for hours, but you'll have to watch my talks in the conferences that

31:41.480 --> 31:42.480
are coming up.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.480
Okay, very good.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.480
I will keep an eye out.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.520
I will also have a link to the blog post about the Pipewire launch, too, that people can

31:48.520 --> 31:50.400
check out to read more about it.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.760
So that's a really exciting, Wim.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.560
Thank you very much for joining us and talking a little about it.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.240
I look forward to watching this develop.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.240
Yeah, definitely.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.120
All right, thank you.

32:00.120 --> 32:05.460
Now, we have many things to do today in the show, so I have something very near and dear

32:05.460 --> 32:06.640
to my heart that I want to talk about.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.640
This is a good one for me.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.840
This is a good last episode, because I was really looking forward to talking about Pipewire,

32:11.840 --> 32:16.480
and this next thing, it wasn't really going to be a show topic, and then, I don't know,

32:16.480 --> 32:19.360
something just switched on in this morning in my head, and now it has to be.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.880
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.840
And thank you for visiting DigitalOcean.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.680
And then you use our promo code.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.220
You use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

32:29.220 --> 32:33.040
It's one word you apply to your account after you've created the account, and then you get

32:33.040 --> 32:35.320
a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

32:35.320 --> 32:39.080
And keep your eye out, because very soon, DigitalOcean, a little birdie tells me they'll

32:39.080 --> 32:41.720
be rolling out object storage.

32:41.720 --> 32:42.720
Very, very soon.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.720
I was just playing with that beta.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.720
Were you?

32:44.720 --> 32:45.720
Yeah.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.720
Nice.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.720
They turned it on for me, too, so I could play with it.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.720
It's a lot of fun.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.000
DigitalOcean's always added new features.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.360
So they recently added load balancing as a service, and monitoring, and metric performance

32:54.360 --> 32:55.360
monitoring.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.280
They've also done what they call cloud firewalls.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.900
It's actually pretty brilliant, because instead of you doing the firewall at your machine,

33:00.900 --> 33:04.120
they apply the firewall rules at the network layer, so the packets never even make it to

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
your machine.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.440
They have lightning fast networking, too, 40 gigabit connections coming to those hypervisors.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.000
They run Linux on those things.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.880
They run KVM for the virtualizer.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.120
Data centers all over the world.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.940
Load balancing as a service, pre-built open source applications ready to deploy, and pricing

33:17.940 --> 33:19.360
that's going to blow your mind.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.360
Look at how affordable this is.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.680
For $5 a month, you could run that rig.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.720
And with our $10 credit, you get it two months free.

33:24.720 --> 33:29.240
My favorite system is $0.03 an hour for 2 gigs of RAM, 2 CPUs, 40 gigabytes of SSD,

33:29.240 --> 33:31.960
because it's all SSDs, and 3 terabytes of transfer.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.240
And you know what's crazy, Wes?

33:33.240 --> 33:36.720
It's a lot of really good stuff, and I haven't even mentioned the dashboard yet.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.720
What?

33:37.720 --> 33:38.720
You haven't even mentioned that?

33:38.720 --> 33:39.720
No.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.720
You haven't even mentioned the game features.

33:40.720 --> 33:41.720
I know.

33:41.720 --> 33:42.720
I know.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.720
Dashboard for days.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
It's because it's so easy to use.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
You kind of forget about it.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.720
It is.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.920
And they also have that API, which we've now built bots around and stuff, which is really

33:48.920 --> 33:51.360
well-documented, easy, straightforward to use.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.440
It's been great for us.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.440
DigitalOcean.com.

33:53.440 --> 33:58.640
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code of absolute power and knowledge,

33:58.640 --> 33:59.640
DO Unplugged.

33:59.640 --> 34:00.640
That's one word.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.880
DO Unplugged over at DigitalOcean.com.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.040
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.040
Okay.

34:08.040 --> 34:15.320
So, I want to talk about something that is not a totally new topic to this show, but

34:15.320 --> 34:16.680
I do think it's a pretty big problem.

34:16.680 --> 34:23.720
But I want to set a couple of ground rules, some disclosures up front.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.440
I'm not talking about any one particular person.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.560
I'm not talking about any one particular business.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.880
This is a bigger problem than any one person or business or company or media outlet.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.880
I'm sorry, Chris.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.880
Thank you.

34:37.880 --> 34:41.880
And it's something that I'm personally very invested in because I've followed the Linux

34:41.880 --> 34:46.720
news for 11 years, very closely, every week, reading and analyzing it.

34:46.720 --> 34:52.280
I cover it in a lot of my shows.

34:52.280 --> 34:57.680
And so watching this has been, it's actually taken a toll a bit because of something very

34:57.680 --> 35:02.040
special about the open source community.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.960
More than ever, I really feel like the quote unquote open source media or Linux journalism

35:05.960 --> 35:11.640
has taken a nosedive of quality, specifically in the written medium, but also with some

35:11.640 --> 35:14.080
of the media outlets too.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.720
Just really gotten bad.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.400
There's fewer and fewer reporters that are actually going to a story, that are creating

35:20.400 --> 35:21.700
new content.

35:21.700 --> 35:30.120
And what's mostly happening now, because it's easy and good business, is we have lazy virtue

35:30.120 --> 35:36.480
signaling clickbait journalism that touches on people's emotional buttons and gets people

35:36.480 --> 35:43.320
fired up and sharing content and retweeting and thumbing down or thumbing up, either way,

35:43.320 --> 35:45.360
angry and happy.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.560
And it works so well.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.360
It works so well, you see it all over the place.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.360
It's media everywhere.

35:50.360 --> 35:54.120
It's not just a Linux problem.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.620
But I believe in the open source community, it has devastating consequences.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.840
I think it murders people's passion and energy to contribute.

36:00.840 --> 36:04.900
And we all know that a large reason why people contribute to open source is because it's

36:04.900 --> 36:10.600
a passion project, or why people go out on a limb and advocate in their commercial company

36:10.600 --> 36:17.820
to be a member of the open source community, to work upstream.

36:17.820 --> 36:23.200
It takes a passion to be willing to take that risk.

36:23.200 --> 36:29.160
So when the tone of conversation is mostly discourse based around toxic straw man arguments,

36:29.160 --> 36:35.540
that the bar has been set by this bottom feeding media, who's not creating anything new.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.060
That's the most offensive thing.

36:37.060 --> 36:38.680
They're not making anything new.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.040
They're creating discussion about the discussion.

36:42.040 --> 36:46.320
This community, the open source community, is a worldwide community of developers of

36:46.320 --> 36:51.120
different cultures, creating different projects for different reasons, coming together to

36:51.120 --> 36:55.480
make something amazing, and predominantly the conversation in the open source media

36:55.480 --> 36:58.040
space is discussion about the discussion.

36:58.040 --> 37:02.960
Things to get people riled up and excited, virtue signaling.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.400
And I think it's devastating in the open source community.

37:06.400 --> 37:14.160
And what's really troubling to me is it's getting worse.

37:14.160 --> 37:18.960
And there's less and less actual quote unquote journalists going to these events and covering

37:18.960 --> 37:22.760
events or going to communities and finding out what they're making.

37:22.760 --> 37:27.880
And I will use us as an example for a moment here, but look at the projects that have come

37:27.880 --> 37:30.960
on the show over the last 215 episodes.

37:30.960 --> 37:35.280
They generally do really well afterwards, not because of this, some magical effect of

37:35.280 --> 37:38.880
the show, but because they connect with our audience and they express what their goals

37:38.880 --> 37:40.280
are and their intentions.

37:40.280 --> 37:44.180
And our audience likes that they buy into their ideas and it doesn't, it's not about

37:44.180 --> 37:47.480
the show, it becomes about the project and that project grows and they get contributors

37:47.480 --> 37:49.680
and they get mouth, word of mouth.

37:49.680 --> 37:54.860
It creates something, it contributes something to the open source community.

37:54.860 --> 37:59.840
But this diverse of click bait, emotional button pushing, bottom feeding journalism

37:59.840 --> 38:03.080
that we have now does the opposite.

38:03.080 --> 38:09.200
It's devastating.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
So this is my rant.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
This is my rant.

38:11.200 --> 38:15.440
And I always, I've made this case before, I've made this case before, and I'm not done

38:15.440 --> 38:16.440
making it.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.000
So now I'm going to, I'm going to just going to, I'm going to call out some names and I'm

38:19.000 --> 38:23.720
going to give you some examples right now on the show because this is a problem that

38:23.720 --> 38:28.520
is getting worse and apparently not talking about it enough hasn't done anything and not

38:28.520 --> 38:30.520
calling out names hasn't done anything.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.800
So we're going to get to that next.

38:31.800 --> 38:48.200
I solemnly swear by my oath as a crime fighter that this outrage will not go un-avenged.

38:48.200 --> 38:56.240
I want to thank Ting, go to linux.ting.com and sign up for the nation's best mobile coverage.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.500
What a company, linux.ting.com.

38:58.500 --> 39:03.640
Go there to experience really incredible customer service, pay for what you want wireless, $6

39:03.640 --> 39:07.520
a month for your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, no contracts nor the termination

39:07.520 --> 39:08.520
fees.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.280
Again, another fantastic, wonderful dashboard.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.900
It's like people are starting to get this.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.000
It's mobile how it should be done.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.800
I hear that from people outside the US all the time.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.520
They have a GSM and CDMA network.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.800
You pick your device, you make it work.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.440
Oh, you're going to get yourself the new internet phone or the new Samsung or the new Pixel,

39:22.440 --> 39:23.440
whatever.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.440
It doesn't matter.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.440
Ting don't care.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
Just make sure it's compatible.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
Check their BYOD page, pop in a SIM, you're good to go.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.040
You want to grab one from Ting directly?

39:30.040 --> 39:31.040
No probs.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.040
Check it out.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.040
Go to linux.ting.com.

39:33.040 --> 39:38.200
You'll get $25 off your first device or $25 in service credit if you bring a compatible

39:38.200 --> 39:41.920
device, linux.ting.com.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.880
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show, linux.ting.com.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
Yes, sir.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
And none of that was clickbait.

39:45.880 --> 39:46.880
It's all true.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.880
It is true.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.880
It is all true.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.880
I'm going to be using Ting all the way across the nation.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.000
Tried and tested.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.960
So I generally have a lot of respect for Matthew Garrett, but I'm going to start here because

39:54.960 --> 39:58.100
this is the beginning of a beast right here.

39:58.100 --> 40:03.080
And it is a disgusting, grotesque aspect of the Linux community, and it's perfectly displayed

40:03.080 --> 40:04.240
right here.

40:04.240 --> 40:10.900
So Matthew Garrett tweets on the 23rd of July, 2013, sitting on a plane watching Jim Zimlin

40:10.900 --> 40:12.680
use OS X.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.280
So he's shaming the head of the Linux Foundation back in 2013.

40:16.280 --> 40:21.480
Four years later, this is September 10th, 2017, four years later, at Jim Zimlin is still

40:21.480 --> 40:27.760
rocking an iPad and doing his slides under Mac OS X.

40:27.760 --> 40:33.920
This starts a cascade of shit, including people jumping in, hocking hardware, hocking open

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
Seuss.

40:34.920 --> 40:41.680
But it develops then into a series of YouTube videos and Reddit posts where people get clickbait,

40:41.680 --> 40:48.280
and itsfoss.com posted this, Linux Foundation head calls 2017 year of the Linux desktop

40:48.280 --> 40:53.080
while running Apple's Mac OS himself.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.640
And takes shots at Jim throughout the entire article.

40:56.640 --> 41:01.920
He even says here in the ITFoss article, perhaps I'm creating unnecessary controversy.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.400
Perhaps this is simple, should be ignored.

41:05.400 --> 41:10.760
This thing that we do is gross because it's shaming people for their choices.

41:10.760 --> 41:16.020
And it wouldn't be accepted in thousands of other contexts in our daily lives.

41:16.020 --> 41:20.200
But when it comes to picking a Mac or Windows, and we're Linux users, all of a sudden we

41:20.200 --> 41:21.600
get to shame.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.460
If they were Jews, we couldn't say these things.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.880
If they were black, we wouldn't be saying these things.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.680
If they chose to have bisexual sex, we wouldn't be saying these things.

41:30.680 --> 41:34.240
If a man wanted to become a woman, we wouldn't be saying these things.

41:34.240 --> 41:39.680
But because Jim runs a Mac, it's okay to publicly shame him.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.920
Now I happen to know there's people in this mumble room right now, shocker, they're not

41:42.920 --> 41:43.920
using Linux.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.960
You're going to call them out, aren't you?

41:45.960 --> 41:46.960
That's what's going to happen next.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.960
Watch out.

41:47.960 --> 41:54.600
But what really gets me is someone sees Jim on an airplane and he's using an iPad.

41:54.600 --> 41:59.640
Well, depending on the day you saw me, you might see me editing video on my Macbook.

41:59.640 --> 42:00.640
Because guess what?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.440
PipeWire isn't shipping yet.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.360
So I use a Macbook to edit my videos.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.080
Now I own three laptops, only one of them is a Mac.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.340
The other two run Linux.

42:08.340 --> 42:13.020
But if you saw me that day on my Mac, you might tweet out, oh, just saw Chris Fisher

42:13.020 --> 42:15.140
had a Jupiter broadcast and using a Mac.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.140
What a dick.

42:16.140 --> 42:19.080
Well, you know, Chris, all the shows are edited on a Mac too.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.080
Yeah, we are.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.840
We are just a bunch of heretics.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.440
Trying to sabotage Linux from within.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.440
Yeah, we're Mac lovers trying to pretend to be like Linux.

42:26.440 --> 42:29.040
So with no information, with no quotes from Jim.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.120
Right, this is not an interview discussing like, you know, maybe he feels the same way

42:33.120 --> 42:34.280
about it, we don't know.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.640
Maybe he has two Linux desktops at home and just prefers to have a Macbook for a laptop.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.800
Because guess who else does that?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.800
Linus Torvalds.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.200
Maybe he has a Macbook running Linux.

42:42.200 --> 42:45.440
Well, I mean, even if he's running Mac or Windows.

42:45.440 --> 42:50.120
But the point is, or an iPad, at what point do we stop shaming?

42:50.120 --> 42:54.120
When does that not become an acceptable thing to shame someone for a choice they made because

42:54.120 --> 42:55.560
that tool works for them?

42:55.560 --> 42:57.800
Not everybody takes this as a religious thing.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.340
I mean, that's a good point.

42:59.340 --> 43:03.600
But also the fact that there's literally no evidence whatsoever that it's even true and

43:03.600 --> 43:08.320
people went off on like on Crazy Train to yell at him for something they have no idea.

43:08.320 --> 43:12.080
And every single time someone does it, they always like, well, you know, I couldn't get

43:12.080 --> 43:16.240
it confirmed or anything, but I'm going to go still go off on a tangent and yell at this

43:16.240 --> 43:17.240
guy.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
He's using a Mac up on stage.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.440
And I am not arguing that the optics of this look bad.

43:21.440 --> 43:25.340
Like get a loaner laptop running Linux and go up there.

43:25.340 --> 43:30.940
Of course, then there would be headlines, head of Linux Foundation prefers Fedora, head

43:30.940 --> 43:33.060
of Linux Foundation prefers OpenSUSE.

43:33.060 --> 43:36.580
So then there would be those headlines, but they would be at least of a different caliber.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.440
So I agree that the optics look bad.

43:38.440 --> 43:43.480
However, the Linux Foundation is not a Linux desktop advocacy group.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.480
Wake up, everybody.

43:44.480 --> 43:45.480
That's not what they're there for.

43:45.480 --> 43:46.480
That's not where they have members like VMware.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.560
They're not there for the desktop, OK?

43:49.560 --> 43:50.560
They're there for the business.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.560
Microsoft.

43:51.560 --> 43:52.560
Right.

43:52.560 --> 43:56.240
Microsoft is more of a Linux desktop advocacy company than the Linux Foundation is, though,

43:56.240 --> 43:59.040
because Microsoft makes Visual Studio code, for God's sakes.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.360
And they make other applications for Linux.

44:01.360 --> 44:05.240
The Linux Foundation is a business representation of Linux and that arm.

44:05.240 --> 44:10.680
And they do they fund other projects that do good work, like the Core Infrastructure

44:10.680 --> 44:13.600
Initiative.

44:13.600 --> 44:17.600
And if you go to these conferences, like the camera that's pointing at Jim, if you turned

44:17.600 --> 44:22.160
that camera around and took a picture of the audience, it would I would be willing to take

44:22.160 --> 44:25.520
a rough best 70 to 80 percent MacBooks in that audience.

44:25.520 --> 44:32.320
The rest would be mostly Lenovo's and Dell's and the half of them would be running Windows.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.520
So Linux is a minority at these conferences.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.600
Don't kid yourself.

44:36.600 --> 44:42.740
And the the idea here that people have to pass some sort of purity test.

44:42.740 --> 44:46.000
And we all love to take a shot at our at our authority figures in Linux.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.640
So everybody got a shot at the Linux Foundation.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.040
We got to take them down a notch, got to take Jim down a notch.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.320
So everybody feels really good about that.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.360
And Jim passed our purity test.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.080
So now we all get the virtue signal about that.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.580
And we're all feeling pretty good right now.

44:58.580 --> 45:00.320
It's gross.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.520
And it doesn't get anything done.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.000
That's the part that stands out to me.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.240
Or we're not like what are the reasons he can't use Linux on his desktop if there are

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
some.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.880
Those are things we maybe we should be talking about and figuring out how to how to make

45:11.880 --> 45:12.880
that better.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.680
And isn't the mechanics of this interesting?

45:14.680 --> 45:19.000
It starts with like if you think about it, the very origins of this are gross.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.640
Matthew Garrett, they're publicly shaming.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.580
He's Mac shaming someone.

45:24.580 --> 45:28.520
And then he does it years later again on his Twitter feed.

45:28.520 --> 45:34.600
And then you have YouTubers and bloggers who then try to get clicks off of it.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.720
And none of them have a single poll quote from Jim.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.580
It's remarkable.

45:39.580 --> 45:45.560
It is the bottom feeding journalism that is suffocating the dialogue in the open source

45:45.560 --> 45:47.600
community.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.120
It makes us spin and chase our own tails.

45:51.120 --> 45:54.140
And it lowers the starting point of the conversation.

45:54.140 --> 45:58.040
And you can say, well, Chris, it's just about filtering the news that you take in.

45:58.040 --> 46:01.080
It's just about making sure that you pick the right sources.

46:01.080 --> 46:08.120
The problem is the dialogue in at a at a at a wider, higher level is getting set low.

46:08.120 --> 46:10.000
The bar is getting set low.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.520
It doesn't matter what source you're getting it from the conversation.

46:13.520 --> 46:19.940
Just look at the big things that have happened to Linux recently or go back to system D.

46:19.940 --> 46:25.480
It's eating us up and it's it's it's something that I feel like I am almost powerless to

46:25.480 --> 46:30.560
solve because, like I said, it's bigger than one person and it's bigger than one company.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.800
And I think about the amount of people that go to these events and cover these events

46:34.800 --> 46:38.560
and it's it's painfully small.

46:38.560 --> 46:44.600
Regular Linux journalists who go to like Gwadek or they don't go to that, but say they go

46:44.600 --> 46:47.840
to DebConf or the open source summit or something.

46:47.840 --> 46:51.600
It's four or five people and two of them work at Jupiter Broadcasting.

46:51.600 --> 46:56.160
I'm serious.

46:56.160 --> 47:02.280
It does make it hard to have like a diverse, you know, network of of coverage.

47:02.280 --> 47:10.200
The only thing I can figure to try to fix this is to compete at a at a level that makes

47:10.200 --> 47:14.800
clickbait journalism not as appealing and makes them have to compete.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.440
And I don't know how to get there.

47:16.440 --> 47:21.220
And my thought is starting to go to things like the Ubuntu rally or going at talking

47:21.220 --> 47:26.040
to projects as as things are being developed and spotlighting them on the show is maybe

47:26.040 --> 47:27.720
a way to do that.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.080
Go to the story.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.280
You know, when I when I think of this Ubuntu rally, I don't think of it so much as an Ubuntu

47:32.280 --> 47:38.160
event as I do about going to a large person, a large company in the community who's at

47:38.160 --> 47:41.760
an interesting transition right now, learning how they work, how they interact with the

47:41.760 --> 47:45.920
community, networking with people and using that to influence and give insight into my

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
future commentary.

47:46.920 --> 47:47.920
Right.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.900
You get a different view of this that you can you can share.

47:50.900 --> 47:56.320
And it's it is it is a type of it is a type of perspective that you don't get by just

47:56.320 --> 48:00.560
sitting in front of your crappy YouTube set up and blabbing your mouth or throwing up

48:00.560 --> 48:05.180
some cheap post on a blog somewhere, hoping that you get a few ad clicks off of it.

48:05.180 --> 48:10.000
And the the cost of doing it is substantially greater.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.580
And the time it takes is substantially higher and more.

48:14.580 --> 48:18.020
So it seems like an impossible fight.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.880
And it I you know, you have to go by my word that I hear over and over again.

48:21.880 --> 48:26.080
In fact, it's one of the things I hear the most is people burn out because of it and

48:26.080 --> 48:27.080
they they give up.

48:27.080 --> 48:31.560
And it's it's it's it's people that if I said their names, it would shock you.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.440
And it's people that you've never heard of before.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.920
It's the whole frickin spectrum.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.300
And I know it's a real problem.

48:37.300 --> 48:38.340
And I hear a lot about it.

48:38.340 --> 48:40.360
And I feel powerless to do anything about it.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.280
And it feels like it's getting worse, like we're slipping deeper and deeper into this

48:43.280 --> 48:45.160
shitty clickbait abyss.

48:45.160 --> 48:52.200
Yeah, it's it's awful and there's the hate that people send about all kinds of different

48:52.200 --> 48:55.880
things like the canonical hate for no reason.

48:55.880 --> 49:00.680
But and there are other companies that are doing something similar that it gets no attention

49:00.680 --> 49:01.680
whatsoever.

49:01.680 --> 49:06.760
Yet, you know, other companies just get hate regardless if they just open their mouth.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.880
Like why?

49:07.880 --> 49:12.000
Why do you need to hate someone for making open source software?

49:12.000 --> 49:15.260
Even if you don't want to use it, shouldn't you appreciate the work they're putting out

49:15.260 --> 49:16.260
there for you?

49:16.260 --> 49:17.260
Yeah, we covered it.

49:17.260 --> 49:20.880
We covered an intense story in Kota Radio this week that just went out a couple days

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
ago or yesterday.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.920
Well, I just wanted to clear up something I looked up.

49:23.920 --> 49:28.760
I'm looking since this entire thing started, I've been trying to find any evidence whatsoever

49:28.760 --> 49:30.500
that this is even true.

49:30.500 --> 49:31.500
It's not true.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
Are you sure?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.480
You can like see a picture of it or something like that.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.200
There's not a you can go on the YouTube channel.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.120
They don't they don't show what you're kidding me what slides there are.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.320
There's no photos whatsoever.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.560
I couldn't find a single photo.

49:41.560 --> 49:42.560
Right.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.080
And none of these articles I've seen have a photo of it either.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.160
No, I saw someone had a stock photo of a MacBook as if that's proof or something.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.160
Wow.

49:49.160 --> 49:53.320
But every single one of them are referencing each other in a cycle of cyclicals, crazy,

49:53.320 --> 49:58.040
you know, attack like the one like the its boss was referencing some YouTube channels.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.800
The YouTube channels are referencing the Twitter.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.920
The only thing we have is Matthew Garrett's word that it happened.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.520
But so he took the time to make a tweet.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.280
You're like, well, that's not a big deal.

50:07.280 --> 50:12.720
He also took the time to find the older tweet that he made, but not the time to take a photo

50:12.720 --> 50:14.200
to prove his statement.

50:14.200 --> 50:15.720
Like that's kind of weird.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.720
Yeah.

50:16.720 --> 50:19.400
And because he's using on the plane doesn't mean he was doing it from the podium either.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.440
That's I didn't right.

50:20.440 --> 50:23.100
And people are blowing it up as if he didn't did it on the keynote.

50:23.100 --> 50:27.500
You know, I think I think there I think I think there is more and more talking to rotten

50:27.500 --> 50:30.600
made me think rotten has really well researched coverage like on his channel.

50:30.600 --> 50:35.880
Like there are people out there that are doing like well thought out, well researched pieces.

50:35.880 --> 50:39.320
You know, like like a lot, like our friends that went to podcast and late night Linux

50:39.320 --> 50:40.320
and the work they do there.

50:40.320 --> 50:43.040
Again, I feel like people that are thoughtful about it.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.260
There is a place for that.

50:44.260 --> 50:48.240
You know, you don't always have to be like creating something brand new or interviewing

50:48.240 --> 50:49.240
somebody.

50:49.240 --> 50:53.100
Like there is a place for thoughtful conversation that does add to a dialogue because, again,

50:53.100 --> 50:56.360
it is an open source community and that's a huge part of it.

50:56.360 --> 51:01.120
So there is a so I feel like there is more and more good stuff, but it's getting outpaced

51:01.120 --> 51:05.120
by the click bait emotion button pushing and that there's such a template out there from

51:05.120 --> 51:07.200
like the buzz feeds of the world on how to pull it off.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.200
Oh, my gosh.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.360
Just I mean, like going through for, you know, preparing for this show.

51:10.360 --> 51:13.560
How much of that do you have to filter, cut away and just not.

51:13.560 --> 51:18.180
And I feel like it's harder to, you know, maybe for people who haven't don't see that

51:18.180 --> 51:21.360
much or don't follow as closely or other things.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.600
It can be pretty confusing when you're just trying to like you look at various aggregator

51:24.600 --> 51:25.600
sites or other things.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.520
And once it starts being shared, those clickbait titles, I mean, if you don't know any better,

51:29.520 --> 51:30.520
those will pull you in.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.800
Suddenly, you've loaded their ads, you've continued, you've been in their click count.

51:33.800 --> 51:37.720
So it can be hard to like actually signal that you're not interested in it.

51:37.720 --> 51:41.340
It's funny is that you're mentioning about the whole researching like the people who

51:41.340 --> 51:46.280
research their topics and stuff that I've actually when I first saw this last week,

51:46.280 --> 51:49.760
I was like, I'm making a video about this, although I'm going to research and make sure

51:49.760 --> 51:54.320
what I say is that I have like another day or two before it's going to be released because

51:54.320 --> 51:57.200
I still have some things I want to make sure that I'm correct about.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.280
But so far, through all the research I've found I've looked through, there's not a single

52:01.280 --> 52:04.040
reference of any kind to have any proof whatsoever.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.040
Here's an idea.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.560
Why doesn't somebody just email the guy and ask?

52:06.560 --> 52:07.560
Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

52:07.560 --> 52:11.280
I mean, if that was him, I wouldn't answer anyway, because it would just create like

52:11.280 --> 52:15.200
an extra like him denying and people are like, how could you deny something that we know

52:15.200 --> 52:16.200
is true or something?

52:16.200 --> 52:20.400
But I could tell you how the conversation would go with Jim if I was at one of the Linux

52:20.400 --> 52:24.280
Foundation events where Jim's at and we're on the sidebar, I'd be like, boy, can you

52:24.280 --> 52:25.760
believe that fucking shitstorm you got for that?

52:25.760 --> 52:30.000
And he'd be like, yeah, that's really just unbelievable.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.160
When you get real and you get outside your little virtue signaling bubble, you realize

52:34.160 --> 52:35.440
people are humans.

52:35.440 --> 52:39.800
And to him, he's sitting on a plane, guess what, the MacBook probably gets four hours

52:39.800 --> 52:42.880
more battery life than whatever Linux laptop he was going to bring on the plane.

52:42.880 --> 52:47.040
I mean, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that iPad that this time he got busted

52:47.040 --> 52:49.800
for, probably has 11, 12 hours of battery life.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.960
That's very freaking competitive.

52:51.960 --> 52:56.780
And it feels like it just kind of paints a bad image of desktop Linux users, especially

52:56.780 --> 52:59.400
in that world that's so dominated by servers.

52:59.400 --> 53:04.400
You're like, well, look, here's this weird, strange internet culture.

53:04.400 --> 53:05.400
They're not making money.

53:05.400 --> 53:08.760
They're not like, it's not part of the same class of people and here they are being dicks

53:08.760 --> 53:09.760
to me.

53:09.760 --> 53:10.760
Why do I care about that?

53:10.760 --> 53:11.920
I'm just going to stay in the world I know.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
I had a really interesting...

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Oh, go ahead.

53:13.920 --> 53:18.120
There's also an argument of like, well, he's running something that he could be using it

53:18.120 --> 53:22.840
to learn more about the thing he's using so that he can convince people why this is better

53:22.840 --> 53:23.840
than this.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.760
If you have no reference, how can you say something is better than something you've

53:26.760 --> 53:27.760
never tried?

53:27.760 --> 53:32.520
So he could be saying like, maybe he has Windows machines and Mac things and he's just using

53:32.520 --> 53:37.160
them for like, well, he's doing a presentation on a plane.

53:37.160 --> 53:40.400
That's not like it's his main primary desktop or anything.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.400
Yeah.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.000
Although people are saying that in articles, of course.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Yeah.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.220
Well, you got to jump to conclusions to make it worth clicking, I guess.

53:47.220 --> 53:50.760
So Swampy, he's one of the journalists that actually goes out there and actually goes

53:50.760 --> 53:51.760
to the story.

53:51.760 --> 53:56.440
I just kind of speak to those people and he has a YouTube channel now and he had a topic

53:56.440 --> 53:58.520
on it recently that, oh, oh.

53:58.520 --> 54:03.340
So it came across our YouTube recommended and it's a totally, for me, I don't even think

54:03.340 --> 54:04.340
about it.

54:04.340 --> 54:09.120
I'm trying to, I can't find it right now, but it was to me like a totally normal title

54:09.120 --> 54:14.760
and it was stop converting users to Linux and migrate them to Linux instead.

54:14.760 --> 54:20.640
It's a pretty good time and it's, you know, it's done pretty well for him.

54:20.640 --> 54:25.560
But Hadia saw that and she goes, wait a minute, is this, this is legitimately the conversation

54:25.560 --> 54:26.560
we had last night.

54:26.560 --> 54:27.560
So, and I think it's related to this.

54:27.560 --> 54:30.280
She says, is this, is this converting everybody to Linux thing?

54:30.280 --> 54:31.920
Is this something more than just Noah?

54:31.920 --> 54:34.120
Like, I thought that was just a Noah thing.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.120
I'm like, no.

54:35.120 --> 54:37.920
She's like, so is that a normal thing for you people to talk about?

54:37.920 --> 54:40.480
Like not, you know, like that kind of, that's a little creepy.

54:40.480 --> 54:41.480
I'm like, what?

54:41.480 --> 54:45.600
She's like, you don't think it's weird that you guys talk about converting people to Linux?

54:45.600 --> 54:46.600
That sounds like a religion.

54:46.600 --> 54:47.600
Yeah.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.600
Like religious undertones.

54:48.600 --> 54:53.480
And I'm like, oh yeah, I, yeah, I guess it, I guess it does have a religious undertone,

54:53.480 --> 54:54.480
doesn't it?

54:54.480 --> 54:59.280
Like you're, you're converting and we do or, or very culty and we very, very frequently

54:59.280 --> 55:00.280
talk about that.

55:00.280 --> 55:06.560
Evangelist is a common title and there's, I've never, ever said church of neon ever.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.560
We all do it.

55:07.560 --> 55:11.440
And it's because, you know, we all, we want to advocate and we think it can actually help.

55:11.440 --> 55:14.440
And a lot of us probably have personality types where we're sort of like the trend,

55:14.440 --> 55:16.680
the technology trends that are in our social group or something like that.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.300
So it's, it's not like it's, we're all a bunch of crazies, but to her, she, I guess she had

55:21.300 --> 55:24.760
made the assumption that that was just, well, that's just Noah because he's crazy passionate

55:24.760 --> 55:25.800
about Linux.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.320
And she was, which is a fine assumption for a few moments.

55:28.320 --> 55:29.440
She was creeped out by it.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.640
And then I explained to her, it's like, well, you know, when you discover something you

55:31.640 --> 55:33.920
think is really great, you kind of evangelize it.

55:33.920 --> 55:38.760
And she's like, well, you just said evangelize, okay, I'm digging a hole here.

55:38.760 --> 55:42.600
You know, she got to, in her business, she runs two Linux computers, but it's not about,

55:42.600 --> 55:47.000
it's not about the license or the, or, you know, because she likes unity or Matei it's,

55:47.000 --> 55:50.960
it's because it's just practical for her.

55:50.960 --> 55:55.760
And I think it's all kind of like, we get kind of swept up in this, like I said, morality

55:55.760 --> 55:59.040
testing and things like that, and we don't even really realize what we're doing and we,

55:59.040 --> 56:00.680
we jump into shaming and attacking.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.680
Yes.

56:01.680 --> 56:02.680
Right.

56:02.680 --> 56:05.200
Instead of pointing out things like, Hey, look, Linux can do this better in some cases.

56:05.200 --> 56:09.280
A lot of the dialogue ends up focused being on like, Windows is garbage and here's why.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.840
And when they're like, well, no, but Windows works fine and it has these, you know, it

56:11.840 --> 56:13.880
doesn't, it doesn't feel like a full debate.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.280
That's right where we're back at with this.

56:15.280 --> 56:19.520
I've now got two stories, one in an email and I think one in the haircare discord channel

56:19.520 --> 56:24.880
from a listener who has heard me kind of talk about this a bit on the pre-show last week.

56:24.880 --> 56:29.360
And he said, I came to Linux Fest Northwest to see you guys to kind of get more about

56:29.360 --> 56:30.640
Linux been thinking about switching.

56:30.640 --> 56:36.280
I have an old Mac book, which I brought with me and I got harassed by people in the booths,

56:36.280 --> 56:38.120
not by people at Linux Fest, but people behind the booths.

56:38.120 --> 56:42.800
Like somebody was giving him a hard time for bringing a Mac and he felt shamed and I kind

56:42.800 --> 56:44.660
of lost my enthusiasm to switch.

56:44.660 --> 56:46.960
Two people told me that they got a hard time at Linux Fest Northwest.

56:46.960 --> 56:49.800
It was totally the opposite atmosphere that we could want or imagine.

56:49.800 --> 56:51.600
And Linux Fest Northwest is always so cool.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.560
It's just such a cool, chill place.

56:53.560 --> 56:54.560
Like of all walks.

56:54.560 --> 56:55.560
Welcoming.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.560
Yeah, exactly.

56:56.560 --> 57:00.800
And to be fair, how often have we commented on one of the shows that how many Mac books

57:00.800 --> 57:01.800
are showing up at LinuxCon?

57:01.800 --> 57:02.800
Yeah.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Yeah.

57:03.800 --> 57:08.680
I know we are not, we are not innocent here because especially back in my switcher days

57:08.680 --> 57:12.280
when I was, when I was really aggressively trying to get people off of Windows and I

57:12.280 --> 57:13.760
did consider myself an evangelist.

57:13.760 --> 57:17.920
Now I'm more like a, I'm like a, like a, like a, I'm like, what's a converted evangelist

57:17.920 --> 57:22.040
who's now just like, I practice the faith, but I'm cool if you don't want to practice

57:22.040 --> 57:23.040
the faith.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.760
I don't know what you call that, but that's the kind of Linux user I find myself to be

57:24.760 --> 57:25.760
these days.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.520
You show off that Linux works great for you, but you don't pressure others.

57:29.520 --> 57:30.520
You're not, yeah.

57:30.520 --> 57:34.800
I think that's a bit of the shaming a bit feels like insecurity about it.

57:34.800 --> 57:38.080
Like you're insecure that for some reason the guy that runs the Linux Foundation needs

57:38.080 --> 57:39.080
to use an iPad.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.760
I think you see the same like with programming languages or anything like that, right?

57:41.760 --> 57:44.720
Like you, you worry because you're thinking like, well, it clearly works for them.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.120
They must think it's so much better.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.120
Yeah.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.120
So what about the devil's advocate position?

57:48.120 --> 57:49.120
Like, so right.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.120
And what about this?

57:50.120 --> 57:54.720
What if, uh, what if, um, you know, a different CEO of a different company, I guess, cause

57:54.720 --> 57:56.320
that's not really fair because it's a foundation.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.320
It depends on the company.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.480
Someone would just automatically get a password regardless of what they do.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.760
But the Linux Foundation doesn't make a product.

58:01.760 --> 58:02.760
They're a foundation.

58:02.760 --> 58:06.640
Part of this whole thing is the nebulous connection between Linux and the Linux Foundation and

58:06.640 --> 58:08.360
Linux just is a kernel also.

58:08.360 --> 58:12.800
So it's all kind of like it's the company model is there to be easier to say yes or

58:12.800 --> 58:13.800
no.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.800
That makes sense.

58:14.800 --> 58:19.480
Or yeah, it's more of a, they're an advocacy group, so that's why you're not really doing

58:19.480 --> 58:20.480
very good advocacy.

58:20.480 --> 58:21.480
Right.

58:21.480 --> 58:22.480
Yes.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.160
I mean, they are because they're, they're showing that they're willing to use the things

58:25.160 --> 58:29.520
that other people are using and can show, like, you know, show them that they're not

58:29.520 --> 58:32.120
like creating this leadism or anything.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.960
But there's another thing I thought of was funny that the same people who would bash

58:34.960 --> 58:38.760
him for using an iPad are the same people who say that Android is not Linux or anything.

58:38.760 --> 58:43.360
So like, as far as tablet go, there is no right answer.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.360
Not yet.

58:44.360 --> 58:45.840
I think there was a new replicant release this week.

58:45.840 --> 58:46.840
That might be the.

58:46.840 --> 58:48.480
What are you going to say, Bjerg?

58:48.480 --> 58:55.520
What if you saw, you know, chairman member and former CEO Bill Gates using a MacBook

58:55.520 --> 58:57.000
at his charity events?

58:57.000 --> 58:58.640
Well, that's, that would be more.

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
I'd give him a high five.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
That would be more surprising.

59:00.640 --> 59:04.140
But again, the Linux Foundation isn't like making an operating system directly.

59:04.140 --> 59:08.580
They finance Linus and Linus uses a MacBook and nobody gives shit one about that.

59:08.580 --> 59:12.920
It's only because, because we like to take a pop at our authority figures, but not our

59:12.920 --> 59:14.100
cult leaders.

59:14.100 --> 59:19.260
Like our cultural icons, they could, they can pick their toes and they can run MacBooks

59:19.260 --> 59:20.460
and we're good.

59:20.460 --> 59:23.920
But if you are an authority figure, well, then you are, you're an open target and we're

59:23.920 --> 59:29.720
just going to take a few, a few shots because we hate you apparently as far as the super

59:29.720 --> 59:31.320
double standard.

59:31.320 --> 59:35.760
The Bill Gates and the Steve Jobs interview, joint interview proved that they hated each

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
other.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
Of course.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.760
Yeah.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.760
Yeah.

59:39.760 --> 59:40.760
That was a good interview.

59:40.760 --> 59:41.760
Yeah.

59:41.760 --> 59:42.760
See, I think it would be different too.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.760
Right?

59:43.760 --> 59:44.760
Like Bill Gates, much less attached to Microsoft.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.560
I don't think I would think anything of it.

59:46.560 --> 59:49.880
Now if like Sacha was doing it while they were trying to launch the next line of Windows

59:49.880 --> 59:53.000
phones, I'd be like, well, you can do whatever you want, but that's probably bad marketing

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
for your company.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Or Tim Cook using an Android.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Yeah.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
That would be crazy.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.520
And that would be, you know, that would be hard for them to explain it for.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.800
My argument would be like, if you have like, let's, especially the phones, cause the phone's

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.080
the easiest one.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.040
Let's say you have, you're a developer for some kind of platform and you have the other

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:14.280
phones that you carry around to test things and to make sure that they like to see that

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.920
it's true interactions with different features.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:20.040
In fact, you almost hope they do do that sometimes actually have references to see what does,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.960
what works and what doesn't and things like that.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.520
Like that would be a reasonable thing.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.900
I mean, if he was going onto like a Mac, an Apple stage or announcing the iPhone pulling

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.000
out a Samsung or something, that would be weird.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.080
But just having it in general is kind of ridiculous that people are freaking out.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.800
I feel like anybody that wants to criticize Jim and they're welcome to do it, but what

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.360
they should do first, if they don't want to be a D bag is they should pack up their laptop.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.360
They should take a long flight.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.880
They should try to prepare for a presentation in front of thousands and thousands of people

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.760
because it's also streamed and released on YouTube and a stand up there and give a presentation

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.080
about whatever the hell Jim talked about and then you can criticize them for using an iPad

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.080
or a Mac book.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.560
I really, I mean, at the end of the day, we really have to come to the understanding that

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.740
for the majority of people that are going to use Linux ever, it's just a tool.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:15.720
It is an ends to a means and many of them will never even know it is Linux and that

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.120
is the reality of our world and it's one that we've discussed before.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.560
It's one that Linus, we've read his quotes, he thinks it's great.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560
That's what it is.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560
And especially in the business space.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560
Definitely don't care.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560
Yeah.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.060
It kind of feels like it goes a little bit back to that, like the GPL enforcement questions

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:38.340
and like the writings Greg had on that and just about, you know, like if we come off

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:43.640
as this really aggressive, mean, super opinionated community, then it's really easy to see that

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.440
and not all the value here and instead of like, you know, we're all trying to push for

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.840
more open source, more DRM free things, all of this and a lot of times it's not the popular

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.760
opinion, so we need to be seen as nice people and so that we can have a reasonable discussion

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.060
with others and be like, look, we're not saying that you need this, but here's why it causes

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.060
us a problem.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.720
Well, why can't we just have the tone, you know, a little more chill, a little more mellow.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.420
Everybody just be kind to each other, be nice and know that everybody's in here because

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.140
they got a certain particular itch they're trying to scratch.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.920
They want to do it by writing code that's an expression for themselves and not every

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.620
single person has to be an advocate or an evangelist and Linux will be okay.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.960
It will continue to grow.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.120
It will go on and you'll still be able to log into your desktop.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.680
Don't don't get your system in a bunch now, especially when it's system because that could

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.000
be a real mess.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.080
So here we are.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.080
We are hard.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.280
We are hard up against our out time and I got to go to New York and I feel bad because

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.280
your caravan out.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280
Yeah.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280
Yeah.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.400
My ride is here and Caleb is he's going to quit listening to the show.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.120
Caleb tweeted me, punting the Gentoo challenge was funny, but now it's really irritating.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.280
Say what you do.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.400
He's got to quit the show now and I'm sorry, Caleb.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.960
I'm sure you guys will get to it next week, though.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960
Right.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960
I don't know if it would be right to do it without you.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960
Oh, no.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.120
I really want to find out about your Gentoo feelings.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.400
I think Chris is trying to ditch the gender responsibility.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
I will listen.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.200
I absolutely want to get into it because I spent all that time working on it.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.240
But the problem here is, is my ride.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240
I know.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.520
And so did Wes and Caleb is really, really upset.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.600
So I'll tell you what we're definitely going to do when I get back.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600
That's right.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600
We will for sure.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
All right.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.120
In the meantime, follow me live on my trip.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.280
I'm leaving in just a little bit at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Rover.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.120
That's also where I'll post videos at Chris Elias for the Twitter at Jupiter signal for

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.120
the network.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
At Wes Payne.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.840
And Beard, where would you like people to find you?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.400
Twitter dot com slash Rakai LP.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.920
Rakai LP on the Twitter.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.680
Very good.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680
Thank you for joining us, you guys.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680
Yeah.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680
Come back next week when it's the Beard and I.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680
Join you guys.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.680
Just you two.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680
I won't be here.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680
I hope you guys have a great show.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680
Be right back.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.680
Yeah.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680
And all that good stuff.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.680
We'll see you right.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.680
Well, they will see you.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680
I guess not me.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680
They'll see you right back.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:20.080
Thank you so much.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:38.840
Alright, so the title should probably either be about PipeWire, which would be my inclination,

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:45.480
but also I like this as a title because it's true, Linux Journalism is in a Nosedive, ahhh.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.480
Yeah.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.600
Thank you Mumble Room, you guys were great, appreciate it very much.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.520
Thank you Chris for having us.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.920
We will, well they will be back very soon, I have to go soon so we should pick our title.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:01.840
Well, I just want to point out that on next week's show and future shows, I should be

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.240
on my new honkin' desktop with that case I just got today.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240
Woo-woo!

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240
Excellent.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240
Congrats.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.120
And it's probably going to run Gen 2 10.01.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.120
Maniac mode engaged.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.640
Chugga chugga chugga chugga.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640
Gen 2!

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.480
Alright, yeah be titles, and also you can toss it in the Discord like I have if you

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.280
like for a title suggestion.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.600
I installed Discord and I don't even know what the freaking room is.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.160
Dev PipeWire is title number one right now, Chris hates us all, great suggestion, Popey's

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.160
porn problem.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
That was good.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.320
Did you notice how Popey just admitted to watching porn on the show?

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
And then he left.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
That's terrible.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.360
That's the best thing ever actually.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.880
We should call it, pipe out the crap, pipe in the light.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880
Yeah.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880
Oh beard.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.360
Hey Chris, what's the link to the Discord?

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.820
Discord dot me slash Jupiter colony will give you the invite link, and if you just want

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:15.520
to use the web app instead of the Electron, it's Discord.
