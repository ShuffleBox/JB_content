WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
So, Rotten Corpse is in here, let's, Rotten Corpse here.

00:04.560 --> 00:09.560
So we're in the, you know, pre-show discussion thread, and I'm sitting there grousing about

00:09.560 --> 00:14.260
the fact that I've done two installations of Ubuntu 16.04 today.

00:14.260 --> 00:20.280
One the Mate flavor, and one regular flavor, and I'm downloading Kubuntu 16.04.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.560
And I'm starting to grouse a little bit about the fact that I want Plasma 5.6 as my desktop,

00:25.560 --> 00:29.980
and there's no reasonable way to get Plasma 5.6 on Ubuntu 16.04.

00:29.980 --> 00:38.020
You have to use either A, Ubuntu 15.10, and then use Neon, or B, wait for the backports

00:38.020 --> 00:41.120
packages to get updated for 15.10, and download it that way.

00:41.120 --> 00:45.760
But there's really no way to get it for 16.04, because Neon is based on 15.10 right now,

00:45.760 --> 00:51.440
so it expects 15.10 repos and 15.10 packages to be pre-installed, and 16.04, there's no

00:51.440 --> 00:55.780
official way, there's no repo out there to get the Plasma 5.6 desktop.

00:55.780 --> 00:59.360
So I'm sitting here grousing about this, and you know what Rodden Corp says to me?

00:59.360 --> 01:02.960
He says, that's just a sign of a lack of patience.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
I disagree.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.960
I disagree.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.960
I disagree.

01:05.960 --> 01:11.580
I'm going to go farther than Rodden Corp's and say that Ubuntu and Canonical should probably

01:11.580 --> 01:14.120
just focus on doing, you know, Unity on.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.160
Oh, for, they absolutely, well that's what they do.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.160
That's all they do.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.160
Yeah, that's what they do.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.280
I mean, you know, even the community members that are now being supported and stuff, yeah,

01:23.280 --> 01:27.280
see if they want to, you know, but outside of the project, I would go for that way.

01:27.280 --> 01:31.440
No, here's where I think it's weird, is it's weird to me that something that's the latest

01:31.440 --> 01:34.760
in development isn't available for something that's in the latest in development.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.760
I understand why, right?

01:35.760 --> 01:37.840
Oh, because we haven't had a chance to base it and test it.

01:37.840 --> 01:44.640
It seems like, it just seems like such an old way of doing software, it feels so weird

01:44.640 --> 01:48.480
that I want to install the latest version of Ubuntu and I don't get to install the latest

01:48.480 --> 01:49.640
version of a Plasma desktop.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.760
Like those two things, like I can't believe those two things coexist.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.960
And if this is not, this is not an impossible problem to solve and other distributions have

01:56.960 --> 02:01.000
solved this problem, some of them fundamentally from the way they're based and others just

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
using other tricks.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.380
It just, it really kind of strikes me as having now, I'm not trying to make this an Arch versus

02:07.380 --> 02:12.440
Ubuntu thing, but now being two years or plus deep into using Arch and then now using Ubuntu

02:12.440 --> 02:18.120
leading up to our review, it really strikes me as a totally old way of doing things, much

02:18.120 --> 02:23.360
like when you go back on a system that uses a really old init system like we're going

02:23.360 --> 02:24.960
to talk about later today, right?

02:24.960 --> 02:29.280
It really feels like a super, or like if you install a distribution that doesn't have a

02:29.280 --> 02:34.080
gooey partitioner and you have to use F disk or CF disk, like that's fine.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.600
And you know, okay, I kind of remember how to do that, but it seems like I shouldn't

02:37.600 --> 02:38.780
have to do that anymore.

02:38.780 --> 02:44.360
So it's not like, it's not a matter of impatience, it just seems like an old model, an old way

02:44.360 --> 02:50.480
of delivering software on a system that is constant, like it's, if 1604 is like as cutting

02:50.480 --> 02:54.920
edges you can get for Ubuntu and you still can't get cutting edge packages on it, I fundamentally

02:54.920 --> 03:00.080
understand the mechanics and the reasons why, but to me it seems like we should have solved

03:00.080 --> 03:02.760
this by now.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.360
There's also another little detail, it's an understanding of marketing.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.440
I mean, if you are going to try and have a bad experience, even though it's development

03:10.440 --> 03:13.880
and you know it's development, you're going to talk bad about it.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.740
And so they actually have something to protect versus the other, don't necessarily have

03:19.740 --> 03:20.740
that protection.

03:20.740 --> 03:26.640
I'm not even talking about canonical shipping anything or Ubuntu releasing anything.

03:26.640 --> 03:33.680
I'm just simply coming down to, it's really weird to me that there are packages for some

03:33.680 --> 03:37.540
Ubuntu systems that I can install on some systems.

03:37.540 --> 03:44.400
Like for example, I almost guarantee you I could install a Kubuntu 15.10, get all the

03:44.400 --> 03:49.880
prereqs that I need installed, install Neon, upgrade the son of a bitch to 1604 with Neon

03:49.880 --> 03:52.000
still installed and I bet you it would run just fine.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.360
Like if I just rejigger the approach, if I jump through these hoops appropriately, I

03:56.360 --> 03:59.600
could trick the software into installing through the package manager.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.080
I shouldn't have to do that though, it's weird.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.520
I'm not talking about who's releasing what or what community is supporting what, I'm

04:05.520 --> 04:11.560
talking about fundamentally this is an old way of managing your software on a Linux box.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.440
It's just weird and it's good by the way that I'm bitching about this now, let me tell you

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
why.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.360
Because I'm getting all of this out of my system before it comes time to actually do

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
the review.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.520
So by the time I actually sit down and review Ubuntu 1604, this will be old news to me.

04:24.520 --> 04:29.360
And it's honestly, it's because what I'm doing is because I'm testing the different desktops,

04:29.360 --> 04:39.460
I keep redoing installations so I keep setting up from scratch with new installs and I tell

04:39.460 --> 04:42.600
you what, it has been tedious.

04:42.600 --> 04:58.480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 138 for March 29th, 2016.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's been installing distributions

05:02.360 --> 05:03.500
all morning long.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
My name is Chris.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
My name is Wes.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500
Hey there, Wes.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.240
It has been an install fest here at the JB1 studio.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.240
It always is.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.240
That's true.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.680
But it's really kicked up into high gear recently.

05:12.680 --> 05:18.440
I've been going through and installing different iterations of Ubuntu 1604 for upcoming review.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.560
Oh my gosh, I got thoughts on that.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.520
But that's not actually what we're here to talk about today.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.820
Coming up on the Unplugged program, we have a whole bunch of updates on some of our favorite

05:26.820 --> 05:29.440
open source projects at the top of the show.

05:29.440 --> 05:34.200
Then I'll give you my tale of ordering the new Ubuntu tablet, the first Ubuntu tablet

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
available for pre-order.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
Have you seen this thing?

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
Yeah.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.420
We're going to talk about that.

05:38.420 --> 05:45.200
And then later on in the show, Wes, prepare your body, prepare yourself, Linux distributions

05:45.200 --> 05:47.080
are old news.

05:47.080 --> 05:53.920
We have two brand new Unix eyes, one that is actually based on Linux and one that says

05:53.920 --> 05:55.720
Linux could learn a few things from us.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.900
We're going to give you our thoughts on these two game changers, as they call themselves.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.800
And then later on, towards the end of the show, I've got a little bit of a fast update.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.080
And Wes, you will testify to this.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.180
I had to write it down.

06:07.180 --> 06:08.180
There's so much to cover.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.180
Oh, it's complex.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.180
Right?

06:10.180 --> 06:12.960
I was pen and paper writing this down because I can remember it, you know?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.820
So a lot in the show today.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.840
A lot to cover.

06:17.840 --> 06:22.100
But before we start any of that, we really can go no further without bringing in that

06:22.100 --> 06:23.100
mumble room.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.720
Time appropriate greetings there, virtual dog.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.720
Hello.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Hello.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
Hello.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.720
Pip pip.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
Hello.

06:29.720 --> 06:35.940
So I just mentioned a few seconds ago, so you probably heard me say it, that I was installing

06:35.940 --> 06:39.320
me a whole lot of Ubuntu earlier today.

06:39.320 --> 06:44.900
And I got to say, right here, I think the software boutique might be the best thing

06:44.900 --> 06:46.760
to happen to Ubuntu since Ubuntu.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
Wow.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
Straight up, full stop.

06:48.760 --> 06:56.060
The software boutique, I think it is now going on anything that is Ubuntu-based, regardless

06:56.060 --> 06:59.520
if it is the Mate desktop environment or not.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.120
And Wimpy, I wanted to ask you if you have considered releasing this, I know it must

07:04.120 --> 07:06.720
rely on apt heavily and PPAs.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.000
This could really be a thing.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.240
I mean, this is a great tool.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.320
And so it must be possible to use it on other Ubuntus, correct?

07:14.320 --> 07:15.640
Yes.

07:15.640 --> 07:23.560
It's all built using the same tools that power things like the Ubuntu software updater and

07:23.560 --> 07:24.880
stuff like that.

07:24.880 --> 07:32.320
So do I add it as a PPA if I'm on a different spin of Ubuntu, or how does that work?

07:32.320 --> 07:38.640
Well, the software boutique is part and parcel of Ubuntu Mate welcome.

07:38.640 --> 07:45.760
So if you install Ubuntu-Mate-welcome on any Ubuntu, it will just install.

07:45.760 --> 07:51.360
Okay so Ubuntu, I'm doing it right now, it's welcome, see, okay, let's see here.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.040
I have this on this neon machine, let's see, whoa, that's a whole lot of packages it wants

07:55.040 --> 07:56.040
to pull down there.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.160
Yeah, if you're on a KDE machine, it's going to need a lot of GTK dependencies.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.480
It is though, I have to tell you, when I sit down and I set up a machine, I can launch

08:06.480 --> 08:12.560
the software boutique, what I think is really great about it, Wimpy, is the application

08:12.560 --> 08:18.560
choice is, I don't know if it was you that picked them or who, who picked the applications

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
that are featured?

08:19.560 --> 08:28.760
So it was myself and Matt Hartley and Luke Corwell, who's the primary developer for software

08:28.760 --> 08:30.480
boutique and welcome now.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
You guys nailed it.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Interesting.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
You guys totally nailed it.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.760
It's just, it's the good stuff and it takes care of all of the clunky PPA stuff in the

08:38.760 --> 08:44.480
background and it's just click, click, click, click and you're going, all right, so my installation

08:44.480 --> 08:45.480
is done.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.800
So now if I would, would I just run welcome or boutique?

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
I probably want to run the software.

08:48.800 --> 08:54.680
So you can find either Ubuntu mate welcome or the software boutique in the control center

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
hopefully.

08:55.680 --> 09:01.440
I mean it's KDE though so I don't know where you find it but from the terminal, you can

09:01.440 --> 09:09.040
run Ubuntu dash mate dash welcome and then hang on, I'm going to give you the secret

09:09.040 --> 09:10.040
source.

09:10.040 --> 09:16.840
So it's Ubuntu dash mate dash welcome space, dash, dash, software dash only.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.840
Ah, okay.

09:20.840 --> 09:27.000
Type that in and it is launching and then yeah, okay, software.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.480
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.480
Thank you.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.080
So now I can make this rig even better.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.080
Perfect.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
I love it.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.080
This is such a nice tool.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.680
It's worth installing all those dependencies for me.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.800
Maybe it should be in one of those app image containers.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.480
Yeah, I described it as it makes installing Ubuntu easier than Antigros, which that's

09:46.480 --> 09:47.480
really something.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.480
That's a lot, yeah.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
That's really something.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
But I mean it's one click.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.480
And that's the whole point.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.760
You know, the whole point is this is supposed to be a low barrier of entry install system

09:56.760 --> 10:03.720
of just the stuff you need for people new to Ubuntu or lazy people like me.

10:03.720 --> 10:09.040
So I'm sure everyone in the mumble room and everyone that's listening has done this.

10:09.040 --> 10:13.640
You have a collection of scripts that you can somewhere and when you install a new machine,

10:13.640 --> 10:18.640
you then run a whole swathe of shell scripts which install this and that and configure

10:18.640 --> 10:20.160
things where you want.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.860
And this is taking all of those scripts of things I used to install and just putting

10:24.860 --> 10:26.920
them in one place that anyone can use.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.080
You're sharing them with everyone.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
And how does it work?

10:30.080 --> 10:32.920
Why does it work on both 1510 and 1604?

10:32.920 --> 10:36.560
Because when I try to add a PPAs for one, it doesn't work for the other.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.480
So how does that work exactly?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.200
What are you doing on the back end?

10:40.200 --> 10:48.160
So on the back end, there's a small database which is just a JSON file called applications.json.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.960
It's very, you know, cleverly named.

10:51.960 --> 10:56.280
And in there, it's a list of all of the applications and it has some properties in there.

10:56.280 --> 11:05.080
So it will say something like this piece of software only works on I386 and I864 or this

11:05.080 --> 11:10.480
piece of software is compatible with trusty Wiley and Xenial.

11:10.480 --> 11:16.480
But then it will say on trusty and Wiley use this PPA on Xenial use the official archive.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.820
And on this one, because I'm like on some neon hybrid, it says, OK, it's not available

11:19.820 --> 11:20.820
for this one.

11:20.820 --> 11:21.820
OK.

11:21.820 --> 11:23.400
I try to install it.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.360
The operating system that you're using should be Wiley, right?

11:28.360 --> 11:29.360
What have you installed?

11:29.360 --> 11:33.520
This here, this is a 1510 with neon and they changed some of the repo stuff.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
Right.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
OK.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.400
So that will work as though it's Wiley.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
Yeah.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.880
So, for example, if there's stuff that hasn't been released for Xenial yet, you won't see

11:42.880 --> 11:47.240
it in the 1604 version, but you will see it in the Wiley version.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
Yeah.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.120
And it looks like my GTK theme.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.840
So whatever desktop theme I'm using, it looks it looks nice.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.560
It looks actually really good under plasma to a surprise.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.040
Yeah, it really isn't offensive.

11:57.040 --> 12:05.860
It's really and if you run if you run welcome itself, there's a little button in the top

12:05.860 --> 12:11.800
of welcome where it's going to also appear in the software boutique as well to say subscribe

12:11.800 --> 12:13.600
to updates.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.520
And what that does is that actually keeps your version of welcome and the software boutique

12:17.520 --> 12:23.960
in step with the absolute latest stuff as new applications become available.

12:23.960 --> 12:29.840
So when, for example, Oracle release VirtualBox Xenial, that will turn up in the software

12:29.840 --> 12:34.800
boutique for you and other things like that will just sort of come online as the support

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
gets added.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.960
Isn't that a nice tool when you're on a new distro like that and stuff isn't completely

12:38.960 --> 12:43.760
ready at launch, that is just show up when it's ready.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.560
I would argue that it shouldn't be a problem in the first place, but you know, that is

12:47.560 --> 12:48.560
actually pretty good.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.160
I would say that.

12:50.160 --> 12:54.360
So I just wanted to say thank you because it was a heck of a tool for me today as I

12:54.360 --> 12:59.160
was setting up three different Ubuntu rigs and now I just put it on a plasma desktop.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
So there you go.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
It works from all over.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
You can use it anywhere.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.160
Yeah, you really can.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
You really can.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.160
All right.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.280
So before we go too much further, I should mention we are enjoying ourselves a Fremont

13:08.280 --> 13:10.080
interurban do you think, Wes?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
IPA.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.760
Well, there you go.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.760
Because beer matters.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.640
So that's our – so if you in the lug there have yourself some beverage, you can crack

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
it open now.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.180
There it is.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.180
And that's what we'll be enjoying.

13:21.180 --> 13:25.040
It is ranked at 86 which is pretty good, very good actually.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
And it has a –

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
Just a few minutes south.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
Yeah?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
Really?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
Down in Fremont in Seattle.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.560
Oh, they've been that free.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.600
You have been nailing the local beers lately.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.080
I do what I can.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.760
Are you doing that on purpose, Wes?

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
Maybe.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
A little local flair.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.040
You know what would be great?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.120
We should treat the guys when they come out for Linux Fest.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.120
Mm-hmm.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.120
All right.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.120
We'll save that for the Linux Fest talk coming up.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
All right.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
Let's do some updates.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.400
This one caught both Wes and my attention today and we're like, okay, this might be

13:52.400 --> 13:54.160
something worth talking about.

13:54.160 --> 14:00.600
There is hubbub coming out from Mary Jo Foley over at All Things About Microsoft at the

14:00.600 --> 14:07.160
ZDNet talking about day one of build Microsoft might announce an Ubuntu-based bash shell

14:07.160 --> 14:09.720
running on top of Windows 10.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
What?

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
Yeah.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.080
It seems that bash on Ubuntu will figure in somehow.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
Bash is a Linux shell, she mentions.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.080
I don't know if you knew that.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
Did you know that?

14:17.080 --> 14:18.080
No.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.080
I was going to ask.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.080
I'm glad you said.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
Stands for the born shell.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
She says.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.080
That's what she says right there.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.080
Stands for, and it has plugins, she says.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.080
Ooh.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.560
I love it when Mary Jo, who I respect, is trying to cover a Linux technology.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
That's right.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
She just is so often.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.560
That's good though.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.560
She's doing a good job.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.560
To employ text commands.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.560
Yes.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
I love that ability.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
Thanks, Bash.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.840
So as someone has noted on Twitter today, there's already ways of getting bash shell

14:40.840 --> 14:45.400
of course running on Windows, which was news to Mary Jo, which of course as we all know

14:45.400 --> 14:50.640
is Sigwin, but Microsoft has been brewing on something that goes a step beyond that.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.120
In Redstone builds, which are new builds of Windows 10 spotted recently, there was a Linux

14:55.120 --> 15:00.880
subsystem added to Windows 10, a Linux subsystem in the new builds of Windows 10, and so we

15:00.880 --> 15:07.760
might find very soon at the build conference, which is, I don't know, coming up soon.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.760
Doesn't really matter.

15:08.760 --> 15:14.220
Coming up soon, the build 26 developer conference, we may see them launch Bash based on Ubuntu

15:14.220 --> 15:15.480
on Windows 10.

15:15.480 --> 15:19.440
Popey, are you switching?

15:19.440 --> 15:20.960
From what to what?

15:20.960 --> 15:26.760
Well now you can have your Ubuntu command line with your Windows 10 desktop environment.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
What else do you need?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
Cortana.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.760
Yeah, yeah.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.760
Cortana.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
Yeah.

15:31.760 --> 15:36.520
So I could say to Cortana, RM minus RF slash.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
I hope so.

15:37.520 --> 15:42.680
I hope they, I mean if they're dumb enough to put that stupid Tay AI robot online, they

15:42.680 --> 15:44.680
might be dumb enough to make it that easy.

15:44.680 --> 15:51.440
You know, speaking, I mean, not to pile up on Microsoft right now, but can we just take

15:51.440 --> 15:54.120
a minute and just talk about how out of touch they are?

15:54.120 --> 16:00.360
Like the idea that the reason why, the idea that them putting a bash shell on Windows

16:00.360 --> 16:04.800
is what's going to keep me developing on Windows is kind of adorable.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.200
And it just shows how disconnected they are from what people actually want.

16:08.200 --> 16:13.280
Much like this commercial about the Microsoft cloud helping the digital crimes unit fight,

16:13.280 --> 16:15.360
you guessed it, cyber crime.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.360
Check this thing out.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.080
The biggest challenge for business today is not competition.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.520
Okay, the biggest challenge is what?

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
Cyber crime.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.600
You got it, buddy.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.360
It's protecting customer trust.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.400
Every day you read headlines about governments and businesses being hacked, emails compromised,

16:31.400 --> 16:34.080
and intellectual property being stolen.

16:34.080 --> 16:39.080
That is cyber crime and it affects each and every one of us.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.600
So how do we fix this?

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
Cloud dude.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
Oh.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.280
Microsoft created the digital crimes unit to investigate and fight cyber crime.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.280
They don't have any big screens right now.

16:49.280 --> 16:54.600
They use the Microsoft cloud to visualize information so we can track down the criminals.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.400
So they use the cloud to visualize information so they can track down criminals.

16:59.400 --> 17:05.280
And what they're showing here is a huge screen, which is literally sitting in front of a huge

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
screen.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.280
Do you see that?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
Are these bigger or smaller than this Fox News giant screen?

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
They're about the same size.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.800
But do you see what they literally are doing is they are literally standing in front of

17:11.800 --> 17:17.180
a screen that is blocking their field of view, which is then in front of it another larger

17:17.180 --> 17:21.400
screen that they probably literally cannot even see while they're doing pinch to zoom

17:21.400 --> 17:24.800
on a cloud powered map because they have cloud.

17:24.800 --> 17:30.420
We use the Microsoft cloud to visualize information so we can track down the criminals.

17:30.420 --> 17:35.280
Using our advanced analytics tools, analysis that used to take days to run, we can now

17:35.280 --> 17:37.480
see in real time.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.800
And we're building what we learned back into the cloud to make...

17:40.800 --> 17:43.620
So here's what else is really weird is you notice how they keep zooming in on the United

17:43.620 --> 17:44.620
States.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.560
Like they keep showing cities and stuff in the US like they're watching the United States

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
traffic.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.760
But I guess, you know, when you have the cloud, you're everywhere.

17:50.760 --> 17:55.480
Back into the cloud to make people and organizations safer.

17:55.480 --> 18:01.520
When it comes to the cloud, trust and security are paramount.

18:01.520 --> 18:08.560
Our passion is making life tougher for cybercriminals and making it safer for you and your customers.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.400
Microsoft come run Ubuntu on our cloud.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
Don't let that baby on the internet.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.880
Like that's what's so great about the Microsoft cloud is that more and more it's used to run

18:15.880 --> 18:16.880
Linux.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
So yeah, have that at everybody.

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
Isn't that great?

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
Yep.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
Yeah.

18:20.880 --> 18:29.080
Honestly, the company that's got the most egregious terms of use and YOLO out there

18:29.080 --> 18:35.880
that is totally designed to invade your privacy at the drop of a hat is trying to pitch their

18:35.880 --> 18:39.400
cloud platform as the opposite of that.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.900
Wimby, I would ask you this one basic question.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.160
Where do you think they're getting all of the metrics that they use to visualize and

18:45.160 --> 18:47.640
put back into the Microsoft cloud to hunt cybercrime?

18:47.640 --> 18:50.040
Where do you suppose those metrics come from?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.000
I can't imagine.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Exactly.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Hmm.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Hmm.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I wonder where that is.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.240
They also have a new other upside, which is the telcos are moving to put their infrastructure

19:03.240 --> 19:05.720
on quote unquote cloud.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.300
And they're pretty much actually hiring a lot.

19:07.300 --> 19:12.840
If you look at most of the mobile companies and telcos are hiring people for cloud development

19:12.840 --> 19:15.160
of their infrastructure technology.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.160
Yeah.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.160
Cloud.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.160
Yeah.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.160
Okay.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.920
We're not going to spend a lot of time on this, but there is a significant amount of

19:21.920 --> 19:26.520
game news updates to do really briefly that we're just going to spend a couple of moments.

19:26.520 --> 19:30.220
And the first one is partially because it takes me back to when I finally had to save

19:30.220 --> 19:34.480
up my own money to get my own first Matrox graphic card.

19:34.480 --> 19:40.360
And this Matrox graphics card had this expandable RAM module to go up to like eight megabytes

19:40.360 --> 19:41.360
of RAM.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
No way.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
Or four megs maybe.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.360
I can't remember.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.440
That forever changed my gaming.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
Tomb Raider.

19:48.440 --> 20:08.440
And now it's coming to Linux again.

20:08.440 --> 20:19.880
So much has happened.

20:19.880 --> 20:24.000
I'm super excited about this game just because I've been wanting to play a Tomb Raider game.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Our captain is injured.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.040
Have you heard from any of the others?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
Nothing.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Takes me way back.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
Our crew is exhausted.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
It sure does.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.920
I have a bad feeling about this.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.940
So Tomb Raider is coming out for the Linux desktop soon.

20:36.940 --> 20:39.880
And we don't have a date yet, but we have details in the show notes that say reboot

20:39.880 --> 20:44.920
is going to hit Linux and Steam OS this spring is the guesstimated ship date, so stay tuned

20:44.920 --> 20:46.180
for that.

20:46.180 --> 20:50.960
Another game coming out, Two Worlds 3, which is in development, and Two Worlds 2 is coming

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
to Linux.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.960
That's only a little confusing.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.960
Right.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.800
Two Worlds 3, which is likely to come to Linux, which is in development, and Two Worlds 2,

20:56.800 --> 21:02.200
which is getting an engine remake, graphics assets, a new DLC is coming to Linux.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.200
So that's a game coming.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.040
And then another game that's actually hit public beta right now, hitting Linux within

21:07.040 --> 21:11.960
the last week, is Darkest Dungeon, which is a roguelike turn-based RPG, which just got

21:11.960 --> 21:14.040
its public beta.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.160
And I will just give you a brief taste of what it's like.

21:16.160 --> 21:30.240
There is a great horror beneath the manor, a crawling chaos that must be destroyed.

21:30.240 --> 21:40.400
The task ahead is terrible, and weakness cannot be tolerated.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.480
So that's Darkest Dungeon, and the public beta is out right now.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.480
So there you go.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.520
Oh, and one more, Payday 2, which has had a bit of controversy in the past, has hit

21:48.520 --> 21:52.640
Steam OS and is going free for the rest of March to play online.

21:52.640 --> 21:57.300
And they're doing it specifically to celebrate the Steam OS launch.

21:57.300 --> 22:02.280
So if you want to throw a little love, nothing out of pocket, I don't think, to get Payday

22:02.280 --> 22:04.100
2, at least not for the online play.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.440
So there you go.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.880
That concludes your Valve Steam game Linux proprietary gaming update.

22:09.880 --> 22:10.880
Faster than ever.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.880
Yeah.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.560
I tried to bust through it super fast for those of you who don't care.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.000
One more little thing, though, kind of gaming-related.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.280
Ferronix has a pretty good comparison right now of AMD graphics cards versus Nvidia graphics

22:22.280 --> 22:23.280
cards using Vulkan.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.280
Oh, really?

22:24.280 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, and early game reports on Vulkan coming in now.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.560
So if you are curious about that, Ferronix has that.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
You can go check that out.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.960
Yeah, I want to play games.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.240
I just want to play games.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.880
But we've got to get real for a second.

22:36.880 --> 22:41.840
I don't normally mention alpha releases as an open source, like, project follow-up thing,

22:41.840 --> 22:45.700
but I am going to mention Fedora 24 alpha, which shipped today, and only because it sort

22:45.700 --> 22:50.000
of codifies something that we already knew well in advance, and that is that Wayland

22:50.000 --> 22:55.280
will not be shipping as default in Fedora 24.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.080
They read here, we've decided not to make Wayland the next generation graphics stack

22:58.080 --> 23:00.160
the default in Fedora 24 workstation.

23:00.160 --> 23:04.240
However, Wayland remains available as an option, and the workstation team would greatly appreciate

23:04.240 --> 23:06.280
your help in testing.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.980
Our goal is one full release where the non-default Wayland option works seamlessly or reasonably

23:10.980 --> 23:17.320
close to that, and at that point, we'll make Wayland the default with X11 as the fallback.

23:17.320 --> 23:24.680
Here's my question, mumble room, does this mean we will not have a mainstream Linux distribution

23:24.680 --> 23:29.240
shipping with Wayland in 2016, as in another year will pass without Wayland shipping as

23:29.240 --> 23:32.560
the default on a mainstream distribution?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.640
It's possible.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.640
Yeah, I think it does mean that, doesn't it?

23:39.640 --> 23:44.640
I think it just means we just clocked another year without Wayland.

23:44.640 --> 23:51.640
Now, if Mir could close the gap, the year of Mir has been doing its work well.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.400
If we use the year of 2016 to polish it up, obviously that's worth it.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
I'm just pointing it out.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.680
It's just worth maybe mentioning.

23:58.680 --> 24:02.480
It's funny to realize that when it's still only March.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.280
It's good for things like SteamOS, right?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.320
I don't think it was ever going to be a problem for SteamOS.

24:07.320 --> 24:11.220
They would have hung out on X probably for a while, but you're right, anytime you can

24:11.220 --> 24:15.160
refine the process and get it better and get another year of driver development in.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.160
That's probably good.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.000
If we can make the switch that much better, more seamless.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.160
Of course, there's going to be distros out there you could load.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
Well, today.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.480
Right, you could use it today.

24:25.480 --> 24:31.440
We're only a week into NVIDIA supporting Wayland on their proprietary driver.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.760
This is probably a good idea.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.080
Also, if you go down to the alpha, you can get your hands on GNOME 3.20.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.080
2.0.

24:37.080 --> 24:40.880
Yeah, you get the new GNOME, which would be pretty nice, a good way to get that.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.160
It looks like overall a pretty cool alpha, and they mentioned you may have some issues

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
with old themes.

24:45.160 --> 24:51.880
But yeah, I just thought that was... I bet everyone, aw, okay, okay, yeah, okay, no Wayland,

24:51.880 --> 24:52.880
no Wayland.

24:52.880 --> 25:00.120
Also, speaking of updates from distributions, Arch has a doozy, which... Hey, Rekai, note

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
this one down, okay?

25:01.120 --> 25:05.120
I better let Rekai know because we got some servers here we got to update.

25:05.120 --> 25:10.560
Pac-Man needs to be updated on your Arch box before April 23rd, and I'm going to be too

25:10.560 --> 25:14.120
busy at LinuxFest to remind you guys, so you got to stay on top of this yourself.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.360
This is Chris helping you out right now.

25:16.360 --> 25:22.600
In order to use the new hooks, the new fancy hooks, they say, we require all users to update

25:22.600 --> 25:29.200
the latest Pac-Man 5.0.1 before April 23rd, 2016, which, by the way, guys, has been out

25:29.200 --> 25:30.200
since February 23rd.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.200
So get your freaking updates on.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
Dash SYU already.

25:32.200 --> 25:37.480
You're getting two months, so get on it, otherwise you're going to be in a world of hurt.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.200
You're going to have to probably go download that stuff manually.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
So there you go.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.200
Oh, thanks.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.200
Wait, really, Rekai?

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
Really?

25:44.200 --> 25:46.320
Oh, he says he already did it.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.320
Look at that, Rekai.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.320
Good man.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.920
Man, that guy, he gets an internet cookie.

25:49.920 --> 25:50.920
Hello, everybody.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.800
Well, that's the best I got for right now.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.120
That's the best I got.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
So there you go.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.120
Go update your Arch boxes.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.840
The first thing I thought of is, oh, no big deal, and then I looked over, you see that

25:58.840 --> 26:00.120
machine we have running right there?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
Yes, I do.

26:01.120 --> 26:07.460
GNOME 3 desktop running on Arch, that runs OBS and VLC and NGINX and fancy stuff to do

26:07.460 --> 26:09.560
internal RTSP streams.

26:09.560 --> 26:15.920
I haven't updated that thing since like December, I think, maybe January.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
What are you doing this afternoon?

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
Yeah.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.920
Yeah.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.920
Well, the problem is that I break it when I do the updates.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.240
Then I have to be like, Rekai, come fix it.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.920
I don't have time to fix OBS because it's usually the NGINX installer or something that

26:26.920 --> 26:27.920
breaks.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
You know what I need to do?

26:28.920 --> 26:32.800
I need to shut that knockoff and move it over to a DigitalOcean droplet.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.520
Oh, DigitalOcean, sponsor right here on the Linux unplugged program.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.760
Here's our promo code DOUNPLUGGED over at DigitalOcean.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.760
Use it.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
See out there?

26:41.760 --> 26:42.760
DOUNPLUGGED.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.080
You got to turn off a knock and just go spin up a droplet.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.280
Less than 55 seconds, you'll have a machine that's ready to go, and they start at only

26:48.280 --> 26:54.200
$5 a month or 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte

26:54.200 --> 26:55.200
of transfer.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.200
That's the starting price.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.760
It only gets better from there.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.760
It does, and they're all SSDs, and the bandwidth transfer just gets more.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.920
It's a really great, simple-to-use cloud hosting service.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.240
You can go spin up your own Linux rig.

27:05.240 --> 27:09.400
They got Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, FreeBSD if you want that.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.720
They got CoreOS, because why not?

27:11.720 --> 27:16.600
Go put it in a Docker container or a rocket thingy or whatever, Alex.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
I don't care.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
Just go do it, right?

27:18.600 --> 27:19.600
Go do it.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.060
You know, we've been seeing a lot of people saying, hey, do you guys want to create a

27:22.060 --> 27:26.040
how-to guide on installing own cloud?

27:26.040 --> 27:31.120
Just go over to DigitalOcean and just click the one-click deployment, and what's great

27:31.120 --> 27:34.720
about it is like if you screw up your own cloud installation, like you just mess it

27:34.720 --> 27:38.440
all up, you can go back and redeploy that base image again, and it's right back.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
Own cloud installed.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
Ubuntu's installed.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.440
Good to go.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.440
It's like, okay, that wasn't so bad.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.440
Put your data back in.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.440
Bob's your uncle.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.660
They have a great interface, a really nice intuitive API that you can write around or

27:48.660 --> 27:51.960
just take advantage of some of the open source code that's already out there, a community

27:51.960 --> 27:57.720
tutorial section that is, honestly, it beats everybody out there, tons of really great

27:57.720 --> 27:58.800
help out there.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.560
So not only do they have the one-click applications, but if you just want to do a basic rig and

28:03.560 --> 28:07.780
just set it up yourself or you want to build on top of it, really good tutorial.

28:07.780 --> 28:13.080
So just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED at a $10 credit, support the show, and spin yourself

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
up a droplet.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.200
DigitalOcean.com, data centers all over the world.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.200
Check them out at DigitalOcean.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.400
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
Thank you.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
Hey, DO.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Thanks, man.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.400
Thank you.

28:25.400 --> 28:31.040
I'm pretty excited about this, only I have been pulling my hair out about this new Ubuntu

28:31.040 --> 28:32.740
M10 tablet.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.860
So there's two versions right now.

28:34.860 --> 28:41.000
There's the HD version, the 1920 by 1080, and then there's a, quote, unquote, HD version,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.640
which is more like 720p.

28:43.640 --> 28:49.640
And I think it was announced yesterday for pre-order, coming from BQ.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.560
It's the Ubuntu M10 Aquarius, Ubuntu edition, or whatever.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.320
Going to have 16.04 on it, probably shipping in March, April-ish.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
No.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
No?

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
Not 16.04.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
No.

29:02.320 --> 29:09.560
Current build, it'll be OTA 10, which is based off Vivid, so that's 15.04, but we'll move

29:09.560 --> 29:10.560
to 16.04 soon.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.720
You know, they say 16.04 in the product marketing there.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
Oh, dear.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.720
But-

29:15.720 --> 29:18.440
It's interesting, because I saw it say 15.10, actually.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.240
Well, I'm talking about just right here in the imagery.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.160
I don't know about in the actual specs.

29:24.160 --> 29:29.280
You know, either way, I mean, that's sort of not the big point.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
That's not the big story.

29:30.280 --> 29:35.560
The big story is, it's our first crack at ordering an official Ubuntu tablet.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.120
That's the story, right?

29:37.120 --> 29:38.120
That's pretty exciting.

29:38.120 --> 29:42.320
Poby, are you, tell me, do you have to buy it yourself, or are you just going to be getting

29:42.320 --> 29:44.680
one, or how does that work?

29:44.680 --> 29:50.600
So, for some, looking around me, I have a bunch of devices that I have been given, but

29:50.600 --> 29:52.440
I do buy my own as well.

29:52.440 --> 29:57.200
So I like to know what the consumer experience is.

29:57.200 --> 30:04.360
So I have two machines side by side, and I have one that's running the latest stable

30:04.360 --> 30:07.800
and one that's running unstable, so I can tell and compare and contrast.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.960
So yeah, I'll probably end up buying myself one.

30:09.960 --> 30:15.840
I might get one from work, but I'll probably buy myself one anyway.

30:15.840 --> 30:20.120
I don't know what my problem is, but I can't get my order to go through.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.120
I don't know if other people-

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
Actually, I heard from somebody else-

30:22.120 --> 30:23.520
Bad credit, Chris.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.960
Somebody else on Twitter is having this problem, but I put my order in, I put my shipping address,

30:26.960 --> 30:32.040
I created my account, and then when I click on place order, the page just refreshes and

30:32.040 --> 30:41.560
it goes from $299 to $799, or it actually goes from $299.90 to $799 price, and then

30:41.560 --> 30:44.440
I hit proceed to check out just to see what happens, and it just – nothing happens.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
It never proceeds.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.160
I can't actually proceed to place an order, and I've tried for the last couple of days.

30:49.160 --> 30:53.320
So I have not been able to order one yet, but I definitely want to get one.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.640
I think it would be – I don't know.

30:55.640 --> 30:59.160
Have you heard, Poppy, about how many there are?

30:59.160 --> 31:00.880
Am I going to run out if I don't get an order in soon?

31:00.880 --> 31:02.280
What's the word there?

31:02.280 --> 31:03.280
I don't know, actually.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.760
I don't know how many they're planning to manufacture.

31:05.760 --> 31:12.720
Usually when it's a pre-order, the fact that you're ordering them means that they take

31:12.720 --> 31:19.440
those numbers and manufacture a certain number for the demand, but no, I don't know.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.920
I've not seen that problem at all.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.080
So I've heard from only one other person that's having the problem.

31:24.080 --> 31:29.400
This has got a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek ARM processor in there, 10.1-inch screen,

31:29.400 --> 31:34.520
8-megapixel camera, it looks like, and this is going to be the one that gives us convergence,

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
right?

31:35.520 --> 31:39.520
This will be a tablet that you can hook up to a keyboard and mouse and have a full desktop

31:39.520 --> 31:40.520
experience.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.520
Oh, that's awesome.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.520
Yep.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.520
And you can either use the internal display or – it's got a mini HDMI port, so you can

31:45.520 --> 31:47.960
just plug in an external display if you want a bigger display.

31:47.960 --> 31:48.960
That's a big feature.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.960
You can use internal or external.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.560
That isn't being talked about that much.

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
Mini HDMI, you mean?

31:52.560 --> 31:53.560
Well, just –

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
Yeah.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
Yeah.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
The convergence aspect of it, that's why I want to get my hands on it.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
Right.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
I want to try it.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
Yeah.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
I really want to try it because I think that's going to be –

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
That makes it a lot more interesting.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.160
And plus, not only do I want to try it, but I'm sure it's going to be something that's

32:03.160 --> 32:06.440
going to be iterated on for years, or at least for a while.

32:06.440 --> 32:11.520
And so I want to see it as that process matures, as that experience matures.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.880
And so that's why I want to get one, but for goodness sakes, I can't get the order in no

32:14.880 --> 32:15.880
matter what I do.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.880
I do not know.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.880
Yeah.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.440
I've also tried it in Chrome and Firefox.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.800
I've tried it with no ad blocks turned on.

32:23.800 --> 32:29.600
I'm just really happy they didn't cut the corners with the display in order to get at

32:29.600 --> 32:33.480
that price point because when I saw that it was full HD, I'm like, oh, this is an absolute

32:33.480 --> 32:34.480
buy.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.480
Oh, really?

32:35.480 --> 32:40.000
You're not worried about maybe applications that you don't want that aren't available

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
or something like that?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
No.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
That will be solved with time.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Yeah.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
And plus, there's a lot of Linux apps that you might want to play with, right?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Anybody in the Mumble Room order one of these?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I have.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Oh, okay.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Wimpy, what was your reasoning?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.440
Other than just obviously interest?

32:55.440 --> 33:03.720
Yeah, also, I had the BQ5 phone, which I bought.

33:03.720 --> 33:08.360
I've since given that to a friend of mine so that they can experiment with Ubuntu.

33:08.360 --> 33:12.480
And I've been using the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7.

33:12.480 --> 33:18.800
And a bit like you were just saying, I want a proper device that's going to be supported

33:18.800 --> 33:20.920
for some time.

33:20.920 --> 33:28.200
And I'm really wanting to see how this works on the road as a portable device that I can

33:28.200 --> 33:30.800
take with me and do useful things on.

33:30.800 --> 33:36.440
Because I think, Popey, am I right about this, Firefox and LibreOffice are going to be installed

33:36.440 --> 33:38.080
by default on these?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.080
Maybe.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.080
I don't know.

33:40.080 --> 33:46.800
I remember reading at some point that those were going to be pre-installed applications.

33:46.800 --> 33:51.880
So when you go into the windowed mode, you've got those sort of productivity tools.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.480
Popey, how does that work?

33:53.480 --> 33:56.400
Is it BQ that delivers the final image?

33:56.400 --> 34:02.900
No, we build the image and it's exactly the same as it is for all the other devices.

34:02.900 --> 34:07.400
We build the image, we do QA and then we pass it to BQ.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.900
They do their QA and then they integrate that into their factory process.

34:11.900 --> 34:16.600
So at the point when they manufacture the devices, the image that gets deployed onto

34:16.600 --> 34:18.720
them is the image that we made.

34:18.720 --> 34:24.240
And if that's true that LibreOffice and Firefox are going to be working on this, then that

34:24.240 --> 34:30.040
also means that it's shipping applications that require XMirror to be fully functional

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
by default.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.040
Correct?

34:32.040 --> 34:33.040
Yes.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
Yes.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
They use XMirror.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.040
Yeah.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.040
You got the same problem?

34:37.040 --> 34:38.040
Except a different number.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.820
So Wes just tried to buy it to see if he had the same problem I got and he has the same

34:40.820 --> 34:44.600
problem only he got $599, I got $799.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.320
We can't proceed with the checkout.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.280
You're living in the filthy colonies and not over in enlightened Europe.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.760
I'm sure, but it says worldwide delivery, right?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.320
It says worldwide delivery, doesn't it?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.320
Yeah.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.320
Yeah.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.320
Neither one of us can place an order.

34:59.320 --> 35:04.320
So both of us are trying.

35:04.320 --> 35:09.480
I've wondered if I should just buy the regular Aquarius and could find the image available.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.480
Is that likely?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.480
How's that going to work?

35:11.480 --> 35:16.080
I know this is sort of looking into the crystal ball a little bit, but are there going to

35:16.080 --> 35:20.080
be images I can download down the road and just install on it if I want to?

35:20.080 --> 35:21.080
Yeah.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.000
All our images are the same for all of the devices.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
They're already available.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
You can already go and-

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Oh, they are?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
They're not device-specific?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.240
They are device-specific, but they're on the same server as all the other devices.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.860
You could go rummage and find them.

35:33.860 --> 35:39.600
They wouldn't be the final image because the final image isn't done yet, but you could

35:39.600 --> 35:40.840
go and get the image.

35:40.840 --> 35:45.480
I'm not guaranteeing that you could go and buy an Android version of that device and

35:45.480 --> 35:48.120
flash it because that's somewhat out of our control.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.240
If they put some lock on it or make it difficult to do, I don't know.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.480
Or changed firmwares or something like that.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
Right.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.080
And that's beyond our control.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.840
So we always say, if you buy the Ubuntu one, we know we can reflash that, but we just don't

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
know about the Android one.

36:01.840 --> 36:07.800
But past experience, we have had people who bought the Android version of the BQ phones

36:07.800 --> 36:13.240
and then asked BQ for the flashing tool that allows them to flash them to Ubuntu and BQ

36:13.240 --> 36:14.240
have provided it.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.240
So it's-

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
Wow.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.240
That's a good time.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.240
It's out of the realms of possibility.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.240
They do have good support at BQ.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.240
I like that.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.240
I like hearing that.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.240
I don't know.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.480
Does anybody else have any thoughts or questions about the tablet before I just selfishly change

36:24.480 --> 36:26.480
tracks for a moment?

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
No?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.480
Okay.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.560
If anyone can buy it, just plus one for Chris.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
Yeah.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Right.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
Okay.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.680
Maybe, Poby, you might be the best guy to ask.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.240
Maybe somebody else might know.

36:36.240 --> 36:40.520
How likely is it down the road that if I were to eventually wind up with a Nexus 5X that

36:40.520 --> 36:42.480
I would be able to run Ubuntu Touch on that?

36:42.480 --> 36:43.480
Right now, I'm looking at it.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.800
It seems like the most powerful phone I could get to run Ubuntu Touch would be the OnePlus.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.000
I don't really have any interest in the OnePlus.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.400
I'd rather have a Nexus device.

36:50.400 --> 36:55.420
Am I SOL theoretically down the road or is there likely eventually going to be a community

36:55.420 --> 37:00.040
edition or maybe even official build for the newer Nexus I?

37:00.040 --> 37:02.680
So it's a good question.

37:02.680 --> 37:07.520
We've got a community porting campaign on at the moment.

37:07.520 --> 37:16.960
And if you go to ubports.com, I think it is, ubports.com, there's like a wish list of devices

37:16.960 --> 37:20.040
that people want ported to.

37:20.040 --> 37:25.560
And the OnePlus One is only already done because that was done some months ago.

37:25.560 --> 37:30.920
The guy who did that, Mario, who did that a while ago, and it turns out that the internals

37:30.920 --> 37:34.740
of the OnePlus One and the Two and the OnePlus X are fairly similar.

37:34.740 --> 37:38.600
So actually, he can reuse some of that work.

37:38.600 --> 37:45.440
The devices that are wish lists that you'd really like probably aren't being ported because

37:45.440 --> 37:48.120
A, he doesn't have the time and he's just one guy.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.620
And B, he may not even have that device.

37:50.620 --> 37:54.920
So he asks for donations if we want to give him, you know, chuck him a few dollars, then

37:54.920 --> 37:55.920
he'll buy it.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.920
Interesting.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.000
And I know he has done that, like someone threw him some money.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.960
So he went and bought a OnePlus X, and then I saw a message on Google Plus with a photo

38:03.960 --> 38:05.800
of a OnePlus X running Ubuntu.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.640
So you know, as soon as he has the device, he starts working on it.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.680
But he has now a queue of devices to work on and he is only one guy.

38:12.680 --> 38:19.280
If you know anyone who is familiar with porting, like cyanogen type porting from the XDA developers

38:19.280 --> 38:23.040
type community, if they want to get involved and start porting to some of these other devices,

38:23.040 --> 38:26.280
like Nexus devices, that would be awesome and put him in touch with Mario.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.280
It seems-

38:27.280 --> 38:28.280
5X is on there.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.280
Not funded.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
Yeah.

38:30.280 --> 38:36.120
It seems like I'm having more and more conversations with people where they say, from now on I'm

38:36.120 --> 38:37.400
only buying Nexus devices.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.400
And that's not to put down like the OnePluses or the S7s or anything like that, but people

38:41.400 --> 38:42.400
are just like, um.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.880
That's about all I consider on it.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.880
I mean, maybe a Moto X.

38:45.880 --> 38:46.880
Yeah.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.820
But I've been, it's funny how often I've been having this conversation.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.260
And I think a lot of people are coming to this as they look at the smartphone market

38:52.260 --> 38:56.900
is if you're going to go Android and you're technically savvy and you want direct security

38:56.900 --> 39:01.240
updates from Google, you just go Nexus right now.

39:01.240 --> 39:07.900
And so if Ubuntu, though I'll just say Touch, got to the point where it was, it got to the

39:07.900 --> 39:13.040
point where if you, like where Linux used to be for laptops a decade ago where you could

39:13.040 --> 39:17.680
take a pretty mainstream distro and if you got a fairly mainstream, well not even ten

39:17.680 --> 39:21.440
years ago, five years ago, if you got a fairly mainstream laptop, you had a great shot of

39:21.440 --> 39:24.660
getting Ubuntu to work on that, it'd be really something now.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.760
If you got a Nexus device, you'd have a pretty great shot of knowing you'd also be able to

39:28.760 --> 39:29.760
run Ubuntu on it.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.760
Man.

39:30.760 --> 39:36.280
That, it would be such a great place for Ubuntu to get to for those devices just, because

39:36.280 --> 39:39.120
it'd just become another option to run on a Nexus device.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.820
And it starts to make the Nexus device look less like a Google phone and more like a general

39:42.820 --> 39:46.600
smartphone platform that you could just load all their OS's on.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
And that's pretty neat.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
Good hardware, good price.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
More like traditional PC hardware where you can.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.600
Exactly.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.600
Something to standardize.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
Decent hardware, good price.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Yeah.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.600
Yeah.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.600
I mean it's reasonable.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.600
Kitson, you wanted to jump in.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
Go ahead.

39:58.600 --> 40:03.440
The reason that I will only purchase a Nexus device is because the support.

40:03.440 --> 40:08.600
With a Nexus device, I know I'm getting at least two years of support.

40:08.600 --> 40:15.640
And why am I going to spend, you know, $700 on a device that may or may not receive updates?

40:15.640 --> 40:23.360
And then on top of that, like if I go to the Samsung Galaxy S website, I can't find out

40:23.360 --> 40:27.880
if I purchased this device, how long they're actually going to support it.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
It's not in.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
They're not interested in committing to that.

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
No, no.

40:30.880 --> 40:34.880
See, the interesting thing here is you've all been tainted by the problem of Android.

40:34.880 --> 40:40.220
Is that the thing that has made you do that is the ecosystem around Android that's forced

40:40.220 --> 40:41.640
you to all make that decision.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.840
You shouldn't have had to make that decision.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.680
You don't make that decision about laptops.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.880
You don't buy a laptop because you're going to get a vanilla experience.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.280
You nuke it and put whatever you want on it.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.280
Right.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.280
And that's something we're not doing.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.200
We're putting the same image on all of the devices.

40:57.200 --> 41:03.520
So the original BQE 4.5, the very first phone that we had, gets the same software updates

41:03.520 --> 41:06.280
as the M10 that comes out next month.

41:06.280 --> 41:11.920
And that's the same updates that the Meizu Pro 5 that comes out next month gets and the

41:11.920 --> 41:15.640
next device and the next device and the Sony device and the OnePlus device.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.600
And if it's ported to the Nexus X, 5X, then yeah, that gets it as well.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.520
So it's the same software stack that all of them get.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.520
Yes, exactly.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.880
I think that's wonderful.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.160
And that's the long term hope.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.920
But in the short term, I think my Linux laptop from a few years ago analogy holds up here

41:32.920 --> 41:36.120
because a lot of times people needed to still run Windows.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.120
Still do.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
They needed to run Windows.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.340
This is going to be true with Nexus users.

41:39.340 --> 41:42.520
They're going to still need to be able to run Android probably at least for the next

41:42.520 --> 41:43.520
couple of years.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.720
And so that's why you want a well-supported Android device, but you also want something

41:47.720 --> 41:50.640
that can run Ubuntu and you really want a sweet spot there.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.120
And so that's why I was...

41:52.120 --> 41:53.120
That's where the Nexus...

41:53.120 --> 41:54.120
Getting me all excited here, Chris.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.120
Right?

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
Doesn't that sound right?

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
Yeah, it really does.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
Yeah.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.120
Because I want to run Marshmallow.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.000
I don't want to not be able to run Marshmallow, but I also want to run the latest Ubuntu Touch

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
or whatever it's supposed to be.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.320
I'm one of the rare people who will never get a Nexus phone again.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.360
Why is that?

42:07.360 --> 42:11.920
Because the Nexus phone completely lost power and the power button was faulty and broken.

42:11.920 --> 42:12.920
Yeah, frustrating.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.640
So the phone won't turn on at all.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.200
It just does a boot loop forever.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.880
I've had issues with every single phone eventually though.

42:18.880 --> 42:19.880
But yeah, that is frustrating.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.080
Yeah, but one of the things...

42:21.080 --> 42:26.380
The reason I like it though is LG made that phone, but under the guise of what Google

42:26.380 --> 42:27.480
told them to do.

42:27.480 --> 42:30.040
If you look at LG's phones, those are awesome.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.040
The ones that are just there.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.040
Like the G4 and G5?

42:32.040 --> 42:33.040
Yeah, the V10.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.040
Pick an LG phone.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.040
It's pretty cool.

42:35.040 --> 42:43.480
And even if the crappy lower level $80 Leons are really impressive for their price.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.000
And the best part, there is no bloatware in LG.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.400
They don't do that stupid crap.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
That most reasons...

42:48.400 --> 42:49.400
Oh really?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.020
That is nice.

42:51.020 --> 42:53.800
You know, that's actually really cool to know.

42:53.800 --> 42:59.440
Why don't I take a moment and mention Ting because they sell the LG Volt 2 for $66.

42:59.440 --> 43:03.320
And LG has just announced they're going to ship Marshmallow for the Volt 2.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.520
So go to linux.ting.com.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
You'll get that for...

43:06.520 --> 43:07.920
You'll get this device for $66.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.120
It ships tomorrow.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
No contract.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.000
No early termination fee.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.640
You only pay for what you use, flat $6 for the line.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.480
That's Ting right there.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.480
Linux.ting.com.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
Go there to support this show.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.840
They have a great selection of devices.

43:20.840 --> 43:25.640
They have right now currently a post on the history of the Kodi project, which is awesome.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.920
I love that they're getting into that.

43:26.920 --> 43:31.040
It's super cool that my mobile carrier is writing a post about the history of Kodi.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.800
I mean, I totally love that.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.600
They get it.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.680
They do.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.880
And they also have the OnePlus 2.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.800
They have the Nexus devices.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.800
They also have the S7.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.320
They just recently added the S7.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.000
The OnePlus 2, $349.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.960
You could load Cyanogen on that, no problem.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.720
You could also load pretty much a lot of images.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.680
I mean, it's the OnePlus.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.920
$349.

43:52.920 --> 43:53.920
You walk away.

43:53.920 --> 43:54.920
You own it.

43:54.920 --> 43:55.920
It's unlocked.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.400
There's no contract.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.400
Nice and clean.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.960
You want to just go buy the Nexus 5X from the Google Play Store?

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
Do that.

44:02.960 --> 44:06.160
And then just get the Ting SIM and just pop the SIM card in.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.320
Easy peasy, my friends.

44:07.320 --> 44:11.560
They have, from the SIM card, starting around $9, which you can get Prime on Amazon.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.560
Woo!

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
I know.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.560
But then you can't support the show.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.560
Go to linux.ting.com at least.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.560
Yeah, just go.

44:16.560 --> 44:17.560
Go there.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.280
All the way up to things like the Internet Phone 7.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.840
Oh wait, they don't have that out yet.

44:20.840 --> 44:21.840
The Internet Phone 6S.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.180
Okay, they might have that.

44:23.180 --> 44:25.480
The Samsung Galaxy S7.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
All of that stuff.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.040
They have a great lineup of phones.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.440
They have great customer service.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.520
They have an excellent control panel.

44:31.520 --> 44:34.440
Find out why I've been using them for more than two years.

44:34.440 --> 44:35.900
Linux.ting.com.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.400
And that LG Volt 2, I mean, it's not like it's going to blow you away in specs.

44:39.400 --> 44:44.400
But I mean, hell, a $66 smartphone with no contract, you pay what you use, and you get

44:44.400 --> 44:45.400
freaking Marshmallow.

44:45.400 --> 44:49.960
It's a great phone for people who haven't had a smartphone before, don't have a lot

44:49.960 --> 44:50.960
of extra cash.

44:50.960 --> 44:54.760
Or if you just need a budget Android device, but you want to have something that's secure.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.320
I mean, that seems reasonable.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.360
I don't know when LG is shipping it, but they announced shipping Marshmallow for the Volt

44:59.360 --> 45:00.360
2, which is really cool.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.360
That's awesome.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.360
Yeah, linux.ting.com.

45:02.360 --> 45:03.360
Go there to support the show.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.360
And a big thanks to Ting.

45:04.360 --> 45:09.160
I'm going to keep trying to get myself that Ubuntu tablet, too, because I really do want

45:09.160 --> 45:10.160
to...

45:10.160 --> 45:11.160
What?

45:11.160 --> 45:12.160
Yeah, you got it.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.520
I mean, I want to play with it when you get it.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.520
I know.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.520
Because if I get it, you get to play with it.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.520
Exactly.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.520
That's very true.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.520
Okay.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.400
So, have you guys heard of Stali?

45:21.400 --> 45:23.400
Anybody in the mobile room heard of Stali Linux?

45:23.400 --> 45:25.880
I think I'm saying that right?

45:25.880 --> 45:26.880
Yeah.

45:26.880 --> 45:27.880
Who said yes?

45:27.880 --> 45:28.880
Rotten.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
Oh, of course, Rotten.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
Okay, Rotten.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.880
How did you hear of this distro?

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
Seriously.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.880
How did you hear of Stali?

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
I thought I'd have one on you.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
ZDNet.

45:35.880 --> 45:36.880
Isn't it?

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
Okay.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.400
Well, this one is from Infoworld.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.400
But yeah, okay.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
Kind of same thing.

45:41.400 --> 45:46.600
Stali promises to smash assumptions about Linux like a fricking wrecking ball.

45:46.600 --> 45:50.600
And so they've put a wrecking ball picture in the post.

45:50.600 --> 45:55.720
It's a distribution built with all statically linked binaries.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.000
They say for speed and compactness.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.200
Stali stands for static Linux, with static referring to how all binaries in the distribution

46:02.200 --> 46:05.600
are statically linked against their libraries.

46:05.600 --> 46:11.840
Stali's project head says – and by the way, he also currently works at BMW and is the

46:11.840 --> 46:16.800
developer of DWM, window manager, believes that static linking works out better for most

46:16.800 --> 46:18.000
common use cases.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.400
The most obvious benefit in static binaries, have a smaller memory footprint and on disk

46:22.400 --> 46:23.400
footprint.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.120
I don't see how that's possible at all.

46:25.120 --> 46:29.760
Static binaries also claim to be faster, although there's no real benchmarks yet.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.720
And here's another doozy for you.

46:31.720 --> 46:33.140
Here's another one.

46:33.140 --> 46:36.840
Another way they're challenging the quote, unquote, directly from the article, traditional

46:36.840 --> 46:41.400
Linux distribution, no package manager.

46:41.400 --> 46:47.880
No repo, no package manager, instead all updates are pulled from upstream by way of Git.

46:47.880 --> 46:51.880
Also no system D, no system D at all.

46:51.880 --> 46:56.760
Stali has its own S-init utility, which is also statically linked –

46:56.760 --> 46:57.760
Jason Kuznicki Synit.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.760
Jason Kuznicki Synit.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
Yeah.

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
Synit, which is also statically linked.

47:00.760 --> 47:07.840
And also, by the way, kernel modules not supported because you would need to link them.

47:07.840 --> 47:14.760
So this is Stali, the distribution that smashes assumptions like a wrecking ball about Linux

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
according to Infoworld.

47:15.760 --> 47:20.280
But I mean, the ISO they provide now, it's like 34 megs, so that's easy.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.880
Is that a full desktop environment too?

47:21.880 --> 47:22.880
Well, no.

47:22.880 --> 47:23.880
That's here.

47:23.880 --> 47:24.880
Oh, just the command line?

47:24.880 --> 47:25.880
So you have it installed right here?

47:25.880 --> 47:26.880
Yeah.

47:26.880 --> 47:27.880
And this is all you get?

47:27.880 --> 47:28.880
Yep.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.880
This is it?

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Yep.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.760
This is how many programs are in slash bin.

47:32.760 --> 47:33.760
Take a look there.

47:33.760 --> 47:34.760
Is there the LS still on the screen?

47:34.760 --> 47:36.800
You'll see that the file system they use is a little different.

47:36.800 --> 47:39.920
That's one of their talking points, they don't use the file system standard.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
Right.

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
Yeah.

47:41.920 --> 47:42.920
They really don't.

47:42.920 --> 47:43.920
Yeah.

47:43.920 --> 47:44.920
Sys and share on the root, log on the root.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
That's interesting.

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Dev on the root.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.160
Half the things are just symlinks to root.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.160
Yes.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.920
Var, user, and root, actually, the slash root directory.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
Yeah, that was confusing at first.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
Yeah.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.320
Is all our symlinks to the root?

47:56.320 --> 47:57.320
Yep.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.320
What?

47:58.320 --> 48:02.080
That is really weird.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.760
It is really interesting kind of as a study of like a minimal Linux.

48:04.760 --> 48:07.080
I wonder if I could show this on camera.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.840
I don't know if this will show up.

48:08.840 --> 48:12.680
Here, you guys, if you're watching the video, pause it and look at this crazy directory

48:12.680 --> 48:13.680
structure.

48:13.680 --> 48:14.680
I can't hold it for too long.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.040
But it's just, it's really, you want to grab it?

48:17.040 --> 48:18.920
That's really like something I've never seen before.

48:18.920 --> 48:20.920
That is special and unique.

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
Wow.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.520
So the completely statically linked distribution.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.520
What are your thoughts having installed it and run it West?

48:27.520 --> 48:30.400
Does it perform well?

48:30.400 --> 48:31.920
It did boot very quickly.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.640
I mean, there's not much going on.

48:34.640 --> 48:35.640
I don't know.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.640
I mean, it'd be interesting.

48:36.640 --> 48:39.600
I could see it being useful for people who really need to, who want to build something

48:39.600 --> 48:43.280
very minimal or very customized and really have a very good conception of exactly what's

48:43.280 --> 48:44.280
running.

48:44.280 --> 48:48.040
You know, if you're trying to craft this into some sort of embedded or like appliance-like

48:48.040 --> 48:51.480
application, maybe this will, maybe this works well, especially if you already have like

48:51.480 --> 48:55.720
something that's installed as a, you know, like something like an app image or a snap

48:55.720 --> 48:59.120
package style system where it has all of it, it's statically linked or it has all of its

48:59.120 --> 49:02.960
dependencies within itself already, then that might be a great way to just use this and

49:02.960 --> 49:03.960
run it on that.

49:03.960 --> 49:09.720
Did you see that everything for like all the system services and everything, the way you

49:09.720 --> 49:14.820
start and stop everything is a single rc init file and there's an rc like shutdown file.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.160
It's all in one file.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.480
All of it.

49:18.480 --> 49:20.080
Everything for simplicity.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.760
That's the rc.exit power off.

49:23.760 --> 49:28.880
Okay, Rod, what were your first thoughts when you read the headline?

49:28.880 --> 49:30.880
I mean, can you see the argument for it?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.520
Could you make a case for it?

49:33.520 --> 49:34.520
Statically linked, yes.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.520
I mean, in certain cases that makes sense.

49:36.520 --> 49:39.880
The entire system, no.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.880
It looked ridiculous.

49:40.880 --> 49:46.120
But I laughed when I saw the bashing system thing and they're like making it called Senate.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
That was just funny.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Yeah.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
Yeah.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.120
That is good, right?

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
Yeah.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.120
That was a good one.

49:52.120 --> 49:58.640
When I heard about it's only 34 ISOs, I was like, yeah, so tiny core is about the same.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.840
And nano Linux is only 14.

50:00.840 --> 50:01.840
Okay.

50:01.840 --> 50:02.840
All right.

50:02.840 --> 50:03.840
Derek Delvin, you've got a good point to make.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
Go ahead.

50:05.840 --> 50:12.240
So I'm going to defend them in the sense that statically linking has become more and more

50:12.240 --> 50:16.160
common because hard drive space is not an issue anymore for shared libraries.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.160
And bandwidth.

50:17.160 --> 50:21.000
It fixes the problem of bandwidth and the problem of deployment is gone because suddenly

50:21.000 --> 50:23.560
you just deploy this binary and it will execute.

50:23.560 --> 50:28.840
So yeah, you don't need a package manager if you just executed.

50:28.840 --> 50:32.860
And honestly, when you're going to look like Google, for example, Go programming language

50:32.860 --> 50:35.800
doesn't even allow you to have shared libraries.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.520
So is that that odd?

50:38.520 --> 50:39.520
Probably not.

50:39.520 --> 50:44.000
About the system, the part, well, if you are statically linking everything, then the other

50:44.000 --> 50:48.280
components don't need to be initialized the same way because there's no dependencies to

50:48.280 --> 50:49.880
initialize before.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.280
So of course they're going to make something that, you know, that it's just different because

50:54.280 --> 50:56.520
they don't need it even.

50:56.520 --> 51:01.400
Moving on to the next point, you know, it's not much different than having, you know,

51:01.400 --> 51:08.040
when you're an Android busy box, having your RC, having all the programs inside just with

51:08.040 --> 51:11.980
the command line options that then inside the program splits them out.

51:11.980 --> 51:16.040
So that's not that big of a deal and not that different anyway.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.880
So honestly, it's a lovable goal.

51:18.880 --> 51:23.920
Now on the file system directory splitting, I mean, in the end, all of the separation

51:23.920 --> 51:29.720
was because you have to separate parts of the software like images here, resources there,

51:29.720 --> 51:30.800
shared libraries there.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.520
You don't have those things to care about anymore.

51:33.520 --> 51:36.480
The assets can be embedded into the binary.

51:36.480 --> 51:39.120
Then definitely yes.

51:39.120 --> 51:44.760
And as a last point, compilers optimize better when they have accessible all of the source

51:44.760 --> 51:45.760
code.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.640
So technically, yes, it can be faster.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.960
Yeah, it does seem to boot super fast and run super fast, right?

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
I mean, yeah.

51:51.960 --> 52:00.200
So okay, so now continuing on this narrative, I've noticed the media, the print media, is

52:00.200 --> 52:03.680
it has like a theme they're running with a lot recently.

52:03.680 --> 52:09.040
And that is, this could teach Linux a lesson or Linux has something to learn from this.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.540
Could this finally replace Linux?

52:11.540 --> 52:15.680
And so to amp it up a little bit, here we go, you ready, ready, let's

52:15.680 --> 52:22.600
Oh, rust, Redox OS could show Linux a new few tricks.

52:22.600 --> 52:25.080
See what I'm saying?

52:25.080 --> 52:26.080
You see how intense that is?

52:26.080 --> 52:27.080
Yeah.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.080
I'm scared for Linux.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.080
Yeah.

52:29.080 --> 52:32.560
Over the last several months, a team of developers has been busy doing exactly that using rust

52:32.560 --> 52:37.720
to create Redox, Redox, Redox, Redox, that's what I think too, a full blown Unix like operating

52:37.720 --> 52:43.640
system designed as a radical rethinking of the Linux approach.

52:43.640 --> 52:48.120
Redox uses rust for its kernel level code to provide more memory safety considerations

52:48.120 --> 52:49.840
and CLLs by default.

52:49.840 --> 52:55.360
Redox uses a minimal set of syscalls and a deliberately smaller subset than Linux, gotta

52:55.360 --> 53:03.360
get that in there, which avoids legacy bloat, gotta get that in there, gotta love that.

53:03.360 --> 53:09.600
The OS also uses a microkernel by design to stay slender in contrast to Linux monolithic

53:09.600 --> 53:14.480
kernel, and many of the OS's internal behaviors have also been rethought.

53:14.480 --> 53:20.600
While Linux and Unix both use the notion of every item as a file, Redox goes a step further

53:20.600 --> 53:26.320
and treats everything like a URL, so it's simple to register handlers for events and

53:26.320 --> 53:31.360
provides a consistent manner to perform other kinds of abstractions.

53:31.360 --> 53:35.520
Another radical break from Linux is that the software isn't licensed under the GPL, but

53:35.520 --> 53:38.440
the entire project is MIT.

53:38.440 --> 53:41.280
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

53:41.280 --> 53:47.440
I feel like we've been seeing a lot of MIT projects lately.

53:47.440 --> 53:52.280
I feel like we've been seeing a lot of going to teach Linux a lesson recently too.

53:52.280 --> 53:56.160
And I wonder, Daredevil, you say you've looked into it, and you have some thoughts?

53:56.160 --> 54:01.120
Because I know Rust is massively popular in the Mozilla crowd, it was recently voted one

54:01.120 --> 54:03.920
of the most loved languages on Stack Exchange.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.180
So tell me a little bit about what you've been following.

54:07.180 --> 54:13.200
So Rust does provide some safeties that might help mitigating some issues on kernel development,

54:13.200 --> 54:14.440
so I'll give them that.

54:14.440 --> 54:17.400
But it still implies that they're good developers in the first place.

54:17.400 --> 54:21.120
I don't know if they are or not, so I'm not making any statement, I'm just saying it implies

54:21.120 --> 54:23.160
that they're good developers.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.800
Then you're going to have to go to the next level.

54:25.800 --> 54:30.300
Actually, Linux kernel is a hybrid kernel because of the way it loads modules, and especially

54:30.300 --> 54:35.600
when you're considering KDBus that it's being implemented, so there's that part too as well.

54:35.600 --> 54:41.220
Moving on to the argument that Linux is complicated, they're saying that Unix philosophy is right,

54:41.220 --> 54:44.960
the implementation are the things that are not working, they're claiming their website

54:44.960 --> 54:46.080
anyways.

54:46.080 --> 54:50.360
Which means that they're going to implement most of the things in a familiar Unix way,

54:50.360 --> 54:56.700
they're just going to change some of the little details that are in Linux because legacy.

54:56.700 --> 55:00.200
So with that perspective in mind, I think there's people that are actually right now

55:00.200 --> 55:07.440
doing a bolder move when it comes to kernel development, they're actually saying, let's

55:07.440 --> 55:12.360
get away with all of these separation and multiple users, I think they're crazy, but

55:12.360 --> 55:16.680
there's talks about this and people actually working on projects, which actually go to

55:16.680 --> 55:18.940
differentiate themselves.

55:18.940 --> 55:24.000
And on MIT, that's all to say that the GPL is the whole reason Linux succeeds, because

55:24.000 --> 55:25.920
all of these companies fund Linux.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.520
Look, who's funding them?

55:27.520 --> 55:28.520
No one.

55:28.520 --> 55:32.320
I'm going to answer just who.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.920
So Alex Voda, he's saying, oh man, this is crap reporting.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.920
I hope he doesn't mean mine, because I agree.

55:37.920 --> 55:43.160
What I'm poking fun at is the narrative of the media that they are taking projects like

55:43.160 --> 55:48.880
this and they're using it to say, this is what's going to teach Linux a lesson to generate

55:48.880 --> 55:50.360
clicks.

55:50.360 --> 55:53.040
And I think that's a really interesting trick they're trying to play there.

55:53.040 --> 55:56.440
Wes, you've actually downloaded and installed it just there, or running a live image?

55:56.440 --> 55:58.280
Yes, I'm running it in VirtualBox right here.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.280
And yep, nope.

55:59.280 --> 56:02.240
So they have a 28 meg installer, right?

56:02.240 --> 56:03.680
You just like it finds your devices.

56:03.680 --> 56:10.640
It looked like it was using the same terminology as dev, SDA, hit yes, installed, I rebooted.

56:10.640 --> 56:14.360
It started up booting into a, you know, kind of familiar kernel looking startup, identifying

56:14.360 --> 56:17.800
all the devices, AHCI, that kind of stuff.

56:17.800 --> 56:18.800
Started the graphical environment.

56:18.800 --> 56:19.800
I've got it running here.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.080
Wait, there's a, you're telling me, you're telling me in a 28 meg?

56:23.080 --> 56:24.080
Well, it did.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.080
Yeah, I guess it must all be contained.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.640
A 28 megabyte download, it has a GUI environment too?

56:27.640 --> 56:29.160
But the mouse doesn't work.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.440
Oh, it looks nice though.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.440
I know.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.400
It's got a, it's got a file manager down there.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.120
It's got a calculator, a terminal, a sound controller.

56:36.120 --> 56:39.080
And it started up, you know, I just logged in and it had to, had a terminal anyway.

56:39.080 --> 56:40.960
It's another hold it up to the camera edition there.

56:40.960 --> 56:44.480
But you can see here, Wes, you want, you want to take it and yeah, as you can see there,

56:44.480 --> 56:48.480
there's the desktop environment with a sort of like your standard start bar down at the

56:48.480 --> 56:49.480
bottom.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.000
Boy, that is damn impressive.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.160
That is really, and that loaded pretty fast from VirtualBox too.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.160
Hmm.

56:55.160 --> 56:57.760
That was just in the time Daredevil was talking, I got it installed.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.760
Yeah.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.760
I get it.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.080
I have a, I have a sense about, about Rust.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.080
I really do.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.380
I don't want to, I don't want to talk out of my butt too much more about it.

57:05.380 --> 57:09.680
So I think I want to move on from the topic, but you know, I was looking through some of

57:09.680 --> 57:13.080
the upcoming talks, the sessions that are going to be at Linux Fest Northwest.

57:13.080 --> 57:14.080
Oh, exciting.

57:14.080 --> 57:18.520
Rust's Community Automation, and they talk about this, they say this talk will discuss

57:18.520 --> 57:25.440
the implementation details as well as the social motivation and effects of the customized

57:25.440 --> 57:28.760
infrastructure and workflow practices which allow a small core team to have such significant

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
impact.

57:29.760 --> 57:33.040
They talk about Rust being a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents

57:33.040 --> 57:35.480
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

57:35.480 --> 57:39.680
Behind the scenes, Rust is also a community that nurtures new contributors, consistently

57:39.680 --> 57:43.520
enforces its code of conduct, and maintains a high quality code base.

57:43.520 --> 57:51.240
This is a talk at Linux Fest coming up on the 24th in room CC236, and damn, that looks

57:51.240 --> 57:52.240
at 1230.

57:52.240 --> 57:53.320
Oh, I did just see something.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.640
They're working on ZFS support.

57:54.640 --> 57:55.640
No!

57:55.640 --> 57:56.640
Yup.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.640
Says work in progress, right?

57:57.640 --> 58:00.600
So like, probably doesn't work, but that would be kind of cool.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.360
Oh man, that's a mind bender.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
So I, you know, I know-

58:03.360 --> 58:04.360
Really giving it to Linux there.

58:04.360 --> 58:05.360
Boy, 1230.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.360
I don't know if I'd be able to attend that since I'm going to be on the air, but that

58:07.360 --> 58:08.360
seems like-

58:08.360 --> 58:09.360
Yeah, let Noah do it.

58:09.360 --> 58:10.360
Yeah.

58:10.360 --> 58:11.360
No, maybe.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.680
I would be really interested in going to that.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.640
That Rust community automation talk might be really interesting.

58:15.640 --> 58:22.800
Why don't we start talking a little bit about Linux Fest Northwest 2016 real quickly because

58:22.800 --> 58:26.360
that actually leads perfectly into my next couple of things that I want to update you

58:26.360 --> 58:27.360
guys on.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.800
First of all, you know what we've got to talk about though?

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Let's get real.

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
Let's get serious.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.800
Let's talk about Linux Academy.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.440
When you're ready to get serious about extending your education, about learning a new platform,

58:35.440 --> 58:39.120
about bringing your career up to the next level, or just challenging yourself, LinuxAcademy.com

58:39.120 --> 58:43.400
slash Unplugged, get our discount and go check out the Linux Academy platform.

58:43.400 --> 58:44.560
Seven plus distros you choose from.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.840
They automatically adjust the courseware and the distros they spin up when you need them

58:47.840 --> 58:52.100
on demand, including, by the way, when you're doing AWS courseware, they'll spin those instances

58:52.100 --> 58:53.100
up for you.

58:53.100 --> 58:54.100
What?

58:54.100 --> 58:55.100
I know, man.

58:55.100 --> 58:56.100
It's a really cool platform.

58:56.100 --> 58:59.600
Tons of cool features, tons of courseware focused on the different aspects built around

58:59.600 --> 59:02.880
Linux that run on top of Linux or Linux itself.

59:02.880 --> 59:06.260
They have systems and tools available if you don't have a lot of time, and if you want

59:06.260 --> 59:11.720
to go get some of the top high-grade courses and certifications, Linux Academy has the

59:11.720 --> 59:12.720
courseware on it.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.600
They just recently did another OpenStack certification courseware.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.280
They've got awesome courseware on the Red Hat certified stuff.

59:18.280 --> 59:21.680
If you need scenario-based labs so that way you know exactly what you're doing when you

59:21.680 --> 59:23.520
go do it in production, they've got courseware on that.

59:23.520 --> 59:26.200
If you want instructor mentoring, they've got a Help Instructors available if you want

59:26.200 --> 59:27.200
that.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.200
They've got live streams.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.600
They've got a community stack full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

59:29.600 --> 59:34.840
I love it, but more than all, more than all of it, I love that there was a company out

59:34.840 --> 59:39.000
there that said, Linux is an amazing platform, and none of the educational sites out there

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
are doing it justice.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.380
They're all treating it as a stupid feature that they've got to check the box, and they

59:44.380 --> 59:50.920
ship some crappy courseware alongside their Adobe After Effects courseware and their motion

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
…

59:51.920 --> 59:52.920
Yeah, exactly.

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
It's just one more application to that.

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
It's one more thing.

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
I'm so sick and tired of that.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.960
So the folks at Linux Academy who are passionate about Linux and open source themselves, educators

59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.040
and developers, friends, they came together, they started the Linux Academy.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.280
Now it's grown into a business where they're growing like crazy with new staff members

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.960
dedicated to all kinds of great things for your content, and they've built this platform

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.700
to help promote Linux and give people a real place to learn Linux by people that know and

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.680
love Linux themselves, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.240

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.640
Thank you, Linux Academy.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.960
All right, so in 2018, when Jupyter Broadcasting is making Leo Laporte money, I mean, we're

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:40.480
talking not right now, something down the road, but when we're making Leo Laporte money

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480
…

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480
I'm going to fly everybody out in the mumbroom.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480
You mean in the year of the Linux desktop.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
Right, yeah.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.880
Yeah, where we've released Jupyter Broadcasting OS based on Ubuntu Mate.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.080
That's where your wallpaper is the live stream all the time.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080
And every time you …

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.240
You're at Wayland.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.560
I wish all of you guys, I wish you could all be at Linux Fest Northwest.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.520
Maybe we could like bring the mumble room in at some point on the live stream.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520
That would be fun.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.320
That would be cool to actually be able to do that because I feel like it's one of

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.280
the neater events, not just in Washington, but in the States and so I'd love it if

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280
you guys can make it.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.280
Maybe one day.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280
Maybe one day.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.000
So I had a couple of things I wanted to cover real quickly.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.040
If you didn't see this week's Linux action show briefly, I'll just mention Noah and

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.040
I have officially made a stash bet.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:37.000
The stash bet is briefly, if he loses to Emma, he has to grow a mustache for six months and

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
he's not very good at it.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So that'd be embarrassing.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.560
And he'll be visible every week.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.740
I want him to win, but if he wins, I will shave my mustache in order to motivate him

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.000
to do it.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.120
That's how dedicated I am to winning.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.540
So that's the stash bet.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.040
Just the mustache, not the beard.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.840
Well, I don't know.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.000
I doubt it because then I start getting carded and that is super annoying.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I hate getting carded.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It's your handsome young face.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.880
Don't you look like an Amish person if you do that?

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.120
Yes, that is the problem.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.800
I will very much look like an Amish person, a lot.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.920
But I also want Noah to win by a large margin.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.240
So I need a little help from you.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.200
I really want to see you look like an Amish person.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.720
I really want to see that.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.120
Well, then Noah's got to win.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.680
So here's what I figured out is we've got to change the game up a little bit.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.240
I don't want to talk bad about our boy Noah, but I'm looking at the playing field and I'm

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.620
thinking Emma has got the cards stacked in her favor right now.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620
So I want to change it up.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.680
And what I want to do is I want us to be able to go mobile.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.380
I want us to be able to go around and go to different locations.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.640
And so if people are listening to this and are going to make it to the Linux Fest and

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.760
you perhaps want to volunteer either helping with bringing a light if you have like an

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.600
LED light or if you want to hold a camera or if you have a microphone or something,

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600
I don't know.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.480
You can call me Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com because what I want to do is I want to set

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:00.240
up two crews, one to follow Noah and his switching adventures and one to follow Emma and her switching

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.720
adventures as they go out into Bellingham and try to get as many people to switch to

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.880
Linux as possible.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.440
And to give them the flexibility to do that, we're going to have to have people dedicated

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.840
to audio, lights, and camera, like an actual production crew, but there's no way we could

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840
actually do that.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.080
So I'm hoping people that are going, Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com if maybe you want

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.700
to help out with that.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.580
And something we're doing kind of different than we've ever done before, which I'm really

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.080
hoping will make a big difference in how much content we're producing is, Ham are you still

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080
in there?

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080
Hey Ham!

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.240
I think Ham left.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.040
Ham is going to be, we're going to go out and pick him up in the Lady Jupiter about

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.960
a week before Linux Fest and he's going to be staying about four or five days, three

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.400
days after Linux Fest here at JB1 to help Rekai and I go through all of the content,

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.720
so all of the footage.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.280
So hopefully now we're going to have another dedicated editor on hand to go through all

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.800
of the clips and stuff because we always have so much content more than we can ever process

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800
or go through.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.960
So that's kind of a big expense for us, but it's also kind of exciting to have basically

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.360
a game plan to what the hell we're going to actually do with all the footage we collect,

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.000
which is something we've never really done before.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
That's awesome.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.360
Yeah, so I feel like we're going into this Fest and maybe this might be something that

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.320
works in the future because a lot of times Linux Fest is where we just completely try

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.080
something new or big because it's local and if we really screw the pooch, we could actually

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.960
just drive to the studio, right?

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.840
When you're in North Carolina or you're in Pasadena, you can't do that.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.160
So you get with Linux Fest, not only is it our largest, craziest, most expensive thing

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.220
we do every year, but it's also where we do the biggest experiments and that's everything

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:39.320
from like road trips to hauling crew out to hiring extra people and new equipment and

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320
switching out stuff.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.120
So that'll be really cool.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.320
So we should have extra footage for that.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.120
So if you want to volunteer, be part of our crew and it might just be something like holding

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.800
up a light and if you have stuff like that, like if you have really, really good high

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.320
end portable production equipment, let me know.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.320
If you don't have high end stuff, don't let me know.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.320
Chris got standards.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320
Yeah, I do.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320
You know what I do.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:09.820
So one more thing, speaking of volunteers, if you're going to go to Linux Fest, I would

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.600
love reporters that go to these talks.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.520
Like I was just talking about that Rust talk.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520
Go there.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.520
Check it out.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.560
You know, I'm hosting the live stream.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.080
I'm interviewing people constantly at Linux Fest.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.040
I sometimes don't even get a chance to eat, let alone go to the bathroom or go to an extra

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040
session.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040
It's here, Mike, Chris.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040
I know.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.920
I start getting sick sometimes, it's bad.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920
Yeah.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.040
Usually Hadia or Angela spots me starting to get a little sick, like, all right, he's

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040
got to take five.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.780
Hey, he needs five.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.280
And then somebody steps in.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.000
But if you're going to go to some of these talks, I would love for you to report back,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.800
come to the booth at Linux Fest, sit down and talk to us about these.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.400
And maybe if you have a camera, you could get some video of it just to give us an idea.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.520
You don't have to record the whole thing.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.720
Just give me some B roll.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.820
If you've got a phone with a decent camera on it, record a couple of seconds of the session.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.520
And then maybe I could get a way to get it on the live stream.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520
Capture the experience.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.520
Yeah.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.800
So while you're talking about it, I could loop that a couple of times.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.040
I'm not asking you to record it.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040
Come back and report.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.120
Like, like, you know, radio or newspaper reporter style, you come back, report, tell me about

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120
it.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120
And we'll scream it.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.120
And we'll record those.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.320
And we could put those in the shows and stuff like that if they're cool, or at least the

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320
best one.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.360
So I'm asking for some volunteers to help us with the switch recording and production.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.640
And I'm asking for some volunteers to go to some of these sessions and then report back

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.200
for the ones we can't go to.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.960
So I think that's going to be if I know that's asking a lot, but it's also gives you an opportunity

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.220
to just be involved in the process.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.000
And if we get a couple people to help us, that's great.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Yeah.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Chris can yell at you and tell you to do stuff.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
No.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
That's not true.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
In fact, you know what?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.240
Honestly, if you're super helpful, you usually end up getting invited to parties and barbecues

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240
and beer.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.680
I mean, really, there is there is so much upside because, like, we are super nice to

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.760
the people that help us out.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.720
So there's a there's a there's a ton of upside, as you will discover, Wes, as it is your first

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720
Linux fest.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.920
You will see it's quite the party.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:06.020
Yeah, there's things that some people should go undercover and accept Noah's proposal to

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020
switch to Linux.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.020
Yes.

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.020
Right.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.020
Or at least spread the word.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:14.000
If you know family or friends in the Pacific Northwest, have them come help us.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Have them help us.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Heaven's forbid.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.160
And you can also help us wherever you're at Teespring.com slash here's the thing.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.160
We've mentioned it.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.160
We announced it.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.560
I launched it on last week's show.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.600
I think we've sold around 60 out of 100 right now.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:34.040
100 would probably pay for maybe me to go pick up ham or hotels like it's like it's really

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040
expensive stuff.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.400
But these are awesome shirts.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.040
They got the last logo on the front, sort of classy style where a Star Trek communicator

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.040
badge would be.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.040
You know what I'm talking about?

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.040
You know, can you visualize that?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.040
Oh, yeah.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.040
Yeah, OK.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040
So right where the communicator badge would be at.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.320
And then on the back, here's the thing.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.800
Do you have a minute to talk about Linux?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800
And we got that.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800
I love that Linux.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800
It's just big.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800
Right on that.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800
You can't you can't miss it.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.260
Look how sharp that S is with with red.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.520
It looks like you're some sort of official or something like that.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.120
We also got the hoodie here.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.000
Just an insider tip.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.360
Gray is gorgeous.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.280
It is a it is a gorgeous kind of charcoal gray.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.840
Red is bold and gets attention.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.960
So if you don't have a red one, either way, people will be like just touching it.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.280
And the long sleeve shirts, if you have if I don't know what your build is, but if your

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.960
build is similar to my build, the long sleeve shirts can be can be pretty can be pretty generous.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960
This is one of them.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.120
This is one of the Jupiter broadcasting ones.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.440
We have different sizes and you can get different colors.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.280
I'm just saying, depending on your you if you're a medium, you are going to get lazy

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280
with these shirts.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.720
If it's an extra large, the way it's cut with the shoulders is still very generous and makes

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.680
you look like you have nice shoulders and still a figure.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.220
And all people will see is the ladies love or the gentleman.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:45.880
And then when they go, oh, who's that handsome or gorgeous individual?

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.300
And what is this Linux?

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.300
And you start the conversation.

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:53.440
So I'm just saying, here's the thing at Teespring dot com slash here's the thing.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.060
And you know, Wes, I know I mentioned this once before, too, but we are doing a.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.060
That's really what it looks like, folks.

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.440
I mean, that's exactly what it looks like here in the studio with all of the mystique,

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.440
the hat.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
You just want to open it.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440
You can't.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.440
Yeah.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.320
No, I'm leaving it like that as a tease to myself and to the host.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.840
Yeah, it's just there sitting there in the living room of the studio.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.440
We're leaving it in the box until the crew gets here.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.080
We are doing a big Linux build.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.960
I talked about it last week.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.640
I would love to know a well built.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:30.640
I mean, I'm talking well built, economical case that I could buy two of that hold, you

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.200
know, at least probably six drives because we're going to have or maybe four drives.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200
That's all right.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
Yeah.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.400
We're going to have an SSD for the OS and then probably five drives and probably four

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.400
storage drives.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.000
You don't want to read one of those SSDs.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Probably read zero.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh, yeah.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.280
It's more about the speed because we're writing it.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.280
All right.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.280
That makes sense.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.640
Yeah, we're writing uncompressed video.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.020
And we may maybe one day.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.000
So we're so if you I don't want to give away too much.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.560
So this is a secret build.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.680
But let's just say one day I would like this to be able to support 4K video bit rates and

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680
it's going to be running Linux.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.520
I'm just going to leave it at that.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.440
That's your hint for what these builds are.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.600
And we need a really nice presentable case that let's say we ended up building something

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.480
that was so awesome it actually showcased the features of Linux and we could take it

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.480
on the road and show it as an example of what Linux is capable of.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:27.080
I would like a case that is presentable to people because I want to be able to sit down

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.000
the table and be like, yeah, this is the thing we use.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.120
And I'll tell you more about it later.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.700
But just a really nice presentable case that isn't too crazy expensive, that accommodates

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:38.960
good cooling quietly with a lot of drives.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960
That's my request.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.720
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.240
Look for the feedback thread for 138.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240
And let me know.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240
Get to it, JB community.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.760
I hope there's one out there because I haven't bought them yet.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.760
And Chris has zero time.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.120
Bitcoin is like up at 420 bucks right now.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120
So it's a good time to buy.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.120
I'm just saying.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120
Yeah.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120
Wimpy, you have a suggestion.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120
Tell me about it.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120
Where did he go?

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120
I don't hear you, Wimpy.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.120
His mic is muted.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120
He linked to a Lincoln HP.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120
Oops.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
There he's back.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.120
Go ahead.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120
Go ahead, Wimpy.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120
Yeah.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120
They're end of life now.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:25.960
But I've got two of the HP ProLiant microserver G7 in 54Ls.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:33.320
And when I bought those, they were about 150 quid because you got a rebate on them.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.000
It was quite good value.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.440
And I've got five drives in there, one TFS and four in a RAID configuration.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.240
They've also got the SATA connection on the back.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:50.680
And I've had a four bay SATA drive hanging off the back of one of them in the past as

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.680
well.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680
Nice.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.560
So if you want something that's low cost, but they're a proper case, they're a proper

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.400
pro grade case with proper fixtures and bolts and they look the business and they've got

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.600
the blue HP light that comes on the front.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600
I like them.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:16.600
So they're cheap, they're not super powerful, but I can get 100 megasecond write speed through

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.440
my RAID array and that's spinning disks.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.440
You were sick last week.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.440
You had to jump out.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.440
I did.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.000
But I teased it a little bit.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.960
I'm financing personally the hardware, so I had to buy it from Newegg directly because

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.600
I only really I don't have any money to my name except this is liquid in Bitcoin.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.600
Yeah.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.800
And so I got to spend Bitcoin to buy something and Newegg sells directly.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.200
And if you buy if you buy directly from Newegg, you can use Bitcoin.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.880
So what I did, Wimpy, just super recap, so people don't have to go back and listen either,

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.480
is we have a big build project.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.340
We're going to switch some some internal functions over to Linux.

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:59.720
And so we needed six core processors and like 32 gigs of RAM.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.440
And so all of that is we're going to assemble that, deploy Linux on it, and then put them

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.960
in production and make some series of episodes out of it.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.320
Got the motherboards and the processors and stuff, you're looking for the cases.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.640
And I figured I would wait again until Bitcoin kind of creep back up.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.120
It's creeped back up to the 420 range.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.600
Get some good value there.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.600
Yeah.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:24.200
And so if there's a nice case that's not crazy expensive that's sold by Newegg directly.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:30.720
I just linked in the chat Fractal Design R5, the Define R5 is awesome and it's $90.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.080
Oh, I've looked at that before.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.560
The Fractal, huh?

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.760
It's very understated.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.760
It doesn't.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.440
You can also get a window version too if you want.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.800
I don't really want a window.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:46.760
No, I just you know what I would really I really think I got the first link.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.880
It's got like a more marketing thing so you can see like all the ridiculous amount of

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.240
bays it has and it's got support for like extended GPUs and stuff.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.400
Extended so I would really think that is three by five drives.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.400
That does look classy.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.040
I'll give it that classy is actually maybe actually the good way is maybe a good way

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040
to go.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.080
I actually have the R4 of this and it's awesome.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080
Kind of want one now.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.780
I think what we're going to build is going to be something unique in media broadcasting

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.720
and especially online media broadcasting.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.520
It'd be neat to turn this into like to do it this way and turn it kind of into a recipe.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520
I think so too.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.520
Right?

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520
Like here, get this.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520
Here's the software.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.680
Well, the reason this is awesome, you can remove the bays and put them in different

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680
configurations if you want to.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680
I've seen that.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680
Yeah.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Okay.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680
Yeah.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680
That is really cool.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680
Boy, that does look like a really nice case.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680
And that's on Newegg?

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680
Yeah.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.680
All right.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:44.240
I will check that one out and I will put a link to that in the show notes if you guys

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.880
want to check that one out too because that does look really cool.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.160
And there's also YouTube reviews coming in.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.160
Yeah.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.720
And so I would really love when we're done to have something that I don't know how we

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.320
would publish it but basically it would be a recipe like you said or it's difficult Wes

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.800
because it literally changes every three to six months.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.800
Well, of course.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.720
So I don't know exactly how to work it but almost something that you could reproduce

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.680
yourself and then sit down and accomplish a lot of what we do using all open source

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680
tools.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.680
I don't know yet.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680
We'll see.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.000
But anyways, and I might be jumping ahead too because one of the things is, one of the

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.160
reasons why I'm being kind of secretive is we're going to build it and see how far we

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160
get.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160
Right.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160
See what we have to work with.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160
Yeah.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160
Yeah.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160
Yeah.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160
And we're going to try to push it as far as we can.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160
And so I'm really excited about it.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.400
And that's why, you know, that's just like part of what we're doing.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.360
Like that's not even really Fest related but since everybody's out here we're going to

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.680
take advantage of it during Linux Fest and get everything done at the same time.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680
It's really cool.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680
Oh, I'm excited.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680
I am too.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.680
I am too.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.880
I mean, the design stuff looks pretty cool.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.360
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.360
And let me see.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360
Where was that?

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.360
Oh boy.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.360
We got YouTube videos too.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.120
I'll put a link to the YouTube review from hardware conducts, hardware conducts in the

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120
show notes as well.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
Okay.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.480
Any other closing thoughts from the moment before we wrap up guys?

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.880
Oh, you hear that?

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.120
Could you imagine?

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.240
Could you imagine you're sitting like at your local library at a Linux meeting and you ask

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.240
that question and nobody actually said anything?

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240
That never happens.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.440
There's always some guy who's got something to add.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.440
Well.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.440
Hello some guy.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.440
Actually.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440
Are you guys serious?

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440
Are you serious?

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440
Are you just joshing with me?

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.440
Because that's what actually.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440
On the other hand.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440
Oh no.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.440
Okay.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440
All right.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440
Okay.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.440
Very good.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440
Very good.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440
You got it.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.440
Yeah.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.440
Yeah.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440
The thing is.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440
So here's the thing.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440
Oh no.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440
Oh no.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440
I almost forgot.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440
No.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440
Here's the other thing.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440
No.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440
I'm getting this out of here.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440
I'm getting this out of here.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440
I'm cutting you guys off.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440
And I almost forgot.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.360
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Uploads.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
The show that never ends.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
We just got trolled there.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
We just got trolled.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
I know.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360
By our own Mumble Room.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.360
We still got Poe Show coming up.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360
We still got.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360
It's a show that will end.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360
All right.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360
Well thank you for joining us.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360
Check the calendar.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.360
Slash calendar.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.360
April is a crazy month.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360
You never know if things change.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360
I don't know.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360
Hopefully not.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
Hopefully things just get even better.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360
But check it out at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar where we convert it to your

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.920
own time zone because that crap seems to be hard for everybody to figure out.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920
jblive.tv is where we do it live.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you go to give us feedback.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.040
And you could also send me an email about any of the stuff I just talked about, Chris,

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.440
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com or at Chris Elias on Twitter would be even better.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:47.120
See you next week.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:10.200
I just want the new LTS with the new plasma desktop that actually I, there's no way I'm

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.800
the only person that wants this, right?

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800
Sounds nice.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.760
It sounds like the new 16.4 LTS, which is damn near release.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.920
I know like a week or two after it's out, it's going to be available.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920
I grok that.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.240
I want to try it now before release.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.360
I understand that if I wait two weeks, but here's the reason why is I'm setting up my

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.840
machine now and I, if I like it, I don't want to reinstall.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:29.840
I don't want to worry about this.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Yeah.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.840
You want to test things out, feel the water.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.520
If I, I'm going to do the review and if I like the desktop, that's going to become my

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.440
new permanent setup.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.480
So I don't want to wait two weeks after the release because that doesn't really work for

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.460
me for this particular use case.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.840
And what bugs me about it is, again, I'm not trying to make this an Archibuntu thing, but

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.560
on Arch, this problem is does literally does not exist.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:57.800
Uh, yesterday I had plasma five, five, today I have plasma five, six, nothing else has

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.800
changed.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.800
Like it's not a big deal.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:06.040
I didn't have to change my release of arch and it's, it's so refreshing is it is so refreshing

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.240
to know that I, it just, it just, when it's, when they have it in the stable repo, which

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.760
was like a few, like a week afterwards, I got it.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.480
There's probably other distros that make it just as easy like that.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:27.320
Um, open suits is about to release their new builds probably like a couple of days or

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
so.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320
And then people who already have installed, we'll just update and get it.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
Right?

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.320
Yeah.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320
Yeah.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.320
That's beautiful.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320
That's beautiful.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320
That's all I'm asking for.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320
They keep everything the same name.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.320
So it's like plasma five dash desktop.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.320
So regardless of what version it is, it gets updated.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320
Yeah.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320
Yeah.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.960
Five, six, one's already out on arch, which is, and so cause of what I'm, what I've done

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:52.480
is I've re since someone, uh, when I, I have not reloaded the Apollo since I got the factory

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.960
image, which came with 1510 and a couple of updates to support the track pad.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:02.400
And I just wanted to review the machine for a while as it comes from the factory.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.860
And now with 1604 getting here, uh, and plasma five, six and all this, I've decided to reload

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:10.000
the Apollo and try a few different things out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.160
And uh, what I would like to do is land on a final installation for the Apollo that I

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.960
just, I run for a while and I would like to try to run it for a couple of years.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.000
I'm trying to find an installation that will be a multi-year installation for me.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That's quite the task.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Yeah, I know.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.800
So it's either gotta be, it's either gotta be 1604 with a snap packages and Docker containers.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.600
So you can run up-to-date things.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.600
Right.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.920
Or, uh, with, and I want, I want, and the other thing is I want the neon repos because

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:41.280
I always want to continue to get an up-to-date plasma desktop, which is, this is lining up

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.720
to be the perfect solution for me because the, all the pieces are beginning to be there.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.120
But the last thing that I need to be able to do is, uh, I need to be able to keep it

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.980
updating constantly, keep it updating, always rolling, always going right.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:56.280
And just for the desktop, just for some of the core applications, I think 1604 can do

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280
that.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.280
I know I can do it in Arch and I know I can go for multi-year installations in Arch.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.440
This will be the first multi-year Ubuntu installation for me in a very, very, very long time.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.920
There was a period of time where I was like four, five, six upgrades deep in an installation.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:11.920
Wow.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.920
And, and, or it probably wasn't six, it was probably like four.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.160
Uh, it was a long time ago though.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.060
Uh, and I have not been, I have not stuck with an Ubuntu, with the exception of a server

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.560
installation for a long time.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.200
So I really would like, I would really love to pull this off because I would, I would

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.200
love to demo that installation during my review of 1604 in LAS.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:32.360
But to get there, I gotta be able to get five, six installed now.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.600
So my thought is maybe I will try installing Kabutu 15.10 instead, with the Plasma desktop,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.600
right?

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600
Get it just how you like.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.480
Upgrade to, uh, Neon and then upgrade from that to 1604.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.480
Interesting.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.120
I kind of like to watch that.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:54.240
I think it's, I think it would be the perfect blend because you still see, uh, you still

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.320
see a lot of stuff released for Ubuntu.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320
Yes.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320
Quote unquote.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.520
Like anything you go download these days, anything that requires a download.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Linux support, it's Ubuntu support.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.880
Yeah, it's pretty much, you're going to get an Ubuntu package.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.200
If you're lucky, you're going to get 32, 64 bit options, right?

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.320
And they're devs.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320
Maybe an RPM.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320
Yeah.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.560
And then, and then, and then if there, if there's somebody who actually knows Linux

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.120
users, there's also probably a Targesi.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.780
And then that's really something.

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:23.280
And that Targesi will have both 32 and 64 builds in that thing, and it's a big download.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.920
So that's, that's the software distribution on Linux right now.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.680
And the, uh, the reality is, as somebody who is trying to understand things from an end

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.560
user's perspective, and also as somebody who wants to sort of sometimes jump in on some

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.080
of those commercially supported applications, there are advantages to having a machine running

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.680
Ubuntu because that would be my machine.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.680
I try it on.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680
Oh, okay.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680
This is an Ubuntu thing.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680
I'll go try it on the Apollo.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680
And like, it makes a lot of sense.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680
Plus, you know, for games or whatever, whatever.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.480
It makes sense to have an Ubuntu machine.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:55.180
And if snap packages can make it possible for me to get new apps on an older installation,

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:58.520
this is really something I'm willing to give a shot because I think it'd be beneficial

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.920
for, boy, that's loud out there.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.240
I think it'd be beneficial for the shows.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:09.120
Did you ever look into doing the, uh, Tumbleweed option with KDE Krypton or Gnome Next as,

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.440
uh, the, uh, the desktop and then using OpenBuild to get your apps?

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:22.640
Yeah, you know, uh, I, the thing is, is for me, uh, I, uh, I don't particularly enjoy

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.640
using SUSE.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.280
I think it's really a fantastically well-engineered distro with a lot of really good technology

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
around it.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:38.440
Um, but I, you know, I had, uh, a dozen, maybe, maybe more, uh, SUSE Enterprise servers and

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.760
SUSE Enterprise desktops that I've managed in the past and I used SUSE throughout when

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.760
I did that.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.400
Uh, so I spent some time with it and a lot has changed.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:51.480
You know, uh, Zipper looks like a pretty competent tool, but I also find myself often getting

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.000
a little overwhelmed working with it, uh, especially some of the tools and stuff.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.320
And so with my, with the way I look at, uh, SUSE, like any of the, uh, Tumbleweed or Leap

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.240
or whatever is they seem to be on a pretty good track and they seem to be pretty sharp.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.920
So I bet, uh, sooner or later those things that I find rough will probably be smoothed

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.920
over.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920
So I just kind of keep an eye on it.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:17.120
But for me, it's not really what I, I'm either going to go with an Arch or a Fedora or, uh,

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.000
an Ubuntu installation, not really likely to go with anything else.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.640
Maybe Debian rolling, maybe, but probably not.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:35.200
Well, I mean, I wouldn't go Debian rolling more than OpenSUSE because Debian rolling

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.680
is more like, you know, untested stuff.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.680
Like they're, they're, they're tested, but yeah, it's probably something based off Debian

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.680
too.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680
I like Debian.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.680
That's why I say Debian.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680
I really liked Debian.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.960
I was like, oh, that's why I like Ubuntu actually, because I like Debian and then Ubuntu got

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960
it better.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960
So, hey-o.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:59.440
OpenSUSE's Leap is really interesting because, uh, they said there was going to be like not

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.560
very many releases or whatever for the backend.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.880
They're going to do like, you know, once a year type thing and they can't, they've implied

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.880
that in the beginning.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.980
Uh, they've already got, uh, updated to Plasma 5.5 for Leap and Plasma 5.6 is going to Tumbleweed

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.720
pretty soon.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.000
What they mean is that the underlying structure, stuff like system D and the kernel are not

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.640
going to be updated on a regular basis, like, you know, like a weekly or whatever.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.160
Um, but the desktops and the software that writes on top of that, uh, can be updated

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.740
on a regular, uh, pretty fast basis.

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:37.640
What I'm referring to is what they actually said of we don't have any plans, but we're

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.600
looking at like a one year release cycle.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.720
I'm not talking about like what they could do or couldn't or like what they're doing

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720
now.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.000
I'm saying like what they said, they basically said we don't know exactly what we're doing,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.360
but now they've essentially changed to the point where they do know and what they're

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.120
doing is awesome.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:00.780
So it's basically just a, uh, base for the core system.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.920
It's like a slower version of Tumbleweed at this point.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.920
Right.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.280
Um, there is, I don't know if you guys know, if anybody knows which one I'm talking about,

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:16.720
but there is, uh, there's a couple of, there's a thread on, on, on our Linux or somewhere

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.480
where our Brown is answering a lot of people's common questions about OpenSUSE or confusions.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.480
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.220
Where he talks about like, yeah, software doing it.

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.200
He's doing it in both the, our Linux and Linux, actually show separate.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.200
Yeah.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.320
But there's one like that's just like really recent in the last couple of days.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.320
Is that what you're talking about?

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.320
Both of them.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.320
Yeah.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.320
He's doing on both.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.120
Uh, he made a, he made an article about the, what, what's, what, what's, uh, what's good

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.600
about OpenSUSE and stuff like that.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.200
So, uh, it's kind of like those threads are devolving from that article.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.680
I think what I find fascinating about the threads is not any one particular specific

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.980
confusion or a problem, but just how, how brilliantly they demonstrate how complicated

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.920
some of the systems and tools are in, in the distro.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:03.640
Um, there's, there's so many things in there where, uh, his response is, well, that's not

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.280
really the way we recommend people do it.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.000
Or we've never actually documented this to be the way you should do.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.480
We've never actually stated this or that's the way we used to do it.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.320
But now we, there's a lot of that, uh, there's just a lot of ways of doing a few different

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:21.140
things in there that those threads, I think, I think our Brown maybe gets, uh, he gets,

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:25.000
they are so focused on the technology and the engineering, but they're not zooming out

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.320
and actually listening to the meta thing that people are saying.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.600
The bigger thing that people are saying is that it's too complicated.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.640
It's too confusing.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.480
You guys are still, you guys are talking about tumbleweed and leap and I, and, and, and I'm,

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.040
I'm still grasping to fully understand it.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.800
Uh, I mean, I do understand it, but I can quickly get them confused.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.880
I can quickly misunderstand like, uh, Wes right now, not to put you on the spot, but

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.360
right now, if you wanted to get KDE 5.6, would you install tumbleweed or leap?

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360
Tumbleweed.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
Cause that's the rolling one?

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.360
Yes.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.360
Okay.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.560
I think that's the one I would say too, but I could get it in leap too, right?

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.560
Rotten?

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560
Not yet.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.560
No.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560
Okay.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560
You see, I don't follow.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560
I don't know.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.200
And you know, I don't, I don't know.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:12.200
I mean, I know I started to complain about Ubuntu software management, but this is very

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.440
confusing to me too.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.040
Uh, it's just, it's stable and tumbleweeds the rolling.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.040
Right.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.040
Right.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.360
I, I still though, I, I don't know, uh, quite to understand what to expect from which when

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.500
it comes to like, well, if I want five, six today, I'm sure a few Google searches would

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.500
resolve it for me.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.800
I'm not, I'm not saying it's an impossible question to answer.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:36.280
What I'm, what I'm implying is that it's still just a little confusing and people only

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.240
care so much when what they already have works well for them.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:44.680
And so if it's too, if, if the on-ramp is, is too much of a climb, uh, I got other stuff

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.680
to do.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.120
I think is what a lot of people feel and think.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.800
Well, if you wanted to get five, six right now in OpenSUSE, it's just install tumbleweed

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.240
and activate Krypton, which is the like next version.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.880
So you get to use the beta stuff before it's officially released as builds.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.160
So it's, it's still not, it's not like it's like untested stuff, but it's kind of like

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.080
Would that mean that I would then get like five, seven or like five, six, one before

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.840
you get five, six, you get five, six, you get, you get the continuous branch of five,

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:16.800
six until KDE releases their latest version, uh, or like the latest betas of the next build.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.360
So you'd get five, seven at some point with Krypton, but it wouldn't be like immediate.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.360
Okay.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.440
And heavens is also pointing out a blog post over at news.openSUSE.org that talks about

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.040
the different choices for KDE.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.360
I mean, I understand, I do get it, uh, but at the same time, like it does take, it takes,

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.960
I know this sounds really, this is the problem is I think they, they, they underestimate

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.380
the cognitive load that just keeping track of what the hell they're doing takes.

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.160
And I know they're like, oh, that's, it's really simple.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.240
It's simple to them because you're the guys that dreamed it up.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.240
That's why it's simple to you.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.240
You use it every day.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.480
And if you look at the threads, uh, he's so good at actually specifically addressing the

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.200
questions and saying how he should do it that he's, I don't know if he's grokking the overall

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200
issue there.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.920
My, that's just my impressions from afar.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:08.440
I'm going to kind of give them an excuse on, we are used to following how Ubuntu does it.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:13.640
And Ubuntu is somewhat similar to Debian and, um, other distros have picked up names that

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.560
are already used in the cycles or the way other distros cycle.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:22.040
So we are used to seeing that cycle pattern and it's easier to recognize.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:26.920
So actually what they described in here is not that different is that the naming conventions

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.000
are not, you know, easily to correlate.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.800
So you say, think tumbleweed and you use leap and then it's like you usually you are used

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.800
to having, is this unstable or untested or experimental and you know, you did the notion

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:47.700
of forward, you know, and unfortunately our brain in a way and added to that when they

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:53.340
are coming up with the other distros, which are, you know, dinosaurs in the distros community,

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:57.160
you're having the sensation that they have to show what they have different and they

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:01.200
end up having to explain much more than the other distro.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.640
When you go and you pick up Debian, you say, I picked up Debian and you maybe mentioned

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:08.760
one thing because everyone assumes all of the rest of the luggage that Debian already

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.240
built over the years.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.920
When you say, I'm going to pick openSUSE that you kind of have to say, you know, because

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.800
these, these and that and that, and suddenly you're explaining too many things and it seems

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:23.480
confused, but it's just because of the time that they are arriving as a visible thing.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:27.120
That's when people, when you say I'm running Debian, they think you're running the oldest

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.280
possible crap you could possibly do.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.480
So that's not even, that's not the issue of the naming thing.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.280
I think it's because they have terrible marketing.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:42.160
Like they, they have a lot of cool technology and just fundamentally the way that the software

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.600
and tools that they have are amazing.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:50.260
They have, they have, the open QA system is amazing and if you just, if you, if you look

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:56.520
at it and see how it works, it will blow you away, but it's really hard to figure out how

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:01.580
it works because it's the most complicated website to go through you could imagine.

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.720
Like it makes, it makes a folder structure like, you know, those, those websites where

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.640
it's just like a directory of files.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:12.280
It makes that seem easier to navigate because there, you have to, you have to know that

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.160
you had to click a particular link in this, like they have an order where you want to

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.200
see a result for one of the tests.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.720
You click the name of the, the test, the date of the test, then you go into which package

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.160
you want to see, which version of the test, then you have to click a link for let's say

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.240
a Gnome test.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.960
Then you have to click an icon to show a video of that test and the, it's just kind of hard

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.920
to get to where you're going.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.480
But once you find it and you realize that this thing is doing an automatic test, showing

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:47.160
a video, highlighting different elements of the test, like testing the deck, the desktop

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.680
loading, running, opening applications, playing audio sounds, playing music, watching videos

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.680
and it's doing this automatically, that is amazing.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:59.640
So here's my, here's my, kind of my thoughts on this for, for SUSE as a desktop.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.040
Open SUSE Leap or Tumbleweed.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:08.520
I think the biggest, the biggest distro besides maybe Fedora that would benefit from XGG apps

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.920
or universal app installers or however we're going to get there, it would be SUSE.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:17.680
Because at the end of the day, it comes down to, it's really got to be dead simple for

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.240
people to get software installed to do work.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.040
If I want to convince people like Michael Dominic from Coderadio, he's doing a Linux

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.040
testing experiment.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.920
Yeah, the last few, the last like three or four weeks of Coderadio, he's been reporting

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:31.440
on his experiences of switching to Ubuntu.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:36.560
And he went to Ubuntu because he would, he wants to know, he just needs a path to know

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.400
how to download and install software and it needs to work reliably because he's simply

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.040
using this to code.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.300
He's writing Android apps right now and he just needs a workstation to develop on.

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:49.280
And the timing is perfect because his Mac died and he needed to pick something himself

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.320
on his own, install it and get rolling.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.280
And it's not that SUSE doesn't have the tools or the build service or the great software.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:04.720
The issue really comes down to the workflow that an average web dev might sit down, like

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.000
we just looked at that Stack Overflow survey, a huge percentage of the developers are, consider

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.280
themselves to be web devs.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.600
Okay, well if they're web devs, then they could web dev on Linux.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.040
They don't have to web dev on a Mac or Windows.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.640
So they, but they need a workflow that is reliable and reproducible for damn near every

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.360
single application for Linux they download from the web.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.160
Ubuntu delivers that right now simply by market adoption.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:32.400
But if XDG apps came along and you could take that one download and you could run it on

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:38.760
Fedora, Ubuntu or SUSE, then all of a sudden that barrier, that wall that's been around

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.480
SUSE, the software availability of commercial applications, things like Sublime Text and

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.960
Telegram and Herupad and some of the SIP clients that we have attempted to install, all of

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.620
that stuff that has been traditionally so hard to get on SUSE, even though there's all

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:56.120
these different methods to get software on there, that wall would fall because every

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.440
application would be available for SUSE all of a sudden packaged that way.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.280
And then all of the technical merits of the distribution would be way more important,

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280
right?

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280
It becomes way more important.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.880
But right now, the fundamental box you've got to check is can I get my job done?

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.220
And for some of us, that box is absolutely checked.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:20.880
But for a lot of noobs out there, because that workflow is not consistent, how you get

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.160
that Sublime Text, how you get that Herupad or how you get that Telegram download or that

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.900
Google Chrome link, because I'm a brand new user, right?

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.440
When I go download Google Chrome, we watch Chase do this.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:35.520
He goes to the Google Chrome website and he looks for a download link.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.440
It never even crosses his mind to look in a repository or a software website, never

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.240
crosses his mind, because he's literally been using Windows for 20 years, right?

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:49.860
So he goes and downloads the deb file for Google Chrome and installs it on his desktop,

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.440
just like Michael Dominic did that night when he had to reload his Dell machine in the middle

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.320
of the night from a thumb drive and he didn't have anybody to call on.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:59.860
He knew that he needed to go get Google Chrome to do half his workload, so he went and downloaded

01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:04.040
that deb file from the website, and that's an expected workflow.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.120
And with these new universal applications, we could reproduce that same exact thing.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120
It's not ideal.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.040
That's how I want to get my software, but that's how they want to get their software.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:15.320
And until that's going to be available, I don't see Sousa getting a ton of traction

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.920
because there's too much of a barrier for that kind of thing, for Sousa right now.

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.080
And there's lots of work around, and if you go post a question in Reddit, there's going

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.560
to be somebody super smart that'll give you the exact command or maybe two commands to

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.320
run on the command line to fix it.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:31.000
But that's not a way to solve the problem.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.720
That's not going to work at scale.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.320
Wes, there is a big old long thing, gosh, I wish I would have printed this out.

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.760
I feel like I want to read this, but it's really long.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:48.480
It's from R Brown at OpenSousa, and he is writing here at the KDE mailing list.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.120
And I don't know if you guys have seen this.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:55.360
It's how to handle KDE not respecting your distros requirements.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:02.400
And it's in response to some packaging issues and about GNOME releases.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.680
And I think it's really interesting.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.520
We almost don't even know the rest of the discussion to read some of the interesting

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.520
points that he makes here.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.800
He says, while I strongly agree with the sentiment that KDE should choose its own path, I think

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:19.600
it's somewhat enlightening to consider that the competitive field KDE has to operate in.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.160
While in my last email I pointed out KDE is the default in only one out of the Distro

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:31.460
Watch top 10 and two out of the Distro Watch top 25, GNOME is the default in three out

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.320
of the top 10 and seven out of the top 25.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.360
GNOME is the default option in all enterprise Linux distributions.

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:43.240
GTK and other GNOME apps and technologies provide the foundation of the default choice

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.560
of another four of the top 25 distributions.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.640
QT provides the foundation of only one of the other top 25 default desktops.

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:57.600
The remaining 11 either do not have a default or opt for lightweight options like LXD or

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.000
XFCE, et cetera.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.760
Or to put it another way, GNOME and its stack is at least three times more popular with

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.800
distributions than KDE and its stack.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:12.840
We've seen this trend mirrored even within OpenSUSE.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.600
Even as KDE with the default option for our installer, over recent years we've transitioned

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.960
from a strong majority KDE distribution to one where KDE is now used by less than 50%

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.000
of our user base.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.720
Why all the doom and gloom?

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:34.200
Because I think it's important we be realistic about where we are before we can improve things.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.440
Doing the same as the other guys is not a viable option when they have the dominant

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.560
position.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.160
They already have all the buy-in from the wider ecosystem of distributions who put them

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.760
first.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.600
They can afford to make questionable choices.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.000
It seems no matter how questionable their choices may have already been, it's not negatively

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.320
impacting their adoption rates compared to KDE.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.720
KDE has to be better, smarter, leaner to compete.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:03.160
It needs to be easier for packages and packagers to work with than the alternatives, easier

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:06.800
to put together, easier to maintain, and easier to track changes.

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.760
I personally think the whole Plasma Application Frameworks Qt split has dramatically increased

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:16.120
the workload of distribution packagers here for little to no benefit for users, although

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.320
I do recognize it makes it easier to develop.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.320
Look at the applications.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.800
Are they all necessary?

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:27.320
Does KDE need to offer an office suite when almost everyone really just uses LibreOffice

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.600
these days?

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.800
Is Scrooge a worthy competitor to GNU Cache?

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:33.160
Does KDE really need two text editors?

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:36.440
There's a duplication even among KDE's own web application offerings.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.840
Never mind when we put up against the backdrop of distributions are wanting to offer.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.780
I think there's room for streamlining there.

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:47.560
And I know it's painful to suggest, but right now KDE is the biggest, heaviest desktop-oriented

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.720
software stack for Linux distributions.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:55.800
All of the competition, even GNOME, is smaller, leaner, and therefore more readily integratable

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.240
into distributions.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.720
But maybe going on a diet isn't an option.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:05.880
If KDE wants to remain technically large and continue to provide such a broad offering,

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.040
then at least it has to do a better job of selling itself to distributions.

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.400
In addition to the clear technical information regarding dependencies and such, distributions

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.680
need clear information about why users should adopt KDE in order to parrot that to their

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.680
users.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.200
What are KDE's selling points?

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.880
What are the hooks which make KDE better than the rest?

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:30.120
I fear KDE is currently making the same mistake I saw OpenSUSE make in the past by only trying

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.440
to sell itself on technical merit and mostly letting software speak for itself.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.240
As I understand why, I've been saying for years that Qt is a superior platform for desktop

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.640
and desktop application developments from GTK, but that being true hasn't changed how

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:51.160
many distributions put their faith into which desktop stack first.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.920
Testing through software capability only speaks to a very narrow market, and problems with

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.160
software quality erode that market dreadfully quickly.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.600
And I think it's safe to say that KDE has had some severe problems with software quality

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.600
lately.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.220
And I do not think that putting all of the responsibility of testing onto a distribution

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:10.960
is a sensible strategy to turn that around.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.880
Is there more KDE can do to make sure its offerings are well tested before distributions

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.640
have to find a way to make all of the parts work together?

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.720
KDE needs to make it very easy for distributions to sell the premise, the promise, and the

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.760
benefits of using KDE to their users.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.720
Where possible, that should be more meaningful than just a bunch of screenshots and feature

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.800
descriptions.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.560
People should have an idea of what the KDE project is trying to achieve and therefore

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.940
be able to buy into that concept by using your software.

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:42.780
Right now, I don't see much information available to help weave such a story.

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.280
That's my two cents anyway.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.560
Man, that's a great post.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.560
Wow.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.120
Yeah, it's really good.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.800
There's a few parts that I massively disagree of saying, and it's incredibly heavy.

01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:02.120
But as far as the fact that GTK and Gnome have such a huge lead as far as users, that's

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.120
totally true.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:20.200
Even when Gnome does incredibly stupid things, it doesn't seem to stop anything.
