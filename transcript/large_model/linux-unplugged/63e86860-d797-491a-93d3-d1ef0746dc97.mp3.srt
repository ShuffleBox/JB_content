00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 2 for August 19th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,460
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, our second episode, a show that I won't say cleans up after the

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,160
sloppy seconds of the Linux Action Show, but it's definitely inspired from the Linux Action

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Show.

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
My name is Chris.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
My name is Matt.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Hey, Matt.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Welcome to number two, man.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Welcome.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Right on.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,200
So this week we're going to... a big part of Linux Unplugged going forward is audience

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960
interaction because we've got some smart people out there.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,680
We want to get the community involved.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,000
Arbulous in our chat room set us up with a mumble server on a hosted system.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
We actually had a couple of people that did some projects for us around mumble.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
It was really awesome.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,640
But Arbulous set us up a hosted server and we're just having a few issues.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
I installed mumble right before the show started.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
It didn't work out, but don't fret, Matt.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
I don't want you to stress.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
I am not stressed.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,360
You know, I think I can keep myself seated and calm.

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Oh, okay.

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Good.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Good.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
I think I'll be all right.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
All right.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Well, you know what?

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
We'll open up the Skype line and then folks can call in as we go.

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Exactly.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,240
And so today, should we start with follow up stuff from last week's episode?

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
What do you think?

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Or I guess yesterday's episode?

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
I guess that would be yesterday.

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,760
I think that's a good plan because there's a lot of stuff that we've thought of and I'm

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,240
sure that the audience has as well.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Yeah.

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
You know, you and I were just talking a little bit during the pre-show that, you know, you

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
poked a little more at elementary and I realized, so I guess we should back up.

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,280
Yesterday in the Linux action show, Sunday, we reviewed elementary OS Luna and big review,

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
highly anticipated.

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,420
I think probably everybody knows about it.

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,960
And it's funny because I definitely missed a couple of aspects in the review.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I knew I would.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,080
I knew I would.

47
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,200
And the one that struck me is I thought maybe a point that I should have made during the

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,880
review was that I could see this being a really good desktop elementary OS Luna for developers

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,640
because you got a good, clean, efficient system that really lets you focus on your work.

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,240
And I think for developers, there's some value in that Ubuntu LTS compatibility and support.

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,920
You know, you get applications that are targeted for Ubuntu LTS, especially in the work sector.

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,040
And with that UI and all of that, I really think it would be a compelling developer's

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
desktop.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I think it's an amazing developer's desktop and I think once you accept the fact that

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
they're not trying to target people that want lots of settings, it begins to make a lot

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
of sense.

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I think that's the one fall down.

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,520
A lot of people look at it and say, oh, how do I do this?

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
How do I do that?

60
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,640
I can't find my settings.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,880
It's not necessarily designed for options on its options.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,280
You want KDE if you want that.

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,720
I think, you know, that is why it didn't work for me.

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,180
Because I feel like I have watched over the last couple of years my options be removed

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,080
from me as a user and I'm just now I am sort of the pendulum is swung and now I just want

66
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
everything.

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,240
Give it all to me and I will just deal with the complexity because I prefer to have the

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,360
complexity than not to have the flexibility.

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Exactly.

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah.

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,000
And that's kind of my thing on it, too, is that I found myself I was drawn to the simplicity

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
of it.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,640
But then I realized that there are other ways of making an existing desktop six XFC or whatever

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
it may be open box, other simplistic desktops that you can still do that with.

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,080
So I wasn't limited to going just that route.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,320
OK, let's put our time machine caps on and project way out in the future.

77
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,120
And Ubuntu has really gotten some traction with sort of carriers taking Ubuntu and putting

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,800
it on old Android devices that didn't sell very well.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
And now they're all running.

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,080
This is like two years from now and they're all running like Ubuntu Touch and they're

81
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,880
selling it as like the Verizon OS and all of this junked up crap.

82
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Right.

83
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,480
And the and the progress on the Ubuntu desktop continues, but it sees less and less attention

84
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,720
as time goes on.

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
This seems like a potential reality in a few years.

86
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Right.

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
It does.

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
That leaves companies and I'm wearing my system 76 shirt right now, but that leaves companies

89
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,100
like system 76 in a real bad spot.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,200
It's going to force them to make some tough choices and to really look at where they want

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
to go in future directions.

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,720
And I think that they're resilient enough that they would adapt.

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, sure.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
But it certainly creates a hassle.

95
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,880
Well, think about this.

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,720
That same time is another couple of years of polish and new applications and improved

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
on the existing applications for elementary OS.

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,660
Maybe elementary OS sort of becomes like the OS 10 of desktop Linux that a company like

99
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,440
system 76, who is very, you know, they have very high end products.

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,960
In some regards, Ubuntu is almost not good enough for the system 76 hardware.

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
And they don't sponsor this show.

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm just saying that like the hardware is better than the operating systems.

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,880
And they like they could I could really see like a slick metal system 76 Ultrabook with

104
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,480
elementary OS on it would be a really, really compelling product that would be competitive

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,720
with the MacBook Air.

106
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,360
You know, I would expand on that and go a step further and say in my mind, if they want

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,880
to go that route, then they really need to run their own distribution.

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,000
And I know that's a ballsy, heavy handed approach.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
But but you know, let's say they go with that, you know, they go with elementary and it's

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
rocking and everything's awesome.

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,240
And then all of a sudden, OK, well, the developers done.

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Now what?

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Oops.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
They're back to square one.

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Yeah.

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
But if they were to borrow that code and basically do what like Mint did to where they basically

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,960
said, thanks, Ubuntu, this is great, but we're going to start working on our own projects

118
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,720
and actually building away from that based on the same thing, not because they're trying

119
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
to be douchey, but just because they want to make sure they're covering their backsides

120
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,400
should the unthinkable happen and they control the whole stack.

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
And they exactly.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,700
But the thing is, is they're focused on hardware.

123
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
They are.

124
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,400
And that's where that's where there's an elementary is focused on UI.

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,600
The alternative to that is then maybe they begin to fund elementary to where it's interesting,

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,120
higher, maybe higher the dev or help them out a little bit.

127
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,080
Do a red hat approach or a novel approach to where basically they fund the project where

129
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,240
it's like, OK, we don't have time to manage this, but we need to make sure you guys are.

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah.

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
You know, that would be another alternative.

132
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,880
They don't have that problem with Ubuntu, which is a sweet spot for them.

133
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,120
And it allows them to do what they need to do.

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,680
But you know, they they're definitely a hardware company.

135
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,360
So you know, Ubuntu doing weird things would definitely create some issues for them.

136
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Yeah, I think I find it to be in an interesting future where we go.

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,040
It's good to see some of these desktops that are coming up that are really offering some

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,120
serious alternatives.

139
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,320
And you know, I think we'll just kind of kick back and look forward to future releases of

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
elementary OS.

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Absolutely.

142
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Do you have any other?

143
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, one last thought is I like the idea of the unified application stack.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't think that's for everybody, but I think for just somebody that in an enterprise

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,880
environment or somewhere, they just need, you know, simple applications to do basic

146
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,160
things without a lot of fluff and cruft.

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,560
I think that's a nice approach and I'd like to see more of that.

148
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,480
So KDE 4.11 hit my rig this morning before Coder Radio started.

149
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,360
I did the I did the upgrade and I thought, yeah, should I wait until after Coder Radio?

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
But I didn't.

151
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I didn't wait.

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
And it turned out fine.

153
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,120
And knock on press board, Matt, haven't had a sound issue yet.

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
No kidding.

155
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I mean, I did.

156
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
We just actually on the pre show had a little sound problem, but that was mumble related.

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Not right.

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,320
But I've been switching interfaces this morning and so far, so far, no problem.

159
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
That's awesome.

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,900
And I'm hoping I'm hoping that that sticks because then I'll feel more comfortable about

161
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,840
using KDE more frequently.

162
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,200
I know this is cliche cliche to say, too, but it feels a little faster, too.

163
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh, well, now that I do know from what I've read that they well, that was a big sentence.

164
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,920
I know that I've been reading a lot of details that they've been trying to speed things up

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,840
to optimize, optimize, optimize.

166
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
That's really been a big focus for them.

167
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,560
And so that may continue and that may be what's what we're experiencing now with the new release.

168
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
So yesterday in last we covered the steam stats.

169
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,400
And we talked about how it's it's it's probably around Linux usage on steam is about one point

170
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,000
six nine percent or something like that.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,440
And I thought I was looking at this, you know, this is something I've been trying to track

172
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
for the show so that we can kind of have a good perspective on the growth of steam and

173
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
we can kind of comment on how the how steam is doing on Linux in general.

174
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,840
And I realize that there's really nobody is tracking this number very well.

175
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,040
There's like we get the monthly snapshot, but nobody's like putting it in a database

176
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,800
and charting it and like showing us on a line graph where it's going.

177
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Exactly.

178
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Show me exactly what you're showing me, because I mean, they're just basically throwing numbers

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,560
at you, which are meaningless without details.

180
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,480
And they get in like and how do I you know, it's kind of hard to picture how these numbers

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
compared to three months ago.

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,080
It'd be nice if I could, you know, see a trend.

183
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,720
And I find it there's a there's a guy his name is Horace Horace Deju.

184
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,280
He has a website called a Simcoe.

185
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,960
And he does this for the mobile market.

186
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,000
He kind of he he he goes in there and digs out all of the information nuggets out of

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,800
the out of the quarterly reports and, you know, publicly available statements.

188
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,640
He digs it all out, gets all the hard numbers.

189
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,520
And then he puts together these incredible graphs and charts of of iPhone versus Android

190
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,960
and iOS seven versus Android four, three, all this other stuff.

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,960
That is really good from like a trend analysis standpoint to sit back and go, oh, yeah, I

192
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,000
can definitely see how where these two lines cross each other.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,640
My personal plea, Matt, to the Linux community, if anybody out there is good with graphs and

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,640
numbers, maybe take on this watching steam on Linux thing.

195
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,200
I think that one of those beats you could start to follow that as as the time goes on

196
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,640
will sort of grow into a larger and larger role in the Linux community.

197
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
That'd be mine.

198
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,200
Well, it'd be awesome if someone could break it down for us just like, OK, exactly what

199
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,560
is truly being said here?

200
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Where are they dropping the ball?

201
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,600
Where where is it falling into the other category?

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Which you know, which distros are specifically involved?

203
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,760
I would love some actual meat and potatoes details on what's actually happening and I'm

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
not seeing that.

205
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
It'd be really interesting to be able to like really see like when one distro is starting

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,160
to fall off, you know, like, oh, this distro is losing popularity, then we can all gossip

207
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
about why that would be.

208
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,520
John Bob's Linux is over surpassing Hannah Montana or whatever, you know, whatever the

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
thing may be.

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I want to know.

211
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Yeah.

212
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
All right.

213
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,440
Well, I want to just cover a couple of bits of feedback to this show and then we'll get

214
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,280
into some more some other topics.

215
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,860
But you know, I I'm only going to let us talk about ourselves for so long.

216
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,940
Once we get to like episode five or so, it feels embarrassing to be so self-indulgent.

217
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,160
But we got a really good response to the first episode.

218
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
So thank you, everyone.

219
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,080
We're pretty excited about that.

220
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,960
And we got got a lot of people that were very, very happy to see another show.

221
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Like it just surprised them.

222
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,920
They didn't catch the last bit on last and like, what?

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Another show?

224
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,360
So, yeah, here is another show that shows a little different.

225
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,580
It's a little less visual centric.

226
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
It's more audio centric.

227
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,160
Part of the reason is there's more Linux involved in the production of the show.

228
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,200
All of all of my all of my visuals here are done on all of my notes and everything.

229
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,280
All my Web pages, my chat, everything's on Linux.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,800
And unfortunately, I don't I can't be hardwired into the switcher like I am when I'm in the

231
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
studio.

232
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
So I can't show you my screen as easy.

233
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,240
Now, I do have a backup Apple Macintosh computer.

234
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,560
They named them after the Apple.

235
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm not sure if you're familiar with these guys.

236
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,560
They're not named after the Orange and all this time.

237
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Yeah, it's run by a guy a guy named Wozniak.

238
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,000
He I guess he owns the I'm not I'm not familiar with the details, Matt.

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,580
Anyways, I got one of their fruit computers here.

240
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,320
So we do have something we need to show up on the screen.

241
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,720
I can but I probably won't be using it as much.

242
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Just I wanted to kind of make that disclaimer.

243
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,760
And as the tech is that tech gets worked out, that will kind of get solved.

244
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,260
You know, well, I'm trying to come up with a way to remotely get the video screen on

245
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,000
my Linux box to a remote broadcast machine.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,040
I don't have that figured out yet.

247
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,640
There is software available that used to work under wine that Matt and I used to use.

248
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,520
I kind of had to jump through some hoops to make it work.

249
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,800
But we got it to work.

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,680
And now that doesn't work anymore either.

251
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Exactly.

252
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,240
And and for those and before anyone mentions, yes, we're aware of Cinderella, we're aware

253
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,360
of VNC, we're aware of all the various Linux applications that allegedly can make you do

254
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
this.

255
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,480
I wonder if they don't really they don't really do it well.

256
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,000
No, it really would like VNC like even that would be kind of Yeah, it would not be what

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
happens if someone chimes and says, Well, you can do it with a, you know, use OpenShot

258
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,240
over here with some Kdenlive on top of that.

259
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,280
And then under this, you use some VNC and then you stand on one foot and through blenders

260
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,200
and exactly like, wait, what and how do you do all this live?

261
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
It's like, wait, what now?

262
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,920
It's like, well, you know, they got a green screen.

263
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,320
What's a green screen got to do with an audio show?

264
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,160
I mean, yeah, just gets really out of control.

265
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,540
The other good news is because it's audio, nobody will know that this is a two bear show

266
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
for me.

267
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,080
Nobody's gonna know that I'm in the clear, so I don't have to worry about it.

268
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
All right.

269
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,400
Well, so guess what?

270
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Guess what?

271
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Pretty excited.

272
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
We got two sponsors this week.

273
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,240
So I thought maybe we'd cover our first sponsor.

274
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,560
And then I want to talk after we talk after we talk about our sponsor this week, I want

275
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,840
to cover a little bit more on the steam community.

276
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,880
I want to talk a little bit about rolling my own mail server because I've gotten some

277
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
good feedback on that.

278
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,400
And then I'm going to cover some of the emails we've gotten into the show and I will take

279
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
some Skype calls too.

280
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
So we got a lot coming up.

281
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,520
But first I want to thank Ting.

282
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
That's right.

283
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,200
Ting.com is sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

284
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Now Ting is mobile.

285
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
That makes sense.

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
A lot of you guys are familiar with Ting, but Matt, right over there, our very own Matt

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,120
is a recent convert.

288
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I am.

289
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,560
Chris was kind enough to get me to the Galaxy Note 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

290
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,600
And it is running Ting.

291
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,720
How much larger is that Note 2 than the Droid?

292
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,640
It's like the Droid was like, was it a four inch screen on the Droid?

293
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
It was a decent screen.

294
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Let's see.

295
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I've got my Droid.

296
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Yeah.

297
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
Just looking at screen, cause I have a case on it, so it kind of gives an interesting

298
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
perspective.

299
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
I would say about two inches.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,480
It feels bigger, but that's not a bad thing because it does kind of solve my phablet challenge

302
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
that I had previously.

303
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Yeah.

304
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Well, you're not a big tablet guy, right?

305
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,080
So this is right in this, this is in the sweet spot.

306
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
Exactly.

307
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
Cause I don't really prefer, I don't really like tablets, but I would love something that

308
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
could fit in my pocket and this will fit.

309
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,440
And it's like, well, this is great.

310
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,640
Signal strength has been fantastic.

311
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,400
I live in the middle of nowhere and I have Verizon and I have Ting and I'm actually getting

312
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,200
one and I'm, I'm, I'm being completely straight with you guys where I'm located in my home

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
right now.

314
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,840
I have four bars on Ting and two bars on Verizon.

315
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Don't know.

316
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,960
And what's great is, uh, the, uh, the, uh, barrier to entry is super low.

317
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Like if you, you know, you didn't know before you tried it.

318
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Oh, right.

319
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
It was super easy to set up, right?

320
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,440
You were able to, were you able to activate it all through the website?

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,920
I was able to activate the whole thing.

322
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,640
I had to disassociate the previous number, which was super simple.

323
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Thanks to their help.

324
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,160
Their help thing typed in, Hey, how do I disassociate previous number?

325
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Typed it in.

326
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
It gave me the numbers to dial.

327
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Did it bam, bam, bam.

328
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Restarted the phone.

329
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
It re-recognized.

330
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
I was good to go.

331
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,520
I was instantly calling people and texting Chris.

332
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Yeah, that's right.

333
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Yeah.

334
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,680
I was pretty impressed.

335
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,800
And uh, the way Ting works, so it's really like zero risk is you only pay for what you

336
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
use.

337
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,640
So they just break out your rate by minutes, text message and megabytes.

338
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,240
They'll bill you at the end of the month for whatever bucket you fall into.

339
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,440
And the base rate's like six bucks.

340
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,360
So you know, Matt, if for some reason at one week, one month even, you don't use the phone

341
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,560
for an entire month, you're not out like some crazy amount of money.

342
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,400
You just, you're out what you didn't pay.

343
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Six dollars flat.

344
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,880
You don't, if you didn't use it, you didn't use it.

345
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I love that.

346
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
I literally dig through my couch to pay the bill.

347
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
I love that.

348
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Right?

349
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
It's couch money.

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
And now also you've got a device you can take with you at all times.

351
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,800
It has built in tethering and hotspot as part of the plan, uh, which is just so nice.

352
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,040
There's no add on charges for things like voicemail, caller ID, three way calling, call

353
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,640
reporting, all that stuff is built in, super easy to manage through the Ting website.

354
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,680
No contract, no overages, no penalties when you want to turn it off and no bundling of

355
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,160
ride along services.

356
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,000
Plus Ting has excellent customer service.

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,120
We've gotten letters and letters from people that confirm when they call into Ting, you'll

358
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,440
get an answer within one or two rings.

359
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,960
You'll talk to a real person if you call between eight AM and eight PM, one eight five five

360
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Ting FTW.

361
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
They got FTW on their phone number.

362
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay.

363
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
How cool is that?

364
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
How cool is that?

365
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
That is awesome.

366
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Go check out Ting.

367
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,800
It's a great cell phone and go get yourself a cell service that knows you're smart.

368
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,980
That's not trying to trick you in and lure you in with a carrot and then trap you.

369
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
You guys know better.

370
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,080
I love that there's no weird fees.

371
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,120
It's like when I look at how much I use or what I'm planning on using, and I'll also

372
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
love the fact of not going to be nailed on data.

373
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,280
It's just, it just rolls up or down accordingly.

374
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
It's awesome.

375
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm looking at it.

376
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
It's like, oh, that's my, that's my bill.

377
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,140
There's no weird like use fee or anything bizarre.

378
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
It's just awesome.

379
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,680
There's certain types of devices and I'd put the, maybe the HTC one and the first iPad,

380
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,360
the, you know, my first tablet experience, even the first Nexus, like when you hold it,

381
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,040
it clicks in a whole new way.

382
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,240
Like, oh, this is a game changer.

383
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,180
I feel that way about Ting and my device when I have, when I have Ting service with a smart

384
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,840
device like that, it's like, okay, so, so this is the future.

385
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,080
It's not as bad as these other telcos are trying to make it.

386
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,480
It's we can actually do this and it, Ting, Ting makes me really excited about the future

387
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,900
of these mobile devices paired within a fantastic service like Ting.

388
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,580
So go to Linux, linux.ting.com.

389
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
That's right.

390
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,280
We got the code Linux for Linux Unplugged.

391
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
How cool is that?

392
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
So go to linux.ting.com.

393
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
That's so great.

394
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,220
I love that we got linux.ting.com and save $25 off your first device or $25 off your

395
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,200
first month of service.

396
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

397
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Big thank you.

398
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,320
I want to talk a little bit just as a lead up, probably with stood off topic, it'll be

399
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
in next week's episode.

400
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,480
I hope we're not bringing people out on this, but listen, the Cindy Go Go's only got hours

401
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
left on it, but Ubuntu Edge at this point, it looks like it's not going to make its $32

402
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
million goal.

403
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,720
No, no, not unless Trump or some rich dude, some rich guy comes bombing in with a bunch

404
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
of money.

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
I don't see it happen.

406
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Yeah, I thought Crash Bandicoot.

407
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,480
He's in our IRC sub and in our subreddit and he had three points that he felt like were

408
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,840
sort of the major reasons Ubuntu Edge was not going to reach funding.

409
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
Number one reason, no hardware to show.

410
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
People could read a review of it, they would be more inclined to actually put some money

411
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,040
down because everyone's been burned by big promises in the past.

412
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
I think you kind of expressed that.

413
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
That's very true.

414
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Yeah.

415
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,560
Number two, hardware specs are nice, but as anyone who's moved from a leg ridden high

416
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,840
end Android to a smooth as butter iOS device and back knows, hardware specs count as almost

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
nothing these days.

418
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,120
This adds to my above point, without an actual third party review, people don't have enough

419
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,160
data to risk the money.

420
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,600
I think this is absolutely true.

421
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,320
He goes on to mention there's been other things like RAM and storage are locked in, but other

422
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
aspects are vague.

423
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,080
He said, we also live in a buy now, pay later society.

424
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,100
This is a huge issue too, and the pay now and receive later model is a difficult one

425
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,320
to sell with fundraising campaigns and the perks aren't priced as high, so people don't

426
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,000
mind risking 20 or 50 bucks here or there to support them, but this is a major outlay

427
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,960
it for a lot of people who are not necessarily even paying one third of this for a phone

428
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,020
that they'd be receiving right then and there.

429
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,760
Even though they're still really painful price, they only see the initial outlay as the expense.

430
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,500
I think that's the big issue right there.

431
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,000
It's not only a matter, as you pointed out, of avoiding the whole buy now, get it later,

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,400
the whole instant gratification thing, but the fact that they're saying, okay, drop 600

433
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,160
bucks, 500 bucks, 700 bucks, whatever it may be, and then wait.

434
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Wow, really?

435
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,280
That sucks.

436
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
That really sucks.

437
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,720
It's not because the phone sucks, but the experience just... Marketing 101, no one

438
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
wants to do that.

439
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
It's like, I'm willing to outlay the money, but make darn sure that thing's in the mail.

440
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,240
You know what I mean?

441
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't make me wait for six months or whatever it may be.

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Forget that.

443
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No way.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,080
Yeah, I totally follow you, and I think... So what it is is it's a niche of a niche, because

445
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,420
it's a niche of people who want the Ubuntu operating system and that aren't already satisfied

446
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,180
with the existing products on the market, which is probably the majority, but then once

447
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,240
you take those people down, then you have to go for the niche of the people.

448
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,160
I go back to Mark's example of the formula racing car.

449
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,520
It's a custom built, limited design.

450
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,740
I personally, I am more inclined to buy tech if it's a limited mint edition.

451
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,480
If I'm one of the few 50,000 people or 80,000 people that had an Ubuntu Edge, that's a thrill

452
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
for me.

453
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,120
So I'm willing to wait the year, because it's sort of like getting in on an IndyCar race

454
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
car kind of thing.

455
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:24,320
I do kind of see that end of the argument, only it's more at a wage worker's price point

456
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
than a race car.

457
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Yeah, exactly.

458
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,080
So I was willing to wait, but I think I am a minority in that regard.

459
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Well, and I think that you touched on something that's really important.

460
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,080
You mentioned the whole, we need to find a way to add an exclusive experience behind

461
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,080
this, whether that's a private conference call with Mark Shuttleworth or a little club

462
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,200
to where they get to see all the behind the scenes stuff that nobody else gets to see

463
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
at all.

464
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean, give me something now.

465
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,520
I mean, something even mildly compelling now, not later.

466
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,000
I think if they can come up with kind of a club environment to do that, some sort of

467
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,520
a – I don't know what it would be, but their offerings kind of suck right now.

468
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,560
The phone's cool, eventually, maybe if it ever happens, and then of course you're

469
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,720
on top of that battling the fact that you have a mindset of people saying, well, it's

470
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,200
going to fail, so no one's going to bother now.

471
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah, especially when the price was so high.

472
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Right.

473
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,620
The phone is a really cool idea.

474
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,160
For anyone listening, I want to really drive that home.

475
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm not belittling the phone at all.

476
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm belittling how badly this campaign was done.

477
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,260
It was absolutely done with the expectation that people are just going to be beating themselves

478
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,800
over the head with their wads of money coming to the table.

479
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I suppose so.

480
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Give me a break.

481
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
I suppose so.

482
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Yeah.

483
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,880
I'm just being honest, and I think the phone's a cool idea.

484
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,120
It was good enough for Stephen Fry, Matt.

485
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,480
It should be good enough for – so they've raised – they've gotten – this morning

486
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,440
when I was doing CoderRadio, they're at 11.4.

487
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Now they're 11.57 million, 57 hours remaining.

488
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,140
I think one of the things I wanted to give some thought for by Sunday's Linux action

489
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,120
show is what does this mean if it fails?

490
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,560
What are the – I mean, we know what Canonical's going to say.

491
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,720
Canonical's going to come out and say, even though it didn't reach funding, it is a success.

492
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
We started the conversation.

493
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,120
We moved the dialogue forward.

494
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,400
We got people thinking.

495
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
We dared.

496
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
You are speak.

497
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Right.

498
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,960
But that's what a company has to do, right?

499
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
No.

500
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
They don't have to.

501
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
They choose to.

502
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
I work with PR.

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
It makes me cringe every time I hear it.

504
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
No, I – I agree.

505
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I agree.

506
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I do agree.

507
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
No, you're right.

508
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
You're right.

509
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
It does make me cringe, too, and I don't like it.

510
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,080
It makes me roll my eyes, and it makes me think, gosh, that's why I like community

511
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
banks.

512
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,440
They're a great company with a great idea and a great phone, and I want to see them

513
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,880
succeed, but they need to get off their pedestal.

514
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
They're not Apple.

515
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,840
People aren't going to just magically jump over there for the promise of air that you

516
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,120
need to offer something upfront that gets these folks excited.

517
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,120
If nothing more than to make them part of the build experience, even that would be something

518
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,860
towards like we can't fly you out, but we can have private streaming – video streams.

519
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,960
We can have private meetings.

520
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
We can have – just include people.

521
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Got sessions.

522
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Yeah.

523
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Include people in the experience.

524
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,360
Then at least they might actually get a rip because then they feel like they're part

525
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,600
of this phone that's not here yet.

526
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
That's all.

527
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I mean, just – it's so obvious.

528
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
I just can't put together how they even figured that out.

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
That makes me want to open beer number two, so I'm going to do it.

530
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Oh, my God.

531
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Yeah.

532
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
All right.

533
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
All right.

534
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Well, we'll ruminate on it.

535
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,120
I want to talk about it more on Sunday.

536
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,720
If you guys want to call in to Jupiter Broadcasting on Skype and share your thoughts on why Ubuntu

537
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,120
Edge is – or maybe you still think it could have a shot, I'd love to hear that.

538
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,240
I'd love to hear that argument.

539
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I really would.

540
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Oh, yeah.

541
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Totally.

542
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,660
I would love to hear some theories on it for sure.

543
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,920
We talked a little bit this morning on Coder Radio – we talked about two things.

544
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,760
The second thing we talked about was the Ubuntu Edge stuff, kind of from a developer's perspective.

545
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm drinking a Heineken, by the way, the chat room ass, and before you jump on me,

546
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,640
the wife brought me home a couple cases, and I'm not going to begrudge her for bringing

547
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
me home beer.

548
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Hey.

549
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Anyone bringing you a Heine?

550
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I use a popular beer.

551
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Yeah.

552
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,200
The first thing we talked about – this is kind of cool, Matt – is you know how – on

553
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,600
Coder Radio – you know how Facebook has Facebook Connect and Google, you can authenticate

554
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
to stuff using your Google account and Twitter.

555
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Right.

556
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Yeah.

557
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Oh, we got a call.

558
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Oh, let's see who's calling in.

559
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
HR is calling.

560
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
All right.

561
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Well, I'll finish my thought after we talk to HR.

562
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
All righty.

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Hey, HR.

564
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, man.

565
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Hi.

566
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Hi.

567
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
So are you calling in to talk about Ubuntu Edge?

568
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Yeah.

569
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Sorry.

570
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
My feed's got –

571
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Oh, yeah.

572
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,840
Caller, you have to mute your radio when you call into the –

573
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah.

574
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Otherwise, it's going to be a mess.

575
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Yeah.

576
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Yeah.

577
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,040
It's like good old-fashioned radio call-in shows where people call in and they're in

578
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,240
the car and they have their radio on in the car and then the radio host is like, Caller,

579
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
turn down your radio.

580
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
It's the same thing here on the show.

581
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Yeah.

582
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah.

583
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,440
You know, what I was talking about was between live feed and Skype, there's like a major

584
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
difference for me.

585
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Yeah.

586
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Yeah.

587
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,160
Well, something that kind of like got my attention about the whole Ubuntu phone thing was the

588
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,520
fact that everything they wanted to use and were saying they were going to use was like

589
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,920
stupid high-end.

590
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
You didn't believe it possible?

591
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Yeah.

592
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,600
And it's like the pricing for just the specs of the phones or the phone by itself, you'd

593
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,040
be able to – you'd most likely be able to afford, I don't know, two or three iPhones.

594
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Exactly.

595
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
On contract, though.

596
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
On contract.

597
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Not on contract.

598
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Yeah.

599
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

600
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Yeah.

601
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
On contract.

602
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,320
The manufacturing cost alone for these phones would be just like stupid.

603
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,160
I mean, they could go with lower – like not lower crappy end, pardon the language,

604
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,800
but like not as nice.

605
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,720
Like what was the glass again, ruby glass or whatever it was?

606
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,280
Sapphire glass, metal case.

607
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Sapphire glass.

608
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Yeah.

609
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Yeah.

610
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,720
Well, maybe even using the Firefox phone as an example of that because I think you nailed

611
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,200
a point because the Firefox phone, they have phones available now on eBay and they're

612
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
lower-end phones.

613
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Yeah.

614
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Yeah.

615
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah, but if you're asking people to shell out 700 bones, I think you've got to make

616
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
it a high-end device.

617
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
I think it's got to be premium.

618
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,340
Well, then again, if the device was being made out of such high-end quality material,

619
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,400
you wouldn't be asking them to shell out $700.

620
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,800
You think it'd be more.

621
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I think you're probably right.

622
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
It'd probably be less.

623
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,360
I don't know.

624
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,040
I think when you're doing limited runs, I think it could be $700, $800 a unit.

625
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I really do.

626
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah.

627
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,480
In fact, I think Mark, I think Shuttleworth alluded to that when he said, the reason why

628
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm not going to close the funding gap on this is because I expect this to overrun on

629
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
costs and I'm going to have to cover that cost.

630
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,440
So he's expecting it to be more than what it is.

631
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
What you'd probably have HR, I bet, is instead of... You'd probably have a slightly slower

632
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
CPU, or maybe a lower-class storage or something like that.

633
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,280
They might have to cut in that area.

634
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Yeah.

635
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Well, good thoughts, man.

636
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,920
Comes with a floppy disk or something.

637
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
All right, dude.

638
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Well, thanks for calling in.

639
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
All right, cool.

640
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Thanks.

641
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Have a good one.

642
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
And that opens up the line, folks, if you want to call in.

643
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,760
But good thoughts on... I do kind of... I see his point to a degree.

644
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,520
I think you mentioned they're not Apple and they can't expect people to jump like Apple

645
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,760
gets people to jump.

646
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,500
And I'd argue, to some degree, Apple has sort of channeled this amazing marketing machine

647
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
with this rabid fanboyism.

648
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,000
But the other thing that Apple does is, when they're up there on stage and they say, boom,

649
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,200
this is the iPhone 5.

650
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,360
It's available next Friday.

651
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,880
Yeah, it's in his hand.

652
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
He's not holding a shell.

653
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
You know what I mean?

654
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Yeah.

655
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
And then the press, they get up and they go into this little room and they get handled

656
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
in there where they get to get shown the new toy.

657
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,280
And it's this... Everybody buys it because you're going to get it in four or five days.

658
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,320
You're going to get it in seven days, worst case, maybe 14 days.

659
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,520
So it's not a year away.

660
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Right.

661
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,720
I mean, and see, that's exactly it.

662
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Because at the end of the day, I'm going to get up on stage, I'm going to have a shell

663
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
in my hand.

664
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
I'm going to tell you how cool it is.

665
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,800
If everything goes well, maybe, kind of, sort of, you'll get it in a year.

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Hey, by the way, I'm going to secure $600 or $700 probably on your debit card because

667
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,920
a lot of folks are using debit versus credit.

668
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,820
All these things that pile up against them.

669
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,080
And on top of the fact that, oh, hey, by the way, our ecosystem's completely new and unproven,

670
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
but don't be worried about that.

671
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Really excited.

672
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Yeah.

673
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
It's like, come on, guys.

674
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
I mean, it's a great idea, but wake up.

675
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Geez.

676
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Oh, geez.

677
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,760
Hate to be a buzzkill, but, I mean, I was really excited to see this come about.

678
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
I think it's cool.

679
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm excited for the, yeah, you know, Firefox phone, too.

680
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,760
But it's just disappointing because it was so mishandled.

681
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,240
That's where my frustration is.

682
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Yeah.

683
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
So.

684
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
So, all right.

685
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
I think I guess we'll move on.

686
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,600
I was just going to mention in Coderadio this morning, we talked with a guy named Dan at

687
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,360
the Mozilla project, and he's working on Persona, which is their authentication system to compete

688
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,400
with Google Authenticator and, or not the two-factor app, but like Google Connect and

689
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Facebook Connect.

690
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
It was a good chat.

691
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
It was a good chat.

692
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,120
And they're working on like a vendor neutral sort of open standardized login system.

693
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,600
I was really impressed by it.

694
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,000
That'd be really nice because honestly, logging into anything with Facebook and whatnot scares

695
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the hell out of me.

696
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So.

697
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah.

698
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah.

699
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It always is weird because you don't know what kind of information they're getting.

700
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No.

701
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's like.

702
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Is it a token or is it my entire profile?

703
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Exactly.

704
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,360
You know, I'm about to go and maybe check something out is will they suddenly decide

705
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,880
to change their policy one day and all of a sudden it's appearing in my wall.

706
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Yeah, exactly.

707
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
Yeah.

708
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
All right.

709
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
All right, Matt.

710
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Well, now we got Corey calling in.

711
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Hey, Corey.

712
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
All right.

713
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Hey.

714
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Hey, man.

715
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
What's going on?

716
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
What's on your mind?

717
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm going to continue with the Ubuntu Edge.

718
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Do it.

719
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Yeah.

720
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Well, you know, with the price, I understand that the price is really high, but if they

721
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:45,400
really want to get the niche of the the people that want to have that high end phone.

722
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Yeah.

723
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I feel like I agree.

724
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,880
Like I think like metal, glass, this is all these are all high end components.

725
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,480
I think that's one of the dings against the Samsung Galaxy S4 right now in reviews is

726
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,880
that compared to the HTC One, it feels a little cheap because it's plasticky.

727
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Right.

728
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Yeah.

729
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:09,480
I think the high end component was a good one, but so you think price wise, non-issue

730
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,680
or do you still think it was a barrier for this thing to succeed?

731
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:20,560
Well, I understand that the price wise, it probably is a bit of a barrier with this thing

732
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,560
succeeding because people aren't used to paying this much for a phone.

733
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Right.

734
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:32,720
People aren't used to having to shout out quite almost $700 just to get a phone, but

735
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,640
you know, I've got the Indiegogo page up right now and I'm looking at it, you know, four

736
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,800
gig of RAM, 128 gig, how many phones do you know with 128 gig of internal storage or four

737
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
gig of RAM?

738
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I don't know of any.

739
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,880
I mean, there might be one, but I don't know any of it.

740
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,280
But maybe in a year that might not be the same.

741
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I mean, yeah.

742
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,300
Because they are building this thing for a year from now and they got to be competitive

743
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,040
what's on the market in a year.

744
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,200
But I think even then, I think it could still be a competitive device or even comparatively.

745
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
It's still going to be competitive.

746
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,400
How many of them do you think are really going to also function as a desktop if you so choose

747
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
to use it that way?

748
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Right.

749
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
How do we know that really works though?

750
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,840
I mean, at this point in time, so we've seen, what we've seen demoed is dude takes a phone,

751
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,680
dude puts it in a dock, dude opens up a program, but that's not convergence.

752
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,640
I can run two environments and with one's large screen, I start that environment and

753
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,000
if one's small screen, I start that environment.

754
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That's desktop switching.

755
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,120
That's not convergence.

756
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:42,000
Convergence is I'm in an instant message with Matt about an app on my couch and then Matt

757
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,920
sends me a link and I decide I want to open it up on my desktop and I dock my phone and

758
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,720
that same instant message conversation moves into an application or is available to an

759
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,760
application that is formatted for the desktop and if I click the link, it launches my desktop

760
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
web browser.

761
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,040
But if I kept the phone in my hand and clicked the link, it would launch the mobile browser.

762
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,640
That to me is true convergence.

763
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,500
I don't think we've ever seen anything like that demonstrated.

764
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,720
What we've seen is you can put in a dock and you can use it and if you store all your stuff

765
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,720
on the same file system, you can probably get to it, but I'm not actually even sure

766
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,520
that that's how that works.

767
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,480
Yeah, I suppose.

768
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,160
Well, and I have one thought.

769
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,000
Now, the closest I've ever seen to that personally and that's certainly not there, but it's way

770
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,400
closer than anything Ubuntu's got, Airdroid.

771
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,280
I pretty much can go back and forth with messages.

772
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I can access applications to back them up or whatnot.

773
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
I can browse the web.

774
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,200
I can do a lot of my battery status, whatnot.

775
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,760
I can do that with Airdroid and it's done without a dock.

776
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,400
See for me, the dock is a real hindrance.

777
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
I don't care for that at all.

778
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,800
In that post I was reading from Crash Bandicoot, he says that convergence is an answer to a

779
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
problem that doesn't exist.

780
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,920
I don't know if I totally agree, but I think Cory and I would love to have a really... You

781
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,960
think about five years from now, these phones are so freaking powerful, it's stupid, right?

782
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,480
You might as well do something with all of that.

783
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,400
Why not use it as a desktop?

784
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Sure.

785
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,320
I think it's a good idea, but not with a dock.

786
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,440
I think it needs to be over the air and it's not like the technology doesn't exist.

787
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
It has for quite a while now.

788
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Just use it.

789
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Yeah.

790
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,360
I suppose over the air would probably be a lot better.

791
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,000
It's just more convenient really than... I'd better put it in the dock.

792
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah.

793
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,640
It's like, hey, let me get my Palm Pilot out and I'm going to have it dial in and I'm going

794
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,600
to check the enterprise server.

795
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,720
Make sure you've got your Comport enabled there, Matt.

796
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Right.

797
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
It's just like, what a buzzkill, but the phone itself is a cool idea.

798
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm excited about the phone.

799
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,800
Well, I was excited about the phone, but I feel like that... I think you're right on

800
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
the specs.

801
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,480
Everyone high on specs, but I think people would rather take that same $600 or $700 and

802
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,760
just go buy a really nice Android phone with the ecosystem that they can get today or tomorrow

803
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
or even in a few weeks.

804
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,560
Well, what I don't understand, and not to take too much from our conversation on Sunday,

805
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,120
but what I don't understand is to me, it seems more capable and more likely to do some sort

806
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,160
of middleman convergence using a tablet.

807
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,180
First of all, tablet space is pretty competitive.

808
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,720
It seems a little less locked down to me than the phone space does.

809
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,960
Everybody's got a phone already, right?

810
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,160
Nobody really... At this point, anybody who has the scratch to back that Indiegogo campaign,

811
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,480
there's none of those people don't already have a phone.

812
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,080
Those two things don't exist in this universe, but they might have a little room for a new

813
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
tablet.

814
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Not only that-

815
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
I don't have a tablet.

816
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Right, right.

817
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Yeah.

818
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
And you're not married to the tablet like you are the phone.

819
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,160
I mean, you're married to the phone, and a tablet could also be its own display, so you

820
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,540
don't have to worry about this weird switch off, hand off between desktop and mobile applications.

821
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,040
Maybe you just create some sort of dock that holds the tablet, and you have a USB mouse

822
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,880
and keyboard hooked up to that all the time.

823
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,160
The Note 2 does this.

824
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,400
The Note 2 that Matt now has, has a dock.

825
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,680
You put the Note 2 in a dock, you can have a USB mouse and keyboard, perma hooked up

826
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,120
to that dock, and when you put the Note 2 in that dock, it becomes a device that works

827
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
with a mouse and keyboard.

828
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
That's right.

829
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
And it's very cool.

830
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
They could have done that with a Bluetooth Touch.

831
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,200
I bet you... I don't know if it would have even been 32 million, because you don't have

832
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,880
to worry about all of the cellular stuff, or nothing like that.

833
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,480
You don't have to worry about this.

834
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,960
You could even have gone a route of what Google does with the Nexus.

835
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Let's be honest.

836
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,880
The Nexus isn't some custom built piece of hardware.

837
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,920
It's made by Asus, and then Google takes it, and they OEM it.

838
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,880
They could have totally done that.

839
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Right.

840
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
They could have.

841
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Yeah.

842
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,440
That's kind of my theory of it.

843
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
There's so much they could have done, and I feel a little bit like they rushed into

844
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
it.

845
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,200
I like what you guys are saying about the tablet aspect.

846
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,840
I think that would be an interesting approach.

847
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Maybe they still will.

848
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
They are working.

849
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
We've seen images on the Nexus.

850
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,480
Well, and I guess when I take away from this, and all the Matt Hartley dramas pulled away

851
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,900
from this whole experience, and we really look at this with practical eyes, the investment

852
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,840
thus far has been figuratively minimal compared to had they actually invested millions of

853
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,520
dollars in this, had it flopped, and then say, oh wow, we should have done a tablet.

854
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,280
So once withdrawing my own drama from it, this may just have been a learning experience

855
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
for them.

856
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
If it is, then more power to them.

857
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
I get excited about a tablet then.

858
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Cool.

859
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,200
Any other thoughts before we let you go?

860
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,240
Well, I suppose really it's kind of, currently it's just one of those things that gets in

861
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,400
with the geekiness of people, you know, those ones that small niche, that idea that they

862
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,720
could have this phone with four gig of RAM, and they can plug it in, and it'll just work

863
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,680
on your Bantu desktop.

864
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,560
And one that's meant to dual boot too.

865
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
That's cool too.

866
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Oh yeah, definitely.

867
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Yeah, yeah.

868
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
That's really cool.

869
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Yeah, I like that feature.

870
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,320
So before I let you go, chat room is asking, they want a little more Luna talk.

871
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
Have you tried out elementary OS?

872
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,320
What do you think?

873
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,240
I haven't tried it out yet, so I was thinking about trying it out later though.

874
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,080
Have you watched our review on it yet?

875
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
No.

876
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,560
Oh yeah, I've watched reviews.

877
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,680
All right, well I want you to try it out and then let us know what you think, okay?

878
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,000
It's important to the chat room, Corey.

879
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's important.

880
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
All right, Corey, thanks for calling in, buddy.

881
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We'll talk to you later.

882
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,480
All right, well that was good.

883
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,560
Good thoughts on Corey's part.

884
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,760
Thanks Corey for calling into the chat, appreciate it.

885
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
All right, Matt.

886
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,960
Well, we'll leave that line open.

887
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,160
This is apparently a hot topic.

888
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,360
You know, it's because it's about the, it's like time, right?

889
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
It's time.

890
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
It's really time.

891
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
It's the last few hours.

892
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,520
And I think a lot of people are passionate about it from one direction or another.

893
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,720
They either are excited and want to see it happen.

894
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,800
They're angry and they think of this as a mis-focus for Ubuntu and that they should

895
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,160
concentrate on software.

896
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
There's a lot of emotion.

897
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yeah.

898
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I feel like that's me.

899
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,600
Yeah, no, I'm kind of, you know, you know, I'm so detached from them these days that,

900
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,720
you know, I want to see them do well, whatever they're doing.

901
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
No, I hear you.

902
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
All right.

903
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,400
Well, before we get into some of the last feedback, I thought I'd cover an email that

904
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,040
was feedback addressed to this show.

905
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Yeah.

906
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,880
Ryan emailed us and he said, I've been watching last for a little over a year now and I just

907
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,320
wanted to touch on Too Much Choice episode one that I just listened to about two hours

908
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
ago.

909
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm very happy that you guys added Too Much Choice to the lineup or Linux unplugged as

910
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
the case might be.

911
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,400
I have a few thoughts regarding the Linux desktop frustrations.

912
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,640
I find myself working with Unity because it works mostly out of the box and I don't have

913
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,160
to deal with it crashing or audio not working randomly during the day.

914
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,720
I would like to use KDE, but I truly don't have time to tweak and fix it.

915
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Hmm.

916
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,240
You know, that's actually a fair point.

917
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,160
I've found that to be generally true.

918
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,800
I've certainly had my own issues with Unity from time to time, but you know, in its current

919
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,600
state, it's not too bad.

920
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,760
KDE, the new release is out.

921
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
We'll try that.

922
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,640
We've dealt with their audio stuff.

923
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,040
It is definitely a desktop for those that like to tweak and to massage into their own

924
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
needs.

925
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Yeah.

926
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, we got a lot of interesting feedback.

927
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,080
A lot of folks are like, yeah, I have the same audio problems you guys do and then like

928
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,240
a lot of folks are like, I've never had an audio problem, I don't know what the hell

929
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
you're talking about.

930
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,120
Well, someone in the chat room earlier commented, they said, well, you know, Skype for Linux

931
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,840
is crap and a lot of that is in fact because of the whole Pulse Audio thing.

932
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,260
I will go on record and saying this Skype call that I'm in right now for the show is

933
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,200
on Ubuntu in Skype.

934
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
It's fine.

935
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,700
My CPU usage is, I can't even see it moving.

936
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,040
It's the latest review and it's actually pretty good.

937
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,840
So is audio okay?

938
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,400
Eh, you know, it's not bad.

939
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
It's not bad in Ubuntu.

940
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,660
He goes on, he wants to know, he wants to know if we could share some of the sites we

941
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,040
use on a daily basis to stay up to date on Linux and IT news happenings.

942
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,440
He'd be curious to know what we do to kind of stay abreast of the news.

943
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,480
Now, do you have any particular sites that you love to troll on a regular basis?

944
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,680
Oh, goodness.

945
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,560
A lot of what I try and make it work for me as much as possible.

946
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,080
I do a lot of Linux.com or Linux Today because it does a lot of the curating for me, Tux

947
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,980
machines.

948
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,360
I have Google Watch watching for various keywords, things of that sort.

949
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't have any real specific brand loyalty to any real websites outside of Datamation

950
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,760
where I will be writing for again here in a couple months.

951
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Nothing real specific.

952
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,440
I used to check H Online pretty regularly, you know, but obviously that's not really

953
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,880
an option anymore.

954
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,920
Of course, the Linux Action Show subreddit is actually seriously one of the best resources.

955
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,240
I also probably every day visit Linux Insider.

956
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

957
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,000
I visit there about once a week, I go to LWN.net.

958
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,240
If I'm just browsing for headlines, Lexer, L-X-E-R.com is pretty good.

959
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,160
OS Static blogs are good for a post here and there.

960
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,040
Honestly, I know, you know, good old Michael Larbo over there at Phronix gets a hard time

961
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,120
from time to time, but I try to check out Phronix once a day, see what they're up to.

962
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Yeah, I check out Phronix.

963
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,360
I don't do Lexer just because we have a long angry personal history with Ferretti people

964
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
there.

965
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Oh, really?

966
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah.

967
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
It was a long time ago.

968
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
It was my fault.

969
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
It's totally long, old history.

970
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm sure you guys could probably find out a lot there.

971
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,200
If you need a website to be dead to the show, we can make a site dead to the show.

972
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,880
By the way, Gawker is dead to Jupiter Broadcast News because I think they're a bunch of pricks.

973
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
Oh, yeah, they totally are.

974
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,800
No, Lexer is just, it's hyper Linux user, very, very passionate people that get angry

975
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
real easy.

976
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Ooh.

977
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,400
I also troll the Linux subreddit, which apparently is full of people who are super grumpy.

978
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Wow.

979
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
You know, different strokes to different folks.

980
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,520
Most of the people in the subreddit are super awesome.

981
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,320
Every once in a while you get somebody with a stick up his backside, but that's okay.

982
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
Yeah, yeah.

983
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
That's okay.

984
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,320
And you mentioned tuxmachines.org, I think.

985
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
TuxMachines.

986
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
TuxMachines is pretty cool.

987
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,480
Linux today, any of the, you know, Phronix is good too.

988
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah.

989
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
The subreddit's a no question, obviously.

990
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,320
Yeah, that is the best resource because if there's something good on pretty much any

991
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,280
of those sites, it'll eventually show up in the subreddit and usually within a few minutes.

992
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
It's pretty good.

993
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Exactly.

994
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Okay.

995
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Marlin wrote in, he said, hi, Chris and Matt.

996
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,480
You both recently talked about too much choice in the Linux world and how this can be potentially

997
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
get a little bit over your head.

998
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,640
While I don't necessarily disagree per se, I think you failed to consider some implications

999
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
of this.

1000
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
You've had some issues with KDE.

1001
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,700
Sorry to hear that.

1002
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,320
And basically said that OS X and Windows users don't have the same immature problems.

1003
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,900
However, I have to disagree because as someone who spends a lot of time troubleshooting Windows

1004
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,760
boxes for home users, I know for a fact that this is exactly the sort of problem Windows

1005
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,720
and OS X users face as well.

1006
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Or because they cannot switch desktop, sound servers, et cetera, they usually don't complain

1007
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,320
about it as loudly as you do and because they don't have a podcast.

1008
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,360
The difference being that in Linux, you can at least attempt to fix these problems while

1009
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,960
Windows OS X, you're stuck with what the factory manufactured for you.

1010
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Excellent.

1011
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,040
First of all, excellent feedback.

1012
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,840
I think that's, I think you made some valid points there.

1013
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,120
I used to be in PC repair myself and that's actually, it was Windows Vista that pushed

1014
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,840
me out of it completely.

1015
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,720
That was at that point I just stopped.

1016
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,920
And so, so I totally hear where you're coming from.

1017
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,280
I would disagree in saying that I don't believe I suggested that Windows didn't present frustration

1018
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,800
experiences because believe me, I feel your pain.

1019
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
They really do and I'm right there with you and being the guy that has to tell the person

1020
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,760
that it's not your fault, the tech, it's the fault of the operating system they're using.

1021
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,080
So I understand completely.

1022
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,160
Yeah, you know, I definitely feel where you're coming from.

1023
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I don't think it's a matter of – I think the people that you're dealing with in those

1024
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,240
situations honestly don't know any differently where Linux users do.

1025
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,160
We have experienced different experiences and so we are in fact looking at it from a

1026
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
different perspective.

1027
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:12,840
I have, I would have as somebody, you know, who's used Linux in production on and off,

1028
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,880
I would say that audio subsystems have been more reliable, especially on OS X than on

1029
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Linux.

1030
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,640
Windows, yeah, I mean Windows, it's always comes down to how good the driver is.

1031
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,000
It's always about the driver on Windows.

1032
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,920
If the driver is shite, then the application compatibility is going to be shite.

1033
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
And you know, he goes on to say, he says, PS, I've never had a sound issue in KDE and

1034
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm running three sound cards on a desktop with one of them being a USB DAC and an amp,

1035
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,840
but it may be worthwhile looking at text configs.

1036
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,200
So you know, in my setup, I've got three sound options.

1037
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,320
One of them is a USB M-Audio adapter.

1038
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,120
You know, and sometimes the issue for me is that KDE just doesn't see the device.

1039
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,600
It just does not show up.

1040
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,160
If I log into GNOME, it's there.

1041
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,240
Well, and that's just it.

1042
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,000
I will literally have not touched USB heads.

1043
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,280
Everything's left as it was the day before.

1044
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,040
I will boot up and it's saying, oh, hey, such and such sound card.

1045
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
It's not there anymore.

1046
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
What do you want to do about that?

1047
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Do you want to ignore it?

1048
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Wait, what?

1049
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,860
You know, that's not something that, that's where our frustration comes from.

1050
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,880
And so in a Windows experience or an OS X experience, usually you don't get the nag

1051
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,920
in Windows or OS X.

1052
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
It just won't work.

1053
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,800
And then of course the casual user just says, oh, well, I'll just call my tech.

1054
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,080
Linux users are a hands-on crowd where they're thinking, oh, well, I need to massage this

1055
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,200
and figure out why it's not working.

1056
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,600
Plus I'm seeing a nag about it.

1057
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,480
So that's usually the difference, I guess.

1058
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
I think-

1059
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,280
But great feedback though.

1060
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Yeah.

1061
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I think it's worth considering that.

1062
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,520
And I'm willing to kind of, you know, I'm kind of willing to monkey around with my setup

1063
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,120
to see if maybe I'm just doing something wrong.

1064
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm willing to accept the possibility, Matt.

1065
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,200
I can accept it.

1066
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,760
I just want to refer people, and I'll try to remember to link to this.

1067
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
You know what?

1068
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,480
I got some notes I've started right here for the show notes.

1069
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:02,400
Ooh, in the subreddit said, he started a thread called, I don't know, this is so great as

1070
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,400
a long-time Linux user, Linux games.

1071
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Before it was cool.

1072
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,840
You know, it's like games before we had actual games, and I don't mean-

1073
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
Oh yeah.

1074
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
I remember those days.

1075
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
He says, I'm a gamer.

1076
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
I like games.

1077
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
It's great that we have Steam now.

1078
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,480
And most indie games are announcing Linux support.

1079
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,160
And we've even seen some AAA stuff.

1080
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,000
Like how cool was that space game I showed in last on Sunday?

1081
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That was awesome.

1082
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That was really awesome.

1083
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:31,120
Like I realized like Linux has gotten to the point now where I'm checking what new games

1084
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,200
are in Steam on a weekly basis, and I'm getting one or two a week.

1085
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Oh yeah.

1086
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,520
Maybe one a week.

1087
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
This is amazing, Matt.

1088
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:46,400
I mean, this is, I'm getting one or two new video games from Steam a week for Linux.

1089
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,880
And I remember like it was a big deal because we had Unreal Tournament and Postal.

1090
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Yes!

1091
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Yes!

1092
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,440
And you know, and Postal, I mean, come on, who hasn't played Postal?

1093
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
I mean, everybody likes to be-

1094
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,320
Remember how appreciative we are when Unreal Tournament 2004 came out for Linux?

1095
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
And we were like, thank you.

1096
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Oh, I get a jig.

1097
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Thank you.

1098
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Yeah.

1099
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,680
That was the only game I played.

1100
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,360
I ignored a Windows partition completely because of that.

1101
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Yeah.

1102
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
It was so funny.

1103
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Yeah.

1104
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,120
And I just, I just wanted to, I just want to take a minute, ooh, whose post in the subreddit

1105
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,120
made me think about that.

1106
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,560
And I just thought, I got to reflect on this, on, on how we've had such a fundamental shift

1107
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,560
now.

1108
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,960
And you know, really good games in Steam.

1109
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,000
Very excited.

1110
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,280
And I, I don't believe this shuts out the open source games at all.

1111
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,880
I think this sort of lights a fire and I think we're going to see a new generation of open

1112
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,360
source games coming soon.

1113
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,720
Anyways, in his subreddit post, he linked to NetHack and Hedge Wars, Broken Sword, bunch

1114
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
of really good old games.

1115
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,720
So if you guys want to get your retro game, he's got an Android alpha build for a couple

1116
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
of these.

1117
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
He's got a lot of retro gaming on.

1118
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,760
I'll try to remember to put all, in fact, I just closed it before I got the link.

1119
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,920
I'll put the link right now.

1120
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,960
I'm writing it down for my notes so that way you guys can go check that out if you want

1121
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
to go get your nostalgia.

1122
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Why not?

1123
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,960
Right?

1124
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Good times.

1125
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,960
Good times.

1126
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,960
All right.

1127
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,960
I'm going to read another email.

1128
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,200
This one is sent in from Ian and it's on the topic of mail servers.

1129
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,800
You know, that's been a hot topic of mine recently.

1130
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Oh man.

1131
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
It's been burning up the subreddit.

1132
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,640
It says, dear Matt and Chris, I just watched the first episode of Linux action show unplugged.

1133
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,120
He called it untangled, which is pretty good.

1134
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,120
That's pretty good.

1135
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,120
If we would have had like the, you know, like back in, back in the day of old time radio,

1136
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,520
you'd have like one sponsor that was like the beneficiary sponsor of your entire show.

1137
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,040
You'd even name the show after that sponsor.

1138
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,280
In some cases, if untangle was that for unplugged, we could have done that.

1139
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
That would totally work.

1140
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Yeah.

1141
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
Radio theater.

1142
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Yeah.

1143
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
Theater of the mind, Matt.

1144
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,720
He said he found it very informative, interesting.

1145
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,840
And he said, since we asked about different setups of mail servers of the viewers, he

1146
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,400
decided to send an email from his own mail server, which he does not keep up 24 seven,

1147
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
by the way.

1148
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
He does that.

1149
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,560
I just recently switched from Ubuntu to arch and I found arch to be a great distribution.

1150
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,440
I tried to set up a mail server for my family with courier MTA, which is an IMAP and SMTP

1151
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
solution rolled into one application, right?

1152
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,160
There was an excellent wiki page on the arch wiki, but I was not able to get relays working

1153
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
correctly.

1154
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,120
So I switched to post fix for SMTP and courier IMAP for IMAP.

1155
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,080
The combination has been working wonderfully and I use the tutorial and he links me to

1156
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:15,960
a tutorial on a hyper X dot or a hyper X or H Y P E X R dot org with a few modifications

1157
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
to be able to set it up.

1158
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,760
I checked out the tutorial actually looked pretty good.

1159
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,100
I also decided to set up a web mail system with PHP and Apache.

1160
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:27,240
He used a after a logic web mail light as his web mail package because it was easy to

1161
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,160
configure and has a nice and easy to use interface.

1162
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,880
And because of course it's open source under the GPL three, I love that.

1163
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,360
So good to see, see that happening.

1164
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,880
Second email came in here to the show.

1165
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:44,600
This one came from Demetrius, Demetrius, Doritos, he says, hi Chris and Matt on last season

1166
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,000
28 episode three and on Linux action show and plugs you spoke about remote desktop solutions.

1167
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,440
For years I've been using multi-user remote desktop based on NX called no machine.

1168
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,920
It's easy to set up runs over the SSH port and it's very customizable and best of all

1169
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,040
it behaves like a terminal server in windows in the multiple users can be logged into their

1170
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,480
own desktop over RDP at the same time.

1171
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,760
It's very customizable, very customizable and scales well.

1172
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,320
He says, by the way, congrats on the new edition.

1173
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,880
My hat's off to you for being able to not only run the network, but also get some salt

1174
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,420
and but on probably what I assume is only two to three hours of sleep.

1175
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,560
He's right about that.

1176
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:29,200
So no machine and NX, talked about it a while ago.

1177
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Have you familiar?

1178
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Have you seen it?

1179
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
I have.

1180
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,880
It's been so long since I played with it.

1181
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,120
It's one of those things that where it's powerful, but it's not exactly like team viewer.

1182
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,120
You know what I mean?

1183
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,200
You're not going to walk into it and get it working.

1184
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,220
You actually have to, there is some minor configuration involved.

1185
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,600
So I think it has its place.

1186
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,920
I think I certainly think it has its place with anyone that's experienced with such things.

1187
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,560
It's not for everybody and I think it's something that each individual would have to try to

1188
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,240
decide whether or not it's a match for them, but it is very cool and very powerful.

1189
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
I'll give it that.

1190
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,360
Yeah, I have.

1191
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,200
I have used it and it is amazing.

1192
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
It is.

1193
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,200
The performance is incredible.

1194
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,360
I had a machine set up in Texas out remote into that machine and I would work out of

1195
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,600
that machine all day long.

1196
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,800
I could watch videos.

1197
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,040
I'm talking YouTube videos, everything through this remote connection through NX.

1198
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,640
It is incredible.

1199
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,000
However, Splashtop is a little better for like that remote desktop solution where you

1200
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,640
actually, and this was key, need to get the console that is up on the screen because I

1201
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,520
will start an application in the studio right there in NX, I'll launch Handbrake and then

1202
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,560
I'll walk away and go make dinner and I want to be able to just fire up on my tablet or

1203
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,360
go into my home office and just pull up the studio machine and just see where Handbrake's

1204
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
at.

1205
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Exactly.

1206
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1207
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,420
And I know that I felt so bad for a few people that have had struggles getting it to work

1208
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,420
in Arch.

1209
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,400
I didn't have that hard a time with it, but I know folks that legitimately have.

1210
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,920
But at the same time, it's just so fast and so easy to use and I can use it on my phone.

1211
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,200
I can use it on another desktop.

1212
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,720
I can use it from anywhere in the world.

1213
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,240
It's just brain dead simple to use once you get it installed.

1214
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,240
It really is.

1215
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,940
And I could see what Arm's saying in the chat room where TeamViewer is a little more available

1216
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,160
for other distributions.

1217
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
It totally is.

1218
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,440
And I use TeamViewer actually on another desktop and the performance is also good.

1219
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,120
And I love TeamViewer and I want to be clear on that.

1220
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,460
I'm a user, but the performance is not even remotely as good as Splashtop.

1221
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,360
And I'm going to say that as a TeamViewer fan.

1222
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,360
I like them.

1223
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
I think they're great.

1224
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,480
I use their app every day.

1225
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
There is no contest.

1226
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,080
There just isn't.

1227
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,080
No contest.

1228
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, and I would say no contest.

1229
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,540
If you want to dumb down the appearance of your desktop, yes, it's comparable.

1230
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,320
If you want it to be like you're sitting there with all the colors and the graphics and the

1231
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,880
sound and everything, no, I'm sorry.

1232
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,320
I'm saying that using both applications.

1233
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

1234
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
I agree with you too.

1235
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
I know.

1236
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
But I like TeamViewer.

1237
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
It's a good app.

1238
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
I use it a lot.

1239
00:51:53,320 --> 00:52:00,160
This episode, Matt, our second sponsor, this episode is the 30-inch Sony Trinitron on eBay

1240
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,900
that Microcode has linked to us in the chat room.

1241
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,900
That's right.

1242
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,480
For $350, you can get a 30-inch Sony CRT.

1243
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
No, I'm kidding.

1244
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,480
But he did link it.

1245
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,960
I don't know why he linked a 30-inch CRT in our chat room.

1246
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,600
I guess if somebody out there wants a CRT, maybe you really want to get your retro on.

1247
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,280
Remember earlier when I mentioned getting your retro on?

1248
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Well, that is...

1249
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
I'm kidding.

1250
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Yeah.

1251
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,280
Although it does say HD.

1252
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,280
So there's that.

1253
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
There is that.

1254
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,280
Really?

1255
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
Wow.

1256
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,280
Yeah.

1257
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
Okay.

1258
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
I guess it doesn't say what resolution though.

1259
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Oh, I take that back.

1260
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
It's CRT.

1261
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
It'll go up to 1080i.

1262
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,120
Actually, a 1080i CRT, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

1263
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,080
Well, I mean, it's like I know the refresh rate.

1264
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,680
Would you like to burn your eyeballs out or not?

1265
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
I mean, no, that matters.

1266
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,120
But if anything below 70 is going to make you get a headache, but yeah, it's just kind

1267
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,840
of like, yeah, you know what I mean?

1268
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,120
Hey, man, guess what?

1269
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,520
It's Energy Star compliant.

1270
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:55,360
Oh, well, that's important, especially when you're bringing in a 300-pound monitor onto

1271
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
your desk.

1272
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
I mean, you know.

1273
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Going to bid now.

1274
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
I'm going to place a bid.

1275
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
It's not even available for buy now.

1276
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,240
You got to bid on this thing, on this bad boy.

1277
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Oh, my God.

1278
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,360
No, our second sponsor this week is UnitySync from Directory Wizards.

1279
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,360
Woo-hoo.

1280
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,000
Here's the thing, you guys.

1281
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm just going to save you a lot of trouble.

1282
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,440
I'm going to make you the IT wizard.

1283
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,440
Hey, hey, if you've got a directory synchronization problem, then you know what I'm talking about.

1284
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,800
If you've got desperate data stores that don't talk to each other, that need to talk to each

1285
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,000
other, UnitySync is going to solve this.

1286
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,560
And if you're in that position, you're going to become the IT hero.

1287
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,560
You're welcome.

1288
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,840
I just made you the savior of your IT department.

1289
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,840
You guys have been looking bad.

1290
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,300
Maybe your HR department keeps things up to date, but doesn't update your other database

1291
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,720
so that what gets pushed out to all the users is not current.

1292
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,040
Yes, I'm familiar with that situation.

1293
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,040
UnitySync is going to solve that.

1294
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,560
It goes way, way, way, way beyond that.

1295
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:51,080
If you've got Microsoft SQL database, Access databases, OpenLDAP, eDirectory, Active Directory,

1296
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,400
iMail, LDiff files, CSV files, Sun, whatever it is, if you need to move directory data

1297
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,520
between two different types of directories, you want to do it intelligently, and you want

1298
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,040
to do it maybe with some templates, you want to maybe throw a little Perl script in there

1299
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,280
to get extra flexibility, UnitySync is going to do that for you.

1300
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,200
Directory Wizards has created UnitySync to solve this problem, and it's available for

1301
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Linux.

1302
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,640
We actually have two separate Active Directory domains that are completely individually apart

1303
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
from each other.

1304
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,920
The UnitySync is running on a Linux box keeping those two Active Directory machines in check.

1305
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
You know what I'm saying?

1306
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
You're bringing the Linux box.

1307
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,800
You could put it on a Windows machine if you're that guy, but you're not that guy.

1308
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,040
You're going to put it on a Linux box, and you're going to say, hey, boss, here's what

1309
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
I got for you.

1310
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,040
I got this UnitySync.

1311
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,280
We're going to load it on a rig, and if we use the code Linux when we download it, I'm

1312
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,080
going to get 30 days on a trial, so we can try it out for a month to make sure it's doing

1313
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,880
what we want, and if you use that code Linux, you're also going to get a year of maintenance

1314
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,880
for free.

1315
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
So the boss is going to like that.

1316
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Oh, yeah.

1317
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
I say this is the way to go.

1318
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,720
He said, hey, look, look, we can get a year of maintenance on this, and UnitySync has

1319
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,240
a very, very competitive model where they charge based on the directory, not the users,

1320
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,160
and not the size of the database.

1321
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,080
Think about how nice that is.

1322
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,640
If you have something that's growing over time, you're not going to have to worry when

1323
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,880
it comes up time to renew that maintenance.

1324
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,560
So many vendors try to ding you for the size of the directory.

1325
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560
That's ridiculous.

1326
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,000
Think about how computers work.

1327
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,720
Go over to dirwiz.com, click on UnitySync, and put in the code Linux for your trial download,

1328
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,560
and you'll unlock the extra bennies while you're over there.

1329
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,200
Check out some of their notable customers.

1330
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,160
Matt, have I showed you this list yet?

1331
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,880
No, I have not seen the list.

1332
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,780
Well, there's a few people on here, like the Air Force Command and Control Information

1333
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,780
Systems of Canada.

1334
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,080
Oh, no one's heard of these guys.

1335
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
They use UnitySync.

1336
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
The Army.

1337
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,560
DC Council uses UnitySync.

1338
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,760
The list goes on on Fiserv uses UnitySync.

1339
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,480
The US Marines use UnitySync.

1340
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,480
The NFL.

1341
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
Anheuser-Busch uses UnitySync.

1342
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
I mean, this is enterprise-grade, Matt.

1343
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,480
Yeah, people like beer.

1344
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,480
I mean, come on.

1345
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
Awesome.

1346
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,480
All right.

1347
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,060
I need, every time Anheuser-Busch needs to update something about Budweiser to their

1348
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,080
Red Hook directory, UnitySync's taking care of it for them.

1349
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,680
And the nice thing is, is UnitySync can go in there and just move a record, or it can

1350
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,880
move everything in that directory.

1351
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,880
It can be super intelligent.

1352
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,160
It can be safe.

1353
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,120
No per-user cost makes it super nice for scaling.

1354
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,080
And of course, it's great for backup, too.

1355
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,160
So use the code LINUX when you're downloading the demo and check it out.

1356
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,960
Go save the day.

1357
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,600
IT can get run over by the other people in the company when these kinds of problems aren't

1358
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
solved.

1359
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,600
And I have been there.

1360
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,600
That leads to burnout.

1361
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,000
That leaves people feeling a little hostile.

1362
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh, yeah.

1363
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,760
We don't want you to have a hostile work environment.

1364
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,400
No IT out here.

1365
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,400
No.

1366
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,400
No.

1367
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
We're hooking you guys up.

1368
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,400
And so is UnitySync.

1369
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,680
So thanks to UnitySync for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1370
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,680
Good stuff.

1371
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,680
All right.

1372
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,280
So I got a couple more emails I want to make sure we get through.

1373
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,720
We're almost running out of time, and I still have an inbox full of email, Matt.

1374
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,680
It's like we're going to have to just keep doing this.

1375
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,280
So David wrote in.

1376
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,960
He says, go for Unplugged.

1377
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,200
Hi, Chris and Matt.

1378
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,680
I was so excited to hear about the extra show, and it's absolutely excellent.

1379
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,280
My suggestion, don't change the format at all.

1380
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
From what you have done already, it's excellent.

1381
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,680
It's open.

1382
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,680
It's frank.

1383
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,680
And the discussions are great.

1384
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,200
And what you've done for the Linux world is perfect, and presented the new show with the

1385
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
same professionalism.

1386
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,760
And from the heart and nature of Lass, he says, I have released episode 9 of Linux Down

1387
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,200
Under podcast, LDUP for short, which is my own small contribution to the Linux industry

1388
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,480
with an Aussie view.

1389
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,120
Keep up the good work, and thank you so much for giving us the extra awesome show.

1390
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,320
Spend time to listen to.

1391
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,320
All things Linux Unplugged.

1392
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,560
He says, by the way, Matt, don't hate on Fedora too much.

1393
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,120
He's a Fedora and a KDE user.

1394
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,600
You know, I'm a big Red Hat company fan, as far as Fedora is concerned.

1395
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,680
I keep revisiting it, and you know, my mind could totally change one day.

1396
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,680
It could totally happen.

1397
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,680
I don't know.

1398
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,400
I feel like I should keep reading.

1399
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,960
We got so many emails that came in, and I haven't even gotten to the BitMessages.

1400
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,800
By the way, what would you think about us doing like an in-depth, hey, what do you think

1401
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,480
about doing this week slash Etsy on BitMessage?

1402
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
It's just kind of like I could just show it.

1403
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,880
Yeah, because like someone like me that's not using it would love to know more about

1404
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
it.

1405
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,760
You get to watch it as a kind of a participant in a sense from afar, but not really using

1406
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,760
it daily.

1407
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,560
So one of the things I was thinking we could show is one of the nice features about BitMessage

1408
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,720
is you can have an address that multiple people subscribe to.

1409
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,300
So we could have a feedback address for this show that when people send to that, it goes

1410
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,720
to both our BitMessage inboxes.

1411
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,720
I like that.

1412
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,520
I kind of, you know, I do want to roll my own email server because I have to talk to

1413
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,640
the rest of the world, but at the same time, I really feel like, you know, email is broken

1414
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,800
fundamentally from a security standpoint and BitMessage really, really addresses a lot.

1415
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,680
Like even if, even if BitMessage was unencrypted and clear text, I would still think BitMessage

1416
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,760
is a good idea just based on the peer to peer nature.

1417
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,200
The peer to peer nature has some downsides than everybody's downloading everybody's messages,

1418
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,160
but only if you can only open those messages if you have the right cryptographic answer

1419
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,160
to the question, which means there's no metadata to collect.

1420
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,120
There's no monitoring that can happen.

1421
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
There's this blockchain concept.

1422
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,720
People download it, they have the answer, they unlock the content, and then they can

1423
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
read it.

1424
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,480
And I think, I think whenever we see something that comes out like this, that fundamentally

1425
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,000
solves a privacy issue or a security issue, like encryption by default and it's open source,

1426
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,760
I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind focusing on that in our shows, giving attention to

1427
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,760
that.

1428
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Absolutely.

1429
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,760
No, I think that's a great idea.

1430
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,880
I think we need to experiment and see what it is because I remember when RSS was a big

1431
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,400
deal, solving different problems, obviously, but it was solving the newsletter problem

1432
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,920
and the spam folder problem and all that sort of thing.

1433
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,040
And it never really took off as much as people thought it would, you know, it was the email

1434
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,040
killer and all this.

1435
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,400
But with BitMessage, I think it does go a step closer than RSS does in that.

1436
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,000
Well, one of the interesting aspects of BitMessage is in order to communicate something to the

1437
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,560
network, you have to do relatively a costly proof of concept work.

1438
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,560
You have to do a proof of work.

1439
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,800
You have to do some math.

1440
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,260
You have to calculate for the network.

1441
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,040
You have to crunch numbers.

1442
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,760
And that is not a big deal when you're firing off, you know, a few bit messages.

1443
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:12,520
But if you want to, if you want to spam on a mass scale, the CPU cost is, is, is extremely

1444
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
high.

1445
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,520
Exactly.

1446
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,680
It destroys profitability for spamming.

1447
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,720
It's not impossible to spam the BitMessage network, but the cost to do it CPU wise is

1448
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,480
really unsustainable.

1449
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,160
So that's one of the interesting things about BitMessage is while without actually charging

1450
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,100
money, they have found a way to introduce cost to prevent spamming.

1451
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,600
That's a really interesting point.

1452
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,500
And not only that, but it's inherently easy enough to do for a newsletter type environment.

1453
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,120
Like you talked about a community, basically a community bucket to where everybody can

1454
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,880
kind of pile into that.

1455
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,640
It's going to be interesting to see where it evolves to, you know, and again, I'm a

1456
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
total newbie to BitMessage.

1457
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,200
So, I mean, this is going to be interesting for me as a, as an end user to be introduced

1458
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,600
to it and to really get my feet wet.

1459
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,520
All right, man, I'm going to say the last chance for anybody that's watching live that

1460
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,740
wants to call in Skype us at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1461
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,880
Hopefully next week we'll have the mumble deal all figured out.

1462
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,640
Just got an email from David at the elementary OS project.

1463
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,120
He says, hi there, elementary OS developer here.

1464
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,880
I'm curious about coming on the show and talking to you guys.

1465
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,960
I don't have Skype set up right now on Linux, but I'd love to join you on mumble in the

1466
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,960
future.

1467
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,960
So there you go.

1468
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,960
That sounds like a great idea.

1469
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
There you go, David.

1470
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,620
We'd love to have you on a Linux unplugged in the future and hopefully we'll have mumble

1471
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,620
set up.

1472
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,640
Matt and I are thinking we're going to have a, hopefully if everything works out, we'll

1473
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,600
have a mumble room for people just to hang out out in general, specifically to hang out

1474
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,320
during live shows, Linux unplugged in particular, just a lobby for people to chat.

1475
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,600
Then we'll have a screening room where you'll get moved into.

1476
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,780
You can join on your own volition where people can just get in there and say, hey, I'd like

1477
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,980
to go on air.

1478
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,120
And we'll have an operator in there who will check your mic, make sure your audio is working,

1479
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,000
make sure you don't have your stream on, you know, the college radio thing.

1480
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,600
And then they're going to move you into what we'll probably have as a showroom where anybody

1481
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,400
in that room can go on air.

1482
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,940
And it's not like you have to jump through some sort of crazy hoop, it's just you have

1483
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,120
to pay basic flight checks and then eventually you'll kind of, I would love to even have

1484
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,180
people who have a known good status and they can always just enter the room directly and

1485
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,180
contribute away.

1486
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,420
I think that'd be great too.

1487
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,420
That would be awesome.

1488
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,420
Yeah.

1489
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,420
Kind of a green room, if you will.

1490
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,420
Yeah.

1491
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,420
We'll have a green room to make sure you're all ready for flight.

1492
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,640
And then we'll actually have the flight deck where when you go in there, you're on air

1493
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,780
and you just boom right in there.

1494
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,000
And I think that's going to be a great way for people to contribute to the show in real

1495
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
time.

1496
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,120
So yeah, I think we'll call it right there.

1497
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,580
I got so much more stuff, Matt.

1498
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,580
I got so much more stuff.

1499
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,580
I know.

1500
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,580
It's just like overflowing out of the-

1501
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,580
Yeah.

1502
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:31,900
I mean, we could go for another hour and still only have scratched just the bottom of the

1503
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:32,960
barrel of these emails.

1504
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,320
Just not even, like a little nick, Matt, a little nick off the top.

1505
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,840
But I'm glad we were able to get to the ones we could.

1506
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I actually have a few more.

1507
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,680
Gosh, I hate to wrap up, Matt, but I got to go make dinner.

1508
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
I got to go make dinner.

1509
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,680
That's not what it is.

1510
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,680
Dinner thing.

1511
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,680
Huh?

1512
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,680
Yeah.

1513
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
It's that dinner thing.

1514
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
It's that food thing, Matt.

1515
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
It's that dinner thing.

1516
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
Plus, I ran out of beer.

1517
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,680
So...

1518
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,680
Well, that's it.

1519
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
There's your sign.

1520
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,000
Once I'm out of beer, that's kind of the indication that the show's over.

1521
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
All right.

1522
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,920
Well, I want to make sure everybody joins us next Sunday for the big show.

1523
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,920
We'll be talking about...

1524
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,760
One of the things we'll be talking about is Ubuntu Edge, among other things, like probably

1525
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,640
BitMessage, and a few other nice little surprises, plus the news.

1526
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,640
Don't forget, we'd love to hear your feedback.

1527
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,640

1528

1530

Always great to have you guys.

1531
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,000
Love to see you next time.

1532
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Hey, Matt, have a great week.

1533
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You too.

1534
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We'll see you soon.

1535
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
All right, everyone.

1536
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:55,880
We'll see you next week for Linux Unplugged.
