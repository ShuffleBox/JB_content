1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
You know, I have been on a steady march to make things more hardware-based, and I just,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:19,720
for the first time, found a four-port HDMI switcher that does green screen and multiple

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,060
cameras, multiple feeds with transition fader bars and everything, all hardware-based.

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,660
A lot of the camera-switching functionality that we use in Wirecast, all hardware-based

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,200
for $1,000.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,280
Now when I first started podcasting, the same unit with only two HD, they weren't even HDMI,

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,240
the same unit with two HD inputs was $15,000.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,720
That sucker now at $1,000, that might happen next year.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,400
I might eventually get that, and then that is going to be such a key piece to replacing

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,120
the Wirecast machine, not only that, but also to have something like that on the road would

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
be amazing, because, you know, I don't know if you guys probably all noticed if you watched

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,140
the video version, but we used OBS this week, or OBS as they call it.

13
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,120
We used OBS to do the live broadcast of Linux Action Show and the live event on an Ubuntu

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:19,600
14.04 system 76 rig, and, you know, we got bit by lip sync issues that were kind of a

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
bummer.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,760
But one of the things, when you don't do video production, that you don't realize is an issue

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,640
until someone tells you, and you're like, oh yeah, obviously that's an issue.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
But you don't think about it until you do video production.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,040
But if you've got a box, say a PC, right?

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
And it's got three cameras coming into it.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,640
One is a 1080p or 720p, doesn't matter, let's just say it's a 720p.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,560
One is a 720p Logitech webcam coming in at 30 frames per second exactly, 3.0 FPS exact.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Another camera coming into your rig is an HDMI capture card.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,520
That's 1080i interlaced even, right?

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,080
And it's coming in at 60 frames per second.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,320
Actually not 60, it's coming in at 59.94 frames per second.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,840
And then you've got a desktop shot that's coming from a PC that is a 1080p picture at

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,640
exactly 29.97 frames per second.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,000
And then you've got a chat room shot that is on the same machine as the Wirecast machine

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
that is exactly coming in at 30 frames per second at variable resolution depending on

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,280
how you size the window.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,880
And Wirecast very intelligently brings all of this together plus an independent audio

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,100
source, manages to try to figure out the timing on them the best possible, automatically mixes

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,040
all of that together and records it and sends it out.

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,640
And it is truly black magic because each camera and each device are all operating at different

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,760
times, at different resolutions, at different frame rates, and then at the same time it's

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,200
bringing that all together with an audio interface which is, you know, zero latency, right?

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,520
So you've got USB which has inherent latency because those web cameras have an H.264 encoder

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
in them which adds latency.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,320
And then you have the bandwidth limitations of the USB bus, right?

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,400
And then you're also between that switching to an HDMI camera which is sitting on the

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,160
PCI Express bus coming in as fast as that HDMI port can blast the data into the PCI

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,360
Express bus which is way faster than that USB web camera.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,240
And then you have that coming in to a screen cap which is going to be variable based on

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,000
the CPU load of the machine that's doing the screen cap.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And it brings it all together so seamlessly that we forget that you have to fight problems

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,720
like lip sync and issues like that.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,820
So when you sit down and use OBS, you know, you basically lose seven years of black magic

49
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,440
and you kind of have to manually punch those.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
So you know for 15 minutes before we started the live stream, 20 minutes or whatever it

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,800
was, we're sitting there adjusting the millisecond delay and then asking people and production

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,720
like Rekai back here at the studio, okay, what did you hear first?

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
The clap or the sound?

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,880
Did you hear the sound first or did you see the clap first?

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,560
And then they tell us and then we adjust it another 10 milliseconds.

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,480
Can you imagine what an animal you feel like when you're doing that?

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
Versus Wirecast where you just plug it all in and it just does it all.

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Wow.

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Yeah.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
So I mean there's still a huge gap.

61
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,800
So I'm looking at this hardware mixer that would handle these kinds of things and $1,000

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
and I'm done with a Mac.

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Right.

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Woo!

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm excited about that.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
I think that's going to be a 2016 purchase for J.B.

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
That's really exciting.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Yes.

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
But would Stallman approve of the hardware mixer?

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Yeah.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I don't know.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I mean you could always...

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
So happy hacking.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
You can hack it, right?

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
So that's cool.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I think Stallman just feels in general...

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Now I don't want to put words into his mouth but I have a feeling he's probably said that

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
before.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah.

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Probably.

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Probably.

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,800
I wanted to see, boy, you know, it's too bad Wimpy's not here today.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I know.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
He's probably busy doing Wimpy things but...

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Making those distributions.

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Yeah.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,160
So maybe he's so busy responding to this ultimate new competition.

91
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,600
I don't know if you heard about this, UUmate is a respin of Ubuntu Mate 15.10.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Whoa.

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Only it aims to be better.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Better.

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,560
I think we'll let our audience be the judge of that.

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah.

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
So here's what it does.

98
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,640
And actually, since Wimpy's not here, I'm going to just say this.

99
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720
I kind of do like these additions but I'm not sure.

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,000
You could just do it to a regular Mate install but the highlights of UU Mate include Google

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Chrome as the web browser.

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Right.

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Right.

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Right.

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
You've instantly got Chris right there.

106
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Yep.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Yep.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
So you're going to be watching them on Netflixes.

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
KDN Live video editor.

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
Now here's the thing I thought was neat.

111
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,080
Peer Guardian privacy oriented firewall built in.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Wow.

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
That's pretty heavy.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Steam included.

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,960
Now Wimpy's got these things with one click away with the welcome screen so it's not a

116
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
little bit.

117
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes he does.

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Yes he does.

119
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Sync thing automatically set up.

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Hey, I like that.

121
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Team viewer remote control software installed and ready to go.

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Wine 1.7 Comp is turned on as well as numerous sound effects enabled by default.

123
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
You know what?

124
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Not sure how I feel about that last one but...

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
You know what?

126
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
If they're Star Trek sounds I'll do it.

127
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes.

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
or nothing.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Yes, there you go.

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,320
That's why I hate the Windows sounds.

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
It's not Star Trek.

132
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah, right.

133
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
So the UU-Mate competition is on.

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
It is fierce.

135
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
I don't know.

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
We'll see if maybe Wimpy shows up.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
We can get his take on it.

138
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,440
I think it's going to be a battle royale.

139
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
Yeah, with the users as the winners.

140
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
That's right.

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
That's West, man.

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,740
That's freaking poetic.

143
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:20,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 119 for November 17, 2015.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, episode 119 of Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show.

145
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,700
It's hoping that we don't get blown away by this crazy windstorm.

146
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
My name is Chris.

147
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
My name is Wes.

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,240
Now, Wes, it is ridiculous.

149
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
I've been getting reports from all over the area.

150
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,800
And right now, as we're sitting here recording this show, I would not be surprised, honestly,

151
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
if the power goes out.

152
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
No, I wouldn't either.

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
That's what I woke up to this morning.

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Yeah.

155
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
So it's really a luxury to have power now.

156
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Now, here's the great part is the way that video codecs work is there's pretty much no

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,240
chance we'll be able to save this file if the recording is lost.

158
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,760
If the power goes out, we'll lose the recording.

159
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
So it's just going to be the live people.

160
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Well, I'm streaming.

161
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
You're lucky today.

162
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
All right.

163
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,480
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, yes, I'm back from Colorado.

164
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,420
I went to System 76.

165
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,360
And we have a great show planned for you today.

166
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,920
And we're going to start with something I've been mulling around for a little bit.

167
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,840
And maybe, sure, true, could be that Alan Jude chat room.

168
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Ping Alan Jude right now.

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
Tell him we're about to talk about Docker.

170
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,840
See what he thinks about that.

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,920
So Docker is obviously a phenomenon.

172
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,060
In fact, DockerCon just happened.

173
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,560
And there's a lot of different people out there that are trying to solve a whole ass

174
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,960
ton of issues that we have ran into now that Docker is a thing.

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,920
And mostly, it's around security issues.

176
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,720
There are rampant security problems with Docker containers.

177
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,360
In fact, if you look at just Heartbleed, there's still a massive percentage of Docker containers

178
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
that are vulnerable to Heartbleed.

179
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
That's embarrassing.

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
We created ourselves a huge mess.

181
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,560
We're going to talk about that today on Linux Unplugged.

182
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,000
And then, SteamOS is getting off to a rocky start.

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A lot of bad reviews.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Ars Technica has said it is the worst performer out there.

185
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,420
Is SteamOS doomed?

186
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,440
Or maybe have they gotten it a little wrong?

187
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,240
And then last but not least, our Mumble Room is going to check in with their report on

188
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,880
using OpenSUSE Leap for a few weeks.

189
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
We're going to get it straight from the horse's mouth.

190
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,200
We got a whole flock of horses.

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Is that what you call them?

192
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Lovely, lovely flock of horses.

193
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Is that what you call a bunch of horses?

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Oh, that's what we call them.

195
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
A flock?

196
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Yep.

197
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Is that right?

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Nope.

199
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Not at all.

200
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
OK.

201
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
All right.

202
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
We're going to talk about that in today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
So let's bring in that virtual lug.

204
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

205
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Hello.

206
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Hello.

207
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Hello.

208
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Hello.

209
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Hello.

210
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Oh, jeez.

211
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Holy crap.

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
All right.

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Everybody stop pinging Alan in the chat room.

214
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Maybe too good.

215
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
That's too much.

216
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Alan, we're sorry.

217
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
We're sorry, Alan.

218
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I love you.

219
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm sorry.

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Double tech snap tomorrow.

221
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
All right.

222
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
So coming up.

223
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
All right.

224
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
So all right.

225
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,560
So coming up now, we've got to talk about Docker because this is I'm not I don't want

226
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
to have one of these episodes where we kind of rant and rave too much.

227
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,480
But it is getting ridiculous.

228
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
You guys.

229
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I mean, my inner curmudgeon is screaming these days.

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Guys.

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
What?

232
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
What?

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
You like that?

234
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
You like that my curmudgeon is screaming?

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
That's what half the people are here for.

236
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I know, right?

237
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
All right.

238
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,560
And so let's start with a couple of big news items.

239
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,960
The daddy of Debian is joining the unstoppable Docker crusade.

240
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,240
Ian Murdoch has joined the Linux container shop Docker.

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,040
He founded Debian in 1993.

242
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,160
He led the project for three years during his birth.

243
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,840
And he's taken up a position as a member of Docker's technical staff.

244
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,080
Story number one.

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,600
And I illustrate that story to just give you an idea of the hype surrounding this Docker

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
thing.

247
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
The momentum that has really.

248
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

249
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Thank you.

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,840
So starting today from the core OS project, which we've talked about a lot on Linux unplugged,

251
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,120
they have launched Claire.

252
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,400
Claire is an open source tool for monitoring container security.

253
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,320
Now you go, oh, that seems like a good idea, right?

254
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Probably want to monitor.

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Yes, it does.

256
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Sure.

257
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I like monitoring security.

258
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Is my security secure?

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
I don't know.

260
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
You got to have good security.

261
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I need Claire.

262
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Exactly.

263
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
You got to have clarity.

264
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Oh, yes.

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
They should hire you on to do jingles.

266
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
They totally should.

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Core OS says that over eight.

268
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
Now, I'm not I'm not making this up.

269
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,840
Eighty percent of Docker images are still vulnerable to the heartbeat.

270
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Heartbleed.

271
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Bug.

272
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Geez.

273
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Hello.

274
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
You can't even say that.

275
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
That's how vulnerable you are.

276
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Heartbleed bug.

277
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Heartbleed.

278
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,360
And this, you know, I don't even I don't even have to say it, but honestly, this is egregious.

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,160
It is disgusting.

280
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
And I can see how this would happen.

281
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Yep.

282
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,120
And somebody who who's a little lazy, you know, I have a couple of Docker images laying

283
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,360
around that I honestly haven't updated since the first day I deployed them.

284
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,760
I think that happens a lot.

285
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,320
A lot, a lot.

286
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,080
And here we are deploying Docker like crazy, just like we've deployed home routers and

287
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,640
all of these other little Internet of Things devices that we don't actually know how they

288
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
work.

289
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
And so you don't even bother.

290
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
You don't even think about it.

291
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Right.

292
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,440
In fact, the whole appeal to Docker is, well, it's a static environment.

293
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,760
You don't have to peek inside.

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
It just works.

295
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Yeah.

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
They configured it for you.

297
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,360
I can update my host OS, but the static little container doesn't change.

298
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
That's the whole appeal to Docker.

299
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Yes, it is.

300
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Right.

301
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,240
Which is another way of saying, this is this little area of my machine I'm never going

302
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
to update.

303
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Yep.

304
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
That's what you're saying.

305
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm not worried about it.

306
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
It does what it does.

307
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
And it becomes a deployment methodology.

308
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Right.

309
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
It becomes a way to manage risk.

310
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Right.

311
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,380
You never hear about making Docker containers.

312
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,000
You just hear about downloading them.

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Or keeping them up to date.

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,260
And I wonder, like, what's the plan here?

316
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,840
What are we going to do here?

317
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,440
And it feels like everybody is scrambling to come up with an answer to this problem.

318
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,360
In fact, even Docker themselves, they are looking at this particular issue.

319
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,400
Docker has added a hardware signing feature.

320
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
You ready for this?

321
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Remember how you were saying about buying one of these?

322
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes, I was.

323
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Yubikey.

324
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Hey.

325
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Yubikey.

326
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,520
A device that we all are very familiar with here on the show.

327
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,160
And this is their solution.

328
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Docker has already implemented the update framework, a method of confirming that a digital

329
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,720
signature applied to a container image in a repository matches the signature of code

330
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
arriving at the enterprise's Docker system.

331
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,260
So they finally have signing.

332
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
This is good.

333
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
This is good.

334
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Now, Yubikey.

335
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,600
With Yubikey 4, this is where you could have two-factor authentication that requires the

336
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,800
device to recognize the user's fingerprint before it will issue the identification.

337
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,720
I don't quite understand how they're going to work this in.

338
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,800
But Docker, this happened at DockerCon, they announced a new layer in code and identify

339
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,880
a confirming process.

340
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,800
Developers and system administrators can use a keychain, a keychain fob, like the Yubikey

341
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
4.

342
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
It's got to be the Yubikey 4.

343
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
It cannot be an earlier version.

344
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,600
They have to go to the USB port on a laptop or a workstation to upload their unique identifier

345
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,240
to the container and authenticate.

346
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,560
As the code moves along its journey to a production system, the identifier continually ensures

347
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,700
the recipient that only the identified hands have touched the code.

348
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,800
So it verifies the entire chain and at the end with the Yubikey.

349
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,520
Pretty fascinating stuff.

350
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,760
But one of the demos from DockerCon was that the developer had a set of private keys that

351
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,280
were generated from a root Yubikey in the developer's shop.

352
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,060
The developer then decided in their wisdom to commit those private keys to the public

353
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
GitHub.

354
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Oh, joy.

355
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
As a backup.

356
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
Yeah, yeah, sure.

357
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
That was the demo.

358
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,720
So what they showed in the demo was that with the Yubikey, they were able to rotate the

359
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,060
master keys and turn off those developer's private keys and therefore make it in so that

360
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,160
he wasn't able to push to the hub.

361
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
No kidding.

362
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,400
The hub just by rotating those keys.

363
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,480
So some really nice features.

364
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,240
Also they announced something called Project Nautilus and that was, I think, the reason

365
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,440
that CoreOS have open sourced Clare.

366
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,360
Ah, you think it was a response to Nautilus?

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,940
I reckon they knew about it and thought, right, we've wasted all this time, let's just make

368
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,740
it open source.

369
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm not a cynic, I promise.

370
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
So what's Project Nautilus?

371
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:50,440
Yeah, what Project Nautilus does is it gives you a very cool dashboard and it analyzes

372
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,480
the layers and it does static binary analysis in each Docker container.

373
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,160
So it'll look at the version of curl, you've got the version of open SSL and it will say

374
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,700
against a vulnerability database that Docker maintain themselves.

375
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,800
They were quite hazy on these details, which are obviously very important when it comes

376
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,720
to security.

377
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,960
But they maintain this database themselves of vulnerabilities and what they were saying

378
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,660
to me earlier was that if there's a vulnerability in upstream, for example, and that's the container

379
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:35,480
I've based off of, what will then happen as a child container, I will get a notification

380
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,860
saying, hey, your container is now vulnerable because of this upstream vulnerability.

381
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,240
It's okay, we fixed it, but you now need to kick off a new build on your machine.

382
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Of course, right.

383
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah, you would.

384
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:58,800
So it's not going to automatically fix the 80% of images, which are vulnerable.

385
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
But it's a good start.

386
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,400
So I'm just going to drop a link into the chat of the interface.

387
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Thank you.

388
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah.

389
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
I put it in the IRC too if you're logged in because that'd be really handy.

390
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
What did you find there, Wes?

391
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
What's that?

392
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
You digging around on that?

393
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Oh, there you are.

394
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
You're digging around on it right now.

395
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Yes, I am.

396
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Cool.

397
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Yeah.

398
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I'll put a link to this in the chat room too.

399
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
That is actually really good to hear.

400
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
And thank you.

401
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
You know what?

402
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
It is really kismet on the timing there that he went to DockerCon and showed up.

403
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
It really is perfect.

404
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,960
That's what I love about our virtual lug.

405
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,280
If you go to a conference or an event like this or even your lug and want to come and

406
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,400
share with our lug.

407
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
We would love that.

408
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah, we would.

409
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Yeah, we really would.

410
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm sat in my hotel room in Barcelona waiting for my flight tomorrow and I had nothing better

411
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
to do.

412
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Thank you.

413
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,800
We really do because it was in Spain this year and we were just talking a little bit

414
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
ago.

415
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,080
It's going to be in Seattle in 2016 on June 20th to the 21st and I'm already kind of thinking

416
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,360
why do I do that, dude?

417
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
I don't know.

418
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Wes and I.

419
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I take it as a compliment.

420
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
After about a year, I'll get it.

421
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
We'll get it right.

422
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah.

423
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,160
Wes and I, I really think Wes and I are going to go to this.

424
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,280
If you can get it from work.

425
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Yes, absolutely.

426
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
You think?

427
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,680
I think whatever, six months is plenty of time to do it.

428
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
June 20th to the 21st in Seattle.

429
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,800
Maybe you can come meet Wes and I and we'll go down there and walk around and go to DockerCon.

430
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,720
This year it was in Spain, so it was not very practical for us to go.

431
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I like Spain.

432
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
Yeah, so thank you very much for going there and giving us kind of the report on that.

433
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,520
That was pretty cool.

434
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:31,560
I was thinking back on why I started using Scale Engine to host Jupiter Broadcasting.

435
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,040
So it started as, the thing about a podcast is sometimes certain episodes are very popular.

436
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,960
And so all of a sudden you have a huge spike in CPU and bandwidth and all of that transfer.

437
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
At times that you probably can't really predict.

438
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Right.

439
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,560
And so I kept getting screwed.

440
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
This is before DigitalOcean.

441
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,200
I just kept getting so screwed.

442
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,800
When you paid for a fixed amount a month.

443
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,760
And even paid for CPU usage.

444
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,040
And so Alan came along and I remember at the time thinking his pricing was unbelievable.

445
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,980
How could it be so low?

446
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
What is he like?

447
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,120
Can he really deliver?

448
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Is this over served?

449
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,600
And do you know how he did it?

450
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,820
His jails.

451
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,960
Because he could give you metal performance at really low cost to him.

452
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,680
He didn't have to spin up a virtual environment.

453
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,580
An entire operating system that emulates virtual hardware or tries to use a hypervisor that

454
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,560
translates between physical and virtual hardware.

455
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,200
He just did a jail.

456
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,000
And honestly it's the same exact thing that makes Docker so appealing to Linux users.

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Is you can create a Docker container.

458
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,800
And it is an isolated environment.

459
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
And all of these things.

460
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,680
So you want to have a certain version of PHP?

461
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Have that at Haas.

462
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
You can have your specific version.

463
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
It doesn't conflict.

464
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah.

465
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Exactly.

466
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
So that I remember.

467
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,440
Now honestly though FreeBSD had that years ago.

468
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Yeah.

469
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
It's been stable.

470
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,120
What Docker did though, and I think it's such an important thing for us to understand.

471
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,000
And I think if you're curious about this at all.

472
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,760
What Docker did is they closed that 10%.

473
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,640
And I like to say this on other shows.

474
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,240
They closed the uncanny valley.

475
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,480
In CG they have the uncanny valley on movies where you can kind of tell it's CG but it's

476
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
like really close.

477
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
It's a little too.

478
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
It makes you...

479
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
It's just freaky.

480
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
It's weird.

481
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
It makes you uncomfortable.

482
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Yeah it does.

483
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Totally.

484
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,840
It's like between where Jails was and Docker is.

485
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Maybe Zones.

486
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Solaris Zones did that too.

487
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Yes.

488
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Totally.

489
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Absolutely it does.

490
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,000
And so Docker closed that uncanny valley with that like GitHub like approach of publishing

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
images.

492
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,360
It very fits in today's deployment development culture.

493
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
And that was all it took right.

494
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,880
Just like Apple famously will, oh my gosh it's so revolutionary what Apple's doing.

495
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
When in reality like us nerds are like, dude other people have been doing that for years.

496
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,480
They just put the pieces together at the right time.

497
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,960
And a lot of us nerds are like, well I'll put the pieces together myself.

498
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,520
It's no big deal.

499
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,920
But they will close that gap.

500
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,260
And that's what Docker did.

501
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,680
And so container technology was not totally new.

502
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,600
I mean even Chirude environments existed under Linux and LXC containers.

503
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,240
But Docker came along and just put it all together in this nice package.

504
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,140
And the problem with that is it also made it way more accessible and way more deployable.

505
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,840
And so you've got guys like me who go deploy smoke ping containers.

506
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,320
Don't really know what they're doing.

507
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Yeah.

508
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
What this Linux thing doesn't...

509
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,200
You know I go to play a smoke ping Docker container and then I don't touch it for a

510
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
year.

511
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Right.

512
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
And now it's sitting out there.

513
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Living there in the public.

514
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Yeah.

515
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Public facing.

516
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes.

517
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
And so that I don't know where to take this.

518
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,920
And I wonder Wes do you figure is this one of these issues that just sort of sorts itself

519
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,960
out over time or is this...

520
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,160
What I worry about is will Linux become known as the platform that hosts a bunch of outdated

521
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
shit.

522
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Right.

523
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
What do you think?

524
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I mean in some senses we are already.

525
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Right.

526
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I mean there are those communities.

527
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I think a lot of the...

528
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah.

529
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
A percent of Docker containers are vulnerable to heart bleed that have open SSL.

530
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,760
I think there's a lot of enterprises that are working on removing a lot of older Debian

531
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
hosts in particular.

532
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Older Ubuntu installations.

533
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Yeah.

534
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Right.

535
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,260
And you get stuck on these things.

536
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,480
Same true with Windows.

537
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Same as...

538
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes.

539
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Very much so.

540
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
So it's not just a Linux problem.

541
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Like the Windows 3.1 that brought down France last week.

542
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,360
My work runs Oracle...

543
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,240
My work runs Oracle Linux 5 and they want to use Docker.

544
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,540
Wow.

545
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,120
Oracle Linux 5 would be what?

546
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,300
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, I guess, which would be three versions old now, which would

547
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:35,380
be almost seven years, I think. I don't know exactly. Wow. Wow. That is really something.

548
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,040
I do think, though, that there's been a lot of very good attention recently to both Linux

549
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,240
community and in Docker, you know, that that we need to have at least, you can't force

550
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,880
what people do. It's definitely an issue they're taking seriously. They devoted at

551
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
least half their sessions today to security. They're aware of it. They're on it. I think

552
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,060
it'll take time. I think we also have community players, like CoreOS in particular, that really

553
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,400
do take security very seriously. And they're pushing Docker. Right. They're pushing Docker.

554
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,800
They're pushing containerization. But I think they're doing it in a very open way and helping

555
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,160
provide the community tools that they can use. Yeah. It's actually, it is a great example

556
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,720
of how you can have legitimate competition in the open source world, but yet every frickin'

557
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,760
buddy is benefiting. And I look at this and I think, man, I wish more people were current

558
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,560
on this issue. I wish more people knew all the nuances and were following this because

559
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,940
this is such a brilliant example of how open source can be competitive yet cooperative

560
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,280
at the same time. Yes. And in such an area that's so critical to the future cloud, quote

561
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,720
unquote, sphere. Right. I feel like right now we're kind of shaping what the next ten

562
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,480
years of deployed code will look like. Yeah, I agree. All right. So before we move on to

563
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,840
some feedback, any other thoughts? Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Yeah.

564
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,120
One other cool thing that came across was I saw a demo today of someone sharing the

565
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,800
X11 socket from inside a Linux OS to inside the container. And with that, they were able

566
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,360
to run whichever desktop application they wanted in a Docker container. And that's nice.

567
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,480
And where they took that was they then they clicked a button and they launched a whole

568
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,680
Eclipse IDE environment in a browser. It sounds like maybe in the future we could have something

569
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,200
like Cube's OS but with like Docker or LXC instead of Zen. Yeah. Huh. Huh. That is kind

570
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,000
of like that. Now that is web computing. All right. I just wanted to point out before we

571
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,080
move in to the rest of the show, we went to System76 this week. That was a lot of fun.

572
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,360
It looked like. Yeah. I had a blast. Had challenges. I forgot the most important piece of equipment

573
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,680
that we could have, you know, I mean there's not a more critical piece of equipment I forgot.

574
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,080
That was awesome. I stayed in a hotel room that felt like a palace. That was pretty cool.

575
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,400
And I got to play with an augmented reality sandbox. That was awesome. So check out Roverlog.

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,300
Check out the Roverlog episode 15 of my trip to System76. It was a freaking blast. Colorado

577
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,640
is. It sounds like you got some walking in too, Chris. Wes, I'm not. So you're feeling

578
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,240
healthier than ever now that you're back. Wes, I did not put this in the video but there

579
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,540
was a night where I legitimately went and laid down in bed, had to put a pillow under

580
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:28,580
my knees and all of my legs ached. And I thought to myself, $380 a night and alls I want right

581
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:35,220
now is a freaking bathtub. It was. No bathtub? It was just so bad. It was so bad. I hurt

582
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,960
so bad because we walked around so much. Here, I'll play the first few seconds of the Roverlog.

583
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,440
I want you to go check out Roverlog 15 though. It was a lot of fun. Oh, I don't hear it.

584
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,280
Hold on. It's mostly Chris talking about how nice the hotel is. That's like 80%. But it's

585
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,720
worth it. It's great. It's definitely at least a solid 30%. I don't know about 80 but yeah,

586
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,820
check out the intro here. We're here in Denver, Colorado to go to System76. It's their super

587
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:15,120
fan contest and we're going to go in there and see what they have to show us. Let's go.

588
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,620
So they had a whole steam room set up which was super, super nice. I bet you were getting

589
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,080
plenty fine performance in that room. Yeah, it was really cool and they had a whiteboard

590
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:30,000
paint up so you could draw and stuff on there. It was really cool. So Roverlog 15, it literally

591
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,720
was down to the wire to get that episode of Linux Action Show and you can find out more

592
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,080
by watching episode 15 of the Roverlog. Go to JupiterBroadcasting.com to find that. You

593
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:46,280
can also find a few other things over Jupiter Broadcasting. So that trip, it was so funny.

594
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,440
We're sitting there just having a nice casual conversation and I can't even remember how

595
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:00,240
it came up but it comes up that Noah switched a few people to Linux. Just a hobby really.

596
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
And Emma is sitting there, she's an employee of System76. I love Emma, she's been a long

597
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,560
time friend of the show. She says, I switch more people to Linux than you do. Gold. Mind

598
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,660
you this is our first day there and we're still kind of doing that phase where I know

599
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,840
you professionally, I followed everything you do. You don't quite know where the human

600
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,340
boundaries are, how to connect on that level. Within 30 seconds of that conversation starting,

601
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:35,360
there was four f-bombs dropped. It was odd. Wow, this got human. These two, Emma and Noah,

602
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,520
take switching people to Linux so seriously. Thank God those people are out there though.

603
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,860
She threw down, I had mad respect. So she came on the Linux Action Show and we talked

604
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,240
about that a little bit and her and Noah are going to have a massive competition. I don't

605
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,800
know how Noah is going to do this because he's also in the process of moving. He runs

606
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:02,880
his own business, he's got two kids and they're moving houses right now. But he couldn't help

607
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,240
himself, he throws down with this competition. And so what I love about it is over on the

608
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,540
subreddit, there was a thread started by russen88, Noah versus Dr. Emma switching people to Linux.

609
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,280
The competition rules, there's already 14 comments and it's heated, it is passionate,

610
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,720
it is so funny. So if you want to throw down on what your idea should be around this competition

611
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:32,120
between, and both of these people, they legitimately switch people to Linux all the time. You don't

612
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,040
know until you've been with Noah, but I went to a burger place with Noah. I went to go

613
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,880
get a bacon cheeseburger and some fries. I feel like you're the embarrassed wife in

614
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,400
this situation. We're like, not right now, we're just trying to have dinner, please.

615
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,640
I am an advocate for the Linux platform. We are standing in line at five guys getting

616
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,440
a burger and fries and Noah is switching this dude to Linux and he's like, here, take this

617
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,420
thumb drive, go install this. And this guy's like, alright, I'm going to do it. And before

618
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:06,160
we order our burger, Noah has this guy switching to Linux. It was so good and to see those

619
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,600
two go at it was so great. And if you haven't watched this week's episode of Linux Action

620
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Show, you got to go watch it. It was a really funny throw down. So we're going to have a

621
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
competition coming up and I really actually do legitimately want Rose because I have to

622
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,980
play judge. I got to judge this thing and I need to know. I got to determine what the

623
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,800
parameters are so we have a link in the show notes if you guys. I think this might warrant

624
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,500
like a T-Spring shirt or something. Oh, yeah. Noah the switcher. I don't know. And Emma

625
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,080
the closer. That's good, Wes. We should really make something out of this. And you know,

626
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,640
if we had more time, because we were just there for a couple of days, if we had more

627
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,400
time I would have just we would have gone out down on the street down a man on the street

628
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,120
kind of thing and just have them start switching because both of them and think about like

629
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,160
the like the social norms you have to completely reject to do what they do. They literally

630
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,320
walk up to strangers and start profiting to them. Are you changing your operating system?

631
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,800
Can I tell you about your savior Linux? Yeah, exactly. It's just ridiculous. And so and

632
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,760
it is so much fun to watch switcher versus closer. You guys got to go watch this week's

633
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,480
episode of Linux Action Show to see what I'm talking about. All right. So before we move

634
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,080
on because there's so much to cover this week, I want to talk about Digital Ocean. I love

635
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,840
Digital Ocean. They always have come in at just the perfect moment. You can start in

636
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,800
less than 55 seconds to build your own Linux rig with one click deployment or really fine

637
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,760
tuning it. And think about that. 55 seconds. I mean, you can't even get a live CD booted

638
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,160
in 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only five dollars a month. You can't even get a

639
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,160
burger for five dollars and this is five dollars a month. A month for a Linux rig up in the

640
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,520
cloud with a crazy fast connection. They'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

641
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,160
SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer. But what I love about Digital Ocean is their

642
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,520
availability of locations. They got a brand new one in Toronto that's called the FUNSA

643
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,480
data center. But they also have a great one in Germany. They have ones in New York, San

644
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,600
Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and even London. But it's that interface. It's that

645
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,200
interface. It is so good. It is so intuitive and it doesn't suck. Like it lets you do snapshots.

646
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,680
It lets you destroy machines. It lets you transfer between virtual servers. It lets

647
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,520
you one click deploy applications in a Docker container. It doesn't suck. And they have

648
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,640
a straightforward API that makes it totally usable and because that API rocks, there is

649
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,320
a crap ton. I mean like a crap ton of really good open source code that makes you look

650
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,760
like a pro you can go take advantage of right now. You can just go grab it right now. You

651
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,560
can integrate it in with your smartphone, integrate it in with your toolbar, get a gnome

652
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,760
extension up in that biz. I don't care. There's tons of code.

653
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,840
It's all about enabling you, right? Like between that and all of the tutorials which cover

654
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,040
like oh my gosh, even if you aren't using Digital Ocean, I mean, that's the dirty secret.

655
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
That's the dirty secret.

656
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,840
But it is so good because like you're just deploying standard Linux distributions.

657
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,360
It's the new ArchWiki, really.

658
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
It really is, dude.

659
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Don't tell them that.

660
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,840
And it is good because the thing they have kind of against like I don't mean to knock

661
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,080
on the ArchWiki because, dude, I go to it all the time, but they pay the people, right?

662
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,840
They pay you to write up tutorials. And then they have full time editors on staff. And

663
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,440
you know, little side story here, and by the way, I haven't said this yet. I probably should

664
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,480
have because this is the only way this show survives. DO unplugged. Probably should have

665
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,840
said that at the beginning because if you don't use that promo code, the show doesn't

666
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
go on.

667
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
So I probably should have said that at the beginning, but I get excited.

668
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,240
So you know, I look at this and I think, Wes, imagine what we've been talking about. We've

669
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,400
been talking about Docker. We've been talking about deploying things. There are ways to

670
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,680
use Docker that are smart. And you and I, before the show, we were talking about a Python

671
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,320
thing that you're working on to take like an extra bit of work you've gotten and kind

672
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,660
of parse it all up and put it in a spot for you that's easy to read and it's using this

673
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
Java intermediate.

674
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,440
It's just like this long, complicated thing you're doing, right? And I look at that and

675
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,600
I think, geez, you know, once you've developed that, if you did all that in a Docker container,

676
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,320
it's like one, two, three clicks. Actually, they're not clicks. It would be, I'm looking

677
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,320
at the command, four commands to have this deployed on a Docker container. And just boom,

678
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,600
you have this up, then you create the DigitalOcean droplet, and then one command after that

679
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
and you have it running on a production.

680
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,480
Things deployed. It's just going.

681
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,480
So in four commands, you've got it containerized, you've got it ready to go, published up to

682
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,280
the Docker hub, and then one command after that, you've got it deployed on your DigitalOcean

683
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,760
droplet.

684
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
That sounds really nice.

685
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,320
I mean, that is a huge appeal. That is, it is really something. Or, you know, there's

686
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,160
a bunch of other stuff you can take advantage of. Just go try something like frickin' own

687
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,400
cloud sync thing.

688
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,520
Sync thing, yeah.

689
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,760
Definitely sync thing. Definitely sync thing. Just go try something like that. Minecraft,

690
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,400
go to your own Minecraft server, Mumble server. There are, MB, there are so many different

691
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,520
ways I use Docker, Docker and DigitalOcean. And MB is running in a Docker container on

692
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,760
a Fedora 23 DigitalOcean droplet.

693
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Right now.

694
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Wow.

695
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Yeah.

696
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
It really can't get easier than that.

697
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Right? That's how I'm rollin' these days.

698
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,360
But it's the good kind of easy, where you know that it's stable.

699
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Here's how I did it.

700
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
It's production grade.

701
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,760
In 55 seconds, I deployed a Fedora 23 DigitalOcean droplet. Then, I installed Cockpit.

702
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Oh, I love it.

703
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,280
Which was one DNF command on the command line, using the HTML5 console that DigitalOcean

704
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,960
gives me. And then, I logged into my Cockpit instance, and in there, they have a whole

705
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:34,360
container section, and I deployed MB. So, I deployed Fedora 23 droplet, installed Docker,

706
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,080
installed Cockpit, one-click deployment of MB.

707
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,200
So, you could give this job to interns, whoever. You can just get it done.

708
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,960
So, there's things that happen. I'm like, you know what? I'll just log into my droplet,

709
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,480
get this show on MB, and I just watch it on the rover. It is...

710
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
That's amazing.

711
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,440
It is amazing. And you can use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get started. Just go check

712
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,520
it out, and you'll support the show. DigitalOcean.com. Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED. It is a Linux

713
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,440
rig up in the cloud, crazy fast access, SSDs throughout. I mean, you can figure it out.

714
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Go do it. DigitalOcean.com. Try it out, and make something awesome, because hashtag just

715
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
saying.

716
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Just saying.

717
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:17,200
Okay. So, on November 10th, Steam Machines hit the internets, went out, and people started

718
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,680
getting their really super awesome, you know, designed for gaming Steam Machines. And, as

719
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,240
always, people got to do their reviews. They got to do their benchmarks.

720
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
We're going here.

721
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Yeah. You know what? Before we get into this, I should do the official opening of our segment.

722
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:45,440
Yeah. There we go. That's better. And, according to ours, the takeaway here is that cross-platform

723
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,160
3D games face a 21 to 58% frame rate dip.

724
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
Ouch. I don't like those numbers.

725
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,440
No. On the same exact hardware, you're dual-booting between Windows and SteamOS, 58% drop.

726
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,720
It is what you might call, Wes, I don't know, devastating.

727
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Devastating.

728
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
And it's sort of confusing.

729
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,760
You like that DF command in the background there?

730
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Yeah, that is nice.

731
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Look at that.

732
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Yeah, look at that.

733
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
At least they're doing the Linux part right. I appreciate that.

734
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,640
Yeah, too bad it's retrying crap like that. It's, you know. So, to start their test, they

735
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,600
dragged out a dual-boot SteamOS Windows machine. This is on ours. They built two years ago,

736
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,560
this was a little old, but not that bad, and got all the OSs up-to-date on both sides.

737
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,480
They ran a whole bunch of tests.

738
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,280
What was the, did they have, I know they had a lot of graphics cards, but...

739
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
What was the specific graphics card that they used on this particular rig?

740
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Yeah, I'm just curious.

741
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,000
Is that what you were asking me right now, Wes?

742
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's exactly what I'm asking.

743
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,360
Are you asking me that right now? I believe it was an...

744
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Go on, go on. I'm sorry.

745
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,040
No, no, no. That's a good question, actually. I believe it was an NVIDIA card, but I don't

746
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,440
actually think they listed it here.

747
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Okay. Just because that's a...

748
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Oh, they did. I'm sorry. I'm a dummy. It was the GTX 660. Are you serious? With the NVIDIA

749
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,840
driver 35891. Now, are you S-ing me?

750
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Is that current?

751
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,680
That's a really good question. So, here you are on the...

752
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm not sure.

753
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,360
On the Bonobo. No, it's not current at all. On the Bonobo, let's see here. I am on 355

754
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,040
because I haven't updated for like two weeks, but I'm trying to figure out what is my...

755
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,960
What's the video card in this Bonobo? Because it's a G4. So, they basically tested it on

756
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,440
a machine that is less powerful than my Bonobo, and my Bonobo is three years old.

757
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
I have a...

758
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
It's still impressive that Windows was able to...

759
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,480
I have a 680M. Dude, I have a 680M in my three-year-old Bonobo, and they're sitting here... You know,

760
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,040
can I just take a second? I mean, we'll get into the rest of this as we go, but I sure

761
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,920
as shit would never come on air. I would never in a million years come on air and dare to

762
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,400
tell you the performance of games under Windows or Linux with such shit hardware. I wouldn't

763
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,960
dare do it because I would be torn apart by my audience because they're smart. They're

764
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:06,220
not a bunch of dumbasses. I cannot believe R's published this just on... Okay, anyways.

765
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,240
But that's not the takeaway because the numbers are what matter, but it is literally... If

766
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,840
you're gonna be R's technica and you're gonna make this huge ass publishing, you're gonna

767
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,720
do this huge ass article, if some podcaster wouldn't even bother doing this because his

768
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,320
hardware's so out of date, you gotta think about that. Give that some thought. I mean,

769
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
that is...

770
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Yeah.

771
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Right?

772
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,320
It's a little... I don't know.

773
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,920
Like, install the latest driver, at least, if you're gonna use that hardware, which...

774
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,160
Wait, are these the stats on the side here?

775
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,400
That's the hardware. That's the hardware there, yeah.

776
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
That they're using?

777
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Yeah, Windows 10.

778
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
What is the CPU there?

779
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,080
The CPU is, well, three gigahertz.

780
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Does that say Pentium?

781
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:54,640
G3220. Will you look up the G3220? It's the G3220. But like, R Brown is... R Brown, go

782
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,320
ahead. You don't have to say in the chat. You're in the mumble room. Go ahead. Make

783
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
your point.

784
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Yeah. Well, the thing I was thinking, though, is if they're using hardware that's old...

785
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,520
I mean, surely all of the effort, all of the optimization for these Linux drivers are targeting

786
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,720
newer hardware. I mean, I've definitely seen it with some of the older Nvidia stuff. They

787
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,160
just drop that support completely out of the Linux drivers sooner or later. So if ours

788
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,720
have gone back and used an ancient card, yeah, maybe it does suck compared to Windows, but

789
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,000
I'd like it to see a relatively recent one.

790
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,520
Yeah. Yeah. I agree. So what'd you find?

791
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,160
Well, I will say that the recommended customer price for the CPU box... Well, for the tray,

792
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,720
which is the more expensive, $64.

793
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Oh!

794
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,400
Yeah. So it's definitely a bargain basement. I mean, and all of this, it still remains

795
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,320
the point, why is Windows performing better? That's still totally relevant. It's just kind

796
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,560
of surprising. I feel like I saw other reviews where they're like, oh yeah, we bought the

797
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,800
newest Skylake and here we were trying, but...

798
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,000
It feels like if Chris went and scrapped together a few spare parts in the JB1 Studio and then

799
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,680
did a SteamOS review. That would be bullshit. And my viewers would think I was an uneducated

800
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
idiot.

801
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,280
And I thought when I was reading it, I just assumed that, okay, they bought the Alienware

802
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
or like one of the commercial options and they installed Windows.

803
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,720
I was going to say, the reason why I went with this, because the fact of the matter

804
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,560
I was going to say was, it doesn't really... What matters was how the difference performance

805
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
Delta was between the two OSs.

806
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And that is important.

807
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,640
Still the case, but like R. Brown is saying is, it very well could be that the newer GPUs

808
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,480
specifically, I mean, that's been three and a half years. Nvidia has changed its tune

809
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,720
about Linux considerably in three and a half years. SteamOS was announced since then.

810
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,200
Not that it's relevant to this review, but I'm sure the same thing would apply for AMD,

811
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
you know, given their recent...

812
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:52,240
Totally, right? Absolutely. But here is the devastating part. And honestly, what is really

813
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,300
disappointing and it's really too bad is it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because

814
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,240
R's technica is saying SteamOS is slower.

815
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,720
So let me tell you what they're saying about SteamOS. That is actually the takeaway. All

816
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,340
that matters unfortunately in 2015 is somebody scrolled past that headline on their smartphone.

817
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,440
And that is the reality of it.

818
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,600
They were thinking about getting Linux, they were thinking about buying a Steam machine

819
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,720
and now they're like, well, no, I'll just build another Windows gaming rig.

820
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,920
This did surprise me. Valve's own Source Engine games show the same performance hit when compared

821
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,920
to their Windows versions, Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. All took massive frame rate

822
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:33,160
dips on SteamOS compared to their Windows counterparts. Only Left 4 Dead 2 showed comparable

823
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,760
performance, comparable performance between Windows and Linux.

824
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
That's pretty devastating.

825
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,280
There was no indication of the frame rate performance improvements that Valve cited

826
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,420
a few years ago. That is a little bit of a bummer. Right now it seems like choosing SteamOS,

827
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,800
this is according to R's, this is their wrap up. Choosing SteamOS over Windows box means

828
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,680
sacrificing a significant amount of performance on many, if not most, graphically intensive

829
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,600
3D games. That's a pretty big cost to bear, R's says, considering that Alienware sells

830
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,760
its Windows powered console style alpha boxes at prices at only $50 more expensive than

831
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,360
identically outfitted SteamOS machines.

832
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,800
That's not to mention the fact that Steam, on Windows, currently has thousands of games

833
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,280
that aren't even available on SteamOS, including most AAA recent releases. While SteamOS has

834
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,800
similar exclusives to recommend over Windows, hopefully Valve and other Linux developers

835
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,720
continue to improve SteamOS performance to the point where high end games will be expected

836
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,920
to at least run as comparably between Linux and Windows.

837
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Ouch.

838
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Yeah, ouch.

839
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,560
That's not how you want your first launch to go. What do you think? Is this a problem

840
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,200
or is this just, is this sort of like how a early generation thing goes and the consumer

841
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,840
market understands or?

842
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,800
It's not great. I mean, I feel like we're still in the waiting phase to see how all

843
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,280
of the Steam launch stuff plays out. You know, maybe after a quarter we'll see kind of what

844
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,600
are the retail, you know, how many, how many were picked up, how many people did actually

845
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,200
buy them, especially over the holiday period. But it is disappointing that we can't come

846
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,880
out the gate and say like, even, especially on titles where Valve has, you know, ramped

847
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
up support that we can't say like, look, you can play them on Linux and it's just as good.

848
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
We can't even say that.

849
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,800
And I want to add a little context to this conversation. For door, for door developer,

850
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,440
gnome developer, he, I think he works on G streamer Christian scaler. He writes for us

851
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,320
in the Linux community, these machines are more than that. They're an important part

852
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,720
of helping us break into a broader market by paving the way for even more games and

853
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:38,260
more big budget games coming to our platform. Playing computer games is not just a niche.

854
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,000
It's a mainstream activity these days and not having access to games on our platform

855
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,440
has cost us quite a few users and potential contributors over the years. I agree.

856
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,920
I agree with that. Yeah. I have an ins I have, for instance, met a lot of computer science

857
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,000
students who ended up not using Linux as the main OS during their studies, simply due to

858
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the lack of games on the platform. This is really, I think this is a really accurate

859
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
point. Instead, Linux got deregulated to that thing in a VM. And you only needed it when

860
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,080
you had to have that assignment to complete. That does kind of right. I mean, I've met

861
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,960
those people. Yeah, you know, I mean, it's not against them. It's like, Windows is the

862
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,960
operating system that works. You don't question it. Well, Linux is your development thing.

863
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,160
You know, so, you know, let's say you got you know, you got let's say you got $500 slosh

864
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,080
a month. And you got it, you know, you save up a couple of months and you buy $1,000 laptop.

865
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,960
Well, now that laptop not only is the way you're getting your schoolwork done, but that's

866
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,160
how you're getting your gaming done. Right. Maybe it has optimist graphics, maybe, you

867
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,480
know, all of these little things. That is literally all that matters is that it took

868
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,140
you two, three months just afford this thing or to make the payments on this thing. It

869
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,320
better be able to play games. And if that's the difference between Windows and Linux,

870
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,000
you're going to go Windows. And it came probably came with a Windows license. You know, I was

871
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,760
talking to a student at System 76, one of the super fans, and she said that she was

872
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,960
running Linux because she was in computer engineering. But gaming wasn't a big issue

873
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,120
for her. Right. And so it wasn't it wasn't a barrier. Right. And but for she said, you

874
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,360
know, other students, that's that's the number one differentiator. That was just a couple

875
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,220
of days ago. Somebody told me that it's in school right now. So that actually really

876
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,480
rings extremely true for me. He goes on to say, remember, he works on G streamer. He's

877
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,720
a developer, which I got to say G streamer has been doing some pretty impressive stuff.

878
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
I don't know if you've seen that, but I have been following that. I'm very, very excited

879
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,920
about that. I think this was on blogs.nome.org. He says steam for Linux and steam OS can be

880
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,080
an important pieces of breaking through this steam OS and steam machines are also important

881
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,920
for the Linux community for another reason. They can help funnel more resources from hardware

882
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,360
companies into Linux drivers and support. I know, for instance, that all three major

883
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:49,000
GPU vendors have increased their Linux drivers investments due to steam OS also rings true.

884
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,520
This is why steam OS is important. And the success of steam OS is also kind of important.

885
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,200
He said, by the way, a side note, also working on a few features in fedora workstation to

886
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,340
make it better for steam and steam games. This includes our work on the GL dispatch

887
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,040
and optimus support has covered in a previous blog, which will have linked in the show notes

888
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:18,800
and lib ratbag is a new library for handling gaming mice under Linux to make it even better.

889
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,880
And they're finally, they're working on bugs to support and make it even better to host

890
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,360
the steam client related to the C++ ABI issues.

891
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,460
I'm glad that they've gotten the sort now because I don't want to deal with that.

892
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,320
Do you think it's important steam OS, steam gaming? Really, honestly, do you think it's

893
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,480
important?

894
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,280
I think that the last point there about putting stress, yes, to develop more, I mean, like,

895
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,900
we see it, you know, obviously, like, Pixar, and the really industry specific things are

896
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,200
doing it, but they have so much stuff that they end up replicating themselves or, you

897
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,920
know, building stacks to do their high end stuff on Linux. I think we need more of that

898
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,280
consumer spectrum to be pushed and developed. And obviously, we have a lot of big changes

899
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,400
coming with Wayland and Vulcan and all of that. So we'll see where that goes. Right.

900
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,960
But I think it's important even now to begin putting that stress on there and be like,

901
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,500
Linux is perfect. We've seen it in other industries. Right. And if we can get more

902
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,720
of that, maybe getting gaming companies to see that they can take Linux and shape it

903
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,560
into what they want. Really, what we have to do is we have to bet that Windows continues

904
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,740
to suck balls. Yes. And then that makes them want something else. And that the store threatens

905
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,480
gaming industries, you know, that kind of stuff. In fact, it'd be good for Linux in

906
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,120
some ways in gaming if the Microsoft Store did kind of well. Too bad it sucks so bad.

907
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,520
Yes. And then you're right, because they could do this, they push on, they go, oh,

908
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,920
man, this is why we need Vulcan. This is why we got to support Vulcans. We're getting

909
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,480
behind Vulcan. Right. This could be really good in the long run. Because the thing about

910
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,720
Linux is like, you know, if you if you're focused on your product, you can take Linux

911
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,520
and you can build it to just do that. You can make it excellent. Yeah. Mumble Room,

912
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,420
any thoughts on this particular topic on Steam Machines or Vulcan or gaming under Linux or

913
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,840
maybe why ours got it wrong? The floor is open. I'll give you a couple of seconds to

914
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:56,380
jump in if anybody wants to. I got one. Yeah. So I was actually looking at these numbers

915
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:03,120
here. And I did mention in the chat room earlier, any number over 60 frames per second is literally

916
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:10,160
going to be imperceivable to the human eye. Any number over 30, you're going to have a

917
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,800
hard time. I'm seeing here for most of these numbers here on the ours technical article,

918
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,280
Linux still performs over 30 frames per second. So for most people, you're not going to have

919
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,840
a perception problem there. Right. The other thing that ours should have done, and this

920
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,200
is why I wanted to talk about this, I want to do a little debunking, is they should have

921
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,920
benchmarked all of these at 1920 by 1080, because that's the highest resolution the

922
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,600
SteamOS machines running at. Right. And if you think about that, 1920 by 1080 is a really

923
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,200
easy benchmark. Now a 668, a 660 and a 680, they should be able to do that no problem.

924
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,120
They should be able to do that 30 frames per second, no problem. 1920 by 1080 is not a

925
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,040
big deal. And everything should have been baseline to that. They did a couple of different

926
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,520
resolutions. One of them was 1792 by 1120, not ideal for gaming. Yeah, that is a great

927
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,260
point, right? Because the SteamOS machines only have to push at the max that your crappy

928
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,880
HDTV can do that you bought on sale.

929
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,400
I will also say that the article, it touches on it and it does mention it, but I feel like

930
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,760
there wasn't enough emphasis placed on what's the end user experience. Like can you buy

931
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:24,000
this or run this and have an enjoyable gaming experience for a large selection of the games

932
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that you can use.

933
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,920
Because a Steam machine is about that living room, big picture experience. And a Windows

934
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,200
Steam machine is about that traditional Steam client experience, sitting at the desk, gaming.

935
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,160
Right. And if you're the user that spends $2,000 and makes a custom gaming rig, that's

936
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,040
a different marketplace than like, I spent $400 at the store and I want to be able to

937
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,760
play last year to maybe this year's titles at reasonable settings.

938
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,280
Wimpy, you want to jump in on the Vulkan point?

939
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah, so if you look at the demonstrations that have been done demoing games using OpenGL

940
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:06,160
and Vulkan to show the performance increase, on Linux you typically see OpenGL performance

941
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:13,440
sort of IO bound to a single thread on a single CPU core. And then when you see the same type

942
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,240
of switch to Vulkan, you see that workload spread across all the cores and the load come

943
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:25,800
down and the frame rate go up significantly. So while I don't want to appear an apologist

944
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,480
for Linux's performance versus Windows in this case, I think we need to have one eye

945
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,360
on the future and that future is Vulkan. And that does perform very nicely with Steam.

946
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:43,280
Yeah, I agree. I actually agree a lot. I wonder if we'll start to see, you know, Vulkan ship

947
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,040
in 2016. I don't know when we're going to actually start to see it as end users.

948
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:53,280
I'm so excited just for Vulkan and Wayland and both of those together as the future.

949
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,960
So when Vulkan launches, does this mean we're going to all have to get new hardware as well?

950
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,560
Maybe although I guess current hardware today …

951
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,960
Sorry, I missed that. What was that?

952
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
I know something.

953
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,880
Yeah, go ahead. I think today current hardware does support it. Go ahead.

954
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:18,960
I believe the GTX 500 series and above will support it and then the newer R series AMD

955
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
graphics may support it.

956
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
Okay.

957
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Okay.

958
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
So at least some of it.

959
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,920
How about the HD 4000 for Intel?

960
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,080
Intel, I believe there are already drivers being built, but I don't know about Intel's

961
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,080
unfortunately.

962
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:41,960
Huh. I'm imagining. Yeah, I'd imagine they make that work, but it is funny. I don't

963
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,080
feel like we have … Specifically for this area, we have never really been to a point

964
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,000
where we've been like, well, next year or in two years. Like there's a lot of times

965
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,520
in Linux where we do say, well, soon it's going to be a lot better or no one's going

966
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,920
to get this or the Linux kernel or … You know, all this stuff we keep saying is going

967
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,320
to be … But this legitimately is actually happening and there's a lot of interested

968
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,360
parties and it legitimately is going to change things. And I'm very excited about it. I'm

969
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,320
very excited about it. And this R-Technica article, what it really did is it underscores

970
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,360
the need for Vulkan and why we want this. But Wes so very, very acutely pointed out

971
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,360
that if even in the lowest conditions, you know, you're getting 61 frames per second,

972
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,640
you're probably going to be okay on a console hooked up to your HD television that may or

973
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,840
may not even support 60 frames per second. And so, that's really the market for SteamOS.

974
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,040
I'd also like to say, it's pretty cool that here we are in a widely read publication

975
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,120
that ours is. You know, they're talking about like, here's the graphs. Here's like a widely

976
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,160
deployed thing and Linux is front and center. I mean, it's SteamOS, right? Linux is always

977
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,880
rebranded. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is actually also

978
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,120
something to kind of take away from this. Yeah. So, Rekai, by the way, is touching in

979
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,480
on the Intel thing in the chat room. He says, developed and showcased a Linux driver for

980
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:07,400
Intel which enabled Vulkan compatibility on the HD 4000 series integrated graphics. So,

981
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,680
there you go. So, you got back to the 500 series of the NVIDIA cards and the 4000 series

982
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,840
of Intel graphics. That's a pretty good way.

983
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,020
That is pretty damn good for Vulkan. That is really good. So, when that actually starts

984
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,400
to make more sense and it's something you might actually see on your machine, we're

985
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,840
going to talk a lot more about it and why it's a big deal. But right now, I'm going

986
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,320
to talk about Linux Academy because that is a big deal and a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged

987
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,440
show and a great opportunity for you. Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our

988
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,120
discount and to support the show. Keep us on the air. linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

989
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,960
They got step-by-step video courses, comprehensive study guides. What do I think is really, really,

990
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,480
really cool? You can jump in, you know, you can start training yourself, you can use your

991
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,040
own time, be your own boss, learn on your own schedule and then if you get stuck, they

992
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,560
got instructor help. And that is really nice because these instructors are super bright.

993
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,680
They are a bunch of Linux and open source enthusiasts and they have decided, well, let's

994
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,800
create a training platform. What a brilliant freaking idea. What a brilliant freaking idea.

995
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,060
Genius! Why didn't all the, like, look at, I shouldn't even say it, look at freaking

996
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,640
Linda, right? What a joke! What a joke compared to Linux Academy. Their courseware is a joke.

997
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,200
They are an embarrassment. Go to Linux Academy and see the difference when you have people

998
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,780
that are actually passionate about Linux. People that know what Vulkan is and Docker

999
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,240
is and the difference between Linux and a kernel and a distribution. Like, maybe they

1000
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,520
know what the GNU tools are. That would be a great thing to know if you are going to

1001
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,480
start writing course material. So imagine people that are so crazy passionate about

1002
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,480
Linux that they get the stupid idea to go create a website to train people how to use

1003
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,200
it. And that is where you start with Linux Academy. But instead of being dumb about it,

1004
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,760
they are like, well, alright, let's pair with educators. Let's pair with developers. Let's

1005
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,680
pair with industry professionals. Let's build something unique, create a platform.

1006
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,800
And you can tell they eat their own dog food, right? Like, they use Linux every day. It's

1007
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,920
so tied into this.

1008
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,760
I frequently communicate with the guy that runs Linux Academy and trust me, he is a die-hard

1009
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,260
Linux user. And what is so brilliant about what they have done is they have taken something

1010
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,000
that is so often a checkbox, a feature on all of the other training platforms and they

1011
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,280
have created an entire platform out of that. Virtual servers on demand, you have SSH access

1012
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,520
to, DNS makes it super easy to log in to. They can choose from 7 plus distribution,

1013
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,240
so your virtual server matches that, your courseware matches that. You can be like listener

1014
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,160
Ryan and totally get all of your downloadable comprehensive study guides and listen to them

1015
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,760
while you are in the shower, or Seth does in the shower. I mean, there are different

1016
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,320
ways. Or while you are driving, instructor help available on demand. They actually know

1017
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,680
what the hell they are talking about. They are watching the open source development and

1018
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,520
they are saying, okay, this is something we need to start creating courseware from. They

1019
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,080
had courseware on Docker before you knew what Docker was. The Linux Academy is tuned in

1020
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,660
and passionate about this stuff. That is that uncanny value that I talked about. They close

1021
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,480
that gap. I want you to go there and try them out because they are always getting better

1022
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,820
at adding new courseware, including new features. Man, in October, it was crazy at all the stuff

1023
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,940
they rolled out. They have some really good stuff, including real-time progress checking,

1024
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,760
some great professional development courses, better expanded nuggets, including, including,

1025
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,960
oh, man, the live events have been so great because you can sit there, you can be stuck

1026
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,800
on something, ask them the questions, and then get the answers. And then if you get

1027
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,280
like a little bit of down, the community is stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting community

1028
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
members.

1029
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
Yeah, and we are the best.

1030
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
I agree.

1031
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Very encouraging.

1032
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,600
I really do. And they also have all the stuff sort of attached to Linux. AWS and all of

1033
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,280
like Nginx and Python and Ruby and all that kind of stuff.

1034
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,200
I think that AWS one is really big, too, because that is one thing you see a lot. Enterprises

1035
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,200
love AWS, right?

1036
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Yeah, more than ever.

1037
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,600
But it's kind of, the pricing structure is a little confusing, especially if you're like

1038
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,240
a small end person or just trying to learn it at home. Linux Academy completely controls

1039
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
that cost for you.

1040
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
They manage all of it for you.

1041
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Right? It's amazing.

1042
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,480
It's just part of the subscription. You go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug. They just

1043
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,920
roll it right in there. The virtual machines they spin up, if they're on AWS, if they're

1044
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,640
on their own infrastructure, doesn't matter. They're honey badgers. Man, they just take

1045
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,760
care of it for you. And you get whatever distro you chose at the beginning of your course,

1046
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,120
that's the system you get. It makes a ton of sense. Even if you want to get into Android

1047
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,120
stuff.

1048
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,000
And then last but not least, if you're ready to go get those Red Hat certifications. There

1049
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,600
are the few certifications, after all of my years in the IT industry, that I feel is the

1050
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,960
Cisco certs and the Red Hat certs that make people go, what? Oh, you actually got that?

1051
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,960
Oh.

1052
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
You know what you're talking about.

1053
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,160
Yeah. Those are the certs, right? Man, they have so many great courses on the Red Hat

1054
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,480
stuff. It is part of their bread and butter. And I get a lot of great emails from people

1055
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,960
that have gone there, taken the Red Hat stuff, and gotten the certifications.

1056
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,840
It's kind of becoming the one go-to link. People are like, how do I learn Linux? I'm

1057
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,840
really interested, but what do I do? You're like, Linux Academy, man. Just check it out.

00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,360
Check it out. LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged. Get our awesome discount. And a big thank

1059
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,880
you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program. LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1060
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,160
All right, Wes, are you ready to... Oh, and by the way, a special mention to the bad news

1061
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
about ours.

1062
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,160
Bad news.

1063
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:07,680
The bad news about Steam Machines is spreading. It does have some impact. VentureBeat has

1064
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,640
a story about how Falcon PC is...

1065
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,960
This one gets close to home, too.

1066
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,000
I know. They've canceled their Steam Machine. They've canceled it.

1067
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,560
Falcon Northwest and an Oregon company.

1068
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:23,160
Yeah. Oh, literally cuts... Yeah. That does. It hurts, Wes. It hurts. So it is having some

1069
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,360
impact. The bad press is... We talk about it from like, oh, this isn't good. Well, it

1070
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,640
actually is making a bit of a difference, at least. So yeah, we'll have links to all

1071
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,840
of that stuff, all of that shenanigans in the show notes if you guys want to go read

1072
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
about that.

1073
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,280
But I want to shift gears for a moment and have a chance for our listeners in the Muppet

1074
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,800
Room to jump in. Last week, we said, well, let's kind of get an idea of how Tumbleweed

1075
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,320
is landing amongst the audience. So we put a call out there and said, if you've been

1076
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,840
running Tumbleweed and want to come on to her show, give us your ideas.

1077
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,080
And so here we are, one week later, and we've got a good assembly here in our room. And

1078
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,720
we've even got a good thread going in the Linux Action Show subreddit. Electrical... Electrician.

1079
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,040
Electrical Magnition. I don't know how you say that. How do you say that?

1080
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,240
Electrician? I'm not sure. But regardless, the feedback's great.

1081
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,240
You sound like an idiot.

1082
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,240
Electrician.

1083
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,240
That's me. That's me.

1084
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,240
There you go.

1085
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,480
But there's no M in there.

1086
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,680
I know. No, you've just got to emphasize the...

1087
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,160
Electrician? I don't know. I'm going to give up.

1088
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,640
No, what you do is you double down on that G. All right, so you just checked in on the

1089
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,800
latest episode of Linux Unplugged and were stoked to see a segment on my distro of choice.

1090
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:33,320
And we have 26 comments coming in on this thread. And I'm actually kind of excited to

1091
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,640
say I want to start with Mr. Brown, R. Brown, from the SUSE project. Kind of get an idea

1092
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,600
of how Leap has been received from the end users. And then jump in from the rest of the

1093
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,480
Mamba room there. So Mr. Brown, tell me about... What are we? Two weeks? Three weeks in

1094
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,280
from the Leap release? I can't remember now. What's the reception been? Any gotchas? Any

1095
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,240
surprises? And any interesting tidbits to share with us?

1096
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,120
Yeah, it's been 14 days. It's been really good, actually. So I mean, this is all a bit

1097
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,360
of an experiment for us, you know. Treading new ground, mixing an enterprise distro with

1098
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:09,920
a community one. And the feedback's been great. The community has been really receptive. Lots

1099
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,720
of people trying it. Lots of good feedback. Lots of good feedback from the press. I haven't

1100
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,640
read a bad review yet. And now I've said that, someone's going to write one.

1101
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:27,040
Right, yeah. So, you know, 14 days into it is not too long, but has anything sort of

1102
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,400
caught you by surprise? Or has anything already kind of been like, okay, we're going to have

1103
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,040
to address this? Any kind of like, might have to shift strategy here?

1104
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Real life adjustments.

1105
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,800
Yeah, it's been interesting with the feedback with our choice of versions for things like

1106
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:48,520
GNOME and KDE, where there's some people who are really happy with KDE 5.4 in there. Some

1107
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,200
would prefer to have KDE 4. Some are wondering, like, when are you going to have 5.5? There's

1108
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,760
that whole question of like, how fast are we going to move that stuff? And I haven't

1109
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,920
got a straight answer for it. I mean, there's so many different moving parts of like, how

1110
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,720
fast will the base system move? How much does the community want to maintain it? How much

1111
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:16,120
do we replace in the base system? All that kind of fun stuff. So that's going to be a

1112
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,720
good discussion point for 42.2. Same goes for GNOME. I mean, we had a lot of feedback

1113
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,760
of like, why did you guys put 3.16 in there instead of 3.18?

1114
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,160
Yeah, yeah. I mean, everybody wants the latest and greatest GNOME.

1115
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
Always.

1116
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,320
Always, yeah. Very good. So Gabriel, I know I've been watching you in the subreddit for

1117
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,800
a while now. I know you've been a user of OpenSUSE and jumped on the leap since the

1118
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,240
beta milestone. So what have been your impressions, Gabriel?

1119
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:50,880
Oh, yes. So my impression is very good. I've started from beta and I saw the review you

1120
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,800
made on the show.

1121
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
A few weeks ago, yeah.

1122
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:05,920
Yes, it was very good. I've tried both KDE and GNOME. On KDE, just a couple of freeze

1123
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:15,040
at the beginning but after the first few updates, everything was very good. GNOME is good too.

1124
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:23,860
So I'm pretty happy. As you know from everybody knows, I'm a supporter of OpenSUSE. So I like

1125
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:32,400
it very much. I'm using it since one year ago. Probably this is the reason why for me,

1126
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,560
leap is awesome.

1127
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:42,000
So what's the main thing about leap that's awesome?

1128
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,240
The stability. I like the idea of having a project that has a professional-maintained

1129
01:00:51,240 --> 01:01:00,000
core plus a community that is giving the, let me say, new things. It's not as new as

1130
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,400
Tumbleweed or Arch but it is new.

1131
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:12,320
Yeah, and Tyler, you've been using leap for a past week and so, what are your thoughts

1132
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,600
on the KDE version?

1133
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:21,520
So far, I've been really enjoying Plasma 5. I've had a couple of issues I've run into.

1134
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:27,640
There are things about Plasma 5 that still feel a bit incomplete compared to 4. I did

1135
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:33,400
actually have an issue where an update actually made the policy kit quite restrictive on the

1136
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,400
desktop.

1137
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,280
Oh, that's a little troubling. Tell me about that.

1138
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:44,240
So after an update, I had an issue where the policy kit would not allow the applets to,

1139
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,760
let's say, go check for updates or I couldn't just use the applet to change my network.

1140
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:54,920
I actually had to go and change the policy kit myself to allow myself to do that.

1141
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
That is probably...

1142
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
Those are the things you don't...

1143
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,800
Might be a bug. Might be a bug. Wimpy, you've been running leap for the last week. Tell

1144
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
me about that.

1145
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:12,240
Yeah, I installed leap on my test machine, which is a fairly old ThinkPad T61P. And I

1146
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:20,520
found a lot about leap to like. I particularly like the way the default installer sets up

1147
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:30,520
the disk partitioning with the root file system using a rather complex structure of B3FS sub-volume

1148
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,520
volumes.

1149
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,440
It's very impressive what they do by default.

1150
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:43,600
I think that's a really smart move. And I imagine is what is powering Snap... Is it

1151
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Snapper?

1152
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Yeah.

1153
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:52,320
So as you do your package installs and package updates, you get these snapshots before and

1154
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:58,520
after and you can what have you. So I really like those features. I think that's very elegantly

1155
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
integrated.

1156
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,680
I also installed the KDE version. So I know traditionally KDE has sort of been the desktop,

1157
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:11,800
the showcase desktop for OpenSUSE. And I haven't really run KDE much. And I really like the

1158
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:19,000
way that that's presented in OpenSUSE because from my point of view, it's a very sane, usable

1159
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,360
KDE setup. You know, it's instantly familiar, usable and unconventional.

1160
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:34,240
And I ran into a few sort of things that made me look at it sideways a couple of times,

1161
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:41,000
but nothing awful or horrible. I was really very impressed. I thought it was quite elegant.

1162
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,280
Now Heavens asks a good question. I want to come back to this for a second. But Barbara

1163
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,000
Wobble in the chat room says he's been using Leap on his home server with a few Docker

1164
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,680
containers running W and Jesse in the container. And he's happy with it so far. He says that

1165
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,360
one of the nice things is that the Ncurses interface to Yast makes it great for headless.

1166
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,640
Yes, I love that.

1167
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,680
Yes, I really do too. Here's Heaven's question. And I'm wondering if anybody in the Mumble

1168
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:07,040
Room has any thoughts on this. And maybe Wimpy, I can start with you. How would you say, Wimpy,

1169
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,160
how would you say Leap is for brand new users, like new or newest users to Linux? Do you

1170
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,000
think it's a suitable desktop OS?

1171
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,160
Once it's installed, it is. But if you've got to install it yourself, maybe not.

1172
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:27,760
Why do you say that?

1173
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,660
For somebody that's familiar with Linux installers, then you're not going to have any difficulty

1174
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:41,080
with this. It's going to be largely familiar. But for example, when I started the install,

1175
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:46,800
I've got Intel wireless something. I forget what model of chipset. But in the installer,

1176
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,560
the Intel firmware for the wireless chipset is not available. So it sort of nags you that

1177
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,960
the firmware isn't available. So I just sort of, you know, skip by that and ignore it.

1178
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,760
But then that's strange on a four gig ISO that the firmware is not available in the

1179
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,360
live session. But then when you've installed the OS, the firmware is clearly there because

1180
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:12,240
the Wi Fi works perfectly post install. But some of some of the way you navigate through

1181
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,680
the installer isn't super intuitive. You know, if you've not done a Linux install before,

1182
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,160
I think you'd feel a bit out of your depth if you've done any sort of Linux install.

1183
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,640
I think I would agree with that. I would be comfortable with it.

1184
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,960
I would say that even just I was trying to download it earlier in the week, and it took

1185
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,720
a good like three click throughs to get to a page where I could actually download it

1186
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,360
easily off the Suse website as well, which was a little like, if you're dedicated, if

1187
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,680
you want to do this, it's fine. But yeah, it's not like the one click link. Yeah, yeah,

1188
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
that makes sense.

1189
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,680
We fixed that.

1190
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,680
Okay.

1191
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,680
That's perfect.

1192
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,680
Good. Thank you.

1193
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,680
Two clicks is much better.

1194
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,680
I can handle two.

1195
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,200
Yeah. And I think 33% less clicking.

1196
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Exactly.

1197
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Exactly.

1198
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,680
33% less matters. Yeah, I wonder I wonder if that actually stops some people from downloading

1199
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,400
it might have, I suppose, in the past.

1200
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,240
Just because I'm used to like Ubuntu, right? It's like right on the screen. You're like,

1201
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,520
Oh, click download. It's great.

1202
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,040
So Kitson, you you kind of like the installer, though, don't you?

1203
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:16,560
I like the installer. I've always liked the OpenSuse installer. I've actually found the

1204
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:23,280
Ubuntu installers and whatnot to be too simplistic. And some of their options I've noticed have

1205
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:29,400
been dangerous. For instance, let's say you have an existing LVM encrypted setup on the

1206
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:35,760
disk and you don't want to wipe it with Ubuntu too bad, you're probably going to have that

1207
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,880
wiped. With OpenSuse, I could set that up. I could give it the password. It'll mount

1208
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,160
it. I could say I want to wipe this partition in that partition, but I want to leave everything

1209
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,120
else the same. And I think that that's a big difference there.

1210
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:56,960
Do you think you can do that on Ubuntu? You can. There are manual partitioning options.

1211
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,360
But if you if you just go next, next, next, finish. Yeah, you might have a bad time if

1212
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,800
you had something that you really wanted to keep.

1213
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:10,800
Yeah. I wonder, is it really? I feel like I feel like the OpenSuse installer lets you

1214
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,600
go more out of the box if you want. But if you're willing to stay within certain parameters,

1215
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,280
all the installers are kind of a wash.

1216
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,280
Yes.

1217
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Yeah. Wimpy, you wanted to comment on Yast.

1218
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,720
Yeah, I mean, it's been such a long time since I've installed OpenSuse and seriously taken

1219
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:31,240
a look at it. Yast has actually changed considerably. I think it's been rewritten. That probably

1220
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:38,520
gives you an idea how long it is since I last looked at it. And I think where OpenSuse shines

1221
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:46,380
is some of those Yast modules for configuring things like your NIST client or authenticating

1222
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:52,480
with a Windows domain controller. That that's where you see the sort of Yast credentials

1223
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,940
coming through on the desk. And there's lots of little things like that that you don't

1224
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:04,440
find in the other distributions as readily. Certainly not so much sort of out of the box

1225
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:10,800
install features. So there's a lot of good stuff tucked away in Yast. It's a little bit

1226
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,480
of a mixed bag still. You know, there's some of the Yast modules are a little bit confusing

1227
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,800
to look at and then other modules are just amazing. I forget which one what it's called,

1228
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,720
but there's one that you can view your your disks and your partitions and your layouts

1229
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,840
in a in a whole load of different ways. And there's one that maps the the physical devices

1230
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,840
and the partitions to the volumes. And I just thought that was terrific. You know, and that

1231
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,980
actually is very useful for a new user to actually get an easy to understand visual

1232
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:45,960
representation of how their data is laid out on their disk. So I thought Yast was pretty

1233
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,400
cool. Yeah, I agree. I that's that's a real area where you can underscore it to also setting

1234
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:57,720
up like Xen or KVM. Yep. Super easy. Yeah. Yeah, that was that was really nice, actually.

1235
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,880
Yeah. And then the nice butterfs support with the virtualization. Like those two go hand

1236
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,880
in hand with snapper built in. So when you install a package, you're getting snapshots.

1237
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,800
I mean, it's real slick. It's real slick. Yeah. And that's something about the btfs

1238
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,360
support quickly. Yeah, it was it was something that we kind of forgot to talk about a lot

1239
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:18,080
with with leaps release. Someone mentioned it already with the different sub volumes

1240
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,800
that were setting up by default. Part of that is to shield stuff from snapper. So things

1241
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,640
like your home directory don't get eaten up into all those snapshots. Yeah. But we've

1242
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:34,820
also started using the non copy on write attribute for certain key areas. So things like your

1243
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,960
database folders, libvote folders, all that kind of junk where they can have big files

1244
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:47,760
with lots of nasty IO, you can still use that on btfs, it won't do copy on writes the performances,

1245
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:53,560
you know, ext4, like, yeah, it really seems like the benefits of openSUSE, a sort of embracing

1246
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,920
butterfs before everybody else are paying off. I really appreciate that they are doing

1247
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,240
this to their show. Yeah, showcasing how you can write there's some places where it's not

1248
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,800
ready. Yeah, it is where it is. It is something I touched on specifically. I remember I spent

1249
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,560
some time talking about this on my review on the Linux action show is that it is I think

1250
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,920
the most intelligent breakdown of sub volumes like I mentioned in the chat room that Postgres

1251
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,320
is broken out to another example where maybe copy on write isn't doesn't make a lot of

1252
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,080
sense or your virtual machines copy on write doesn't make a lot of sense. And it is the

1253
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,440
number one thing that can hit your performance on a butterfs file system. And so the fact

1254
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,360
that SUSE has thought about that, I think very much shows that they've been, you know,

1255
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,680
they've been trying this for a little while. And Wimpy, in that kind of sense, I agree

1256
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,720
with you. It's not necessarily a new user. I mean, it can be a new user's distro, but

1257
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,400
it also can be a power user's distro, too. Yeah, I think so. I know if you're if you're

1258
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:48,080
a an admin, more more an admin than a developer, I would say I think open SUSE is a is a nice

1259
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,080
distro. Yeah, it seems like a great place to host some hosts and deployments. Yeah,

1260
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,440
I'm wondering if we'll start seeing it take off in like the VPS and cloud sphere as much

1261
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:04,440
that would really be big. Yeah, yeah. We already have some hosts already offering leap as part

1262
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,820
of the hosting package. Yeah, leap, especially, it seems like yeah, you kind of got the stable

1263
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,680
is about once a year, I can handle a refresh, right? But like, I don't, maybe I don't need

1264
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:17,640
to micromanage it more. Right. But it gets, you know, security spot. Yeah. Dasani, you've

1265
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,600
been using tumbleweed and stable. And they are sharing the same home directory. Tell

1266
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,160
me about that. And has it blown up in your face yet? Nope, not yet. Yeah, for the home

1267
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:38,520
directory, or actually, what's the one you use for the robust one? XFS? Yes, that one.

1268
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,640
I use XFS in the home directory and I share. So tumbleweed can get however unstable I know

1269
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:51,680
I can always roll it back. Or if it gets corrupted, I can always kill it. But also I have BTRFS

1270
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:59,600
running my stable, I guess leap is what it's called now. And that is got all my games on

1271
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:06,080
it. So the kernel stays stable, the proprietary drivers, unfortunately, but yeah, they stay

1272
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:14,600
the same. And so I can play Borderlands 2 on stable and runs beautifully. And I can

1273
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,440
if I want to play with like, builder, it will run beautifully as well. And I don't have

1274
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,840
to wait till next year. Yeah, that's a good point. And Wimpy, you had a great question

1275
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:32,920
for our Brown about rolling distros. I'd love to hear it. Yeah, I saw the Linux voice, voice

1276
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,800
of the masses, the question asking about I think it was something to do with rolling

1277
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:44,920
releases, I can't remember was it containerization. But I saw Richard comment on there that he

1278
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:51,560
had a feeling that rolling release was sort of vital to the future of Linux distro at

1279
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,960
that point. Yeah, that was from one of my slide decks. I have a lovely slide that I

1280
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,320
kind of throw in there to troll people where it says, yeah, rolling releases of the future

1281
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,720
of Linux, but I do honestly believe it. I mean, if you look at the pace of how upstream

1282
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:11,240
stuff is changing, the old distribution model just can't keep up, you know, with kernel

1283
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:17,240
changes, base system changes, everything just moving too fast. And in many cases, like a

1284
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,480
lot of the, if you look at things like system D, gnome, etc, you know, you need to move

1285
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:29,160
the base system in order to move the user space. So long term, and I'm in cases of,

1286
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,440
you know, enterprise, maybe we're talking a decade from now, in other cases, maybe five

1287
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:41,400
years, whatever. But I really think rolling releases, moving everything at a faster pace,

1288
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:46,160
and then worrying about things like integration and testing and containerization and whatever,

1289
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:50,920
is how we're going to see distros having to evolve, because otherwise, we just can't keep

1290
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:55,960
up. We're out of date by the time we ship. Yeah, very much. I completely agree. Yeah,

1291
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,760
I do too, actually. Popi, do you want to expand on that? No. Yeah, I don't really need to

1292
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,120
either. I completely agree as well. Like, I mean, we just heard from the beginning of

1293
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,880
this conversation, why are you shipping gnome 316? Even Microsoft is doing that with the

1294
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,760
new Windows 10, right? Yeah, I think the new expectation is, well, I've heard about this

1295
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,640
really awesome thing on that blog, and now I want it. I want it. Why can't I get it?

1296
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,720
I want it. I want it right now. And yeah, that's, yeah. So that's the Linux community

1297
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,760
in a nutshell. Well, you know, I mean, that's sort of put in the worst light. But the reality

1298
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,480
is there is really smart people making really awesome code that's available for free that

1299
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:36,280
makes your life better. And yeah, you do want it. Because it makes crap easier, and it makes

1300
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,000
crap better. And you don't want to have to deal with installing a whole bunch of stuff

1301
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,600
or dealing with conflicts. You just want it. And you know, you look at XGD app, and you

1302
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,880
look at Docker, and you look at all this different stuff that is talking about shipping applications

1303
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,080
and containers, and it seems like that's already a foregone conclusion as well. And that sort

1304
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:56,040
of isolates you from the touch and go of a rolling release. So we're kind of coming upon

1305
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,560
this problem with two different solutions at the same time. And I think that Tumbleweed

1306
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,420
is a, you know, it's a very specific, unique approach to this particular problem. And it's

1307
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:09,200
one that I've kind of fantasized about for years. So it's really cool to see it actually

1308
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,960
ship. So yeah, anybody else before we wrap up have any other comments on OpenSUSE Leap

1309
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,360
or things of this nature?

1310
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:23,200
Yeah, one thing that I really do like about OpenSUSE as well that I've noticed is that

1311
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,980
pretty much you can customize it from the get go to be your own distribution. Yeah,

1312
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:33,480
look at the way the software manager works and everything. You can get the network installed.

1313
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,880
You could click GNOME, for instance, as your default desktop. Then you can click software

1314
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:43,520
at the summary, and you can go in and you could say, I don't want this, but I want this,

1315
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:49,040
that, and that. And then all that stuff gets uploaded there, and it's, you know, you're

1316
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,800
not wasting any bandwidth or anything like that.

1317
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,560
Yeah, you know, and it's funny because that's how it used to be. So you used to do it in

1318
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:01,280
distros. I want the KDE desktop environment. I want the web browsing packages and all of

1319
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,280
that stuff.

1320
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,920
I can imagine the old Debian menu right now.

1321
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,760
Right. And then Ubuntu came along, and it's like, well, we'll just pick all the best stuff

1322
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,480
for you by default. And that kind of became the trend for a while. And now there's like,

1323
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,480
oh, I kind of like being able to choose. I mean, there's a middle ground there, too.

1324
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,440
And I was going to say, I thought what you were going to mention was the build studio

1325
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:21,600
because that's really where you can customize. Yeah. If you guys out there listening to episode

1326
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,960
119 and want to share your thoughts on Leap, go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com or go to

1327
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,480
jupyterbroadcasting.com. We really do check it. Please do.

1328
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:34,160
And it's been interesting to see. I specifically think they're doing something right here,

1329
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:39,540
them being the OpenSUSE project, because without question, without question, it has gotten

1330
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:45,740
more and more attention in our community over the last year. And there was a point in time

1331
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,200
where we were not talking about it very much anymore, OpenSUSE.

1332
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,200
It's kind of the unmentioned third player.

1333
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:57,640
And I think this is regearing in a way that much more matches the expectations and desires

1334
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,720
of today's Linux user. I think it's fascinating. And I think it's also something that OpenSUSE

1335
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,580
was in the best position to deliver on. Arch can't do it. They're too far into the very

1336
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,080
rolling release. Ubuntu can't do it. They've got their system. Fedora can't do it. They're

1337
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
trying to reform it, but they can't quite do it.

1338
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,800
And really, you look back at it now, and it almost seems like, well, yeah, of course it

1339
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,000
had to be OpenSUSE. But at the time before they made this leap, you couldn't see it.

1340
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,600
But now you look back on it and go, oh, they're in the perfect position. They have the perfect

1341
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,200
tool set. And they're ready to go. I feel like it hits that sweet spot, too, where you

1342
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,440
have people, maybe they're in our community, they use Arch at home. But at work, they've

1343
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,280
got CentOS or RHEL deployed, and they're a little like, oh, this is so old. I keep having

1344
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,320
to deploy my own, configure things from source because it isn't in my repo. And they'll be

1345
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,520
like, when we refresh our server, what's the next thing we're using? Maybe it's OpenSUSE.

1346
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,720
Maybe. Maybe. You get that live kernel patching in there. You get that, you know, whoo-wee!

1347
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,160
I like that. I like that. All right. Well, okay, last chance. Are there any closing statements

1348
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:59,160
from the Mumba Room on OpenSUSE and Leap going once? Yeah, go ahead.

1349
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,520
Leap is now track...

1350
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,160
Yeah, go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead.

1351
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:12,000
Leap is now being... is now tracking SUSE, which is the thing why they're calling it

1352
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,760
Leap now. So that's the thing. You can now cleanly... Leap is the ambition. Transition

1353
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,240
from Leap to straight up SUSE, if you want.

1354
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,080
Yeah. And I know there's one other person trying to jump in there. I didn't catch who

1355
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,000
it was, but go ahead.

1356
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,520
So yeah, Gabriel. So one of the good things I like in OpenSUSE Project is that we have

1357
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
both.

1358
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,520
Right.

1359
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:46,520
Stable and rolling together. So in a few clicks, I can move from stable to rolling using zippered

1360
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
up.

1361
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Yeah, it seems to be...

1362
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,880
That's a very good point, actually, because it's the only distribution doing that.

1363
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,640
Yeah. And I don't want to give the impression that you're going to have zero problems when

1364
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,280
you make that transition. Like, you know, your NVIDIA driver might start complaining,

1365
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,080
but it is pretty damn neat. It is pretty cool. And if that kind of stuff doesn't matter to

1366
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:12,480
you, it is an incredible ability to make that switch. It is worth mentioning. Yeah. And

1367
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,880
I don't think anybody else is quite doing it like this with the complete picture. So

1368
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,440
it's pretty exciting to see it happen.

1369
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,400
And with the pedigree that they have.

1370
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,880
That too, right? That's also a really good point.

1371
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,880
It's not an upstart.

1372
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,880
And the brand.

1373
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Yeah, right.

1374
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,400
Yeah, right. Yeah, yes. It's not some distro that nobody's running.

1375
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,960
That won't be here in a year or two years, right?

1376
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,520
Yeah, very much so. Very much so. Yeah, R Brown, you want to make a quick comment on

1377
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,040
the migration. Go ahead. I'm curious about that.

1378
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,740
Just hopping from leap to tumbleweed. When you're doing it with just the official repositories,

1379
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:47,100
we test that as like a standard OpenQA thing. So like every time there's a tumbleweed update,

1380
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,560
we see that you can get from leap to there and back. And in fact, back we don't test

1381
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,320
that much, but we know Zippa does it with its eyes closed, or you can just use Snap

1382
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,320
it.

1383
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Nice.

1384
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,480
You can always hop over, try it, roll it back, and everything's wonderful and done.

1385
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,480
Easy peasy.

1386
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,640
Ooh, that's really cool. That is really cool.

1387
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,640
You almost take it for granted.

1388
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,640
You almost do, right?

1389
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,320
And we've got a few things from the SLE guys. If some of the stuff they're slipping in their

1390
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:14,480
new service packs, which I'm really keen to throw into 42.2 to make that even slicker.

1391
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,640
What would it take to make that actually happen? Is it just somebody saying, I'll do it? Or

1392
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,920
what? Does somebody get assigned that job? How does that happen?

1393
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,840
That's just going to be figuring out a few differences between how our infrastructure

1394
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,480
works and how the enterprise infrastructure works. Because there's things like repo metadata

1395
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:37,640
where they can say, okay, this release can upgrade to that release and that stuff. And

1396
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,520
we haven't got that stuff plumbed into our new service yet.

1397
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,800
What does it feel like to you, being a bit out on the edge, saying, here's the distro,

1398
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,760
it's released, now we have thousands of people using it, but we don't actually have that

1399
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,520
particular question answered yet?

1400
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,520
Which particular question?

1401
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,520
Sorry.

1402
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,960
How exactly you might take something from Sles, SUSE Enterprise Linux Server, a great

1403
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:05,320
feature, and move it down to Leap. It seems like that's going to be a cornerstone feature

1404
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,600
of Leap, but maybe not something that's totally been figured out yet, even though it's now

1405
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,240
out there for users. Does that feel sort of like, well, we're just kind of going by the

1406
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,840
seat of our pants and we're just going to figure it out as we go, because we know that's

1407
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,880
the best way to do it? Or what is your impression sitting there in the project when there's

1408
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,120
real questions about how do you migrate something like that, like a piece of technology from

1409
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:31,560
Upstream or Sles, and push it out to Leap? And you know you want to do it, and you've

1410
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,120
even kind of publicly committed to doing it, but there's not actually a process or a plan

1411
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,680
to do that thing.

1412
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:43,000
99 times out of 100, SUSE are doing that as part of the daily job anyway. So even when

1413
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,200
they're working on SLE, they, you know, engineering at SUSE, work on Tumbleweed at the same time.

1414
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,640
If they're doing a new thing in SLE, in fact, I think it's still a policy in many cases

1415
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,160
where like their internal commit to SLE will get rejected if there isn't a matching one

1416
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,160
to Tumbleweed.

1417
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,160
Wow.

1418
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
Okay.

1419
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:06,000
So that, you know, Upstream first is a common policy. In the case of Leap or stuff like

1420
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,480
this where it's kind of falling through the cracks because it's not a code thing but kind

1421
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:17,240
of an infrastructure thing, we'll figure it out. I mean it's just a case of timing, syncing,

1422
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,280
talking to each other. I'm sure we'll come up with a solution.

1423
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:25,600
Yeah. Yeah. It is an interesting time. Well, I'm glad that, thank you everybody who showed

1424
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,080
up to chat about this. Thank you R. Brown and everybody who's been talking about this.

1425
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,880
It is really, really, really cool to see this kind of, see a lot more passion and interest

1426
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,880
pick up.

1427
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:34,880
There's some great momentum here.

1428
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,280
I want to tell you about something else that's got some great passion. Ting, my mobile service

1429
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,320
provider and mobile that makes sense. Go to linux.ting.com. Why? Because you like putting

1430
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,400
Linux in your history bar. I know you got RedTube in there and stuff like that. Now

1431
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:50,800
you can put Linux in your history bar. linux.ting.com. Get $25 off your first Ting device or $25 in

1432
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,020
service credit if you bring your own device like I did. And $25 paid for my first month

1433
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:59,520
of Ting right off the top. It was nuts. Ting is mobile that makes sense because you just

1434
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:06,760
pay for what you use. There's no contract, no determination fee, boomsies and even because

1435
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,720
they hate contracts with a passion will help you get out of your existing contract with

1436
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,680
their ETF relief program. I love that. That's sweet. Go to linux.ting.com right now to support

1437
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,120
this show. Keep us on the air please and also get yourself that discount. Take a look at

1438
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,320
some of their different devices there. They have a bunch of good stuff and also when you

1439
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,600
go to linux.ting.com, I want you to try out their savings calculator. Plug in your stuff

1440
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,160
and see if it makes a good sense. Literally, does it make sense? Are you going to save

1441
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:34,480
some sense? Try it out. I got an email today. I wonder if he's in the chat room. I don't

1442
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,160
see him in there. I don't see him in there but I got an email today where he's like,

1443
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:44,760
you know I had a carrier charging me a ton of money. My bill was over $80 after taxes.

1444
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,880
Switched to Ting, $30. Same with me. I got three lines about the same story. It's really

1445
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,320
nice. Go to linux.ting.com to get started. They got two different networks, GSM and CDMA.

1446
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,240
You can choose from some more devices than ever you can bring. And when you bring your

1447
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:01,720
own device, then it's really incredibly, incredibly valuable. But if you go to linux.ting.com,

1448
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:05,680
you can also get $25 off a brand new device that's unlocked. No contract. You pay for

1449
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,920
what you use. They got an awesome dashboard and really awesome customer service. And Ting's

1450
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:16,600
all about it. They're not just about bucking the trend on contracts and early termination

1451
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,080
fees. They're also about cutting the cord and all that kind of stuff. They have some

1452
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,960
great posts about cutting the cord recently and keeping the content. Cut the network but

1453
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:29,000
keep the content. They got a post about that. And then you got to love Kyra. You got to

1454
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,280
love Kyra. She's posting up app pics over on the Ting blog and she's got one for your

1455
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,760
faces right now. It's called Swappa. What's your phone worth? I'm Kyra and this is the

1456
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:44,160
Ting app of the week. Swappa is an online marketplace where you can buy and sell used

1457
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,560
devices. If you've ever wondered how much you'd get for your phone if you were to sell

1458
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:51,560
it, this is the app that will tell you. While you can't buy or sell directly through the

1459
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,320
app, it's a perfect price checker and the first of its kind. Just tap to get a realistic

1460
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,320
valuation of your used smartphone. Here you can select a specific model and view a pricing

1461
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,640
chart of your phone over its lifetime. Tap the orange circle in the bottom right to check

1462
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,400
out other devices too. You can use the search bar or search by manufacturers and providers

1463
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,160
like Ting. If you're thinking about an upgrade or just wondering how much you could get for

1464
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,600
your smartphone, Swappa price is worth checking out. Grab the app for free on Android. You

1465
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,520
can find the link in the description below. Thanks for watching and see you soon.

1466
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,520
Thank you, Kyra.

1467
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:29,280
Linux.ting.com. Thank you, Kyra. That's right. Linux.ting.com. Go there and try it and support

1468
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,560
the show just by checking them out. Linux.ting.com. It's pretty cool. And those are some good

1469
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,400
apps and we've had some previous ones before and Kyra's always, I always enjoy having Kyra

1470
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,960
come on. I wanted to have the 12 days of Kyra in December but I haven't been able to make

1471
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,560
it work out yet. Yeah, but I haven't tried it yet.

1472
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,080
Linux.ting.com. Go check out Ting. It really is mobile that makes sense. You support this

1473
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:53,280
show and you finally get out of that really crappy contract where they totally own you.

1474
01:25:53,280 --> 01:26:01,080
Linux.ting.com. Wes, I am so effing hoping that in a couple of weeks I'll be sitting

1475
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:06,720
here giving you a review of my Libre or Librem. I don't even remember anymore. Librem. Librem

1476
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:15,960
Prism 15. The Librem Prism 15. Purism. Purism. Thank you. Thank you. 15 will be shipping

1477
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,760
in phases. 10 pieces of light gray. What is that? 10 PCs? Really? Only 10? Already shipping

1478
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:26,360
another 10? Either way, I should be getting my Librem or Purism or whatever it is. I can't

1479
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,400
even remember because I bought it so long ago. Someday. I should be getting my ultimate

1480
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:38,240
Linux laptop soon to review. This is exciting. I actually am not that super excited anymore.

1481
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,440
I was even as... You don't even seem like you believe it's happening. I don't. Because

1482
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,560
it's been delayed twice now and I actually needed it. The first time I got delayed, the

1483
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,720
first delay was I desperately needed a new laptop because of a work thing we were doing

1484
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:58,120
and I didn't. I like how you say work. We don't know what it is you do for work. Like

1485
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:03,680
a work thing, not this radio station. You know, podcasting. I know, right? Yeah. Well,

1486
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,580
the thing about it was, because I've just been thinking about it, my window of opportunity

1487
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:14,400
for getting this laptop has passed and I kind of regret... Now you're getting an Oryx, so...

1488
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:19,120
Right. I want... Actually, now I want an Oryx. Exactly. And I kind of regret funding this

1489
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,960
thing. I mean, I wanted to fund and I wanted to get behind something that was the ultimate

1490
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:28,260
Linux laptop. Nice, a MacBook competitor that you can install a bunch of distros on, had

1491
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,440
physical switch buttons for the webcam and things like that. You know what, though? It's

1492
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:39,160
going to be the end of the year soon and I've moved on and I'm really kind of bummed that

1493
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,080
I got caught up in this. I wanted to do this for a review and so I'm hoping that once this

1494
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:48,360
thing shows up, my enthusiasm returns, but at this point... At this point, it's a little

1495
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:55,200
hmm. Yeah, it really will depend on what shows up at your doorstep and how you like it. Wimpy,

1496
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,080
I have not read the recent reviews. What have you seen? I'm not going to say. I'm going

1497
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:05,040
to let you read them for yourself. Oh, no. Secret, secret. It's not secret. If you search

1498
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:11,720
around you'll find it. I just don't want to go down as a purism naysayer. Well, that says

1499
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:18,160
it. Despite the fact that I am. All right. See, when you say that, I think I'm going

1500
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,720
to read the reviews and I'm going to be disappointed is what I'm taking away as an impression here

1501
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:31,280
and I don't like that. Oh, man. All right. And I don't know. What should I have done?

1502
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,880
As the idealist Linux user, should I not have crowdfunded this? It seems like this was a

1503
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:42,040
good honest effort to try to fund. I think you had a duty to fund it. You know, with

1504
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,960
the weight of the Linux action show behind you, this was a big initiative, wasn't it?

1505
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:52,280
It was a bold statement that purism made. You had to back it. You had to get the equipment

1506
01:28:52,280 --> 01:29:02,280
and you have to review it. The thing is, is that it was a year ago when it was first tabled

1507
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:07,960
and you can't know a year ago how long this crowdfunding campaign is going to take to

1508
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:14,680
turn into a reality. I think you've done the right thing in terms of, you know, for the

1509
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,640
Linux action show, you've done the right thing. Whether or not it was the right thing for

1510
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,200
you to do personally or not, you'll be able to tell us when you get the unit and review

1511
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,200
it.

1512
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,200
Yeah, that is exactly what it is.

1513
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,520
Either way, I think we're going to get a really good Chris Last rant.

1514
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:34,040
You know, I've interviewed the founder and I've met him in person. I know he even knows

1515
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:39,600
which laptop is mine. He knows which one is mine. I'm like, okay, I feel like I should

1516
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:46,280
be excited here, but it was a year ago. To be honest with you, like Wimpy said, the enthusiasm

1517
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:52,160
personally has dwindled and professionally I'm still interested. Are you amazed? I don't

1518
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,240
know if people can hear it in the background right here. I'm going to turn on my microphone

1519
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,880
just for a second. Hold on. Hold on.

1520
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,720
It sounds like a fan, really almost.

1521
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,720
Yes, the wind.

1522
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,720
Are you in a plane?

1523
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:06,800
Yeah, it is really, it is really windy here. I'm amazed that we haven't been knocked offline

1524
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,800
yet.

1525
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,520
No, it's really, it's really windy here as well.

1526
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,520
Yeah, I know.

1527
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,520
Really, really windy.

1528
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,960
Yeah, I think actually about the same speeds. It is, what about it? What was it? 110 km?

1529
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,480
It was, yeah, it was really...

1530
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,520
We do miles an hour here. You don't have to convert it.

1531
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,280
Oh, you do? Okay. All right. Very nice. Impressive. I think we're about 60, 65 miles per hour

1532
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,600
wind here. It is really...

1533
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1534
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,000
I was so proud of myself for having the conversion.

1535
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,760
I was. That was impressive. You've been staring at your car dial, haven't you?

1536
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,680
No, I Googled it. Yeah. All right. Well, I'll let you guys know if I get it because they're

1537
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,800
supposed to be shipping Librem 15 units with dark gray coming with 4K screens. I believe

1538
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,360
mine is 1080p.

1539
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,280
You should just put this here where this Windows laptop is, just for my sake, really.

1540
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,240
Right. I know, really. I'm amazed that it hasn't been deactivated yet.

1541
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,360
No, it still shows the watermark.

1542
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,560
Wow. I almost feel like I want to keep... I feel like Kramer right now. I want to keep

1543
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,120
going until the power knocks us offline.

1544
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,840
I know, right? How long can we go?

1545
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,840
Right. I feel like we're...

1546
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,840
Love the marathon.

1547
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,400
We're running on fumes right now. It's damn impressive.

1548
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,960
It's a good idea for a larger show.

1549
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,480
Yeah. All right. Well, we'll wrap it up there while we... So that way we can actually record

1550
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,600
the entire episode and not lose the file. That would probably be a good idea. That would

1551
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,360
probably be good because I have lost so many episodes in the past that I can't bear to

1552
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,360
lose another one. But I would love to have you join us live. Go over to jblive.tv on

1553
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,840
a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific or go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, and you get this converted

1554
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,320
to your local time zone.

1555
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,320
It's amazing.

1556
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,840
Also, I'm going to give one more plug for Rover Log 15 for our trip to System76. I say

1557
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,560
that because right now, over on the reruns machine over there, I'm looking at 391.

1558
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,560
Hey, look at that.

1559
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:39,840
Live from System76. It's very... It's well timed. You know, that was such a cool setup

1560
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,200
they had for us with the illuminated desk and all.

1561
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,240
It's amazing. And like the nice backing wallpaper. It looks like you're out in Hollywood.

1562
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:52,760
It's their booth setup, and it was super cool. And, you know, this was like all live events.

1563
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,160
It was down to the wire to get that work, and it was a lot of fun. But a big thank you

1564
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,920
to System76 for having us out there, too.

1565
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,480
So anyways, I'll wrap it up by just saying our Mumble Room is an open room. There's no

1566
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,400
secret password. There's no secret code you need to know. Just go over to jblive.tv, do

1567
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,880
Bang Mumble. You'll get the Mumble server info, and then we just have mods who are awesome,

1568
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,280
and I love them, and I want to give them kisses.

1569
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,280
Thank you, guys.

1570
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,480
Because I yelled at them today. I'm like, what the hell, guys? But no, now I'm saying

1571
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,480
I love them.

1572
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,480
He loves you. He loves you.

1573
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,080
That was in private, but in public I say they're great. That's what I do. And you can talk

1574
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:25,040
to those mods, and they'll check your microphone and see if you can join our virtual lug, and

1575
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,520
then come in and share your opinion on stuff. LinuxActionShow.Reddit.com for topics or feedback

1576
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,680
or check for the thread for 119 in there. And I think, is there anything else we need

1577
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,680
to cover this week, Wes?

1578
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,160
I don't think so. I think we've hit it right on the head.

1579
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:39,880
Mumble Room, thank you guys for joining us. And of course, if there's anything we're forgetting,

1580
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,480
we'll also have the post show, which we can chat in.

1581
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,040
Or please contribute to the subreddit.

1582
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,600
Yeah, that does really help quite a bit.

1583
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,600
We'll bring it right back up.

1584
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,600
Yeah, LinuxActionShow.Reddit.com.

1585
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:54,920
Alright, so as we are recording right now, hopefully this isn't the only show you hear,

1586
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,400
because the power just went out again and the lights are flickering.

1587
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,400
If so, welcome, goodbye, hello, everything.

1588
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,720
I shouldn't have said anything. I apologize, Linux Unplugged 119 is coming to an end right

1589
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,160
now while we still have power. My God, I have no idea if we're going to make it. The lights

1590
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,160
are flickering.

1591
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,480
We'll see if we're here next week. We don't know.

1592
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,360
I don't know, but thank you very much for tuning in. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com

1593
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:16,160
slash calendar to get live events. JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar for all that stuff, and contact

1594
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,960
slash contact for emails and slash live for the livestream. It's all slashes.

1595
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,960
Everything.

1596
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:21,960
Everything.

1597
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:22,960
Slash, slash, slash.

1598
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,280
Wow. Well, hopefully this wasn't the only show we got. And thank you so much for tuning

1599
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,280
this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1600
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:27,280
We really appreciate it. Come back next week. No power outages.

1601
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,280
If we don't get blown away, we'll be here.

1602
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:57,000
See you then.

1603
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah, we were unplugged.

1604
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,360
Even the Hughes lights got reset. That's how you know it's bad.

1605
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,440
My connection to Quossel dropped. What is this?

1606
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,680
Now, before everybody writes in and says, good at UPS, listen. Listen, they add line

1607
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:16,160
noise. If you don't want bzzz in your podcast, you don't want Chris running everything on

1608
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,440
UPS. You can fit a few in there.

1609
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,400
Otherwise, we'll have to get conditioners, and it's a whole thing.

1610
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,840
Now, I know our friends across the pond, they probably don't have this power issue we have

1611
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,120
here in Washington, where all of our power lines are above ground.

1612
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,680
Yeah, who bury things. That's insane.

1613
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,680
That's nuts, right?

1614
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,680
Yeah.

1615
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,920
You can just string them up very loosely on the side of the road.

1616
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,640
Oh, wow. That was so funny. Wes and I are just sitting here looking at each other like,

1617
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,040
oh, wow, we just lost power. That sucks.

1618
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,040
Seriously?

1619
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,160
Sorry, guys. Did you all know in the mom room immediately what happened? You all must have.

1620
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,160
Yep.

1621
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,160
Yeah.

1622
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,160
Yeah.

1623
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,160
Yeah.

1624
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,160
We were just fooled.

1625
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,160
Yeah. We were gone.

1626
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,160
There was an awkward silence.

1627
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,160
And then they're gone.

1628
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,880
All right. Well, we should probably wrap up so we can get this file, but thank you guys

1629
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,240
very much. Great show.

1630
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,240
Absolutely.

1631
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:03,160
Sorry we have to kind of rush out of here, but I don't want to lose the file. Hopefully,

1632
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,880
we have more than just this for the show release this week.

1633
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,880
Yes.

1634
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,160
Oh, come on, Scale Engine. You have a backup. You're our only hope.

1635
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,640
Chris, I've got a question for you.

1636
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,640
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1637
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,120
In your time in the trenches helping people move away from Windows and businesses.

1638
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,120
Down in the trenches.

1639
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,240
What did you use? Did you have a deal with Exchange compatibility?

1640
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,440
Oh, man. That's a good question.

1641
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:27,360
Exchange compatibility was, for myself, I'll tell you my personal story.

1642
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,360
Yes.

1643
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:32,440
Personally, it was the thing that held up my conversion to Linux the longest on my work

1644
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,440
desktop computer.

1645
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,440
I can see that.

1646
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:40,240
And now, this goes back to why I have such a soft spot for Crossover, Office, because

1647
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:46,840
they made it possible to not just be connected, but actually use a legitimate outlook.

1648
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:52,120
I started with Evolution and the Exchange data server and all of that, and it was okay,

1649
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,680
and it was my preferred way to go, but it just... So many times, little things didn't

1650
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,680
work right.

1651
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,280
And so, for Crossover, Office to come along and give me actual outlook, even though I

1652
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,000
hated Outlook, but to give me actual outlook...

1653
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
A full-on outlook.

1654
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,080
Yeah. Oh, man. That was such a game-changer for me. And then, it became less important

1655
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:17,480
after Exchange 2003, or whatever they called it, where they started to get the Outlook

1656
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:21,240
web access interface a little bit better, and then it became, well, I could just use

1657
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,240
the web browser.

1658
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,240
You could just use the web browser.

1659
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,680
And then, now, today, in 2015, it is not a weird concept at all to say, well, I'll just

1660
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,680
check my mail on the web browser.

1661
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,400
Right. You already have Gmail in one tab.

1662
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:35,080
Right. But back in 2005, 2004, 2003, you were a maniac. Squirrel Mail was like good web

1663
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,800
mail, and that was what you had. And I tried so many times. I tried using Thunderbird and

1664
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,920
LDAP and Kmail, and just so many different things I tried to use.

1665
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:56,840
And so, for me, the slow but steady march of companies failing to very often upgrade

1666
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,560
their office installation, just the slow but steady pace they have there, meant that Wine

1667
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,760
compatibility was almost a guaranteed thing with the version of Outlook they would be

1668
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,760
using.

1669
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,760
They would have known.

1670
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:08,760
Yeah.

1671
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,760
Right.

1672
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,760
So, everywhere I went, there was almost always like, if they got to this... Well, what I

1673
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:15,840
eventually did later on is I developed this scale. And on this scale, you could just

1674
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,720
use Outlook web access. And on the other end of the scale, you had Run Wine and Outlook,

1675
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,720
right?

1676
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,720
Right.

1677
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,640
And usually in the middle was where Evolution sat, or even a little bit towards the Use

1678
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:30,680
Outlook web mail scale, Thunderbird sat. And so, what I would normally do is I would suss

1679
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,320
up... And I'm drawing Wes a diagram here.

1680
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,320
It's a beautiful diagram.

1681
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,320
Yeah.

1682
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,320
I will attest to this.

1683
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,840
What I would normally do is I normally found that most users sat in the Thunderbird to

1684
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,440
Outlook range or between Evolution, and I would actually usually just avoid Evolution altogether

1685
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,160
because I found the stability to be unpredictable.

1686
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,160
I see. Yeah.

1687
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:49,280
Now, every now and then, you had your high-ends, which had to go with your wines.

1688
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,280
Right.

1689
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,280
And then...

1690
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
They needed everything. They used all those features.

1691
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,280
Yeah.

1692
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,120
And then now, I think if I was still doing it, I would probably just have them use Outlook

1693
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,120
web access.

1694
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,120
Yeah.

1695
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,320
And that would probably be fine. Why do you ask?

1696
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,080
Oh, I was just playing with a tool I found that takes Exchange and translates it into

1697
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,080
IMAP, CardDav, CalDav, and LDav.

1698
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,080
No.

1699
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,080
Yeah.

1700
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,080
Now, do you have to run it on the Exchange server?

1701
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,080
Nope.

1702
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,080
Oh, now you got me.

1703
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,080
You can either run it locally or set it up as a transparent...

1704
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,080
What's it called?

1705
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,080
What's it called?

1706
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,080
I'm going to write it down.

1707
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,080
DavMail.

1708
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,080
Okay. Yeah.

1709
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,080
So it makes it like a web-dav thing, huh?

1710
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,080
It is Java.

1711
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,080
But I had no problem running it.

1712
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,080
They have a dev and...

1713
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:29,440
So the DavMail process goes out and connects to an Exchange server over what?

1714
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,440
OWA?

1715
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,440
Mappy?

1716
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,720
It can use OWA, and then it also uses Exchange web services.

1717
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,720
Okay.

1718
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,240
So you're pretty much going to get even like address book lookup and stuff like that?

1719
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,240
Yeah.

1720
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:41,240
You can do address book lookup, calendar.

1721
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:44,080
I haven't tested the full suite, but IMAP works really well.

1722
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,280
So your work uses Exchange?

1723
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,280
It does, yes.

1724
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,280
Yeah.

1725
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,320
And yeah, OWA works fine, but there's some stuff where I want to set up some scripts

1726
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:54,120
that can check and do email-related actions.

1727
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,120
What about things like out-of-office?

1728
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,200
Do you have to go to the webmail to set that still, or do you not?

1729
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,200
That's a good question.

1730
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,200
Yeah.

1731
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,200
I'll have to experiment with that.

1732
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Because that's always the thing that was totally...

1733
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,200
Right.

1734
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,200
It's those little details at the ends.

1735
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,200
Yes.

1736
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,200
Yeah.

1737
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,680
Exchange has gotten a lot easier in the era of smartphones and things like that, but...

1738
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:16,640
And I know Office 365 even has a JSON API now, so if you go that far, then it gets better.

1739
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,920
It was really, though... Like you said back when I was in the trenches, it was really

1740
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,600
that thing... And I'm specifically reflecting on Exchange 5.5, Exchange 2000, and Exchange

1741
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:31,280
2003, and just watching that... Watching how they had... Microsoft had such a brilliant

1742
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,280
lockdown.

1743
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,280
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,280
It's crazy.

1745
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,280
It's all just one big thing.

1746
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,120
It was really an active directory solidified all of it, right?

1747
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,120
It worked well enough.

1748
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,120
Yeah.

1749
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,120
It was really interesting.

1750
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:47,440
It was actually... Active directory was perfect, because what it was, was it was a significant

1751
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:51,480
organizational improvement over NT4 and that paradigm.

1752
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:56,960
And it was much more in line with NetWare's eDirectory and others.

1753
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:02,880
And it managed to not only make organizationing more streamlined, but it also could accommodate

1754
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,040
acquisitions and mergers that businesses faced.

1755
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,040
Sure.

1756
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,040
Right.

1757
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,040
That was something supported.

1758
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
You understood how to do it.

1759
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,040
Yeah.

1760
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,360
You could do acquisition mergers with other companies and integrate them into your active

1761
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,000
directory, which was, for the business world, that's a big deal.

1762
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,440
And then on top of that, they managed to... If you're going to go active directory, well,

1763
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,600
then you have to have a Windows DNS server.

1764
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,440
And if you're going to go active directory, you should probably do DHCP on a Windows server,

1765
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,960
because that DHCP server will automatically, dynamically update the DNS entries, which

1766
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
is important.

1767
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:32,960
Oh, I've been playing with that at work as well.

1768
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,600
Which is important for active directory to function correctly.

1769
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,960
And if you're going to go active directory, you might as well go Exchange, because that's

1770
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:41,520
going to tie into all your user accounts, and that'll make single sign-on possible.

1771
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,720
And if you're going to go active directory, you might as well go IIS on your internet

1772
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,360
server, because then you can use single sign-on for your internet as well.

1773
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,600
And yeah, we'd prefer to use Apache, but single sign-on's a big deal.

1774
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,120
We don't want users to have to enter passwords, so we'll go IIS here.

1775
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:59,000
And it's such a brilliant way to lock you in.

1776
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,760
It's totally the old model, right?

1777
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,200
And it doesn't really apply anymore, and yeah, active directory's still huge and all that

1778
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,200
kind of stuff.

1779
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,360
I mean, it just is such, it was such a stroke of genius on Microsoft's part, right?

1780
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,760
When Windows was going to be everywhere.

1781
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,760
Yes.

1782
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,360
Yeah, that was something.

1783
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,600
And now today, active directory can just simply be a service on Azure.

1784
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,600
Yes.

1785
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,600
And you know, the LDAP integrations and that kind of stuff, and Linux has been a lot better.

1786
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,280
So you've been playing with DHCP and dynamic updates?

1787
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,480
Oh, just, there's a Windows component to our network, and just playing with the living

1788
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,080
on Linux in that environment.

1789
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,880
You know, it was, I remember when Bind actually, I don't remember if it was Bind 9 or, I can't

1790
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:37,880
remember when Bind got it, but I remember when dynamic DNS came to Bind.

1791
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,360
And I could deploy a Bind server again on my network and have it dynamically update

1792
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,740
the DNS on a Windows server.

1793
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:48,040
And I didn't expect, I don't remember exactly the nature of the improvement, but I didn't

1794
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,780
expect an improvement, a noticeable improvement.

1795
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:55,480
What I expected was essentially no change at all from my point of view or the end user's

1796
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,480
point of view.

1797
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,920
I didn't really think moving to Bind would, I swear to God, Wes, there was an actual performance

1798
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:04,440
improvement in DNS resolution across all of the users, because the way we worked is we

1799
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:08,840
had 110 terminal servers that I was responsible for sitting in one room.

1800
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:13,180
And so all of your users across 40 plus branches come into one room, and then they're hitting

1801
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,180
everything at once.

1802
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:18,000
When they log in across all, you know, you have 700 users that log in in one spot on

1803
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,800
one LAN all at once.

1804
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,800
It really hits it, right?

1805
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,800
Yeah, definitely.

1806
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,500
Especially back in the day when, you know, things were, you know, crappy processors and

1807
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,840
stuff like that, and we didn't have SSDs and any of that kind of stuff.

1808
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,320
So if you're going to have any kind of disk I.O., it's a massive SCSI array, and it's

1809
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,800
a monster to manage.

1810
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,720
And so when Bind came along, just that small, I mean, Bind was around way longer than Windows

1811
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,000
DNS, but when Bind dynamic updates came along that interrupted with Active Directory, when

1812
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,800
that happened, you could actually witness, like you could sit there and see desktop logins

1813
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,080
happen faster, name resolution happen faster.

1814
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,080
That's amazing.

1815
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,280
It was just like, wow, is everything better under Linux?

1816
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,280
Like everything?

1817
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,120
I was at DockerCon in Barcelona this week.

1818
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,120
Oh, really?

1819
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,120
Can you tell us more?

1820
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,120
Yeah, man.

1821
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,120
It was good.

1822
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:05,360
But the most surreal moment of the entire conference was listening to a Microsoft rep

1823
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:11,920
giving a talk, stood there in a red hat hat about open source and how great Linux was

1824
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,920
on Azure.

1825
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,920
Whoa.

1826
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,920
That's weird.

1827
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,360
I don't know how I feel about that.

1828
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,200
What was the scene like at DockerCon?

1829
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:22,400
Does it feel like a lot of money was spent, or does it feel like a new startup thing that's

1830
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,760
struggling to seem big, or did it feel like it's arrived?

1831
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,480
Like, what was your vibe you walked away from DockerCon?

1832
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,040
Such a great community.

1833
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,840
The DevOps community has such a nice energy around it.

1834
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,760
It was a big conference, about 2,000 people.

1835
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,600
And there was food everywhere you went.

1836
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,560
And there was free beer, which obviously is great in Spain.

1837
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,560
And yeah, it was a really great experience.

1838
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,400
Definitely recommend going if you can.

1839
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:57,520
And they've announced that the next DockerCon in June will be in your neck of the woods,

1840
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,520
Chris, in Seattle.

1841
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,520
No.

1842
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,520
Oh, cool.

1843
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,520
Wes, we should go.

1844
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,520
We should definitely go.

1845
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,520
Hmm.

1846
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,520
Well, you know what?

1847
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,520
I'm going to look into that.

1848
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,520
I'm going to.

1849
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,520
Hmm.

1850
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,520
That's interesting.

1851
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,920
I've been thinking about scale this year.

1852
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:11,920
So I've been thinking about different conferences.

1853
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:12,920
I think.

1854
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,920
Just toying with it.

1855
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,760
I think we're not going to do scale this year, which is ridiculous, because it's one of the

1856
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:19,000
largest Linux conventions.

1857
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,440
But you know, Noah and I were talking about it on this trip to System76.

1858
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,000
And we honestly, there's like a threshold where they start to get too big, and they

1859
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
get corporate.

1860
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Right.

1861
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And.

1862
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,080
Yeah, then it's more like an industry convention rather than like a user.

1863
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,160
And scale's really walking that line.

1864
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:39,360
I think Docker is going to head that way fast.

1865
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,360
Yeah.

1866
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,360
Yeah, it feels like that.

1867
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:46,000
10 years ago, you were mad if you ran a VM in production, right?

1868
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Right.

1869
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,040
Now you're mad if you don't.

1870
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,040
Right.

1871
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:54,920
I suspect that Docker will go that way much faster because people will note the trends

1872
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,920
faster.

1873
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,240
You know, we're going to talk about it, but the economies of scale that Docker offers

1874
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,240
is just.

1875
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:04,600
I mean, it is like, it's impossible for your CTOs to ignore.

1876
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:05,600
Right.

1877
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
It's just too attractive.

1878
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,600
You mean we don't have to buy new hardware?

1879
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,600
Right.

1880
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,600
Keep that CapEx down.

1881
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,360
They showed a few cool demos, right?

1882
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:19,440
One of them was they managed their Docker containers in Minecraft, so your kid might

1883
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,440
like that, Chris.

1884
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,440
No kidding.

1885
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,440
That's wild.

1886
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:23,440
Dylan.

1887
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:34,160
And another one they showed was a thousand node cluster on AWS deploying 50,000 containers

1888
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,960
in 52 minutes.

1889
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,960
Whoa.

1890
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,960
50,000.

1891
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,960
Imagine the DDoS you could start up with, you know.

1892
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:40,960
No kidding.

1893
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,040
And the only reason they stopped at a thousand nodes was because that's all that EC2 would

1894
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,040
let Docker have.

1895
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,040
Oh, really?

1896
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,040
That's great.

1897
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:51,200
That is, that must have been quite the demo.

1898
01:45:51,200 --> 01:46:11,800
Yeah, it got Apple style applause.
