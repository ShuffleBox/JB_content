WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Utopian.io, I'll go look for it, yep.

00:02.160 --> 00:03.240
Yeah, okay.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.720
And they basically take open source projects, okay,

00:05.720 --> 00:09.280
and they induct them into the Steemit blockchain

00:09.280 --> 00:13.200
or Steemit blockchain and build up a community around them.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.200
And people who actively contribute back to the project

00:19.120 --> 00:21.560
can get rewards back in cryptocurrency.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.000
So it doesn't have to be code necessarily,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
it could be things like translations or manuals

00:26.000 --> 00:28.520
or graphics or anything else.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.000
And it builds this idea around the open source project

00:31.000 --> 00:32.400
if you're making money direct

00:32.400 --> 00:34.440
from people who are contributing to it.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.840
It's a very interesting point.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.080
And your comparison there would be something

00:38.080 --> 00:39.820
maybe for content creators too.

00:39.820 --> 00:44.820
Well, no, I mean, the point is that Steam also has Dtube,

00:45.040 --> 00:48.040
which is decentralized tube, and DLive.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.640
And they basically work in the same way.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.000
So you put content out in Dtube

00:52.000 --> 00:55.720
and you're earning money in cryptocurrency

00:55.720 --> 00:59.080
by people upvoting your videos.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.280
So the bottom line is, okay, right,

01:00.280 --> 01:01.840
the popular ones get upvoted

01:01.840 --> 01:04.620
and you earn money from being popular.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.760
So you put out good content, you make money.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.080
Hmm, hmm, that also could,

01:09.080 --> 01:11.820
I can't, how does that not turn into Clickbait 2.0 though?

01:11.820 --> 01:12.760
Yeah. Ooh.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.600
This is the cool thing about it.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.760
Okay, so the whole idea about upvoting people

01:16.760 --> 01:21.760
for good content is that it's community-managed

01:22.120 --> 01:24.120
about the weighting of the content.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.200
So you have to have so many people, okay, right,

01:26.200 --> 01:31.040
of sufficient steam power to be able to upvote your content

01:31.040 --> 01:33.360
to say it's legitimate content.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.320
So you earn the steam power

01:34.320 --> 01:36.320
by being a good person to the community.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.480
More steam power you have, the more your vout counts.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.360
Interesting, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.440
That's particularly interesting.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.360
That's a really interesting take on that.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.320
The problem with Dtube is it just sucks

01:49.320 --> 01:51.720
at delivering video, that's the problem.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.520
I get to see a single video actually play.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.960
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 245.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:02.080 --> 02:04.720
that's running the numbers, looking at the distros,

02:04.720 --> 02:07.120
and watching all of the projects.

02:07.120 --> 02:07.960
My name is Chris.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.120
My name is Wuz.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.720
Hello, Mr. Payne, it's good to be with you again

02:11.720 --> 02:14.240
on episode 245.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.960
Coming up in this week's episode,

02:15.960 --> 02:18.640
we're gonna do all of our traditional community news,

02:18.640 --> 02:21.800
as well as some new project releases, some app picks,

02:21.800 --> 02:23.760
and some development sprints.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.400
But then, towards the end of the show,

02:26.400 --> 02:31.120
we're gonna talk about Microsoft's new Linux powered devices

02:31.120 --> 02:32.440
that will be coming to the market soon.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.960
It's all of the news this week,

02:33.960 --> 02:35.960
and it's part of Azure Sphere,

02:35.960 --> 02:39.520
which is an overall, large, three-stage,

02:39.520 --> 02:42.720
three-component effort that Microsoft's putting on

02:42.720 --> 02:45.960
that may just wind up dominating IoT.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.040
And we'll tell you how Linux is playing a role,

02:48.040 --> 02:50.280
what component of this is Linux-based,

02:50.280 --> 02:54.040
and what you can expect in the pretty near future.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.720
Wes and I got on a phone call

02:55.720 --> 03:00.440
with one of the core creators and developers from Microsoft.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.640
They took the time to get the team on the phone with us

03:02.640 --> 03:06.080
before the show, and we asked them all of the hard questions.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.280
We got the specifics about what they're running

03:08.280 --> 03:11.560
on these devices, and we'll share what we learned with you

03:11.560 --> 03:13.960
later on in the show, straight from the horse's mouth.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.680
We couldn't have gotten better people

03:15.680 --> 03:16.880
to describe the tech to us.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.800
It was really pretty awesome.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.400
But before we get all of that,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.880
there's like news, community stuff,

03:22.880 --> 03:24.120
and a mumble room to bring in.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.960
So let's do all of that right now.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.360
Time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.200
Hey.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.040
Hey.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.640
Wow, that kind of made me hungry, actually.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.600
Now I have a bit of an appetite.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.080
Well, guys, we have much to cover today,

03:40.080 --> 03:42.360
and I don't really know where to start

03:42.360 --> 03:43.600
other than maybe with Linus.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.000
That just seems like the appropriate place right now.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.480
Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list

03:48.480 --> 03:51.520
announced plans that you should not be excited about

03:51.520 --> 03:53.360
and mean absolutely nothing,

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
so would you please stop talking about it?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.800
Except for Linus keeps talking about it.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.280
So he says, the next release doesn't really seem

04:00.280 --> 04:02.760
to be shaping up to be any particularly big release,

04:02.760 --> 04:05.960
and there is nothing particularly special about it either.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.360
The most special thing that happened

04:07.360 --> 04:09.800
is just sort of a numerology thing.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.880
The Linux kernel has passed the six million

04:11.880 --> 04:14.200
Git object mark, and this, he says,

04:14.200 --> 04:18.080
is reason enough to call the next kernel version 5.0.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.400
This version is completely meaningless.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.760
It should mean that it's just silly

04:22.760 --> 04:24.400
and that maybe I won't even switch to it

04:24.400 --> 04:28.440
because even numerological rules would be a silly reason,

04:28.440 --> 04:31.640
so I may not do it, and it may just surprise you,

04:31.640 --> 04:33.240
but 5.0 will happen someday,

04:33.240 --> 04:34.920
and it will be and should be meaningless.

04:34.920 --> 04:35.960
You have been warned.

04:35.960 --> 04:36.800
I like it.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.640
I can't wait.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.480
Yeah, right?

04:38.480 --> 04:39.320
I can't wait for it.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.160
I have no reason to be excited.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.880
I am really looking forward to Linux kernel 5.0

04:41.880 --> 04:43.160
for no reason at all.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.000
I thought, okay, all right.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Thank you, Linus, thank you.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.280
So that's how we start the show out today,

04:48.280 --> 04:49.920
but let's talk about something

04:49.920 --> 04:53.000
that's a little bit higher up in the kernel stack,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.600
and that's the user interface,

04:54.600 --> 04:59.480
and Mr. Martin Wimpress tooling away like a soldier

04:59.480 --> 05:01.720
at Ubuntu MATE's high DPI support,

05:01.720 --> 05:05.880
and it was almost a year ago that Wimpy came on here

05:05.880 --> 05:08.520
and told us about the first steps

05:08.520 --> 05:10.800
of bringing high DPI support to Ubuntu MATE.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.980
In fact, I'm looking at the post right here

05:11.980 --> 05:15.840
from April 2017, where it's a screenshot

05:15.840 --> 05:19.800
that Wimpy took on his XPS 15 4K screen,

05:19.800 --> 05:24.080
and with a few dirty hacks, with Ubuntu 17.04 as a base,

05:24.080 --> 05:25.720
we had a high DPI.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.220
So fast forward now about a year,

05:27.220 --> 05:29.080
where are we at with all of this, Wimpy?

05:29.080 --> 05:30.240
We're all done.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.000
It's all high DPI to the max in all the right places.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.160
So I think I last spoke to you about this

05:36.160 --> 05:38.860
maybe five or six weeks ago,

05:38.860 --> 05:40.320
and I said I wouldn't talk about it again,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.760
but I'm lying because I'm going to talk to you about it now.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.720
So what's changed since then is we had a few bits

05:45.720 --> 05:46.760
that weren't implemented.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.320
So one of the big changes is now that Marco,

05:49.320 --> 05:52.400
which is the window manager for the MATE desktop,

05:52.400 --> 05:55.040
that now all of its window controls and everything,

05:55.040 --> 05:57.780
all of those scale and work correctly.

05:57.780 --> 06:00.880
So where before, when high DPI was enabled,

06:00.880 --> 06:03.400
we were standing up compers underneath

06:03.400 --> 06:05.360
in order to fill that gap,

06:05.360 --> 06:07.040
we don't need to do that anymore.

06:07.040 --> 06:07.880
Wow.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.120
So the behavior is just like what you used to have.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.120
You can either choose to run Marco or compers,

06:14.120 --> 06:16.320
and it's not constrained

06:16.320 --> 06:18.720
by whether you're using high DPI or not.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.960
So that's one of the big changes.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.720
And then Kaja, the file manager,

06:22.720 --> 06:25.280
has now had the full high DPI treatment.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.120
Ah.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.600
And in terms of user facing changes

06:28.600 --> 06:30.580
that are going to be obvious there,

06:30.580 --> 06:31.780
that's really sort of,

06:31.780 --> 06:36.420
we've made sure that the icons are all using vector icons

06:36.420 --> 06:37.260
and what have you.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.560
So it all looks a bit crisper.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.720
Very good. And nicer.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.920
So, yeah.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.160
And there's been a few tweaks and touches

06:43.160 --> 06:45.880
all the way through to just improve things.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.420
So there's some improvements

06:48.420 --> 06:51.960
to the way that font DPI scaling works.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.800
So it gives you the ability

06:53.800 --> 06:57.580
to sort of do pseudo fractional scaling

06:57.580 --> 06:59.440
by having a scale desktop

06:59.440 --> 07:02.520
and then manipulating the font DPI.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.720
So yeah, it's all looking really good now.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.280
And all those patches have landed in 1804

07:07.280 --> 07:09.440
as of about a week ago,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.400
all being tested, looking in good shape.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.520
So our high DPI journey's finished.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.400
And interestingly, you said it was a year ago,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.160
we had that first discussion

07:18.160 --> 07:20.640
about here's a rather shonky setup.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.720
But the actual journey started a year before that,

07:23.720 --> 07:26.640
just after 1604 closed.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.160
We embarked on our journey towards GTK3.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.440
So this has been two years in the making.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.280
Wow. Yeah, good point.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.320
And congratulations.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.140
Let me start there.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.460
Let me just say congratulations.

07:37.460 --> 07:40.680
And then also work well done.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.760
Really nice to see this.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.680
We were just talking on the pre-show

07:44.680 --> 07:46.580
about how there's just a few systems right now.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.760
I can't really decide like if my next rig

07:49.760 --> 07:50.840
is gonna be high DPI.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.340
And so I'm really happy to see this getting pushed forward

07:53.340 --> 07:54.800
by more and more desktops.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.940
Yeah, I think the state of high DPI in general

07:57.940 --> 08:00.880
is in a good place for Linux now as well.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.400
Yeah, I can remember some,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.440
I think when you got your XPS,

08:04.440 --> 08:07.480
I think that was the third gen.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.760
So that was about two and a half, three years ago,

08:09.760 --> 08:11.400
I think you got that laptop.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.240
Correct.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.060
And, you know, you were saying,

08:13.060 --> 08:15.280
well, you know, these applications don't scale.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.320
And I think Firefox and Chrome both didn't scale

08:18.320 --> 08:19.160
at that time.

08:19.160 --> 08:19.980
Yeah.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.360
You know, these days, and it's not just, you know,

08:22.360 --> 08:24.480
it's nice, obviously that the desktop

08:24.480 --> 08:27.920
that I am involved in now has high DPI scaling.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.760
But when I install lots of other applications,

08:30.760 --> 08:33.320
I see just about everything scaling.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.920
Now, you know, the one obvious standout

08:35.920 --> 08:38.700
that doesn't scale is GIMP,

08:39.600 --> 08:42.160
which is disappointing and they're getting there.

08:42.160 --> 08:47.160
They've got some cheeky workarounds in GIMP 2.10,

08:48.120 --> 08:50.040
which is still based on GTK2,

08:50.040 --> 08:53.760
but they do some magic to use larger icons

08:53.760 --> 08:55.720
and bump up the font scaling

08:55.720 --> 08:58.840
to sort of fill the gap in the meantime.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.720
But other than that,

08:59.720 --> 09:02.040
there isn't a whole lot that I run and think,

09:02.040 --> 09:05.360
oh, this isn't high DPI scaled.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.420
It has gotten better.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.000
It could be, the story could be a bit better still

09:10.000 --> 09:11.520
on the plasma side of things.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.840
There's still three or so places you have to go

09:13.840 --> 09:15.760
to really get it all working.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.400
But Cheese Bacon asks an interesting question,

09:18.400 --> 09:20.720
and I don't know if you have the rough idea,

09:20.720 --> 09:23.400
but just from like a raw numbers standpoint,

09:23.400 --> 09:25.160
do you have any idea of roughly how many assets

09:25.160 --> 09:27.140
had to be touched to get to a high DPI version

09:27.140 --> 09:29.800
or had to be replaced, like icons and things like that?

09:29.800 --> 09:30.640
Oh, crikey.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.200
Thousands, thousands, every icon.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.920
Those were retouched by Daniel Foray.

09:37.920 --> 09:42.920
He did an icon rework for us in 1704.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.720
Michael Tunnell did all of the small assets

09:46.720 --> 09:49.600
to provide scaled versions and recolored them.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.000
So that's everything from like the check boxes

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
and the outlines around the buttons,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.880
cause all the buttons are styled and themes.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.040
So, and then all of the CSS at the backend

10:01.040 --> 10:05.820
for the GTK3 stuff, whole chunks of that had to be adapted

10:05.820 --> 10:08.600
so it knew how to apply styling

10:08.600 --> 10:10.560
when it was in a scaled mode.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.000
So, you know, when I say it took two years to get there,

10:13.000 --> 10:17.440
just building on top of GTK3 is only one of those steps

10:17.440 --> 10:19.600
and, you know, reworking all of the themes

10:19.600 --> 10:22.800
to understand how all of these assets scale

10:22.800 --> 10:25.420
and are provided, you know, that was a whole chunk of work

10:25.420 --> 10:28.840
and there were numerous themers and digital artists

10:28.840 --> 10:30.360
involved in that endeavor.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.080
So yeah, thousands and thousands of assets

10:33.080 --> 10:34.600
have been touched along the way.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.160
Wow, well, I'm glad you guys are doing the hard work there.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.040
So that'll be all good to go in 1804.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.520
So when I get the final 1804, I'll have that.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.640
Yeah, I think there's one teeny tiny thing

10:46.640 --> 10:49.640
we're gonna fix post-release regarding high DPI,

10:49.640 --> 10:51.760
but it's so insignificant I'm not gonna mention it

10:51.760 --> 10:52.960
and nobody will notice it.

10:52.960 --> 10:57.440
Okay then, don't pay any attention over here.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.280
Well, thanks for the update.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.720
Yeah, it's misdirection.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.680
Yeah, we're good.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.000
You know, while we're on the Ubuntu vein here,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.800
Eric, I know I saw news about a week ago, I think,

11:09.800 --> 11:12.280
about the Ubuntu studio project rebasing

11:12.280 --> 11:13.520
or making big changes.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.640
Can you fill us in on that?

11:14.640 --> 11:17.360
Yes, so we've got some great things going on.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.080
First of all, we established a council

11:19.080 --> 11:22.840
so that we can take some load off of the project later,

11:22.840 --> 11:25.240
which is really a good thing.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.400
But what we're doing is we are trying to do something

11:28.400 --> 11:32.200
such as replace our metapackage installer

11:32.200 --> 11:35.640
with something like the Ubuntu MATE welcome,

11:35.640 --> 11:37.800
which I guess has also been forked to Budgie.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.640
Cool.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.640
And so we're going to be including that

11:41.640 --> 11:44.080
to let people tailor the experience the way they want.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.840
And we're also considering perhaps

11:45.840 --> 11:48.820
a change of default desktop environment

11:48.820 --> 11:52.960
and perhaps add additional desktop environments as options.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.600
So there's a number of things we're kind of brainstorming

11:55.600 --> 11:56.640
and working on.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.560
We definitely want to get Ubuntu Studio out of the stagnation

11:59.560 --> 12:01.520
it's been in for about the past two years.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.920
Well, I look forward to seeing how that goes,

12:02.920 --> 12:04.320
because I've used it on and off.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.640
It's a pretty solid distro for people that maybe want

12:06.640 --> 12:09.400
to get into podcasting, as an example, or something like that.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.240
It's pretty great.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.960
So Ubuntu Studio will have some change.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.160
When do those start landing?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.520
So it sounds like the council stuff is already in place,

12:15.520 --> 12:19.200
but other changes, is that a release or two away?

12:19.200 --> 12:24.240
We're aiming for 18.10 for the first of the big changes.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.480
But 18.04 is really just going to be iterative.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.680
And the only thing about 18.04 is for us,

12:28.680 --> 12:32.120
it will not be an LTS just due to load manpower.

12:32.120 --> 12:32.800
OK.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.800
Yeah, I think I remembered hearing that.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.560
Well, great.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.000
Thank you guys for the updates.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.680
And definitely keep up the good work

12:37.680 --> 12:39.120
and keep us posted on how that goes.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.760
I love watching them projects.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.360
And it's always cool to see that kind of stuff.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.240
It's just so darn great.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.320
You know what else is great?

12:46.320 --> 12:46.840
Ting.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.240
Linux.ting.com.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.760
It's smarter than unlimited, because if you use less,

12:50.760 --> 12:51.400
you pay less.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.240
It's just a base $6 for your line,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.240
and then your usage on top of that for your minutes,

12:56.240 --> 12:57.720
your messages, and your megabytes.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.440
That's it.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.280
So if you only get a dozen text messages a month,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.920
you don't need to pay for 500 text messages.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.480
If you can download podcasts and listen to music via Wi-Fi

13:07.480 --> 13:09.080
and cache it locally, you probably

13:09.080 --> 13:11.600
don't need 12, 15 gigs of data.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.120
So just pay for what you use.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.560
And if you want multiple devices, like a Mi-Fi

13:15.560 --> 13:17.960
or a cell phone, or if you want a backup phone,

13:17.960 --> 13:18.880
it's great for that.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.640
Because at $6 a month, you can afford

13:20.640 --> 13:22.280
to be really, really flexible.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.600
And they combine that with a great control panel,

13:24.600 --> 13:27.240
fantastic customer service, and ton of devices

13:27.240 --> 13:28.120
that are ready to go.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.920
And maybe the most important thing about Ting

13:29.920 --> 13:32.120
that I don't talk a lot about, because it's just obvious

13:32.120 --> 13:37.600
to me now, is they don't have a strategy to get into media.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.800
They don't have a streaming service.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.640
They don't have a Ting app store.

13:41.640 --> 13:45.280
They don't have a branded experience with partners

13:45.280 --> 13:47.280
that they want to push down to my phone.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.560
They don't do any of that.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.080
They don't care how you use the service.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.680
They just want you to have service.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.720
And you can pick from CDMA or GSM.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.600
And they don't have some sort of Ting ROM

13:56.600 --> 13:57.680
that you'll have to install.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.360
So they don't get in the way of updates.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.160
If you've got a phone that gets frequent updates,

14:01.160 --> 14:03.520
like the Pixels, and the Nexi, and the Motos,

14:03.520 --> 14:04.680
they don't get in the way of that.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.440
You get the updates as soon as the vendor releases them.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.600
That's, by far, one of my favorite things about Ting.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.560
And embarrassingly uncommon in the US

14:13.560 --> 14:15.200
when you buy devices from carriers.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.000
But there's so many other great things about Ting.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.880
The customer service, like I mentioned, is bar none.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.520
The control panel, always the best, and much, much more.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.720
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.280
Take $25 off a device, or if you bring a compatible device,

14:27.280 --> 14:28.800
$25 in service credit.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
linux.ting.com.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.440
Big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.800
linux.ting.com.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.840
Wes, you found this cool, cool terminal app

14:38.840 --> 14:40.920
that, for once, isn't powered by Node.js,

14:40.920 --> 14:42.600
but it's still super cool.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.280
It's written in Go, actually.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.960
And how would you ever know it's named GoTop?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.160
Yeah, exactly.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.480
You've got to make sure you know.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.240
And it's another terminal-based graphic activity monitor.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.040
And it's so epic.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.320
First of all, because it's in Go, it's really simple.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.200
It's a small little thing, no big deal.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.920
And it has a colored end cursor,

15:02.920 --> 15:05.240
it has a colored end cursor's graph,

15:05.240 --> 15:07.960
and it has boxes of memory usage in your process list,

15:07.960 --> 15:11.000
and it boxes everything out into individual segments.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.240
It's the exact kind of thing if your boss is walking in

15:14.240 --> 15:16.200
and you want to have something grayed up on your screen,

15:16.200 --> 15:19.040
and you could just have this up in an SSH terminal,

15:19.040 --> 15:20.960
and you just tab over to that when your boss walks in.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.440
Oh, yeah, just pulling down some metrics off the old server.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.800
Meanwhile, you're watching YouTube on another tab.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.480
Yeah, right, probably also in a terminal,

15:28.480 --> 15:30.080
but in the other team works pane.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.800
Yeah, actually, you did have a pick

15:31.800 --> 15:34.440
for bare minimal YouTube this week, too,

15:34.440 --> 15:35.400
that almost made it in the show,

15:35.400 --> 15:36.880
which could go nice with this.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.360
Minimal YouTube, do you want to check?

15:39.360 --> 15:40.960
Check your link, see if you have it,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.280
because we should almost bust that out.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.320
It has a light and dark mode,

15:44.320 --> 15:46.160
and the installation is just dead simple.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.600
You just get, clone it down, you run the shell script,

15:48.600 --> 15:49.640
you've got it to go, and of course,

15:49.640 --> 15:52.840
it's in the AUR, too, as gotop-bin.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.680
Where was it?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, so it's minimalist YouTube.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.160
And if you go to tube.quinzel.tech,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.880
it's Q-U, put a link in the thing.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.720
Put a link in the IRC for that one.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.000
Yeah, we'll put a link in.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.720
That is like the Google search page for YouTube.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.320
It's just nothing, it's just blank, it's minimal.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.200
So simple. It's easy, clean, yeah.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.000
It just gets you the video.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.560
It's a great way to use YouTube

16:16.560 --> 16:17.800
if you just want to go watch a video,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.240
but you don't want all of the rest of YouTube.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.520
So yeah, West will drop a linkskies

16:22.520 --> 16:24.360
in the irc.geekshed.net.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.080
Anyway, so this is called gotop,

16:26.080 --> 16:28.600
and gotop is a super slick looking terminal

16:28.600 --> 16:30.120
that we wanted to point you guys to,

16:30.120 --> 16:32.320
so you have an app to download this week after the show.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.080
And then a call out to a project

16:35.080 --> 16:38.120
that used to make or break my day, it's Clonezilla.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.800
And Clonezilla got a good update this week, version 25538.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.840
And the most interesting feature

16:44.840 --> 16:48.000
is a new massive deployment mechanism

16:48.000 --> 16:50.280
based on BitTorrent technology.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.720
So the machines that you're imaging

16:53.720 --> 16:55.640
become part of the distribution network.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.560
Well, that is just slick.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.000
It's obvious, too, really, if you think about it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.720
Now, it does require some additional disk space

17:02.720 --> 17:06.640
to do this, but I've worked on some large networks

17:06.640 --> 17:09.280
where you're imaging 30, 40, 50 systems or more,

17:09.280 --> 17:11.280
and this could be so useful.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.960
It's such a neat, neat thing.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.800
They're also baking in some part image support,

17:15.800 --> 17:17.360
some additional part image support,

17:17.360 --> 17:19.640
and the ability to change Windows 10 host names

17:19.640 --> 17:22.280
when you restore an image in Clonezilla, yeah.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.200
In Clonezilla, they just keep on going,

17:25.200 --> 17:26.640
and it works so well.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.840
I'm so appreciative, it's not something I use frequently,

17:28.840 --> 17:29.680
but I am so appreciative.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.880
Every time you need to, right, it's just boom.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.760
And there's a live CD that has now been synced up

17:35.760 --> 17:39.440
to Debbie and Sid and running Linux kernel 4.15.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.760
So it's a pretty modern, pretty recent live environment

17:41.760 --> 17:43.920
to run Clonezilla from, and then they're baking

17:43.920 --> 17:46.040
in that BitTorrent distribution.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.400
I gotta play with that sometime.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.000
I don't have any need for that, but I gotta play with that.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.640
It just sounds so cool.

17:51.640 --> 17:57.240
And then to round out sort of an app pick-ish section,

17:57.240 --> 18:00.840
Font Finder is a GTK3 application.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.960
Yes, I'm still talking about GTK applications.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.280
That is a really easy, smooth front end

18:07.280 --> 18:10.400
to browse Google's free font archive from the comfort

18:10.400 --> 18:11.840
of your Linux desktop.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.640
And it's super straightforward.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.320
It's exactly what you'd expect, but at the same time,

18:16.320 --> 18:17.200
it's pretty nice.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.040
You can search for the font you want.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.280
So say you want to go get Google's Robo font,

18:21.280 --> 18:22.320
or Roboto, I think it is.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.000
So you put in Robo, and then it'll

18:24.000 --> 18:26.080
show you Roboto, condensed, monoslabbed,

18:26.080 --> 18:27.400
all the different fonts they have.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.800
And then in the client-side decoration header bar thingy,

18:29.800 --> 18:31.360
it has a nice install button.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.040
It'll pull that font down from Googles

18:33.040 --> 18:35.120
and load it into your Linux box.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.400
Bob's your uncle.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.800
Robert's your father.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.880
Now you've got a font.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.520
I like it.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.840
Simple, easy, and we'll have a link in the show notes

18:41.840 --> 18:43.440
for that, because it's up on GitHub.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.600
So that's Font Finder.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.480
I did notice there, Chris, it was, did you pick it,

18:47.480 --> 18:48.520
because it was Rust?

18:48.520 --> 18:49.560
Is that why?

18:49.560 --> 18:50.720
Your little favorite?

18:50.720 --> 18:51.760
It actually did.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.000
That was legitimately what pushed it over.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.120
You know me so well.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.460
That was totally it, too.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.160
I was going to make a Rust joke about it,

19:00.160 --> 19:01.080
but then I just got to let it go.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.120
But yeah, you caught me.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.160
You caught me.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.120
Saree was going to join us from System76,

19:05.120 --> 19:11.000
but Mumble is off-putting if you don't use it

19:11.000 --> 19:12.200
on an ongoing basis.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.160
So I think they had some audio troubles.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.560
I might try to grab him later on in the week

19:16.560 --> 19:18.520
and just have an offline chat with him about it.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.720
System76 is joining the Gnome Foundation Advisory Board.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.120
And I believe it's actually Saree from System76

19:25.120 --> 19:26.800
that'll be doing this.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.360
And I find this to be a fascinating move,

19:29.360 --> 19:33.560
because while the advisory board isn't super influential

19:33.560 --> 19:35.800
over what Gnome does, because at the end of the day,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.680
some developer has to do the work.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.720
And it's not like they have a lever they pull on,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.600
and then a developer comes out the other side.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.880
So it can definitely set directions and things like that.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.040
But it could also, my understanding,

19:47.040 --> 19:48.000
I was going to ask Saree about this,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.400
is it can be sort of a sounding board

19:50.400 --> 19:52.760
for organizations that are using Gnome,

19:52.760 --> 19:55.480
or groups that are using Gnome for different projects.

19:55.480 --> 20:00.000
That seems like a super sweet position for System76 to be in.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.760
It makes sense, right?

20:01.760 --> 20:05.280
To be able to get sort of a wider industry data collection

20:05.280 --> 20:07.600
of how people are using Gnome,

20:07.600 --> 20:10.560
when they're building Pop OS on top of Gnome,

20:10.560 --> 20:12.360
it seems really, yeah.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.920
You're part of the conversation in the community.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.200
Yeah, so good for them,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.760
System76 joining the Gnome Advisory Board.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.600
Boom, how about that?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.760
It's a rapid fire set of app picks and news.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.280
That's what we do here on the Unplugged program.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.720
We busted through that quicker than I expected,

20:23.720 --> 20:24.560
even with a bonus app pick.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.560
Linux right to the brain.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.680
Man, man.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.200
If we could just hook it up to your eyeballs,

20:29.200 --> 20:30.040
it would be even better.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.160
Just suck it right in through the neurons in your eyes.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.720
Coming next week.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.560
Yeah, we're working on that, aren't we?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.080
In fact, maybe I'll mention a couple of things.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.960
So there is a new mysterious operator behind the scenes.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.880
I can't say more than that,

20:42.880 --> 20:45.200
but I don't know if you guys remember,

20:45.200 --> 20:46.720
but many, many weeks ago,

20:46.720 --> 20:48.840
I announced around episode 250,

20:48.840 --> 20:51.800
we'd be making some changes to the Unplugged program.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.640
Yes, we did.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.040
I think I might've mentioned it around 200.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.400
I don't know.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.760
Well, they arrived a little early.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.080
And so we've been, for about a month and a half,

20:59.080 --> 21:00.560
we've been every week,

21:00.560 --> 21:03.200
there has been small incremental changes

21:03.200 --> 21:05.120
for the better behind the scenes.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.280
The poor folks on YouTube have it the worst,

21:08.280 --> 21:10.920
but the folks on the podcast version have it the best.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.000
So it's been a mixed bag,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.720
although we are adding new features to our YouTube video.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.760
We're trying a new experimental encoding

21:17.760 --> 21:19.760
that will post the video on YouTube

21:19.760 --> 21:21.640
and in the show description section,

21:21.640 --> 21:24.680
include time links for the different chapters of the show.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.520
Slick.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.120
Yeah, that's something we're working on for a bit.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
So we've been making changes for a few weeks

21:29.120 --> 21:30.920
on the Linux Unplugged program.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.080
And the core of it is,

21:34.080 --> 21:35.640
if you haven't updated your RSS feeds,

21:35.640 --> 21:38.480
it'd be a good time to go to linuxunplugged.com

21:38.480 --> 21:40.240
and slash RSS is the feed directly,

21:40.240 --> 21:42.360
linuxunplugged.com slash RSS.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.720
Subscribe to that new feed,

21:43.720 --> 21:44.560
let us know what you think,

21:44.560 --> 21:46.040
and start sending in your feedback about it

21:46.040 --> 21:47.240
at the slash contact.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.880
So you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

21:49.880 --> 21:51.840
and let us know what you think.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.040
Because it's been a slow edit of change

21:54.040 --> 21:55.720
and we're going through another change.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.040
So we'll have,

21:57.040 --> 21:59.080
we've hired someone to do the editing for a bit

21:59.080 --> 22:02.360
and see how that works and see what you guys think.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.200
So I have been editing the show for the last few weeks.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.680
I'll be pulling back a bit.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.040
I'll still be involved with all that stuff,

22:08.040 --> 22:10.800
but more changes are coming, but they're starting now.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.760
We're sort of at the end of it all.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.400
So it's a good time to kind of take stock

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
and see what everybody thinks.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.000
And if you're on the YouTube side of things,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.080
just be patient with us

22:18.080 --> 22:20.360
as we sort of retool some of that workflow

22:20.360 --> 22:22.160
because that stuff is a changing.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.520
But it's exciting times in the Unplugged universe.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.600
Times would be a changing.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.440
Yeah, yeah.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.720
Oh, and also speaking of times changing,

22:27.720 --> 22:30.080
Tech Talk Today is back on the air twice a week,

22:30.080 --> 22:31.720
technology show, Tech Talk Talk Today.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.560
Yeah, yeah.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.480
With me and Ange predominantly,

22:33.480 --> 22:34.720
but we're going to have folks in town

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
for Linux Fest Northwest.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.480
So I'll probably try to get folks to jump on the mic

22:37.480 --> 22:38.720
and hang out with us.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.120
Special guest stars.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.880
Yeah, I bet that Noah Chalaya,

22:41.880 --> 22:43.080
I bet I could talk that Noah Chalaya

22:43.080 --> 22:44.360
and that Alan Jude.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.200
There you go.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.040
Getting on the mic from time to time.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.800
And then of course, we'll do a live,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.400
we may do a live Linux Unplugged from Linux Fest.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
I don't know.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.880
I think we're also going to try to do a Tech Talk.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.560
So we've got a lot we're good doing,

22:54.560 --> 22:56.440
but you can just stay subscribed.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.800
You'll get the best stuff there at linuxunplugged.com

22:58.800 --> 23:02.120
slash RSS to get the feed directly.

23:02.120 --> 23:05.000
All right, so let's move into a couple of final news items

23:05.000 --> 23:05.840
for the day.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.560
And let's also then get into the huge item of the day.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.360
The one that I think people are still processing

23:12.360 --> 23:15.400
and that is that Microsoft is now shipping a Linux product

23:15.400 --> 23:16.600
based on the Linux kernel,

23:17.480 --> 23:19.360
which I think has caught a lot of people by surprise

23:19.360 --> 23:20.200
this week.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.880
So we'll talk about that as well.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.000
But first we'll mention DigitalOcean.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.840
Here's that.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.960
Hold on Wes, let me pull out the prop paper.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.280
You ready?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.360
We gotta be prepared for this.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.560
This is serious business.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.000
dio.co slash unplugged.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.440
That's where you go to get a $100 credit.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.760
dio.co slash unplugged.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.480
Go there, sign up with a new account

23:38.480 --> 23:40.880
and get a $100 credit for 60 days.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.280
You can try out their new mix and match droplet there.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.240
Flexible droplet for $15 a month.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.880
You choose how much CPU and disk and memory you need.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.800
You mix and match the different resources.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.440
They also have CPU optimized droplets

23:52.440 --> 23:55.760
with massive high-end, great, just huge,

23:55.760 --> 23:57.160
just massively powerful.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.480
And then if you want to,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.200
you can just throw in a few hundred gigs of RAM.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.760
Just throw in a few hundred gigs of RAM too.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.440
I don't know what you're doing,

24:05.440 --> 24:06.320
but damn, it's amazing.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.000
I mean, they have a whole scale.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.880
But for me, for my humble needs,

24:11.880 --> 24:14.600
I have my favorite sweet spot at three cents an hour.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.840
Fact, the rigs that I don't have at three cents an hour,

24:19.840 --> 24:22.320
they got upgrades recently from Digital Ocean.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.680
And now it's like, they're more than,

24:23.680 --> 24:25.080
I was like, I already have them as like,

24:25.080 --> 24:26.760
at $5 a month total.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.600
Like that's plenty.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.080
Cause they're just doing like metric collection

24:29.080 --> 24:31.640
or they're like alerts or it's one's a bot.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.320
And it's like, it doesn't need a lot.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.680
But Digital Ocean recently adjust all their prices

24:35.680 --> 24:39.160
and retroactively just upgraded my machine.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.200
So my machines just got better recently.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.040
It's so great.

24:42.040 --> 24:42.880
You didn't do anything.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.720
They're just better.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.560
I love it.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.120
Do.co slash unplugged.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.240
You can deploy a system at less than 55 seconds.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
Everything is using SSDs.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.160
They have 12 data centers all over the world.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.440
20 gigabit connections, 40 gigabit connections.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.280
I don't know, it's gigabits.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.720
I mean, they're just gigabits for days.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.400
Plus private networking on the backend.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.520
Block storage, they have available as well

25:01.520 --> 25:04.720
as S3 compliant spaces, storage.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.760
Very nice.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.960
Network level firewalls, monitoring baked in

25:08.960 --> 25:11.680
to give you metrics on your CPU, your disk

25:11.680 --> 25:13.320
and graph it all for you.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.400
It's a really, really, really compelling offer.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.360
And you can get a hundred dollars of credit to play around

25:18.360 --> 25:23.360
when you go to do.co slash unplugged, do.co slash unplugged.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.600
Well, my favorite Linux video editor

25:25.600 --> 25:29.280
is having a development sprint as we're on the air, I think.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.160
Or it's at least in the next few days, if not that.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.760
Their team is going to Paris

25:33.760 --> 25:35.000
and they're going to dedicate the time

25:35.000 --> 25:36.680
to discuss long-term goals,

25:36.680 --> 25:39.520
review application workflow with professional editors

25:39.520 --> 25:41.920
and prepare for the next major release,

25:41.920 --> 25:45.040
which is labeled 18.08.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.400
So the KDN Live team is going there.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.000
And then after that, after that,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.440
they're going to the Libre, at least a sub part of the team

25:50.440 --> 25:52.240
is going to Libre graphics meeting

25:52.240 --> 25:54.680
for a KDN Live workshop on the 30th.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.960
So if you're going to be in Paris,

25:55.960 --> 25:57.040
you can come say hi to the team.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.880
If you're going to the Libre graphics meeting,

25:58.880 --> 26:00.800
you can go say hi to some of the KDN Live team.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.960
That's fantastic.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.160
So a couple of weeks ago, I'm like,

26:04.160 --> 26:05.600
who is using KDN Live?

26:05.600 --> 26:08.160
Is anybody else using KDN Live in production?

26:08.160 --> 26:11.760
And I said that Crazy Cast over at Linux Game Cast

26:11.760 --> 26:14.440
and Van Stone was editing an open shot.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.880
I have been corrected.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.600
They are actually using KDN Live.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.000
So yeah, another one of the books.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm trying to keep track.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.640
So if you know anybody out there,

26:21.640 --> 26:24.160
a YouTuber or actually somebody

26:24.160 --> 26:25.440
who's maybe not on YouTube too,

26:25.440 --> 26:27.840
just somebody that's just making content

26:27.840 --> 26:29.000
in some other capacity,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.280
I'd love to know who is using KDN Live out there.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.120
Me.

26:33.120 --> 26:33.960
Who's me?

26:33.960 --> 26:34.800
Who said that?

26:34.800 --> 26:35.640
Popey.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.480
Oh, Popey.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.320
Oh, what are you using?

26:37.320 --> 26:39.680
Popey is Ubuntu podcast video and I didn't even know it.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.600
Well, it is, but we don't use KDN Live.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.760
I used it just briefly today

26:43.760 --> 26:46.640
because I wanted to record a video

26:46.640 --> 26:49.680
and I needed to redact some personally identifiable

26:49.680 --> 26:51.280
information and I didn't know how to do it.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.320
And it turns out that I just Googled

26:53.320 --> 26:55.960
blur credit card info or something like that.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.400
And I found a tutorial.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.360
And within under a minute,

26:59.360 --> 27:01.240
I figured it out and added an effect,

27:01.240 --> 27:03.600
drew a box around the thing that I wanted to pixelate

27:03.600 --> 27:05.120
and it just did it, rendered it out, done.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.800
It was so easy.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.560
KDN Live is just awesome.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.400
Really?

27:09.400 --> 27:10.240
Wow.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.200
So what about the fact that it was,

27:12.200 --> 27:13.360
video's moving, right?

27:13.360 --> 27:15.400
So the object kind of moves around in the frame.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.280
No, it was a webpage with credit card info in it.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.760
But it did show how you could move it.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.920
But I didn't need to do that.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.320
I didn't follow the rest of the tutorial.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.240
I just went as far as,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.280
oh, that's what I need to do.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.160
That's enough, shut the video down.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.480
I was, yeah, it was great.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.600
Yeah, I've played with it lightly

27:32.600 --> 27:34.520
and I like it quite a bit.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.520
And I know that when you're working

27:37.520 --> 27:39.680
with really long projects, that's sometimes,

27:39.680 --> 27:40.560
that's why I was asking you like,

27:40.560 --> 27:41.960
what is the Linux game cast using these days?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.960
Cause when you're working with really long projects,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.560
a program can get a lot, lot more crashy.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.200
It's just totally makes a big difference.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.520
If you ever watched him,

27:50.520 --> 27:54.520
he sometimes live streams him editing his own shows.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.360
I think on a Sunday afternoon, he does it.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.280
My time.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.240
And I've watched him on Twitch sometime

27:59.240 --> 28:00.480
and he's just like chatting to people

28:00.480 --> 28:02.160
and saying, does this music fit here?

28:02.160 --> 28:03.160
What should I do here?

28:03.160 --> 28:04.440
And you could just see him going over

28:04.440 --> 28:05.480
and over and over the edit.

28:05.480 --> 28:09.600
And I don't, I think I've seen Kaden live crash once

28:09.600 --> 28:11.720
for him on a live stream.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.600
But yeah, it seems to work for him.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.040
Now I haven't seen it, I'm always,

28:15.040 --> 28:16.760
that's usually probably when I'm recording LAN.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.080
So I don't really have a chance, but yeah.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.400
I've been experimenting on a couple

28:20.400 --> 28:21.880
of behind the scenes projects just for like,

28:21.880 --> 28:24.360
when we go to Linux Fest, if we have a camera with us,

28:24.360 --> 28:26.200
how do I want to edit the resulting footage?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.360
Because if I don't figure this out now,

28:28.360 --> 28:30.120
it's gonna end up on a Mac.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.440
That's what my thought process has been.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.320
And I've also been experimenting with Reaper,

28:33.320 --> 28:34.560
which is an audio editor.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.400
Oh yeah, nice.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.200
On the other end of things on Linux.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.640
I think the situation with Apple and the Mac Pro

28:40.640 --> 28:43.720
is the canary in the coal mine for Apple,

28:43.720 --> 28:46.960
that they have no idea how to build high-end computers.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.680
They have no idea.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.080
The people that are making those computers

28:50.080 --> 28:51.280
have obviously lost touch.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.880
They don't understand thermal throttling.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.320
They don't understand all of these things.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.800
And it's just, I think it's too late.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.320
Even if they ship something decent in 2019

28:58.320 --> 29:00.440
by hiring a team of highly paid professionals

29:00.440 --> 29:03.720
to tell them, yes, you're doing everything right, Johnny,

29:03.720 --> 29:04.560
I think it's too late.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.920
So it's just not a professional workstation anymore,

29:07.920 --> 29:10.560
unless your workload is doable on laptops,

29:10.560 --> 29:11.760
or laptop-like components,

29:11.760 --> 29:13.640
or systems that are cooled like laptops.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.920
So I think it's behoovent upon all of us,

29:16.920 --> 29:18.360
if that's a word I can make up,

29:18.360 --> 29:21.240
to try to replicate our workflow

29:21.240 --> 29:24.560
or replace parts of our workflow as much as possible on Linux.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.240
The only problem is KDN Live's getting better

29:27.240 --> 29:28.480
for simple edits for me,

29:28.480 --> 29:31.400
but Reaper is commercial software.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.360
And so it's like, am I really any better off?

29:34.360 --> 29:38.040
Because I'm just moving to another commercial solution,

29:38.040 --> 29:39.560
but it needs to be sophisticated.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.480
It needs to have certain support for industry plugins.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.760
It needs to support multi-track.

29:43.760 --> 29:48.160
I've got a mixer with ungodly amounts of inputs and outputs,

29:48.160 --> 29:50.760
and my recorder needs to be able to read all of those

29:50.760 --> 29:52.120
and bring us all in on our own track.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.880
And it's stuff that just Audacity can't even do.

29:55.880 --> 29:56.880
It's not even capable of doing.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.040
So you have to have a certain level of software to do this.

30:00.040 --> 30:00.880
It's a start, I think.

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
It tends to be commercial.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.280
Yeah, at least it's on Linux though.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.280
Yeah, no one's trying to convince me.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.720
I'm not so convinced yet.

30:06.720 --> 30:07.920
So I'll be curious to see what comes out

30:07.920 --> 30:08.920
of the KDN Live sprint.

30:08.920 --> 30:09.840
When these things happen,

30:09.840 --> 30:11.480
it seems to be pretty good for these projects.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.160
Like the results that we get out of it

30:13.160 --> 30:14.600
seem to be pretty, pretty positive.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.960
You know, I don't think I've given it a shot yet,

30:15.960 --> 30:18.360
so now I have a new something to play with.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.360
You ought to do like a day in Seattle with Wes.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.200
Yeah, totally.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.120
And then edit it on KDN Live.

30:23.120 --> 30:23.960
I think I will.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.800
I would so watch that.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.640
Yeah.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.720
You could be a vlogger, Wes.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.560
You could.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.520
I would watch the Wes vlog.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.360
Downtown Seattle of Wes vlog.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.560
Is there any Seattle vloggers?

30:31.560 --> 30:34.760
You could just own the market

30:34.760 --> 30:37.160
and become the next YouTube star,

30:37.160 --> 30:38.240
which sounds wonderful.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.320
Yeah, great.

30:40.200 --> 30:44.360
Yeah, I've been debating whether to talk about this on air.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.760
And so I'm not gonna put links in the show notes

30:46.760 --> 30:49.240
because I don't want to encourage traffic,

30:49.240 --> 30:50.400
but I also feel like it's something

30:50.400 --> 30:51.560
that we need to be aware of.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.200
And so I don't know if you guys have seen,

30:54.200 --> 30:55.880
and I really don't know much about it,

30:55.880 --> 30:59.160
but what's been going on with Linux Deepin this week?

30:59.160 --> 31:01.040
It's really, it's a disgrace, really.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.920
So there was an unsubstantiated YouTube video

31:04.920 --> 31:08.440
that goes live that says that Linux Deepin is spyware

31:08.440 --> 31:10.680
and that it's spying on you.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.160
And then the project, after it gets enough traction,

31:13.160 --> 31:16.000
of course, because Reddit is a cesspool of de-bags,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.240
it gets upvoted, it starts getting a lot of attention,

31:18.240 --> 31:22.040
so it becomes on the Deepin Project's radar.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.000
And they respond with a blog post,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.400
and of course, there is a communication barrier here,

31:26.400 --> 31:28.680
so there was a couple of things that are misunderstood.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.040
And they come back and say, well, we're not really spying.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.440
What we're doing is we're collecting the number of installs

31:33.440 --> 31:36.080
and they list the three or four data points

31:36.080 --> 31:38.200
that are pretty basic bitch metrics

31:38.200 --> 31:40.000
that aren't really gonna offend anybody

31:40.000 --> 31:42.400
unless you're looking to be offended.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.560
And of course, then there's a follow-up video

31:44.560 --> 31:49.560
that then sort of just makes hay out of their admission

31:50.480 --> 31:52.080
that they are collecting some metrics.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.680
And I told you, here's proof of the spying.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.120
And then everybody in the Reddit comments,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.760
oh, they're saying they're not spying,

31:58.760 --> 31:59.880
but then they write a blog post

31:59.880 --> 32:02.280
saying exactly how they're spying on us.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.080
And it's just outrage after outrage.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.080
And I think we have a problem here because,

32:10.080 --> 32:11.120
and I won't go through the whole thing,

32:11.120 --> 32:13.080
but you guys know I'm a big believer

32:13.080 --> 32:16.880
that unlike the Windows admin community

32:16.880 --> 32:19.240
or the Apple user community

32:19.240 --> 32:21.440
or these different sub-sects of technology,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.760
the open source community is vulnerable

32:23.760 --> 32:25.800
to this sort of insidious infighting

32:25.800 --> 32:27.400
in a way that I think is destructive

32:27.400 --> 32:29.880
to people's motivation to contribute to open source code.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.840
So I think it's worth talking about just really quickly.

32:32.840 --> 32:33.680
I won't go into it

32:33.680 --> 32:35.160
because there's episodes dedicated to it

32:35.160 --> 32:36.880
if you wanna hear this.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.880
But I think we have a particular problem with YouTube.

32:40.880 --> 32:45.640
It is a toxic cesspool of clickbait one-upism.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.560
And it's compounded by adpocalypse

32:48.560 --> 32:50.160
and constant demonetization

32:50.160 --> 32:52.280
that forces people to continue to pivot

32:52.280 --> 32:54.240
to try to flail around

32:54.240 --> 32:56.360
and find a new way to get people's attention

32:56.360 --> 32:58.160
and prey on their emotions

32:58.160 --> 33:00.240
so that way they can click on a YouTube video

33:00.240 --> 33:03.240
and somebody can monetize that click for a penny.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.280
At the same time,

33:04.280 --> 33:06.400
there is competition inherent in the platform

33:06.400 --> 33:07.720
because there's multiple people

33:07.720 --> 33:10.160
that are trying to cover these topics.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.480
You've noticed that probably if you are on YouTube,

33:12.480 --> 33:16.160
you've noticed, oh, well, really since we ended last,

33:16.160 --> 33:17.840
Jupiter Broadcasting has been significantly

33:17.840 --> 33:19.480
pulling back on YouTube.

33:19.480 --> 33:23.520
And the rationale has been because I think it's toxic

33:23.520 --> 33:27.880
and I think it's damaging to the open source community

33:27.880 --> 33:31.240
because of its inherent nature of how the system works.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.320
It's designed to encourage clickbait

33:34.520 --> 33:36.640
because of the way the YouTube algorithm works.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.560
It's designed to encourage people

33:38.560 --> 33:41.560
to try to elicit an emotional click.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.840
But the other problem is,

33:43.760 --> 33:44.960
and this is a secret that Google

33:44.960 --> 33:46.480
doesn't really like to tell you

33:46.480 --> 33:49.320
because it's really bad for ads,

33:49.320 --> 33:51.480
but anybody who creates content for YouTube

33:51.480 --> 33:52.320
for a little while,

33:52.320 --> 33:55.520
and I've been doing it for about 10 years,

33:55.520 --> 33:56.640
I've been posting to YouTube,

33:56.640 --> 33:58.160
so I have some standing here.

34:00.440 --> 34:05.080
A huge portion of the audience on YouTube is kids.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.560
And I'm grateful you guys are watching.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.880
This isn't me saying, hey, kids suck.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.680
It's just saying the reality is

34:11.680 --> 34:15.560
a huge portion of the YouTube audience is children.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.880
Not all of them are logged in, but it's a huge percentage.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.000
And especially on the large YouTubers,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.440
like your Roman Atwoods, your Casey Neistats,

34:24.440 --> 34:26.920
your large channels where they get hundreds of thousands,

34:26.920 --> 34:28.120
if not millions of views,

34:29.040 --> 34:32.000
a ginormous percentage of that

34:32.000 --> 34:33.920
that Google does not want you to know about,

34:33.920 --> 34:36.800
because again, that doesn't play well to advertisers,

34:36.800 --> 34:37.760
is children.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.360
When you remove the child metric from YouTube,

34:41.360 --> 34:43.600
what's left, the adults,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.960
well, you have to realize that now these people

34:45.960 --> 34:48.480
that are making videos about Linux and open source

34:48.480 --> 34:51.720
are serving to a very small niche of YouTube already,

34:51.720 --> 34:52.560
the adults.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.720
And then it's a niche within that niche

34:54.720 --> 34:57.280
of people who care about Linux and open source

34:57.280 --> 34:59.880
and are willing to watch production values

34:59.880 --> 35:01.080
that tend to vary,

35:01.080 --> 35:03.840
and people who tend to be varying presenters

35:03.840 --> 35:04.880
talk about these topics.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.280
That's like a super double, triple niche, right?

35:07.280 --> 35:09.640
Now we're way down the stack.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.360
And so these people that are creating these videos

35:11.360 --> 35:14.600
are really fighting for a small number of audience

35:14.600 --> 35:15.440
on YouTube.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.640
And I would argue it's a number that is actually too small

35:18.640 --> 35:20.680
for them to successfully monetize.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.480
So we have this really toxic nature

35:23.480 --> 35:25.200
where they're competing against each other

35:25.200 --> 35:27.360
because you only have so much time in the day

35:27.360 --> 35:28.600
to watch a YouTube video.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.240
They're competing against an algorithm

35:31.240 --> 35:33.160
that's a total black box,

35:33.160 --> 35:37.440
and it drives clickbait nature of content creators

35:37.440 --> 35:40.520
to put something out there that I just need you to watch

35:40.520 --> 35:41.840
because I have to grow my audience

35:41.840 --> 35:46.080
because unless I'm getting about 25,000 views per video,

35:46.080 --> 35:47.720
I can't really monetize this,

35:47.720 --> 35:49.840
especially if I'm living anywhere on either side

35:49.840 --> 35:51.920
of the East or West Coast of the United States.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.760
You gotta get around 25, 30,000 views per video

35:55.760 --> 35:57.080
to make a decent living.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.680
That's not accounting for ad pocalypse.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.640
That's not accounting for demonetization.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.000
So don't say a bad word.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.840
It's a very, very difficult landscape,

36:06.840 --> 36:08.720
and it pushes people to do things

36:08.720 --> 36:11.320
like call a Linux distro spyware

36:11.320 --> 36:13.680
simply because it's checking how many people

36:13.680 --> 36:15.200
have installed Firefox.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.520
And it creates this negative momentum

36:17.520 --> 36:20.800
and this negative discussion and this confirmation bias

36:20.800 --> 36:24.440
that you see then spread throughout discussion forums.

36:24.440 --> 36:29.440
Do you think that Deepin was looked at more closely

36:29.440 --> 36:31.880
because it originates from China?

36:31.880 --> 36:32.720
Yeah, yeah.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.200
And do you think that that betrays

36:36.200 --> 36:39.040
the content providers mentality?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.280
Yeah, and maybe the people

36:40.280 --> 36:42.480
that all got their pitchforks as well,

36:42.480 --> 36:45.480
although I could easily see it happening to Ubuntu,

36:45.480 --> 36:48.440
especially if Canonical hadn't been fully out ahead of,

36:48.440 --> 36:51.360
hey, in six months, we're gonna start collecting

36:51.360 --> 36:53.080
some basic metrics that we should have been collecting

36:53.080 --> 36:53.920
all along.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.960
If Canonical hadn't messaged that ahead of time,

36:55.960 --> 36:58.000
it would have, and you guys, that's why you messaged it,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.560
that's why Canonical messaged it, right?

36:59.560 --> 37:02.840
Because it would have been a huge controversy.

37:02.840 --> 37:07.840
Yes, but I just feel that there is a mentality

37:07.840 --> 37:10.120
which is because something comes from China,

37:10.120 --> 37:13.120
it should be eyed with suspicion first.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.240
Absolutely, I think that's absolutely true.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.320
I'm not saying I subscribe to that, by the way.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.760
I think that it's actually a rather dangerous position,

37:20.760 --> 37:22.720
a default position to have.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.760
But I feel that Deepin has been picked out

37:26.760 --> 37:30.360
in this way more than once in the past

37:30.360 --> 37:34.680
by a similar group of content makers on YouTube.

37:34.680 --> 37:38.440
There is a common theme that something that comes from China

37:38.440 --> 37:40.400
is like cheap Chinese rubbish.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.680
Yet what a lot of people forget is

37:42.680 --> 37:45.040
they also buy expensive Chinese stuff.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.000
Like, you know, they're very expensive device

37:48.000 --> 37:49.680
that they fondle all day, every day.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.760
It was almost certainly made in the Far East.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
That's okay, but it's the cheap Chinese rubbish

37:53.760 --> 37:56.520
that's terrible and decrepit.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.480
Decrying everything is cheap Chinese crap

37:58.480 --> 38:00.800
because they can buy something cheap on Alibaba.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.840
But it turns out it's actually cheap

38:01.840 --> 38:02.920
to manufacture something over there.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.000
That doesn't mean it's all crap, right?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.480
And the same goes for software.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.640
Just because there's a vast number of developers

38:08.640 --> 38:12.080
over there creating software at low cost

38:12.080 --> 38:14.280
doesn't make it inherently rubbish.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.920
Yes, they might make mistakes, so does everyone.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.600
Nobody in any of those threads on Reddit is perfect.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.640
None of them have ever not made a mistake in their life

38:22.640 --> 38:25.720
and never been found out and then everything's okay.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.920
Like, everyone makes mistakes, right?

38:27.920 --> 38:29.200
And these people made a mistake.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.480
There's a communication barrier

38:30.480 --> 38:33.240
between our Western YouTube friends

38:33.240 --> 38:35.880
and those guys over in the Far East.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.760
And I think there's a massive misinterpretation

38:38.760 --> 38:43.760
of basically what was in essence like Google Analytics

38:44.080 --> 38:46.000
that everyone has turned on

38:46.000 --> 38:48.920
unless they've got an ad blocker and everyone uses.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.600
Yet it's not okay for them to use it over there

38:51.600 --> 38:53.640
because they are them, that's why.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.280
Yep, pretty much that.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.680
It does feel, and you see it too, it's not just China.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.280
You know, a lot of people don't trust Telegram

39:01.280 --> 39:02.760
because it comes from Russia.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.040
And that's reason enough to be skeptical of it.

39:05.040 --> 39:09.720
But that's just as bad because it doesn't come from Russia.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.320
It's not like Russia is one amorphous blocker.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.280
That is how it is seen.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.120
Right, exactly.

39:14.120 --> 39:17.680
It's one guy who happens to be Russian who made that thing.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.520
Russia is a effing huge place with a lot of people in it

39:21.520 --> 39:22.800
that do lots of different things.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.600
One guy who happens to be Russian

39:24.600 --> 39:26.600
doesn't make all of Telegram bad.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.160
There are other things that make Telegram bad,

39:28.160 --> 39:29.000
but it's not bad.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.840
Yeah, I think, Bobby, you nailed it on the head right there.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.760
I couldn't say it better myself.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.000
And so maybe that's part of what gets me going about it

39:35.000 --> 39:38.080
is the sort of insidious thing that sort of creeps in.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.800
You don't even realize it's what's driving your motivation.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.920
And it just seems so damaging in the open source community.

39:43.920 --> 39:47.080
I guess part of it comes, I got another email this week

39:47.080 --> 39:50.080
from, I don't know if he's a well-known developer,

39:50.080 --> 39:51.600
but the project is well-known.

39:51.600 --> 39:56.240
And he's quitting because of just feeling

39:56.240 --> 39:58.680
like the most common thread in there

39:58.680 --> 40:01.640
is this awful sense of entitlement

40:01.640 --> 40:04.760
and this sort of inflexibility in respecting the fact

40:04.760 --> 40:06.320
that I'm a human being.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.480
And it's just really sad to see that.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.720
I can't agree more with that sentiment.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.120
You know, the other thing that some

40:13.120 --> 40:18.280
of these YouTube videos and other outlets on Reddit

40:18.280 --> 40:20.560
is this huge sense of entitlement.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.960
I'm just going to dog pile on this thing

40:22.960 --> 40:26.320
that you make in your spare time for the love of it.

40:26.320 --> 40:29.360
I'm going to criticize it like it's a professional project.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.360
I'm going to build my own profile off

40:33.360 --> 40:38.080
the back of shitposting about whatever Linux distribution

40:38.080 --> 40:40.800
or whatever application it is that you think you've

40:40.800 --> 40:42.760
got superior opinions on.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.400
And it is extremely demoralizing for the people

40:45.400 --> 40:49.640
that invest huge amounts of time in a positive way

40:49.640 --> 40:52.920
to actually try and create something for anyone

40:52.920 --> 40:56.640
to use free of charge in open source.

40:56.640 --> 41:01.120
And then to have it shit on by a bunch of monkeys in Reddit

41:01.120 --> 41:03.520
is really disheartening.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.480
And it does make you think twice sometimes.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.360
You know, I'm sat here this evening

41:07.360 --> 41:09.320
whilst we're talking in another window.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.440
I'm fixing the last of the bugs that

41:11.440 --> 41:14.520
are blockers for release next week.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.280
And I've been doing that to the early hours of the morning

41:17.280 --> 41:18.640
for several weeks now.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.760
And I'm pretty tired.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.280
And when you see posts like that in the corners of the internet

41:23.280 --> 41:27.280
where these discussions run, it really

41:27.280 --> 41:29.520
turns you off putting the effort in.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.920
Yeah, I find it super irony too.

41:32.920 --> 41:37.400
So people that are sort of stuck in this cycle of trying

41:37.400 --> 41:40.880
to create crazy content so that way they can build audience,

41:40.880 --> 41:43.200
so that way they can reach sustainability,

41:43.200 --> 41:45.320
it's sort of like pissing in your own well.

41:45.320 --> 41:49.080
And they have devastating consequences

41:49.080 --> 41:51.520
on people that are working on a passion project, that

41:51.520 --> 41:53.720
are doing something that fulfills them.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.720
And then these people come along and they just devastate them.

41:57.720 --> 42:01.160
And the irony is, how fulfilling must their work be?

42:01.160 --> 42:03.440
If they're creating content like this,

42:03.440 --> 42:06.320
that is just this shit content, these shit posts,

42:06.320 --> 42:08.720
they can't be proud of themselves.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.200
They can't be fulfilled by this.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.640
And so the very thing that's probably

42:11.640 --> 42:13.640
robbing them of fulfillment they use

42:13.640 --> 42:16.040
to take away from somebody who has found something that

42:16.040 --> 42:17.600
gives them fulfillment.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.560
It's sick.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.080
It's the smug attitude that you see

42:21.080 --> 42:26.000
in the comments and some of the content as well.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.400
I'm making a funny now by pointing out this thing

42:31.400 --> 42:32.160
that I've found.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.360
And it's just like, well, if that's

42:33.360 --> 42:36.000
the best you've got to contribute to open source,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.320
I'd rather you weren't a part of it and shut the fuck up.

42:39.320 --> 42:43.920
Yeah, I have found that it's not everywhere.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.960
And it's not like I wouldn't say most

42:46.960 --> 42:49.280
of these things about anyone in the Jupiter broadcasting

42:49.280 --> 42:49.800
audience.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.480
I have had so many wonderful interactions.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.240
I get notes from people that just say,

42:54.240 --> 42:55.320
thanks for working as hard as you do.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.400
Thanks for doing what you do.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.360
I get a lot of that.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.280
I mean, I get haters too, but I get a lot of that.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.440
But there are corners where it's really prevalent.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.840
And it seems to be areas where there's

43:06.840 --> 43:09.640
a lot of incentives around getting as many clicks

43:09.640 --> 43:12.840
as possible, whether it's upvotes or ad revenue.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.720
Wherever those dynamics come to play,

43:14.720 --> 43:18.040
it just seems to be really toxic for open source.

43:18.040 --> 43:18.560
I don't know.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.720
I think we've made this point enough.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.840
But it's something I've been thinking about watching

43:22.840 --> 43:24.040
this go down with Deepin.

43:24.040 --> 43:26.760
Because I see this go across my radar, and it's like,

43:26.760 --> 43:27.560
how do I treat this?

43:27.560 --> 43:28.720
Is this a news story?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.440
I don't want to even give this legitimacy.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.880
Now, if there was legitimately spying taking place,

43:33.880 --> 43:36.040
I absolutely would cover that.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.480
But when it's this sort of rough shot,

43:38.480 --> 43:40.160
no fact-based opinion stuff.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.320
It really breaks the trust that is oftentimes

43:42.320 --> 43:44.280
kind of the heart of the open source community.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.240
I kind of feel like we do this with stuff from Microsoft,

43:46.240 --> 43:46.720
too.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.600
It came from China.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.560
It came from Russia.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.680
It came from Microsoft.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.440
So therefore, we're automatically skeptical.

43:52.440 --> 43:55.600
And it was in full force this week

43:55.600 --> 43:59.400
when Microsoft announced Azure Sphere, which

43:59.400 --> 44:02.760
is a multi-part component.

44:02.760 --> 44:05.760
But the most headline-grabbing component

44:05.760 --> 44:07.920
is the fact that there's an OS involved

44:07.920 --> 44:09.880
that uses the Linux kernel.

44:09.880 --> 44:13.280
And I have seen everything from this is now everybody.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.120
Actually, the most common thing I've seen

44:15.120 --> 44:19.280
is this is Microsoft embracing and extinguishing Linux.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.760
They've begun the extinguish phase.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.160
And everybody's jumping to 11 on this one.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.760
So we decided, let's actually talk

44:26.760 --> 44:31.240
to the people behind the project and figure out what's going on.

44:31.240 --> 44:35.040
And so we discussed with a couple of folks from Microsoft

44:35.040 --> 44:38.040
that are involved in building the product, what it is.

44:38.040 --> 44:38.680
What's going on?

44:38.680 --> 44:39.480
What kind of Linux?

44:39.480 --> 44:40.960
What are they using it for?

44:40.960 --> 44:41.920
What's the hardware?

44:41.920 --> 44:42.840
All of that stuff.

44:42.840 --> 44:45.960
And so we'll share with you what we picked up.

44:45.960 --> 44:46.920
Does that make sense?

44:46.920 --> 44:47.880
We'll share what we learned.

44:47.880 --> 44:48.720
We got the deets.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.720
We got the deets.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.480
But first, let's mention Linux Academy.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.840
It's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.000
You go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial

44:56.000 --> 44:57.400
and support the show.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.440
It's a platform to learn more about Linux.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.880
And once you sign up, you get unlimited access.

45:01.880 --> 45:05.080
And they're about to add a whole bunch of new stuff

45:05.080 --> 45:06.280
in the month of April.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.640
70 new courses, challenges, learning activities.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.320
It actually breaks down like this.

45:11.320 --> 45:14.120
20 new courses, as well as some content refreshes,

45:14.120 --> 45:17.320
50 new cloud assessments, hands-on learning activities,

45:17.320 --> 45:20.560
and new challenges baked in, as well as taking advantage

45:20.560 --> 45:23.480
of their new real-time grader platform

45:23.480 --> 45:25.640
so you can get feedback as you're learning.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.400
Ooh-ee.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.240
Isn't that great?

45:27.240 --> 45:28.000
That is.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.680
Yeah, so go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.520
Sign up for the free seven-day trial.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.680
You support the show.

45:33.680 --> 45:34.600
And then check it out.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.520
They got hands-on scenario-based labs.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.320
They spin up servers on demand.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.200
You pick the distro and adjust the courseware and the servers.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.200
They have full-time human beings that can help you

45:43.200 --> 45:44.280
if you ever get stuck.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.840
If you're busy, they've got a course schedule.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.520
It'll work with your busy schedules.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.000
And they got learning paths, which

45:49.000 --> 45:51.040
are a series of content and courseware planned

45:51.040 --> 45:53.200
by instructors for specific career tracks.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.080
Now, you combine that with all the new content

45:55.080 --> 45:56.720
they're rolling out in the month of April,

45:56.720 --> 45:58.680
it's never been a better time to sign up.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.960
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.120
You can also try out the iOS and Android app, the flashcards,

46:04.120 --> 46:05.920
which are forked by the community,

46:05.920 --> 46:08.040
and the tiny bits of wisdom that they call nuggets that

46:08.040 --> 46:09.760
go deep dives into single topics.

46:09.760 --> 46:12.240
Like, you want to learn file permissions on Linux.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.680
You want to learn firewalling.

46:13.680 --> 46:16.560
You want to learn basic networking and ports on Linux.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.600
They have deep dives into those specific topics.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.760
Other topics too, including some development ones

46:20.760 --> 46:22.240
at Linux Academy as well.

46:22.240 --> 46:25.560
I love me some nuggets.

46:25.560 --> 46:28.360
And MexiFries, because we had little MexiFries with us too.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.440
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.640
Go there, sign up for a free seven day trial,

46:32.640 --> 46:34.600
and try out the full featured training library

46:34.600 --> 46:36.640
with everything you need to learn new skills

46:36.640 --> 46:37.640
and advance your career.

46:37.640 --> 46:40.240
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.000
Big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring

46:42.000 --> 46:43.920
the unplugged program.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.760
So help me not mistake the pronunciation

46:46.760 --> 46:49.160
of the primary gentleman that we spoke with.

46:49.160 --> 46:50.000
Was it Galen?

46:50.000 --> 46:50.760
Galen Hunt.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.720
Yeah, it was Galen Hunt.

46:52.720 --> 46:56.600
And Galen is the author of a whole line

46:56.600 --> 46:58.840
of publications of papers that came out of Microsoft

46:58.840 --> 47:01.320
that if you read them, would almost

47:01.320 --> 47:03.480
kind of give you a clue of where they

47:03.480 --> 47:04.680
were going with all of this.

47:04.680 --> 47:08.760
Like the hint was out there.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.520
Like the one that was published last year,

47:10.520 --> 47:12.920
The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices,

47:12.920 --> 47:15.200
or Challenges to Building Scalable Services.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.200
And the background is you could see

47:18.200 --> 47:20.560
that there's been a lot of thought that went into this.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.880
So Wes and I wanted to be able to talk

47:22.880 --> 47:26.580
on some level of authority of what Azure Sphere is.

47:26.580 --> 47:29.280
And how Linux is being used by Microsoft.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.720
And so Azure Sphere, think of it as something that

47:31.720 --> 47:33.880
really has three aspects.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.840
Overall, it's a solution for companies

47:35.840 --> 47:38.600
that are building single chip computer products.

47:38.600 --> 47:42.360
Devices that are often even smaller than a Raspberry Pi.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.880
You know, truly like the toasters and the hair dryers

47:45.880 --> 47:48.320
that haven't yet been connected to Wi-Fi,

47:48.320 --> 47:49.840
but are just about to be.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.640
Right, things that are running like just little micro

47:51.640 --> 47:54.120
controllers now, maybe real time operating systems,

47:54.120 --> 47:56.440
not big full featured things.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.760
Yeah, we were joking, but actually very realistically,

47:58.760 --> 48:02.160
things like those Bluetooth sous vides and whatnot.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.840
It's really happening.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.240
And Microsoft estimates that there's probably 10 billion

48:07.240 --> 48:08.520
units around the world like this.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.680
I think that might have been a yearly number two that

48:10.680 --> 48:11.520
gets sold.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.720
Lower end devices that you just don't traditionally think of,

48:14.720 --> 48:17.200
but they would sometimes have like a real time operating

48:17.200 --> 48:18.320
system on there.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.840
Azure Sphere is stepping in here.

48:19.840 --> 48:23.240
They're sort of making a product for these manufacturers,

48:23.240 --> 48:25.800
a full end to end product to run on these devices.

48:25.800 --> 48:28.060
So it's three aspects, and this is

48:28.060 --> 48:29.360
where it starts to make sense.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.240
You've probably heard of the new MCUs,

48:31.240 --> 48:34.640
these machines that are a system all on this one slab.

48:34.640 --> 48:37.880
It's part of a hardware solution that vendors

48:37.880 --> 48:38.760
will be able to use.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.040
It'll also be available as a dev kit later on.

48:41.040 --> 48:45.040
And they've built in some of the similar hardware checks

48:45.040 --> 48:46.640
that they have in the Xbox.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.280
They took that hardware root of trust.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.560
Each device has its own secured identity.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.600
It uses secure boot capabilities.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.760
It verifies that the device software installed

48:55.760 --> 48:56.680
is legitimate.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.560
And it's also possible to check them with the server

48:58.560 --> 49:01.000
and have server side and client side checks as well.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.160
Microsoft's going to be licensing that silicon.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.600
And I didn't quite get the license out of them,

49:06.600 --> 49:09.880
but it sounds like it's going to be pretty liberal.

49:09.880 --> 49:10.720
And royalty free.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.460
Yeah.

49:11.460 --> 49:11.960
Yep.

49:11.960 --> 49:14.920
And the second bit is, so this Azure Sphere is three parts.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.720
That's part one, the hardware part.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.080
The second bit is the OS.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.200
This is where Linux sits.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.360
It's a multi-layered OS.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.940
And the reason why they call it that

49:22.940 --> 49:25.880
is there's a lower level that's doing the hardware and software

49:25.880 --> 49:26.600
verification.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.640
The second layer is the Linux kernel.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.640
And we pushed them for some details on this.

49:30.640 --> 49:31.960
And they shared it with us.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.560
It's using Linux kernel 4.9.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.240
And Wes asked them specifically, are you

49:37.240 --> 49:39.320
going to be tracking upstream kernel releases?

49:39.320 --> 49:41.600
Is it based on another project?

49:41.600 --> 49:43.400
Is this a derivative distro?

49:43.400 --> 49:45.400
It is upstream Linux kernel 4.9.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.960
And they said they're going to be aggressively tracking.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.480
Aggressively.

49:48.480 --> 49:49.360
That was their term.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.800
Yeah, aggressively tracking upstream with that.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.960
And so I asked, so what are you using Linux for specifically?

49:54.960 --> 49:58.840
And they kind of shy away from this a bit.

49:58.840 --> 50:01.760
Because to them, it's just part of a three-part solution.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.100
I know that sounds so corporate.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.840
But that's really how they see it.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.540
Linux is sort of just like this enabling technology stack.

50:07.540 --> 50:10.280
It's not like this huge come to Jesus over the GPL.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.560
It's just practical.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.040
Yeah, it wasn't designed around Linux.

50:13.040 --> 50:13.880
Linux isn't a focus.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.720
Linux was just a tool that fit into the architecture.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.400
So we said, so how are you using Linux?

50:18.400 --> 50:21.540
And so they're using process isolation via the Linux kernel.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.720
And they're using sandboxes for all the apps.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.520
And they're using the kernel features built into 4.9

50:26.520 --> 50:27.360
for sandboxing.

50:27.360 --> 50:29.440
And of course, they're using the networking stack

50:29.440 --> 50:30.360
and the disk IO stack.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.560
So they're using the base elements.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.800
And I said, OK, well, honestly here,

50:35.800 --> 50:39.440
is this something that you guys just slammed in because you

50:39.440 --> 50:41.200
realized you couldn't get Windows down

50:41.200 --> 50:42.600
on these real-time devices?

50:42.600 --> 50:45.540
Or was Linux baked in from the very beginning

50:45.540 --> 50:47.600
when you started this project?

50:47.600 --> 50:52.360
And the answer was, we started this project four years ago.

50:52.360 --> 50:56.800
And Linux was, from day one, part of the solution.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.080
From day one, they were going to use Linux.

50:59.080 --> 51:02.160
And then so that's the second middle layer of Azure Sphere.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.760
And then there's the third part to Azure Sphere.

51:04.760 --> 51:08.600
And that is the part that actually is on Azure, really.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.240
It's the Azure Sphere Security Service.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.480
It's a cloud service that can reach out

51:13.480 --> 51:16.460
to every device that has a security Azure Sphere

51:16.460 --> 51:18.760
chip in it that's part of the MCU.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.840
It uses certificate-based authentication

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
for authentication to the cloud.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.680
And it allows for device-to-device communication

51:25.680 --> 51:27.720
directly using these certificates.

51:27.720 --> 51:31.280
And it also includes the ability to collect

51:31.280 --> 51:35.360
crash metrics of applications, which Microsoft

51:35.360 --> 51:38.360
is planning to aggregate across the entire Azure Sphere

51:38.360 --> 51:42.120
ecosystem so that way they can, at large scale,

51:42.120 --> 51:44.600
see if all of a sudden a lot of devices

51:44.600 --> 51:47.000
are getting this port banged on, or this application

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
is crashing on a lot of systems.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
But on top of that, they can give those metrics back

51:52.000 --> 51:54.760
anonymized to the hardware manufacturers,

51:54.760 --> 51:56.900
and they can see how their devices are failing.

51:56.900 --> 52:00.000
And then the last part of the hosted part of Azure Sphere

52:00.000 --> 52:03.320
is a software update channel that Microsoft

52:03.320 --> 52:04.800
will host and manage for them.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.920
But the vendor will have a secure channel

52:07.920 --> 52:09.680
to ship software updates.

52:09.680 --> 52:14.880
And Microsoft will run support for 10 years.

52:14.880 --> 52:19.040
They will support these Linux-based IoT devices

52:19.040 --> 52:21.400
and give vendors a channel to ship updates

52:21.400 --> 52:25.640
and give them metrics for 10 years.

52:25.640 --> 52:29.360
They have an SDK coming soonish, probably like summertime.

52:29.360 --> 52:32.600
It's going to include a dev kit board, hooks up via USB,

52:32.600 --> 52:34.100
and then you can start banging on it.

52:34.100 --> 52:36.600
Even Visual Studio integration sounds

52:36.600 --> 52:39.000
like a pretty decent development environment.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.680
The core problem they're really solving

52:40.680 --> 52:43.560
is hardware manufacturers that, say,

52:43.560 --> 52:45.840
want to make a Bluetooth sous-vide,

52:45.840 --> 52:49.520
or a Wi-Fi sous-vide machine, or a Crock-Pot,

52:49.520 --> 52:52.320
they don't have to now build a whole server infrastructure

52:52.320 --> 52:56.080
to manage incoming requests, set up a REST API,

52:56.080 --> 52:59.000
set up push services, build out through data centers

52:59.000 --> 53:01.340
all around the world so that way they can have low latency

53:01.340 --> 53:04.160
connections, and then have an on-staff software team that

53:04.160 --> 53:07.520
ships out updates and looks and analyzes logs and ships out

53:07.520 --> 53:11.480
fixes, Microsoft is now doing all of that.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.040
They're figuring out the inner device communication security.

53:14.040 --> 53:16.360
They're figuring out how to push out the software updates.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.920
And they're even using a Linux kernel

53:18.920 --> 53:22.200
for the actual low-end hardware devices.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.840
It is truly like a, you want to make an IoT device product GE?

53:26.840 --> 53:28.320
Well, here's Azure Sphere.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.640
We'll take care of the silicon.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.280
We'll take care of the software updates.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.720
We'll take care of the metrics.

53:33.720 --> 53:37.160
And we'll take care of 10 years of support channel for you.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.680
You just have to figure out the product

53:39.680 --> 53:41.520
and figure out what you want to do with it.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.960
And we'll handle the back end stuff.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.960
Seems like that's going to be a big, big thing.

53:46.960 --> 53:50.000
And you tie it in with Azure, which is all over the world.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.520
Microsoft would probably price it extremely aggressively

53:52.520 --> 53:53.840
to get people to try it.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.760
Right, yeah, I'm sure.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.280
And then it's oh so easy.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.240
Oh, we'll just keep you a host of other things in Azure

53:58.240 --> 53:59.160
as well, of course.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.360
Yeah.

54:00.360 --> 54:05.360
And fascinating that from day one four years ago, Linux.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.040
I thought another part that was interesting

54:07.040 --> 54:10.080
was that a large part of that was that their vendors,

54:10.080 --> 54:12.920
their silicon partners, they already knew Linux.

54:12.920 --> 54:13.960
And Linux was open source.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.420
It was easy for them to experiment,

54:15.420 --> 54:18.000
to take Microsoft's code and iterate on it,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.840
make improvements, ship them back, share them.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.840
Kind of speaks to the things we like about Linux.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.000
I don't know if they would characterize it this way,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.440
but my personal takeaway from our call

54:27.440 --> 54:30.200
was they were surprised how much attention the Linux

54:30.200 --> 54:32.760
aspect has gotten.

54:32.760 --> 54:35.400
They didn't see that coming because,

54:35.400 --> 54:37.240
and kind of paraphrasing, they're like,

54:37.240 --> 54:41.200
well, we've been shipping Linux on switches in Azure,

54:41.200 --> 54:43.440
and Linux is a massively growing aspect

54:43.440 --> 54:44.800
for that end of our business.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.080
So when it comes to Azure, Linux

54:46.080 --> 54:47.920
has been part of their business for a long time,

54:47.920 --> 54:49.320
and it's totally normal to them.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.760
They're not even surprised by it.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.600
So they weren't quite expecting the amount of reaction it got

54:53.600 --> 54:55.880
because their mindset has been, well, yeah, of course

54:55.880 --> 54:58.680
we're using Linux, which was weird for us

54:58.680 --> 55:00.400
to kind of get up to speed on.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.560
Because they were like, I don't know why everybody's

55:01.560 --> 55:02.760
so surprised by this.

55:02.760 --> 55:06.520
I'm like, really, guys, you're shipping a Linux-based OS now.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.560
Like, yeah, well, this is the Azure team.

55:08.560 --> 55:09.600
This is what we do.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.120
Like, OK.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.240
Yeah, and from that perspective, it does make sense.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.840
Yeah, it fits.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.320
It was the right tool at the right time in the right place,

55:17.320 --> 55:19.440
and good on them.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.920
Yeah, I suppose so.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.360
And they talk about, so you'll hear in the announcements,

55:23.360 --> 55:27.920
you'll hear Microsoft has put certain Windows security

55:27.920 --> 55:29.640
technologies into their version of Linux.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.680
You may have read some version of that in the press releases,

55:32.680 --> 55:33.640
and we said, what is that?

55:33.640 --> 55:35.760
What are these Windows security techniques

55:35.760 --> 55:37.600
that you're now applying to Linux?

55:37.600 --> 55:40.600
And predominantly, it was around the crash reporting,

55:40.600 --> 55:42.160
the Windows crash reporter, tying that

55:42.160 --> 55:44.760
into their existing infrastructure for that,

55:44.760 --> 55:46.280
but also came down like a couple,

55:46.280 --> 55:47.600
the way they designed some of the permissions.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.440
You remember, there was like a third thing

55:49.440 --> 55:50.560
that they took from Windows.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.880
It didn't seem like a huge deal, but I didn't note it down.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.320
But the crash metrics collection, oh, oh,

55:56.320 --> 55:58.240
the way they're slip streaming the updates in

55:58.240 --> 56:01.080
to be low bandwidth so that way they can slip updates in,

56:01.080 --> 56:03.480
they're using that same system that they

56:03.480 --> 56:05.120
use for Windows 10 to do that.

56:05.120 --> 56:05.840
Yes, right.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.160
That's what it was.

56:07.160 --> 56:09.480
So anyways, kind of a compelling offer.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.880
I didn't ask them this, but when I first

56:11.880 --> 56:15.040
heard the announcement, I was a little surprised

56:15.040 --> 56:18.960
it wasn't based on an existing distro,

56:18.960 --> 56:23.160
like your Ubuntu core or something to that degree.

56:23.160 --> 56:24.800
I was a little surprised that they

56:24.800 --> 56:26.000
decided to roll their own.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.600
But when you hear about the other stuff,

56:27.600 --> 56:28.720
they've wrapped around it.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.360
I think I can understand why.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.840
Yeah, and it may be that these devices

56:31.840 --> 56:32.880
are special purpose enough that you

56:32.880 --> 56:34.920
don't need a full featured regular sort of user

56:34.920 --> 56:36.240
landing your tightly.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.360
Yeah, the kernel really sounds like an enabling piece

56:38.360 --> 56:39.000
of technology.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.200
It's not like the core aspect of these devices.

56:42.200 --> 56:45.640
It's just a sub-aspect of three parts of a component, really.

56:45.640 --> 56:48.440
But a big turn of events for Microsoft, either way,

56:48.440 --> 56:51.240
from where I said it seems like a big deal to me.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.360
And they went out of their way to make

56:53.360 --> 56:57.240
sure it was clear to us, including setting up

56:57.240 --> 56:58.000
a conference call.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.800
I think they said they were at a conference, at RSA callers?

57:00.800 --> 57:02.880
Yeah, they're at the RSA conference right now.

57:02.880 --> 57:06.080
So they grabbed a room, and they got a group of people

57:06.080 --> 57:08.800
from the Azure team in a room and got on a phone call with us.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.680
That's why we didn't do an interview.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.120
But they got on a phone call with us

57:11.120 --> 57:13.480
and let us just bang questions at them for a half hour

57:13.480 --> 57:14.200
about this thing.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.720
And I walked away feeling pretty impressed.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.320
I went in not really understanding

57:19.320 --> 57:22.840
what's going on, wondering, is this embrace and extinguish?

57:22.840 --> 57:25.720
But I walked out of it with, well, those takeaways

57:25.720 --> 57:26.760
that I just shared with you.

57:26.760 --> 57:29.800
Yeah, I mean, it really seems like they are motivated.

57:29.800 --> 57:33.560
They see the business case for all the terrible IoT

57:33.560 --> 57:35.240
things that already exist in the world

57:35.240 --> 57:36.720
and why that needs to be fixed.

57:36.720 --> 57:39.280
Whether or not it's going to be adopted, I don't know.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.400
But it might be a good thing if it is.

57:41.400 --> 57:45.040
I wouldn't be too surprised if Microsoft doesn't have success

57:45.040 --> 57:47.880
working directly with like fridge manufacturers.

57:47.880 --> 57:51.200
And they can do that big business to big business.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.400
And they're already in on so many different devices.

57:53.400 --> 57:54.640
And some of these devices have tried

57:54.640 --> 57:56.400
to ship versions of Windows embedded,

57:56.400 --> 57:58.760
and now they can just shift those hardware partners over

57:58.760 --> 57:59.720
to this, possibly.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.160
I don't know.

58:01.160 --> 58:02.440
Anyways, I was really thankful.

58:02.440 --> 58:04.680
And I extended them an offer to come on the show down the road

58:04.680 --> 58:05.720
if we have more questions.

58:05.720 --> 58:08.000
So if you have some questions or comments,

58:08.000 --> 58:11.240
leave it either where you're watching or linuxunplug.com

58:11.240 --> 58:12.000
slash contact.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.200
Is there anything from the Mumble Room

58:13.200 --> 58:14.920
that any questions or thoughts about Microsoft

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
shipping a Linux distro?

58:15.920 --> 58:17.680
That's kind of a big development in itself.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.720
I mean, I guess it's not fair to call it a distro,

58:19.720 --> 58:22.320
but a Linux-powered product, I guess we could say.

58:22.320 --> 58:24.680
I think Linus Torvalds says he won.

58:24.680 --> 58:25.560
Yeah.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.400
Yeah, that famous quote, when Microsoft

58:27.400 --> 58:30.720
starts making applications for Linux, I've won.

58:30.720 --> 58:31.760
Yeah.

58:31.760 --> 58:35.560
And there was a real just practicalness in their mind.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.400
They just thought for these ROT devices,

58:37.400 --> 58:39.840
these really kind of lower-end real-time operating system

58:39.840 --> 58:41.880
devices, Linux was just a better fit.

58:41.880 --> 58:43.960
And then you have to wonder, would they

58:43.960 --> 58:48.480
have done this if the last few years of work on containers

58:48.480 --> 58:50.760
and sandboxing hadn't been going to the Linux kernel?

58:50.760 --> 58:52.320
Because those are some of the core features

58:52.320 --> 58:54.240
they're using to secure the applications that

58:54.240 --> 58:55.360
run on these devices.

58:55.360 --> 58:55.880
Right.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.800
I mean, you need a certain amount

58:56.800 --> 58:58.960
of those primitives available so that you can build.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.540
If you're trying to build a secure OS,

59:00.540 --> 59:02.600
you need to be able to achieve that goal.

59:02.600 --> 59:03.120
Yeah.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.920
And if those weren't there, they wouldn't have had that goal.

59:05.920 --> 59:08.600
Minimac, you have a point about sort of the future.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.360
Yeah, see, with all these changes

59:10.360 --> 59:14.480
they did, the last thing, meaning restructuring

59:14.480 --> 59:16.280
the whole company, it looks like they

59:16.280 --> 59:19.920
want to be a service provider in the future.

59:19.920 --> 59:22.920
So selling software is not that important.

59:22.920 --> 59:25.080
Selling services, that makes money.

59:25.080 --> 59:28.040
We've been talking on the Coder radio program, Coder.show,

59:28.040 --> 59:30.920
about Microsoft sort of becoming the new IBM.

59:30.920 --> 59:34.200
And it started about three weeks ago or four weeks ago

59:34.200 --> 59:37.520
when we did a retrospective look at Sun Microsystems

59:37.520 --> 59:40.440
and their influence on the IT industry,

59:40.440 --> 59:42.680
their influence on Android and Java.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.480
And that retrospective then got us

59:44.480 --> 59:47.200
talking about IBM, which we did last week.

59:47.200 --> 59:50.040
And at the end of our retrospective of IBM

59:50.040 --> 59:52.120
sort of at its heyday in the 80s,

59:52.120 --> 59:55.360
we realized that Microsoft is very much getting

59:55.360 --> 59:57.400
to a new version.

59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.640
My co-host, Michael, calls it a platonic ideal of what IBM

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.040
wanted to be, is what Microsoft is becoming.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.000
I don't know.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.760
I'm watching this, all of these events.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.400
And you go into it with, at least I can't help,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.880
because I came up during the good old wars of Microsoft

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.960
and Windows and Linux.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.280
I mean, that was the fire I was raised in.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.400
So when I see these stories, that, oh, man,

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.640
this is embrace and extinguish does go across my mind.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.920
And I have to really sort of just take a moment

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.560
and be self-aware and go, OK, well, that's

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.480
an emotional reaction.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.440
That's an emotional reaction.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.200
Be mindful.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.120
And what could this really be?

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.120
And I think what's deeper is what we are witnessing

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.520
is that Microsoft is going to become

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.720
one of the handful of companies that has successfully,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.920
and I mean very successfully, monetized Linux

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.200
and open source.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.600
And we have a hard time with that in the open source Linux

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.720
community.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.120
We don't like people making money.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.760
You know, we have a few handful of blessed companies,

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.920
like Red Hat, that will even celebrate when they make money.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.480
They're allowed to make money.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.360
But otherwise, you're not really allowed

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.920
to make money in Linux.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.360
And so when Microsoft is becoming

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.800
one of the clear leaders of people making a profit off

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.600
of Linux and open source, I think

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.700
it doesn't sit well with us.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.800
I think below all of this is, what

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.040
if one of the companies, at the end of this war,

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.320
everything we fought for, at the end of all of it,

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.080
when all is said and done, the company that's

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.720
making the most money off of Linux

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.080
or making some of the most money is Microsoft.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.240
I think that's what's really bothering people,

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.840
is they shouldn't be allowed.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.080
They fought us the whole way.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.720
They shouldn't be allowed to have this.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
This is ours.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.840
But they're a smart company with a lot of smart people.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.040
And they made some smart changes.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.920
And now they're going to be one of the number one moneymakers

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.600
off Linux.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.320
You see, they don't have to destroy Linux.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.120
They don't have to take over Linux.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.160
They don't have to convince the Linux Foundation to slow down

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160
development or any conspiracy theory

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.080
that people cook and bake and come up with.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.520
Because they can make money off Linux just the way it is.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.120
And they're making more money than ever.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.280
And the GPL will keep Linux Linux.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:07.920
That's done.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.640
The GPL is done.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.160
GPL too.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.560
Unless they convince Linus to relicense,

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.240
I think we're pretty much safe here.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.760
And so what we really got to wrap our heads around

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.840
is that Microsoft is going to be one of the biggest

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.400
moneymakers off of Linux.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.440
And we've got to think about how that makes us feel.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.320
And maybe that's what's influencing our reaction

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.120
to some of this.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.880
Are they better at Linux than we are?

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.680
I mean, that's just it, right?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.280
Not to be Mr. Linux podcast psychologist here,

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.440
but I think that's a play a little bit.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.640
Because it's unsettling.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.560
You're not allowed to make money off of Linux.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.480
You fought us on this.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.320
You called it a cancer.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.040
But we all know that things change.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.640
And this Azure Sphere, shipping Linux at the core of it,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.920
may be just the tip of the iceberg.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.840
Think about that for a second.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:00.440
If.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, all of those things

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.640
have been brewing in the background for years, four

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.200
years, and then PowerShell Core comes out, another four years.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.280
And now we've heard of this, Azure Sphere

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.680
using a Linux kernel, about four years in development.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.320
Something big happened at Microsoft.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.360
Well, we know what happened, but four or five years ago,

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.440
all those stories about Satya taking over,

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.960
we heard about the top echelon of management getting reorged.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.800
But just like how it always goes,

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.520
the actual worker bees down below,

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.160
people that got moved, fired, shuffled around,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.560
we didn't hear about them.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.800
But that's where some of this work started,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.720
down in the bowels of Microsoft, where lots of reorgs

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.360
happened that didn't make the headlines.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.520
And that's the hard part, we're having a hard time

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.560
wrapping our heads around when it comes to how Microsoft is

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.440
behaving now.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.080
It's because we've seen Satya, we've

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.480
seen the top layers, because those

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.880
are people on their websites.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.960
And when they make changes, they got to update the website.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.280
They make a press announcement.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.720
But when you're 10 managers down the chain,

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.800
and you're working on some prototype product,

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.640
and that doesn't make headlines.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.280
So it's a different Microsoft, too.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.540
So it's a Microsoft that's learned

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.500
how to make money off Linux and open source,

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.440
and it's a different internal beast

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.000
that we haven't really learned yet.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.600
We have so many decades of experience

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.200
with the old configuration.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.160
But now we're dealing with Microsoft in a totally

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.520
different configuration.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.920
They're not as static of an entity

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.760
as we want to think that they are, right?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.180
I mean, I feel like an old version of Microsoft

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.520
would have figured out a way to cram NT on this,

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.240
or would have crammed some BSD that they didn't even

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.960
have to name on there.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.240
There just would have been a hard line.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.280
It's clear something deep down changed.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.160
Right, yeah, clearly the leadership doesn't object.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
There's not this entrenched resistance,

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.680
at least it doesn't seem to be.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.180
And it doesn't feel like it's the light of Stallman either.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.360
It's just simply.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.560
It's just practical.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.960
You've got to wonder if they're sitting around the boardroom

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.560
going, I wonder if we can make more money at this Linux

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.000
stuff than Red Hat.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.840
Yeah, right.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.920
Do you think we could make more money than Red Hat?

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.760
Let's give it a go.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.200
You know, that's what's going on.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.440
It's good old capitalism.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.720
And then we're sitting back going, what the hell?

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.080
A Linux kernel, embrace and extinguish,

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:03.920
embrace and extinguish.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.760
It's just reactionary.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.160
But maybe now we'll be seeing, you know,

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.000
security-related patches flowing from Microsoft upstream.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.840
Who knows?

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.920
Yeah, weird, weird.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.240
Yeah, especially if they start shipping a lot of these things.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.200
Going to be a lot of Linux kernels out there.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.200
How are they going to do 10 years of support?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.280
That's a huge commitment.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.240
I guess that's just something else

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.320
I'd like to follow up with them is,

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.560
are they going to run their own internal forks?

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.880
Because you're going to have to do your own LTS.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.440
Or are they just going to be updated a lot?

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.640
You know, is this going to be like a continuous deployment

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.480
style?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.480
So they'll be on 5.0 in a few weeks.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.280
Maybe not that current.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:37.960
I don't know.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.120
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.080
We also don't know quite what the licensing's

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.760
going to be around the silicon yet.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.520
We don't know, like, what the, because they're

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.560
going to also release the specs.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.840
We don't really have a clear picture.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.680
They said royalty-free, but we don't really

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.280
have a clear picture.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.040
And all that.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.400
Like, will you be able to even design applications

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.080
for it from Linux?

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.400
We don't know.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.080
We don't know.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.560
All that is still to be determined.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.800
But it was something.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.360
It was really something to see that.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.940
I did not expect that story this week.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.200
Did not see that coming.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:06.800
All right, guys.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.220
Well, is there anything else we need to cover before we

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.960
get out of here this week?

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.600
Mention the Ubuntu podcast.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.400
We've got to do that, Ubuntu podcast.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.320
Go get more poppy and wimpy over there.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.320
Good show.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.560
And yeah, OK, go get more Westpane, techsnap.systems.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.120
How about that?

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:20.640
Bam.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.880
Should plug our own stuff, too.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.040
I like it when we do that.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:23.640
OK, everybody.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.680
Well, we'll get out of here.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.520
Thank you for joining us.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.480
If you want to join us on a Tuesday, you're more than

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:27.800
welcome.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.960
We do this show live over at jblive.tv.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.640
Usually, the live stream kicks off around 1.30 PM Pacific.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.520
You can get it converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.440
slash calendar.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.080
Then you hang out.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.400
You join us.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.760
And then kick back and enjoy the Yatsunoa show, which comes

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.880
just right after this show.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.040
Bonus show.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:44.920
And then go get more.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.720
Just go get more.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.480
Just more JB.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.000
Always, more, always.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.600
There's more shows, linuxunplug.com.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.280
There's more there, jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:50.960
There's more there.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.520
There's always more.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.400
Tech Talk today.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.840
Yeah, Tech Talk talk today.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.960
All right, thanks for being here.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:10.440
We'll see you right back here, next, to, who, who, who, who's

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:33.640
up next.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.800
Oh, you know, ironically, I think most people catch the

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.120
show like on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.600
So I really shouldn't say see you next Tuesday.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.040
Just see you next week.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:42.760
See you next week.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.040
What do we call this thing, guys?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.080
We covered a lot of things.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.720
Thank you, everybody, for contributing.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.480
I really appreciate it.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.960
I enjoyed the heck out of the show.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.000
Extend and extinguish.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.960
Boom, done, title chosen.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.280
Extend and extinguish, huh?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.360
That's not bad.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.160
That is not bad.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.000
I'm sure that would get a few clicks.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.320
I'm going to submit it.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.840
JBtitles.com.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.200
Go vote.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.520
Can you give me a bit of YouTube consultancy, Chris?

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.560
Sure.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:16.520
Can you create multiple channels under a single, like, Google account?

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.800
Yes, I have it.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.360
How the heck do you do it?

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.360
What I've done is I have different Google accounts, and then I have them all logged in.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.480
You know, you can use a little switcher.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.720
That works better for me.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.520
Because then you can just go in and add them as managers to the individual YouTube channels.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.000
But yes, that's how I do it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.880
So I have like a Jupiter, I have Chris at Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.800
I have my personal one.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.720
And then we have a couple of, like, behind-the-scenes channels.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.520
Those are all different Gmail logins.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.840
And then I've logged into the browser, and I just switch up in the little YouTube thing.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.360
OK.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.720
But I don't want another Google account.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.600
So what's your trick, Bobby?

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.120
I'm trying to figure it out, because I did it a long time ago.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.880
And I can see them both there in the Creator Studio.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.960
I think there used to be a way to do it through Google+.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
And I don't think you can.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.440
I don't know.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.400
There's some functionality that they used to do through Google+.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.560
They've removed now.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.880
And they haven't replaced it, but I can't remember what it was.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.480
Azure goes Linux.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.120
That happened a long time ago, though.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.240
Azure as a service.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.760
How much Linux is in that Windows?

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.280
The bonds of Azure.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.000
It came from Redmond.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.960
What did I submit on your behalf?

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.320
I forgot.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:21.880
You had something.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.120
Oh, yeah.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.480
Embrace and Extinguish.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.640
Maybe one called Lindows.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.680
The end of Embrace and Extinguish?

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.520
Maybe.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.920
There was a new snap that I saw recently that I was surprised could actually

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.360
be a snap.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.480
And I thought it was something more like at the system level.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.760
But now I can't remember what it was.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.920
You guys, does that remind you of any bells?

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.680
It was pretty vague.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.160
But there was some new snap I saw go across the news headlines.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.720
And it was like, that's possible?

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.800
Notepad++?

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.640
The Windows version of Notepad++?

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.400
No.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.160
I'm not even kidding.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.800
That is the fastest growing snap right now.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.440
Really?

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.480
I'll give that a go, actually.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.600
Snap install Notepad-the-word-plus-the-word-plus.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.400
It's pretty interesting that you can like.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.040
And I know the first thing everyone's going to shout at me

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.800
is the Flatback guys did this with games

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.160
and chucked them on the pirate bay, bundled wine

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.920
and a game, dodgy pirated copies of games.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.520
OK, yes, I know they've done it before.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.840
But this is like the first time we've had a legitimate application bundled

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.840
with wine in the Snap Store, because it's an open source application.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.720
It's not some proprietary.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.000
It's not like someone took Photoshop and bundled it with wine

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.120
and shoved it in the store.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.200
This is a GPL application that's been bundled with wine

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.240
and put in the store.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.320
It's a weird one, but it turns out it's a popular application.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.520
And so people install it.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.040
And it got me curious as to what Windows applications that you

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.040
miss from Windows that are not proprietary, which is a tricky one,

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.040
would you want available as a Snap?

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.520
I can only think of commercial ones, you know?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.960
Because that's the only thing I use Windows for.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.120
If I want to use free software, I just use Linux.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.800
The lunatic in me thinks we should bundle wine and Steam inside of Snap

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.600
just for the lulz.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.720
Yeah, totally.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.640
Yeah.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.400
Let me change topics here for a second, because I

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.200
want to pick your guys' brain.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.760
I have a little birdie telling me that an XPS 13 review unit

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.640
may land on my doorstep in the next couple of weeks.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.680
Is that now we've finished with it?

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.520
Yeah, it's probably your used one, Poppy.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.080
I was very good with it.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.680
I polished it and wrapped it all up just like it was new.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.600
Actually, it may be.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.160
Like, is there any identifying marks on there I should look for?

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.880
Was it a high DPI or a standard?

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.680
I can't remember.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.760
I think you got the standard.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.800
Have you not listened to our amazing review?

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.000
I did, but I seem to recall you got the standard DPI screen,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
but I don't remember for some reason.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
We got the best model, in my opinion.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So we got the one with the 1080p screen, but with the 16 gig memory uplift.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.240
My personal opinion is on the XPS 13, that 13.3 inch display, 1080p, super crisp,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.680
and then you get the benefit of the enhanced battery endurance

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.000
using that 1080p display rather than a UHD display.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.320
I think I should ask for that.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.280
This is a thin one with only USB-C ports.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.880
No, I think it has regular ports still.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.520
It just has USB-C in addition.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.360
They're not monsters.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.120
Well, I mean, there are more USB-C ports, and they're very, very thin.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:23.960
It is those things.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.480
That's true.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.000
Those are true statements about it, but I'm looking forward to it.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.840
I'm just kind of figuring, like, what's a new take on a laptop review?

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.640
That's what I'm trying to think of.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.320
So if you guys have any ideas, let me know on a new take.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.240
I'll probably try all the different smattering of distros and different

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.760
functions, but take it to the beach.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.560
Take it to the beach?

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.000
Yeah.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.560
Take it to the beach.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.520
Work a day at the beach.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:43.960
Yeah.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.000
Definitely trackpad.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.120
Yeah, definitely trackpad.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:46.720
Yeah.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.280
I'm just curious.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.320
We have time to think about it.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:13:05.360
I think it'll be a few weeks, but if people have ideas, I'd love to know.
