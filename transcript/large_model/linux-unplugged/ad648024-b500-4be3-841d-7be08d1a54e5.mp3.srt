00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,840
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
And my name is Brent.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Hello, gentlemen.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
It is great to be gathered together with you today.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,360
We pushed the Hercules of Linux workstations to the breaking point, so find out how far

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,280
we push the new Thaleo from System76.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,440
We got a beast in house, and we attempt to tame it.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,760
Plus, there's something that seems to be concerning the community, a little bit of inaccurate

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,280
information kind of regarding drivers and open source stuff and kernel stuff.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,320
We just want to address all of it here in the show, just sort of try to get our take

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
on it and maybe get the right information out there.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,120
So we're going to talk about that coming up in the show in just a few moments.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,920
And then we'll round it out with some boosts and picks, and I mean, picks and a lot more.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,200
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual log.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Hello, Mumble Room.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Hello, friends.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Hello, Chris.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Hey, Wes.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
And hello, Brent.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Aw.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Hey, fam.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
How's it going over there?

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Nice to see you all in there.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,620
If you'd like to join our Mumble Room, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash mumble for the info, we live stream

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,240
over on jupyter.tube on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,800
Like maniacs.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,640
And it's archived up there for your perusal later on, if you'd like to view the sausage

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
factory.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Jupiter.tube.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Jupiter.tube.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,480
And we also want to say good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,160
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
We love it.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,040
It is the definition of a game changer.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,080
All of us love TailScale here so much.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,580
I think every single JB host, everybody on the team is using TailScale.

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,520
So go say good morning to one of our favorite tools out there and get it for free up to

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,560
20 devices at TailScale.com.

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Tell them Unplugged sent you if they ask, I don't know.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,420
Maybe just volunteer that anyway, even if they don't ask.

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,760
You could go to TailScale.com slash coder and then they'd know it came from JB, I suppose.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,640
Maybe I should be plugging that.

45
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,960
Let's talk about something that's kind of going off like crazy this weekend.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,600
I didn't even really see when this video got posted from Linus Tech Tips.

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll pull that up while we talk about this, but there has been a lot of discussion around

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,320
Intel's new Arc GPU.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,040
And it is really exciting because it's got an open source driver stack.

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
The Intel stuff has always worked really well on Linux and now they're making dedicated

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
GPUs.

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:42,000
And on October 5th, the Linus Tech Tips channel posted their take on the Arc GPU.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,440
And they said something in there that seems to have confused a lot of people online.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,320
And so I want to play that moment for you here on the show and then we will address

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,280
it after we've heard it so that way we know what we're talking about.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,480
Intel also made a good case for not using Arc on Linux for the foreseeable future.

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,160
Sorry guys, I know that you had high hopes, but currently Arc only supports kernel version

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
6.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
And Intel has said that they do not plan on supporting version 5, meaning that every stable

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,520
version of Linux is currently not supported.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,640
To put this in perspective for the non-Linux folks out there, this is basically like Intel

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,760
launching a product, but only having drivers for Windows 12.

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,840
So this is a little confusing because it sounds like if you're on Linux and you're using

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,340
a distribution, you're not going to be able to get access to the Intel Arc GPU because

65
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,960
Intel hasn't released drivers for the previous kernel.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,920
There's a way in which that is true, but the way this works when you're a developer that's

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
contributing upstream is you contribute to the current development branch.

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
And so Linus pulls these in and then it ships in that version of the kernel and forward

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,760
and they maintain it.

70
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,520
It is pretty uncommon for that stuff to be backported unless the developer chooses to

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,640
do it themselves or a distribution chooses to do it.

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
Does this all sync with, track with how you view it Wes?

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
Yeah, that seems to be how things are usually done, right?

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
I mean, you've got to contribute it upstream.

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,560
You can't magically make it show up on all these older kernels and maybe a lot of work

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
and no one's willing to do that work.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
It doesn't just happen.

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,520
And if you think about the way things are, 6.0 is the current version of Linux.

80
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,440
The 5.0 series is now an older version.

81
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
It's okay.

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You can say old and busted.

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,620
Well, see what happens is distributions, they're kind of forking it when they take, they fork

84
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,400
it and they support a certain version for a while.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,880
And so it wouldn't even necessarily land in say Ubuntu's 5.0 series kernel if Intel did

86
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,720
even contribute it back to the 5.0 series because it's its own branch now.

87
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,100
And so generally what we recommend here on the show is if you want to play around with

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,800
cutting edge hardware, you need to run a very current distribution, probably a rolling distro

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
if you can or something like Fedora, it stays really current because that's how you're going

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,540
to get access to those drivers.

91
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,760
And this is something that tricks up reviewers that are kind of new to Linux and they come

92
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,600
in and they don't really understand how this works.

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,240
And we've seen it with previous AMD video card releases, they'll have maybe like an

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,480
Ubuntu LTS installed or maybe one version back of Ubuntu installed and they'll throw

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,480
the new GPU in the system and fire it up and it's not working.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,960
They said it supports Ubuntu but it's not working.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,420
It's because that driver, that stuff goes upstream and while it means that you have

98
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,200
to wait a little bit till it trickles down to your distribution or you can choose to

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,360
use a more current distribution, you have the choice.

100
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,280
It means that that's going in at the base layer, like it's baked in now to Linux, right?

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,800
It's like built in support and everything that ever gets built off of 6.0 or later now

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
just has it.

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,660
And ultimately, it's the best way to support something like this is to have the developer

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,720
contribute upstream and then have that work integrated with distributions as they package

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
it.

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,540
And it's a kind of a funky way Linux works because it's different than Windows where

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,000
you'd get maybe like a driver installer that supports a couple of versions of Windows instead

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,680
of just the most recent version with the most recent service pack.

109
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,420
That's how maybe people expect it to work you think because there's a lot of confusion

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
around this right now.

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,720
Well, yeah, I mean, we just have as usual on Linux, right?

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,880
There's more ways that we do things.

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,920
You can get a roll in up to date distribution or if one of the stable releases happened

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,920
to have coincided with when this made it into the kernel, then it would just be there.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,580
But we get to pick and choose.

116
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,320
One of the benefits of some of these stable releases is they are stable, right?

117
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
You don't have to worry.

118
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,680
And if you're like many people who don't need to fuss around with this fancy brand new to

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,460
the market first version discrete GPU from Intel, that's something you like or at least

120
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,760
a lot of people seem to like.

121
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,400
Clearly not here in the studio, but many people seem to like and that's just part of the trade

122
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
off unfortunately.

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,940
I would like to see it maybe a little bit easier because you probably need like updated

124
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Mesa as well.

125
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Yeah.

126
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,920
You know, so I think it could be easier if you were willing to make that trade off.

127
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Obviously you lose kind of all the planned and integrated support for a particular kernel

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
shipped from your distribution if you do that.

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,120
But it'd be nice if it was easy to be like, well, I just want I just want new features.

130
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,200
I don't think this comes up a lot because I don't think traditionally people that run

131
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Linux are buying the absolute latest graphics card as is being put on the market.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,880
Well, they don't ship that in like my four year old ThinkPad.

133
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
So how am I?

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
How's that going to work?

135
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,720
But what is really, really kind of just really demonstrates the point here of why it's great

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,140
to have it upstream.

137
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,460
So we have the Thaleo in house right now and it ships with Pop OS and it's all fully tested

138
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,580
and integrated with the kernel and the Nvidia driver in it.

139
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,360
Everything ships working.

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,920
So of course we went ahead and broke it immediately and put Nix OS on there.

141
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,960
So not immediately, but pretty soon afterwards, because of course we wanted to do a series

142
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,440
of extensive testing.

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,800
So we wanted to use Nix OS and Nix OS is basically a rolling distribution.

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
I don't say it's not cutting edge.

145
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
It's just current software.

146
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Nix OS is current software.

147
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah.

148
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,080
It feels like it's maybe not in a hurry, you know, like a new release dropped.

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not like immediately packaged all the time, depending on what it is.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,960
But it's, you know, pretty quickly.

151
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Yeah.

152
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,360
So we were doing an update and it was pulling down Linux 6.0.

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,320
But the Nvidia driver, at least the stable released Nvidia driver, doesn't work with

154
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,840
Linux 6.0 yet.

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,360
And so our upgrade failed because we were trying to install a version of the kernel

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
that was incompatible with our proprietary video driver.

157
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,480
And so Nix doesn't proceed if it's going to break and so it bails.

158
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,400
And this is the exact opposite.

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,040
With something that's upstream, like these Intel Arc drivers now, you will always have

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,360
support in the kernel.

161
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,940
So you can always go with the latest kernel if you want.

162
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,140
These upgrades won't fail.

163
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,480
You don't have to wait for Intel to release a driver for Linux 6.0 now and 6.1 and all

164
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
of these things.

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
It's just built in forever now.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,600
It's the exact opposite experience when you're trying to use leading edge software with something

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
like an Nvidia card.

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,280
It's just it's such a pain in the butt.

169
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
And this solves that.

170
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Yeah, right.

171
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,600
I mean, it's like the trade off of this sort of unfortunate uncertainty around release

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,980
time and when exactly support there.

173
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,520
You trade off having once it's in, it's just in as long as anyone's meaningfully using

174
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,360
those devices, the kernel will probably keep it hanging around and you can just forget

175
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
about it, right?

176
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,160
You just grab whatever distribution, put it on that machine and it'll work.

177
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,580
And as you would expect, once again, Michael Larbel over at Ferronix really does have the

178
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,240
best coverage on this stuff.

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,280
He's got one of these, you know, a mid-level one is like 280 bucks.

180
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
It's pretty good.

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,480
If you want a high performance desktop with 3D acceleration for video playback and your

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,960
desktop environment, and you want to play some games, maybe not like maybe you're not

183
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,920
a hardcore gamer, but you want to play some games.

184
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,180
This dedicated Intel Arc GPU seems like it really could hit that sweet spot.

185
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,480
And so Larbel talks over here, he says the caveat that exists for the graphics micro

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,520
controller is the GUC firmware.

187
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,820
And as with the past decade of Radeon GPUs and the NVIDIA stuff, it does have a signed

188
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,120
firmware that has to get loaded.

189
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,240
So the driver is open source and it's built on the integrated driver stack and extended,

190
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,900
but it does have the requirement of being able to load proprietary blobs and you do

191
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,360
need Linux 6.0 and Mesa 22.2.

192
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,000
But we've been tracking this story in Linux Action News because I think this is a pretty

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
important development.

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,840
And Intel is really serious about adding a GPU to the market that is affordable and has

195
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,880
an open source driver stack.

196
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,600
And I'll take more of those.

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah.

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm thinking about voting with my wallet on this one.

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,260
If I'm hearing you right, does that mean that Linus of Linux Tech Tips got it wrong or is

200
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,040
just a misinterpretation of what he said?

201
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I think so.

202
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,400
If you listen to the clip, what I heard is actually probably anything.

203
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,900
It's probably just they were rushed when they were scripting this video because it's actually

204
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,360
it's it's it's kind of a transition that he makes and it's kind of clunky.

205
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Intel also made a good case for not using Archon Linux for the foreseeable future.

206
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,560
See, that's just that is factually wrong because it's available on Linux right now.

207
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,240
It's available in the latest version of Linux immediately, like on that Nix system that

208
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,560
was upgrading to 6.0 or, you know, it's already available.

209
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,840
And is Intel making a case or are they just sort of doing the normal development model

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,600
that they do with the Linux platform?

211
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Right.

212
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,960
So the making the case thing was a segue from something else he was talking about in the

213
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,040
Windows world where Intel made a case about something and that was just a bad segue.

214
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,100
And then he combines it with not really understanding that it's actually an incredible achievement

215
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,160
to have the video driver upstreamed and open source in the Linux kernel.

216
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,220
And it's like the opposite of not supported.

217
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,280
It's like fully supported the way we would want it.

218
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,220
But, you know, they don't know the nuance on that one.

219
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,060
They just know that if you're on like an Ubuntu LTS or a five series kernel, which is pretty

220
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,960
much everybody today, you couldn't actually just plug this in and use it.

221
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,400
The opposite, the flip side of that is if you have a modern kernel and modern Mesa,

222
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,240
you literally just plug it in and you're done.

223
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,860
Where on Windows, I'm sure you got to run a bunch of installer wizard crap and reboot

224
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,920
a few times, right?

225
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
It's going to be a mess.

226
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
On Linux, it's even better supported.

227
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
It just has to be current Linux.

228
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,680
And this is something I think we need to get reviewers to wrap their head around because

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,320
it's traditionally been the written press that gets this wrong.

230
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,680
But I think as hardware and tech reviewers start covering Linux more as it grows, like

231
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,880
Linus Tech Tips obviously is, then maybe there needs to be a little bit more of an understanding

232
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,040
of how the development cycle works when it comes to video card drivers and drivers in

233
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
general because it's not what they expect.

234
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,460
Traditionally they expect an installer that supports a range of shipped operating systems

235
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
on the market today.

236
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,460
Yeah.

237
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,600
And I mean, it could be better, right?

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Like it's fine to point out that, you know, hey, if you're just running these stable releases,

239
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
this won't work for you right away.

240
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,720
And that's a totally reasonable point to make.

241
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Maybe especially for his audience that it probably has a lot of sort of maybe Linux

242
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,600
curious but not Linux experts like we're lucky enough to have as a subset of our audience.

243
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
But you just kind of, you know, as you're saying, add the nuance there to say there

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,900
are plenty of distros available if that's what you want and you want to have software

245
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,840
running Linux to play with this new card.

246
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
That's the thing you can do.

247
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,800
You just need a specific version.

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

249
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,840
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

250
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,800
And it's a great way to show support for the show while you're checking out something awesome.

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,320
Linode is really, truly the Linux geeks cloud, 11 data centers worldwide.

252
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,320
And they've been hard at work for nearly 19 years just building the best experience to

253
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,720
run your applications on Linux.

254
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
That's it right there.

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,440
And to do that, they had to create a genuine support department that actually sticks with

256
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
you.

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,080
The first person you call is the person that helps you.

258
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,560
They had to build fast infrastructure.

259
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,960
They had to become their own ISP.

260
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,580
And they had to figure out how to use Linux to do these things before anybody else did.

261
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
And the performance truly is incredible.

262
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,600
I mean, I just wouldn't run all of JB's infrastructure over there unless it was great.

263
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,640
Like the new website, super fast.

264
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
We're running it on Linode.

265
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,040
It's great.

266
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,080
We take advantage of some of their backend features too.

267
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,480
Like if an application needs it, we'll use their MVME storage.

268
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Screaming fast.

269
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
And of course, you know, we love their S3 object storage as well.

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,360
But you know, there's been some research done recently that really underscores how big enterprises

271
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,740
and medium companies that have really gone all in with the hyperscalers are now kind

272
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,960
of looking for an alternative cloud provider.

273
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,120
In fact, more and more enterprises are embracing that idea.

274
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,760
Just looking somewhere where they don't have so much lock-in.

275
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,240
And I think Linode's performance and price combination is what's going to bring people

276
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
through the door.

277
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,280
So I'm going to link to a paper, a research paper that kind of talks about this a little

278
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
bit.

279
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
If you need some ammunition inside your corporation to advocate for something like this.

280
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,320
Because when you combine just the speed, availability, the support, and the fact that Linode is going

281
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,720
to deploy a dozen new data centers next year, it's really going to take things to the next

282
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
level.

283
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,320
And then if you're just a single home user who wants a blog or a gaming server, Linode

284
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
has rigs for that too.

285
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
And for different expertise levels.

286
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,800
If you've never deployed a server or if you love building it from the ground up.

287
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,960
That's a really unique package that's becoming less and less common, I have to say.

288
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,440
Especially as those hyperscalers sort of take over the whole world and they lock things

289
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,400
up behind these archaic sort of corporate thick verbiage for all of their different

290
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,320
features that are just like re-implementations of free software.

291
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
I don't know.

292
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Just that model just doesn't seem like it's going to work forever.

293
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,840
And after you've been using Linode for a minute, well you're going to wonder why you ever did

294
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
it any other way.

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,720
Especially when you start integrating some of their tools like their great API or use

296
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,660
some standard infrastructure management tools because they support all that as well.

297
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,800
So for the best customer support, super fast rigs, and a Linux culture that runs deep.

298
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Those are some of the reasons I choose Linode, but go find your own reasons.

299
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Go kick the tires.

300
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Go grab that $100 and support the show.

301
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,880
Linode.com slash unplugged.

302
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,660
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

303
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,400
We have some housekeeping today.

304
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,160
Yeah, I'm excited about some of this.

305
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,640
Let's start with the new drop, Brent.

306
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,640
On your way home, you had an opportunity to hide another geocache.

307
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,120
I did, and I had a lot of fun with it.

308
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
Those who've been paying attention, I drove home from the studio this week.

309
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,920
And while I was driving, most of the time I was like, where am I going to drop this

310
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,800
last geocache?

311
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,780
Because we didn't really have a plan for it, but we thought that somewhere along Brent's

312
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,240
journey might be the way to go.

313
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,040
And Chris, you recommended that I stop at this location called the Washington Pass Overlook.

314
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
And I think you totally nailed it.

315
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,640
With the trees changing, with the season changing, it was a beautiful stop.

316
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,120
And I thought, I think this is the perfect spot.

317
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,160
Well, I am here at the North Washington Pass Overlook, which is a beautiful spot.

318
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,080
Thank you, Chris, for mentioning it.

319
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:53,360
And I've made my way, let's say, off the beaten path just a little.

320
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,000
And the views from here are gorgeous, and I just found a nice little spot to tuck our

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,560
little geocache for those who are adventurous enough to come here and have a look on one

322
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,280
of the steps that are made by nature.

323
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
It's a beautiful spot.

324
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,600
I hope you make your way out.

325
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,960
Just know, there isn't really any internet out here, so you might have to work a little

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,120
harder to find the coordinates.

327
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,960
But good luck, and let us know if you found it.

328
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,720
We got to watch the video version of this, which is in the Jupiter tube recording.

329
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,160
And every camera frame looks like a wallpaper background.

330
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,600
Such a beautiful spot.

331
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,080
I like to go there on a hot day, just because it's up high in the elevation, and just get

332
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,360
some fresh air, although it's all smoky right now.

333
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,040
What do you mean a nature step?

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
What is a nature step?

335
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,520
There's like, well, I don't want to give too much away, but there's this like, you know,

336
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,800
of course, I went off the path of where they want you to actually walk, and I'm not the

337
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
first to do that.

338
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,320
There was a little like, worn out trail, you know, it looked like a game trail or something,

339
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,640
but it's clearly people just getting a different view.

340
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,840
So, rule breakers only for this cache.

341
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Right?

342
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
And so the infrastructure there is great.

343
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
They've got it all, you know, all the paths are paved, and there's railings.

344
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Easy parking.

345
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,040
Yeah, it's actually great, but you know, you got to trek off of that path from time

346
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
to time.

347
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,360
And if you do decide to do that, there's like, these large rock formations that feel like

348
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,560
natural steps down to this other view that I got to take and it was beautiful.

349
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,920
And I didn't have to be around people.

350
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,540
I mean, there weren't that many people and everybody was really nice, but it just felt

351
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,700
for a moment like it was just me up there.

352
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,380
And so one of these natural steps, that's kind of where you want to look.

353
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,160
We learned a new French Canadian translation today.

354
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Natural step?

355
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Yeah, that's rocks.

356
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,280
That's a destination, really.

357
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,400
If you visit the state of Washington, that's a destination.

358
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
And Highway 20 is a drive.

359
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,600
And why not top it off with a little JB Geocache?

360
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,680
So we've got one that's been discovered and three out, or do we have four out in the wild

361
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
right now?

362
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Yeah.

363
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,280
I guess we're supposed to be keeping track of this.

364
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
I think it's three.

365
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,600
The one in the one at the power station has been found.

366
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
No.

367
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Has it?

368
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Yeah.

369
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Wasn't it?

370
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
That was the power station.

371
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Yeah.

372
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,840
The Pasadena at the at the hydro plant that had been shut down.

373
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
No, that was in somewhere else.

374
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,400
This is perhaps a perfect segue into an idea I had this week that I'm looking to get feedback

375
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
from.

376
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
That was in Folsom.

377
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Oh, Folsom.

378
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Right.

379
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Which is right.

380
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Right.

381
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Not Pasadena.

382
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
It's more closer to Sacramento.

384
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
My bad.

385
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Get your California straight.

386
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I know.

387
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
So we have one Geocache in Folsom hasn't been found.

388
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,940
We have one Geocache in Grants Pass has also not been found.

389
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,320
We have the one I just dropped.

390
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
That's three.

391
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,640
I think that's it.

392
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,600
I think we need Hidia here to keep us straight.

393
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,920
But an idea I had this week to kind of keep track of all this is I wondered what you both

394
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,600
think and what the audience thinks of having a more permanent JB Geocaching tracker.

395
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,480
I was thinking it might be fun for audience members to drop some and for us to have sort

396
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,460
of a list and even, you know, which ones have been found, locations that you could go looking

397
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,840
for them just sort of all over the world.

398
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,520
It doesn't have to be us dropping them all the time.

399
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,120
I thought that might be a little fun.

400
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,040
If people were into it, I would totally like that.

401
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,320
We got to see because we got Geocache although these are only in the West Coast.

402
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
If we could get them spread out and get the audience involved.

403
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, I could see what you're saying.

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That could be fun.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
And maybe we could partner up to you know, people are willing to if they've got some

406
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
stuff that's great.

407
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,280
Maybe we could like send them some swag from time to time.

408
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,720
Help help spread things.

409
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Definitely.

410
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Yeah, help them stock it.

411
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,160
And I did notice that some of the meetups that there were some gear exchange happening

412
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,800
and I thought might be a different way of doing that as well.

413
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,420
That does happen a lot.

414
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,640
People bring gear to the meetups.

415
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,240
So I was wandering around in the woods and there's just like a server rack out here.

416
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,800
Something that happens too is and I understand because I can be this way is people have like

417
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,240
this really cool piece of gear or nice piece of gear that they don't want to they don't

418
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
want to throw out.

419
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,520
So they bring it to give it to me, but I'm often like on the road and don't really have

420
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
room for it.

421
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,160
It's like a tricky thing and it's sometimes I accept but it's he always takes pies though.

422
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,800
But we've had you know, we've had boxes left behind with stuff in them and like, oh, OK.

423
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
All right.

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
You can leave that here.

425
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I guess that's fine.

426
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,120
But where do we organize this this idea?

427
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,080
Maybe in the matrix room somewhere in the J.B. chat.

428
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,600
Well, I was thinking something maybe a bit more official or more technical way.

429
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Let me guess.

430
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Let me guess.

431
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
No, no, don't guess.

432
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah, you'll get it right.

433
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
It's going to be GitHub.

434
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It's going to be GitHub, isn't it?

435
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
But I don't know if that's the right place.

436
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,320
I mean, I'm, yeah, new to it and excited about GitHub and I'm liking the way it's working.

437
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
But is that really the right the right place?

438
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,560
Brands got himself a hammer.

439
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,200
Well, but maybe it's just a page on our website.

440
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Right.

441
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,520
And if you drop a new geocache, then you make a new PR to add that information to our website.

442
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
That could be a way to do it.

443
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,040
Sounds like it's I need some brainstorming, but I like the idea.

444
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,880
Yeah, that's that's really the step I'm at.

445
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
So I need help.

446
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
All right.

447
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,040
So but let's let's I think you start maybe in the website chat room.

448
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,440
I mean, you need somewhere to you need somewhere to organize this.

449
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,000
I think we need we might want a matrix chat about it anyway.

450
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,680
We need a temperature gauge to know if this is something people are interested in, I think.

451
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,120
Because right now we've got three caches out there that nobody's even gone out and snagged

452
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,760
up, which should indicate to me low to moderate interest.

453
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,040
But perhaps it's just location specific or those are very well hidden.

454
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,120
I don't know.

455
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,740
Or maybe what we should do is a marketing campaign where we just start finding other

456
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,900
geocaches and putting our stickers in there.

457
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,600
I think you're on to something like guerrilla marketing shows canceled next week.

458
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,280
We're going to be out cash on just bring a microphone with us.

459
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,900
We're here from this field.

460
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:51,480
We think there's something here.

461
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,860
Johnny comes in again as our baller booster.

462
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,800
We like to feature the folks that are supporting this episode significantly with their boost

463
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,320
contribution and he comes in with 22,504 sets and he says these boosts are real and they're

464
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
spectacular.

465
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
It's great.

466
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Seinfeld reference.

467
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Mm hmm.

468
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Seinfeld reference acknowledged.

469
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,760
And he goes on to say not to complain guys, but by the way, this is actually my ninth

470
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,800
consecutive episode where I've boosted.

471
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Just saying.

472
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,600
I think this is I think he and I have two different counts.

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,080
I'm counting the baller boost run, which seems unsustainable.

474
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,680
And I noticed I noticed John's playing around with the numbers a little bit, trying to get

475
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,660
in just above what he figures is the baller threshold.

476
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,640
So what we really need is somebody to come in and like throw him a curveball and see

477
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,200
if he can maintain his streak.

478
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
But all right.

479
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
We'll say this is your 10th.

480
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,760
I was going to say, yeah, I mean, at this point, I'll just accept whatever John's number

481
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
is.

482
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
It's totally fine.

483
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,680
At this point, John gets to say, all right, so this is his 10th consecutive boost, which

484
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,120
I feel like that 10 in a row is like, we got to give him some sort of trophy or something,

485
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
some sort of swag item.

486
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,520
John, you got to contact me on Matrix or something and we'll figure something out.

487
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,360
There are three geocaches you can choose from.

488
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Yeah, right.

489
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
There you go.

490
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
OK, very good.

491
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,720
We've hidden, pre-hidden your trophy for you, no problem.

492
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,160
Gene Bean boosted in with 20,000 sats.

493
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,560
I hoard that which your kind covet.

494
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,960
He says there's plenty of places in Carlton.

495
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
There's also the west side of Atlanta that might fit your idea of being able to host

496
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
a podcast on site.

497
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,920
Y'all would likely want to fly to Atlanta, though, as I've made that drive and it's long.

498
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,440
Yeah, I do picture us kind of flying.

499
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,160
So just to recap what people are, if you're out of the loop from what Gene Bean is talking

500
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,400
about, we're done with these road trips that we've been doing traditionally.

501
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,920
I think they they worked in an era where no events were going on.

502
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,700
But they've been hard and arduous and technically challenging and expensive.

503
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,580
So what I want to do is shift to a venue based approach where we do live shows at a venue.

504
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,000
People come, they see the show.

505
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,860
Ideally, there'd be like a ticket that's cheap enough to cover our cost to fly out there

506
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,800
and do the show, but not so expensive that it's prohibited for people to visit.

507
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,740
And I think we're probably we would start as we would want to maybe, unless somebody

508
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,800
had a great venue in mind, I think we'd want to pick a couple of venues to start with to

509
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
practice.

510
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,680
Maybe we would do it at an event like a Linux fest or a scale to learn like the ropes.

511
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,480
And then actually start doing a production that has tickets and things like that.

512
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Kind of bring a microphone for each of the hosts.

513
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
OK.

514
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah, right.

515
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
I got to figure that out.

516
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,960
Gene Bean, followed up with a set of stats, said, gee, I really wonder how Chris feels

517
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
about the whole Fedora fiasco.

518
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,720
Guess why I didn't make my feelings clear about the whole patent thing.

519
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Still bummed about it.

520
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Still bummed about it.

521
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
It's really it's really unfortunate.

522
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,960
The whole patent situation is extremely unfortunate, I have to say.

523
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,840
You say you're only going to watch H265 encodings from now on.

524
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Right.

525
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Very particular.

526
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm going to kick off that old FFmpeg script that's just converting everything to WebM

527
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,160
because clearly VP8 is our only future.

528
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,560
Did you see that there's a patent shark getting a bunch of buying up a bunch of small patents

529
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,860
and stuff getting together to go after Opus players?

530
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,720
And Opus was specifically designed to avoid patent issues.

531
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,080
I guess they claim they're focusing on like people shipping hardware encoders and stuff.

532
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah.

533
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
We'll see.

534
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,600
Well, even then, though, if all of a sudden people you know, if the word gets out that

535
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,340
if you ship Opus on your hardware player, you're going to get a knock on a door from

536
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
a patent troll.

537
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,760
Well, the easy way to solve that is just don't ship Opus.

538
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,040
And it's not like there's a there's not like there's an organization that can go get a

539
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,920
patent from patent license from, I don't think.

540
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,120
So that's really unfortunate.

541
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,160
And it's a problem that isn't going to get any better.

542
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,720
I think what at the core of it, what really bothers me about it is that I guess I kind

543
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,920
of think like as Linux users, as we put up with things like the Nvidia driver or proprietary

544
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,200
codecs and then we kind of over time, we build these solutions to solve that problem, to

545
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,480
make it more approachable to more users, something that can be done, you know, across distros

546
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
or something like that.

547
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,380
And it feels like a win and it feels like we've stepped forward, we've made progress.

548
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,640
And what this feels like is, oh, actually, that progress can be undone at any moment

549
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,200
because Red Hat Legal just didn't understand how this worked before and now realizes that

550
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,480
they're, oh, choosing to ship this stuff, so we have to be careful.

551
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,680
And so because their perception of the situation changed, we're now undoing progress.

552
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,720
And it just makes me wonder, well, what's next?

553
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,480
You know, what happens if somebody starts going after Wi-Fi drivers and now decides

554
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,040
that the Intel driver violates some sort of patent and the people that are using the Intel

555
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Wi-Fi driver need a license, something that, you know, Intel ripped off from them or something

556
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
like where does it end?

557
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
When does it stop?

558
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,640
And it made me realize that the progress that the Linux desktop gets is fragile and that

559
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,920
it can be undone by hyper-protective, hyper-proactive legal departments at an influential distribution.

560
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,360
And as a Linux user, I find that sad and frustrating.

561
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,380
But at the end of the day, there's lots of choice.

562
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,440
It continues to be the number one thing our audience mentioned at our meetups and it continues

563
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
to be true.

564
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,440
The choice is both Linux's weakness in terms of fragmentation and frame of development

565
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,400
time and it's also its strength.

566
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,760
And you know, in this case, it's a strength.

567
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Still better than Windows.

568
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
That's right.

569
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
That's right.

570
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,960
So thank you Gene Bean and thank you John A. for your baller boost this episode.

571
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,360
We really appreciate it.

572
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,200
The contributions in the boost have been really significant because you may have seen in the

573
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,280
last week PayPal had a user license or a user, not a license, what are they called?

574
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I guess agreement.

575
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,320
They call it like a EUL or something like that.

576
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,680
An end user agreement perhaps?

577
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,480
Yeah, it's basically like a EULA, but they have a different name for it.

578
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,240
And they updated it saying that they were going to fine users $2,500 if they spread

579
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,720
misinformation online and if you don't have $2,500 in your PayPal account, no problem.

580
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,400
They'll just automatically debit it from whatever accounts you do have connected.

581
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,400
And of course, PayPal is the arbiter of what is misinformation and where it matters and

582
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,160
where it doesn't matter.

583
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,040
As a result, there has been a ton of PayPal account closures.

584
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,120
In fact, to the point now where PayPal is paying $15 to people who don't close their

585
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
account.

586
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,200
So if you want to free 15 bucks, I don't know how long it's going to last, but they'll pay

587
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
you 15 bucks not to close your account right now.

588
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,520
That's how desperate they are.

589
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:23,360
PayPal though underlies a lot of the payment processing for memberships and automatic contributions.

590
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,720
PayPal is one of the few ways to do a subscription on the back end successfully.

591
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,920
And so a lot of podcasters, JB included, but not as much as some of my other friends have

592
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,680
been negatively impacted by this because when you cancel your PayPal account, you're canceling

593
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,720
that payment to that podcast too, understandably.

594
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,000
And so that's why I'm just very grateful that earlier this year, we did start working on

595
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
the Boost system.

596
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,840
We did start implementing an alternative that is based on free software, that is decentralized,

597
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,360
that isn't connected to any single company.

598
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,160
And so when we have these baller boosters step up, that is investing in that particular

599
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
episode.

600
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,040
And so we have our members, we have a network of members who are there that are investing

601
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,840
in the reoccurring production of the show, making it financially possible that if like

602
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,240
every sponsor pulled out tomorrow, we could still get an episode out, right?

603
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
We could still pay for the editor.

604
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,680
That is what the members are doing and it is absolutely essential, UnpluggedCore.com

605
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
by the way, or Jupiter.party.

606
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,380
And then the boosters are coming in and they're thanking us for that particular production.

607
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,520
They're transferring their value for that particular production.

608
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,480
And when you see something like PayPal and the moves they're making and then people's

609
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,200
result because they're clearly upset, justifiably so, I am just so grateful for something like

610
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,460
the Lightning Network and the fact that these boosts are app agnostic as well.

611
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,040
So there's just no vendor tie-in, there's no lock-in at all.

612
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,320
So thank you to John A and thank you to Gene Bean.

613
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,640
We'll have more boosts later in the show, but I think this is going to be more important

614
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,920
to podcasters as time goes on.

615
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,760
I could talk about it for hours, but instead I'll save some of that for office hours.

616
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
And why don't we move on to the new Thaleo?

617
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,460
The new Thaleo from System76, they shipped us a pre-production unit so we could get our

618
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,780
hands on it early and start doing some testing and then the road trip landed.

619
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,360
So they actually released it while we were on the road trip.

620
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,500
We just didn't have a moment to talk about it.

621
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,520
We want to talk about it today because it's kind of an iconic piece of hardware in its

622
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,040
look, in what it's trying to do performance-wise, its ambition in that regard.

623
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,000
It's kind of the Mac Pro for the Linux crowd.

624
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,840
I don't know if we have a better built, you know, especially when you look at all the

625
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,760
range of Thaleos, there's like five different Thaleos and some of them are just monstrous.

626
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,240
Yeah, I mean, I'm a machine, I don't even know what I would be able to do it with.

627
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Throw all the scripts I have at it.

628
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I know, right?

629
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,120
So what we have in the studio is the smaller of the five Thaleos.

630
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,920
It's the base unit, still pretty rockin', AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, which bursts up to 4.8

631
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:58,640
gigs, 32 gigabytes of fast RAM, a 1 terabyte Samsung 980 SSD, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti with

632
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,800
8 gigs of RAM, and a crap ton of CUDA cores.

633
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,080
And you can get it with AMD or Intel builds, but ours came with the AMD build, obviously.

634
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,160
The size of the base Thaleo on your desk takes up about the size of a sheet of paper.

635
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
That's the footprint.

636
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
You're talking about like the 8, yeah, the footprint.

637
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Oh, wow, okay.

638
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Not, right?

639
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
And I'd say it's about the height.

640
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,920
It's about half the height of a standard ATX.

641
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,360
So it's actually much more compact than the pictures make it look.

642
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,840
That really surprised me.

643
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
It's a dense little unit too, right?

644
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,400
Because the whole case is made out of like milled metal and aluminum or whatever.

645
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,080
It's not, I don't think it's aluminum, it's heavy.

646
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
Very sturdy.

647
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,440
And System76 has built certain things in there to hold the graphics card in place so it can

648
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
withstand shipping.

649
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
They've included things like the screws in the case.

650
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,820
They've pre-run all the wiring you'll ever need with wire management.

651
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,800
So if you want to add something, the plug is already there, you just...

652
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah, that part, the maintenance, the expandability bits, that seems very thoughtful.

653
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,480
It's got an impressive amount of room for storage even in this small unit.

654
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,360
So the Thaleo to me kind of feels like one of our hero machines in the Linux community

655
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,060
in terms... and that's kind of, that's a term for like a, you know, kind of like a really

656
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,580
high-end aspirational unit.

657
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,080
And the base price starts at $950 US greenbacks.

658
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,040
Our unit as configured came in around $2,100, $2,200 depending on what you do warranty-wise

659
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,260
and whatnot.

660
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,900
So $2,200 we'll say for our unit.

661
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,520
And I think ours was pretty close to the final production unit with just a couple of tweaks

662
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,120
like to the Wi-Fi and a couple of other small things.

663
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,700
Some brackets here and there that they print and whatnot and of course the parts.

664
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,520
But now they're shipping the full production units.

665
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
And we ran ours with Pop!

666
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,840
OS for a little while to get a good sense of that.

667
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,860
And then, oh, I don't know, I think a week or two after some baseline testing, we moved

668
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,460
it over as like a workstation and put Nix on there.

669
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,040
And then towards the end, we started looking at it more as like an OBS live streaming machine

670
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,600
and a deep fusion rendering.

671
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Is that the right way to put that?

672
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah, you know, playing with some machine learning tasks because why not?

673
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,280
When you got a nice graphics card, you got a fancy rig.

674
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,560
It's got a lot of CUDA cores Wes, a lot of CUDA cores.

675
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Yeah.

676
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
And that's been a lot of fun.

677
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,600
The challenge for us here is like, how do you really, how do you push something like

678
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
this?

679
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Right?

680
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,480
It's got 12 physical cores, 24 virtual cores when they're all turned on.

681
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,720
I mean, that just like takes up your whole HTOP screen just right there, just showing

682
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
you all the cores.

683
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,000
You don't even get to the processes.

684
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
It's pretty crazy.

685
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,320
And for me, 3060 Ti is like the nicest video card I've had in two years.

686
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,720
And 32 gigs of RAM, well, I can actually use that up, but it's a lot of RAM, it's a lot

687
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
of RAM.

688
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,920
So we really wanted to push this thing and we did.

689
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,080
We attached three external monitors to it to kind of really kind of tax the graphical

690
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
subsystem with different speeds.

691
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,520
So one in the center was a high refresh rate, high DPI, HDR monitor.

692
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,080
And then we had two 1440p monitors, one vertical, one horizontal.

693
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,520
And it was driving all of those with the Nvidia card as we were doing all of this testing.

694
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
And one of the things we'll do, although I'll give you a high level overview, but just so

695
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,560
you know if you're listening, in the notes, we have linked to some openbenchmarking.org

696
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,200
benchmarks for kernel compilation time, 3D graphics performance.

697
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,880
We also did some comparisons between the Dev1 and the Thalia, which I'll talk about in a

698
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,100
little bit.

699
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,400
But if you're curious to know how your system would stack up to this Thalia, if you'd like

700
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,920
to know what kind of performance delta you're looking at, you can go to these links and

701
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,640
there is a command you can copy in there, and you can run your system against the Thalia

702
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
and see.

703
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,280
That way I have like an easy thing I can go justify maybe to someone if I need to say

704
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,120
like, look, this is what I got now, it's not cutting that, whether that's a partner or

705
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
a boss.

706
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,160
Well, it was interesting with the Dev1, Wes.

707
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,240
You know, so we benchmarked the Dev1 versus the Thalia on a few things.

708
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,440
And I was impressed with how the Dev1 performed, I'll say that.

709
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,360
But it was clear there was a significant time savings for some of this stuff if you went

710
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
with the Thalia.

711
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,880
I mean, Brent, I'm curious to know what your impression was if you kind of if you experienced

712
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
the same thing.

713
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,440
It's like, wow, there's a big delta here.

714
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,240
But practically speaking, it makes sense for the price of the units.

715
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
I think it really depends on your workload likely.

716
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Like I was looking at it from a desktop users workload, not necessarily someone who's doing,

717
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,480
you know, machine learning and all that kind of fancy stuff that I don't know how to do

718
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
yet.

719
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,440
But it seemed to me from that perspective, that it was surprisingly close.

720
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,080
You know, we also in our comparisons had my old x 250 in there.

721
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,040
So I think that adds perspective a little bit.

722
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,040
It was lagging far, far, far, far, far behind.

723
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
But we knew that.

724
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,560
But it was interesting to add that to the comparisons, because then it became maybe

725
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:56,720
a bit less of a massive jump in advantage to having the Thalia versus the Dev1 for certain

726
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
modes.

727
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,520
And more of like, I want to be careful with saying this, but like slightly diminishing

728
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,180
returns in that, if you're really going to push it, well, that thing can do amazing things.

729
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,840
But if you don't need the whole performance gamut, maybe the Dev1 is actually a surprisingly

730
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
good machine.

731
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,600
Yeah, I think it speaks to how far laptops have come.

732
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,400
Yeah, especially the AMD laptop stack is very impressive.

733
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,400
The Thalia if you're buying this, you're buying it for a high end workload.

734
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,360
Like this is the kind of machine where you can have a kernel build going or you can have

735
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,080
something building in the background, while you're also running all of your regular applications

736
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,840
and maybe you fire up a quick game to kill a few minutes.

737
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,560
Kind of thing you get so you just don't have to think about the computer performance for

738
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
the most part, right?

739
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,640
It's essentially unlimited.

740
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,180
And if you like that idea, the Thalia might be worth the $2,200.

741
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll tell you what, like multiple times, Brent and I had a YouTube video playing, software

742
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,320
building in the background and the highest end games we could possibly find on Steam

743
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,480
and the games we could run under wine or whatnot.

744
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Going at the same time.

745
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
Let me see how this testing went down now, okay.

746
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,520
There were at times multiple games being played somehow.

747
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,880
We managed to figure that one out.

748
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,600
I had Zonotic going and I can't remember the Zelda knockoff PC game that we were playing,

749
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,680
but a very high end looking game.

750
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,440
And while we also had Zonotic going on one of the monitors, while we also had a software

751
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
build going.

752
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,360
The Hashcat too, I think was running at the same time in certain cases.

753
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,840
I mean, you can really push this thing and you know, it will use power.

754
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,200
I think when we really, what we were attempting to replicate, we weren't just like being silly.

755
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,520
I mean, we were kind of having fun too, but what we really wanted to replicate is we wanted

756
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,840
to stress several of the subsystems at once.

757
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,200
We really wanted to stress the GPU and the CPU simultaneously.

758
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
I'll tell you why here in a moment.

759
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,920
But while we were doing all of this, the unit's taken, you know, just over 300 watts of power.

760
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,340
We ran this thing continuously on a monitor so that way we could chart its power usage

761
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,780
over the entire time we've had it.

762
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,960
And there's clear differences in sustained workloads and in just sort of idle, you know,

763
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,320
just doing day-to-day office stuff.

764
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,960
There's about 180 to 200 watt difference.

765
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,000
So you can tell when you're using it.

766
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,640
Man, when that Nvidia card lights up, oh boy, it's a whole other, it's a minimum of like

767
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
another 100 watts of power that thing draws.

768
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,260
So that Nvidia card is powerful.

769
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:26,060
That brings me to my point that I think this Thalio unit probably suffers from more so

770
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,000
than all of the other larger Thalios.

771
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,800
And that was thermals because Brent, we spent a lot of time digging through the thermal

772
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,360
performance on this when we were stressing the GPU and the CPU at the same time.

773
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,640
Yeah, I think that's really what we wanted to discover was can it sustain those kinds

774
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
of workloads?

775
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,480
You know, okay, we're playing two video games at the same time.

776
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,560
Maybe that's not realistic, but we did do some actual real workloads that you could

777
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:59,480
see someone doing and it was really fascinating to watch how the Thalio reacted in terms of

778
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
keeping itself cool.

779
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,000
And I think we were pretty surprised that it had to really make some major changes to

780
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
keep those temperatures down.

781
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,920
You know, if you're stressing the GPU, it just, the CPU has just dropped dramatically

782
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,080
to try to maintain, I guess, order inside that case.

783
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,240
And we did experience certain, maybe borderline alarming properties about the case.

784
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,480
One of them, which you and I were both surprised by, was just how, I'm going to say hot, I'm

785
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,520
not going to say warm, I'm going to say how hot the case got when that thing was really

786
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,160
being pushed for, I think it would take maybe like 10 minutes for it to get to that point.

787
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
What'd you say, Chris?

788
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,480
Yeah, 10 minutes of really pushing.

789
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Really pushing.

790
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,440
CPU, GPU, and disk and really giving it the onion.

791
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,440
And what you have is the primary air intake on that Thalio.

792
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
This is my supposition.

793
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,360
I don't know if this is actually the problem, but my theory is the primary air intake is

794
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,520
on the very bottom of the case.

795
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,600
And so if you've got some carpet, that may interfere a little bit with air flow.

796
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,600
So we put it up on a flat surface, it does have some nice feet to give it a little bit

797
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
of distance.

798
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:20,200
And that air gets blown up past the PSU and blows through the GPU and it blows through

799
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,680
the intake of the GPU, nicely done, and the GPU, it actually stays relatively cool, comparatively.

800
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,640
But then that GPU and that air continues up into the CPU intake.

801
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,940
And I imagine some of it's getting blown out the back of the GPU, but some of that hot

802
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,400
air is being pulled into the CPU cooler.

803
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,800
And so it's starting with a pretty high temperature.

804
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,840
And what we witnessed was we'd see it clamp down to about two-ish gigahertz, 2.2 gigahertz.

805
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,840
So we weren't getting anywhere near 4.8 for sustained workloads.

806
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Now for bursty things, this wasn't really a problem.

807
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,200
But sustained workloads, you could watch the CPU speed is just kind of drop.

808
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,920
Now, practically speaking, if I had done this workload and didn't have frequency monitors

809
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,880
running and temperature monitors running, I'd have no idea.

810
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,560
You don't really notice it because you've got 12 cores at like 2.2 gigahertz or whatever,

811
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,020
whatever it's throttled to, like 2.2 is worst case.

812
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,880
Sometimes it's up in three, right?

813
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,640
You've got 12 of them and you've got 24 virtual threads.

814
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
And they're still going.

815
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,240
So you wouldn't notice it until Linux gives up the ghost, because sometimes if you stress

816
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,720
the disk, the GPU, the CPU, and the networking, you really push it, sometimes Linux gives

817
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,940
up the ghost.

818
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,760
And you do notice it then, but there is thermal throttling that's happening in this unit.

819
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,060
And I would imagine if you got one without a honker of a video card in there, you might

820
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,520
be a little better off.

821
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,020
If you don't need that honker, maybe don't do it.

822
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,440
But we did double check everything.

823
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,540
And everything was within the specs of like the RAM, the CPU, the GPU, the motherboard,

824
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,780
the Northbridge, because we got one of those little laser guns and checked everything.

825
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,160
And everything was within the upper limits of the thermal specs.

826
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,080
And if you're not absolutely pushing the GPU and the CPU to their max consistently, it's

827
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,680
not as much of a problem.

828
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,080
And if you're just looking for bursty performance, you're going to get everything that AMD has

829
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
to offer.

830
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,980
I mean, it really does perform.

831
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,060
But it led us like just a little uneasy about the temperatures.

832
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,720
And so we kept an eye on that.

833
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,640
We chatted with System76 about it, and I think for the most part, you're probably within

834
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,560
the limits of what's OK.

835
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,440
I was slightly worried about it, but you'd probably be all right.

836
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,000
This morning, though, well, this morning, things changed and not for the better.

837
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,040
I wish I could have just captured it happening.

838
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,680
I'll try to describe what I saw briefly.

839
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,520
So the system was booting after being powered off at the smart switch, because there's a

840
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,720
smart switch down there that it isn't currently plugged into as a troubleshooting technique.

841
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,840
But the entire time we've had it, we've had it plugged into this smart plug for power

842
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,060
monitoring so we can get historical power monitoring.

843
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,200
That smart plug got turned off last night.

844
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,760
Otherwise, I think the system's been running for days.

845
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,980
When I turned it back on this morning, the LED light lit up around the little button

846
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,060
like it normally does that indicates that it has power, but it's off.

847
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,320
You press that and then it gets bright and the system powers up.

848
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,160
That begins to happen.

849
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,400
As the system is booting, the light turned off on the LED power light.

850
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,800
It just turned off.

851
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,400
The fans were still running.

852
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,940
I could see LED lights reflecting out from the bottom of the case from like the graphics

853
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:43,360
card internally, but the LED power light was out.

854
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,200
So I flipped the power off on the back of the power supply, flipped it back on, and

855
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,240
now it just doesn't boot, which sort of stinks because this was going to do our live stream

856
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,240
today.

857
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,200
I've tried turning it on and off on the back of the power supply.

858
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:10,320
I've moved it out of the smart plug and I've left it unplugged for a bit, and nothing.

859
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,560
So it seems on its last morning of duty, well, it eats the duty.

860
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,520
I'm not really sure what happened.

861
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,040
I actually haven't even had time to contact System76 support yet because I was going up

862
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,760
there to grab it this morning thinking that we'll use it down here in the studio today

863
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,000
because we've been experimenting with OBS on there as well, and I just had that issue.

864
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,680
Now we do have a pre-production unit I should mention, and so that could be a factor here,

865
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,440
and there could be something with the button.

866
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,960
So the case has the button integrated into it.

867
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,480
It is a hell of a power button, and when you slide the case up, it disconnects, and when

868
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,180
you slide the case down, it seats into a little connector.

869
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,920
We haven't moved it, but it's possible, like maybe that got loose or disconnected.

870
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,680
So I'm going to play with that after the show, and obviously I'm going to let System76 know

871
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
about it too.

872
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,680
You know, if a machine is going to have issues, it's probably within the first month or so.

873
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,120
First hundred days of usage is probably when it's going to fail, or it's like after five

874
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
years.

875
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,920
It's like one of those two times, right?

876
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,800
As a desktop, I would love it in here.

877
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,760
As an OBS machine, I think it would just make an excellent OBS machine.

878
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,600
I don't know if I would need a 3060 Ti.

879
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,160
We could probably get away with an ARC.

880
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Exactly.

881
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Exactly.

882
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,280
We could probably get away with like a $280 ARC that would, I would hope, do like quick

883
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,800
sync and OBS would support, and you put something like that in a Thalia, that would also drop

884
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,240
the price by like $700 because these GPUs are crazy, and now you've got yourself a serious

885
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,600
OBS alternative because our hardware is falling apart.

886
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,800
I like how there's this world now where you could have like you're getting an AMD CPU

887
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,600
with your Intel GPU.

888
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,920
Westman, you are blowing my mind.

889
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
You're right.

890
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,760
2022, you crazy cat, but I like the setup, although maybe you would want to go all Intel.

891
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,120
I mean, the 12th gen CPUs aren't so bad.

892
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Maybe you would just go all Intel, Intel ARC, Intel CPU.

893
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:17,240
I think that would make a compelling OBS machine, and I might, I don't know, I might, I might

894
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,240
do it.

895
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
I haven't decided yet.

896
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,760
I kind of like the idea of, you know, it is a very handsome looking machine.

897
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,080
I really wouldn't mind having it sort of right on the desk.

898
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,080
It's okay.

899
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,040
It looks fine, and it looks nice in an office.

900
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,240
It's something that looks good in the studio.

901
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,720
I wouldn't mind having it in studio, which is a cool looking piece of hardware.

902
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,720
Yep.

903
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,680
And you know, our little hiccup aside, you know, System76 machines, they seem to last.

904
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,680
Like I would be confident, like if we did that go that direction, I think it could,

905
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,680
you know, I could fill that role for a long time.

906
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,680
Yeah.

907
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,360
One of the things about using the Thalios, I felt like, well, I don't know if I ever

908
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,480
want to build in my own computer again, because I'm never going to have a case this good,

909
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,680
and everything just fits together really well.

910
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,640
I mean, we've seen them build it, and they definitely do a better job than I do when

911
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm putting computers together.

912
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,800
That also influences my thought process a little bit, as we've been to the factory,

913
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,000
we've been on the floor, and we've seen the attention to detail assembling this thing,

914
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,760
and how, what a process that is.

915
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,200
And so there's something about having that bespoke made hardware right there in Denver

916
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,360
that is like, obsessed over for quality.

917
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,320
And now this is the next iteration, and they've updated that front panel, so they kind of,

918
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,760
they've removed the, they've removed that wood veneer siding, and they've replaced it

919
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,680
now with just a strip.

920
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
And I like it.

921
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,760
I think it looks good, and you can get customized ones, and it's kind of more low key, like

922
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,280
you could have argued that the wood look was a little dated, it was awesome, but it was

923
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,360
a little dated.

924
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,600
And this is a nice way to keep that, it's a nod to that.

925
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,600
But down the road, I think you're gonna be able to get customizable ones.

926
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Can you imagine?

927
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
That'd be nice too.

928
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,000
You know, we got a couple different machines here in the studio, you could easily tell

929
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
them apart.

930
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,920
Oh, you could put their names, like unit one, unit two.

931
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,400
Oh, that's a great idea.

932
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Yeah.

933
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,000
I was thinking, maybe we're at Linux Fest Northwest, and we're live streaming from Linux

934
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,320
Fest, and we've got Athelio up there, and we have in our panel is like the JB logo with

935
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,600
each logo for the show is vertically listed or something.

936
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Oh, yes.

937
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,040
And our website or whatever.

938
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,040
And you could do a little bit of branding on there.

939
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,800
So I think the idea is pretty good.

940
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,040
I think the machine's a good one.

941
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,000
The new case updates are really good to see, it's quieter.

942
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,680
There's been more attention to detail on the back, the ports are labeled in a nice way

943
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,560
that just all just works so well.

944
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,700
It's gotta be the best PC case ever.

945
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,680
I would say that as well, Chris, that case is probably the nicest case I've had my hands

946
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,960
on, and it just felt solid in every way, and it was very organized the way they put it

947
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
all together.

948
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,440
So I can't say that enough, like the attention to detail is clear in every step of the way.

949
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,760
So just to wrap it up, we were slightly concerned about the high thermals, but they were within

950
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,760
spec.

951
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,280
I think depending on your build, too, you're going to see different results.

952
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,920
And did they sort of tend to stabilize as the system adjusted?

953
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Yeah.

954
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,600
Yeah, it would just sort of reach a point and then just hold.

955
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,560
That gives me some confidence there, too, you know?

956
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
Yeah.

957
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,160
It's like the one step down from the absolute most baller CPU you can put in there.

958
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,720
So that's going to draw power.

959
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
It's going to generate heat, right?

960
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,680
It's one step down from the most baller GPU, or one or two steps down from the most baller

961
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,680
GPU.

962
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,380
That's going to generate a bunch of heat.

963
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,200
If you don't need to dial your system up to 11 and you still want that small footprint,

964
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,760
I think you could probably get it real tight.

965
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,520
Ah, you're just telling me to be reasonable.

966
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Okay.

967
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Well, I'm just thinking for our build, like you said, you get it without a GPU, and then

968
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,040
you add an arc.

969
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,280
I mean, that, I think, is the way to go.

970
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,760
I want to go configure one right now.

971
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,480
I'm thinking maybe I should just take a moment and just go build one.

972
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,480
Well, yeah.

973
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
I mean, the one we got in the studio is not working.

974
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,480
We need to order one.

975
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,480
I mean, there is that, right?

976
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,480
We don't want an outage or failure.

977
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,600
When did we have to do the Hawk attack on the power supply?

978
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,400
You were here, Brent, so that must have been office hours right before you left.

979
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,640
I have a technique.

980
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,200
When the machines are making noise, you got to listen to them, and depending on the type

981
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,360
of noise, you do a different type of attack.

982
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,480
So if it's a low, almost like throbbing, it almost sounds like a capacitor is about to

983
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,720
pop, but it's really just the fan, you got to make sure it's not the capacitor.

984
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,240
You don't want to attack the capacitor.

985
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,840
What you want to do is a Hawk-like striking attack with your hand, so make your hand look

986
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,640
like a Hawk, and I find if you make the noise, it helps, and then you just want to hit it

987
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,520
fast, like you're pecking it, tap, tap, tap, you know, you tap, tap, tap, like that a couple

988
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,360
of times, and that'll fix that.

989
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,040
But if it's a high-pitched, like louder one, like a grindier one, that's a full fist thump.

990
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,320
You want to do a big old thump-thump on that one.

991
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,320
Sometimes once, sometimes twice.

992
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,920
Now, do you curse as part of this at all?

993
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,720
You curse as you're walking up to it, you know, oh, this gosh darn doing this, but you

994
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,600
know, you put in the right, you know what I'm saying, here it goes again, you know,

995
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,200
you kind of do that kind of a thing, like that's my preferred technique, and then you

996
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:53,480
just get real focused, get Brent out of the way, and then you just do the Hawk attack.

997
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, apparently I don't know what I'm doing.

998
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,080
Clearly Chris has to show me how it's done, but...

999
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,000
I think this is what they teach you in the A plus certification, right?

1000
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,840
So you know, I used to be a tech, back in my day, that's how we did it, and that'll

1001
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,140
work for probably another month or two.

1002
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,360
The thing that I like about it is it's clear that like multiple components are failing

1003
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
too.

1004
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,680
It's like the GPU fans can be failing, the CPU fans failing, the PSU fan, yeah.

1005
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,160
A lot of variables in play.

1006
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,420
You know, who needs that crap anyways, right?

1007
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,280
I knew we were in a bad state, but when I got my head down there, I didn't realize just

1008
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,640
how in a bad state we are with the studio machines.

1009
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,680
The cases are half apart because clearly they've had issues for years, can I say that?

1010
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,640
And it's just a mess down there.

1011
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,200
I mean, Drew was amazing a few years ago and cleaned up all those cables.

1012
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,760
I think it's just a bird's nest again.

1013
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,960
Yeah, we need Drew to come back out and clean them all up again.

1014
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,920
I don't think it ever happens unless he does it.

1015
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,160
Don't tell him, we just gotta get him out here for some pretense.

1016
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,720
Yeah, right, right, you're right.

1017
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,120
Okay, so I didn't save as much money.

1018
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,520
So while we were chatting, I configured one and mine came in at $1,949 actually.

1019
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,480
Well, what are we getting for that?

1020
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,680
Well here's the thing is I kind of went baller on the storage.

1021
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,240
So I upgraded the power supply to make room for that arc.

1022
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,160
So it comes with a 450, I upgraded to a 650, which they recommend depending on your GPU.

1023
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,000
I went with integrated graphics.

1024
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,480
That's where we save the money because upgrading to the GPU I have is a $539 upgrade.

1025
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Oh boy.

1026
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,120
So it's not as much as I thought, but it is a lot.

1027
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,080
Now here's where I spent money.

1028
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,820
I got 500 gigs of PCIe Gen 4 storage for the OS drive.

1029
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:39,520
That's 6.9 gigabytes of transfer a second, 6,900 megabytes, right?

1030
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,440
6,900 megabyte read, 5,000 megabyte write.

1031
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
That's pretty good.

1032
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
I think that worked for us.

1033
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,680
We can update that next door, huh?

1034
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,560
Yeah, that's PCIe Gen 4.

1035
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:55,640
And then for the bigger storage for like the recorded videos, which are just like 10 megabit

1036
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:04,240
bitrate videos, I went with a 4 terabyte storage, which is a 535 megabyte read and a 515 megabyte

1037
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
write.

1038
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,580
But again, we're just doing 10 megabit video or whatever, so should be fine.

1039
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,880
But that's kind of a spendy upgrade.

1040
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,960
That 4 terabytes there is kind of spendy.

1041
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,600
I would drop 485 bucks if I took that off.

1042
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,760
So if you already had some like storage you wanted to use...

1043
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,040
I kind of do, but it's spinning rust.

1044
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,240
I think I'd like to go SSD in this.

1045
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Don't you think?

1046
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
It would be convenient.

1047
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,320
Yeah, but that's a debatable one.

1048
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,360
I think I could take it off and I could come up with probably a better way to do that.

1049
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,800
So I'm going to take off that additional storage.

1050
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,000
We'll just stick with the PCIe 4 storage for the OS drive.

1051
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,480
Yeah, that seems like the option you click if like money's not a big deal and you just

1052
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,680
want to forget about having to worry about storage for a while, which is a nice position.

1053
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Yeah.

1054
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
All right.

1055
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,520
So looking at that, taking that modification off, that brings the Studio Thalio that I

1056
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,920
would build for OBS to $1,464 at $1,400.

1057
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,240
Now mind you, I would be buying an ARC GPU later.

1058
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,960
So that's another 280 bucks, but a base price of $1,400 for a machine that would probably

1059
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,160
work for us for eight years, 10 years as a streaming machine, maybe six years.

1060
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,160
I don't know.

1061
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,360
That seems like a pretty good deal actually.

1062
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,560
And you get a warranty in there too, which these machines certainly don't have.

1063
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,040
I don't know.

1064
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,400
That seems like a pretty fair value.

1065
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
I have to say.

1066
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,160
I know it's not the exact machine we tested, but it's still a really well-specced machine

1067
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,680
with 32 gigs of RAM and a nice high-end Intel CPU in there.

1068
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,240
So I'd be very happy to have that system.

1069
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,640
So I think you got to price it for the right workload.

1070
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,200
The nice thing is you got a lot of options.

1071
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,320
There's from AMD options to Intel options to Vigicards, no Vigicards, lots of storage,

1072
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,240
SSD, PCI storage, you name it.

1073
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,240
You got lots of options with the Thalio, including size options.

1074
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,560
So I think you just got to figure out what your workload is and go from there.

1075
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,820
And the way I would do that, if you really have no idea how to start, I would go grab

1076
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,640
those benchmark links that we have and compare them to your system.

1077
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,320
And you can kind of see where a laptop, the Dev1 fits in there or an old ThinkPad if you'd

1078
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,960
like to grab that.

1079
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,360
And a fairly well-specced, not the maximum Thalio.

1080
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,600
You could still spec it out even higher, but a well-specced Thalio and see where your systems

1081
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,600
fall in there.

1082
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,200
And then you can start to get a price performance ratio idea and maybe do a build from there.

1083
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,640
And I think if you buy this machine, you're going to be extremely happy with it.

1084
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:18,360
I had the unfortunate ending where mine died, but I don't really know what happened there.

1085
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,480
The last thing that happened to that machine is it was running and the smart plug got turned

1086
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,640
off and the machine was hard turned off.

1087
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,240
And then when we realized what happened, as we were getting it set up to do the show this

1088
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,680
morning, we turned the smart plug back on and when the Thalio gets power, the little

1089
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,840
light around the button turns on low, a soft light around the button and it's a good button.

1090
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,280
When you push the button in, very satisfied, then the light gets bright and the machine

1091
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,840
boots up.

1092
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,200
So it did that.

1093
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,260
And you could hear the fans kick in and just about as the boot process was done, right?

1094
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:02,520
As like X or Wayland was loading on the screen, the screen went blank, the LED lighter on

1095
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,720
the button went out, but the fans were on and like the LEDs inside the case were still

1096
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,720
going, right?

1097
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,360
It makes me think maybe something got disconnected with that button or maybe something died somewhere

1098
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,880
in like the motherboard or something.

1099
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,360
But I suspect you like that button so much that you've clicked it too many times at this

1100
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
point.

1101
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Even just a couple of weeks, you've had it.

1102
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
I'm going to find out after the show.

1103
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
I'll find out.

1104
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:32,320
I'll report back next week if I remember, you know, I'll do my best.

1105
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,360
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1106
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,440
That's where you go for yourself to try it out for free.

1107
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,280
Or it's a good way as an enterprise or a team to get started.

1108
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,800
Bitwarden is the easiest way for a business or an individual to store, share and sync

1109
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,040
sensitive data.

1110
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,440
It's what I use for passphrases, passwords, private information that maybe I want to keep

1111
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,360
in a vault that I have easy access to, but I know is truly protected and there's a safe

1112
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,700
way to share it with my team and my family.

1113
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,720
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factor codes and other sensitive data

1114
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,720
like recovery keys.

1115
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:07,280
And of course, Bitwarden has just been getting better and better as they've been a sponsor.

1116
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,360
They just did their October release.

1117
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,480
So great.

1118
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,960
Password protected, encrypted, export.

1119
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,040
You can export your vault in an encrypted format using a password of your choice.

1120
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,320
That's so nice.

1121
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,480
On mobile, the username generator is here.

1122
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,440
It also includes three out of the five aliases for generating an email address just for that

1123
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,120
service that Bitwarden supports, including DuckDuckGo email aliases.

1124
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,120
It's now in there.

1125
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,440
I'm not sure if it's in the mobile app.

1126
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,200
I should mention, depending when you're listening to this, the mobile apps can have to trickle

1127
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
out to the app stores.

1128
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,920
But these things are coming, including DuckDuckGo's email alias service.

1129
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
How cool is that?

1130
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,740
So now you don't have to give away your email address to these services.

1131
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,200
You can generate a unique username, a unique password, and a unique email address for every

1132
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,680
site and service you use.

1133
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,040
And you can use those complicated passwords on mobile, on your desktop.

1134
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,080
I grabbed the Flatpak from FlatHub and I used one of the very first things I install to

1135
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,440
get some of my applications up and going on my Linux desktop.

1136
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
It's so fantastic.

1137
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,080
Doing it any other way just feels like caveman stuff.

1138
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,760
I couldn't even imagine.

1139
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,040
So go try it out and support the show.

1140
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,880
Go get started by visiting bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1141
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,020
Try it for yourself.

1142
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,440
Maybe recommend it to your business, to your team you're working with, or maybe you know

1143
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,800
a friend or a family member who could just use better password practices.

1144
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,480
Send them all to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1145
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:30,040
That's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1146
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,080
This week for feedback, we're featuring two love letters.

1147
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,320
One of them is from Mike, longtime listener and lifetime Jupiter party member here saying

1148
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,440
thank you for introducing me to NixOS.

1149
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,140
I know the summer of immutability is long over now, but I've never been so smitten with

1150
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,800
a distro as I am now with NixOS.

1151
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,820
I reluctantly tried it to prove it was just all hype, but I was wrong.

1152
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,820
It's glorious.

1153
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,880
I've come to trust it more than I've ever trusted anything.

1154
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,280
It's so reliable and predictable that I'll swap my main production machine over to something

1155
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,200
like Plasma or Sway for the weekend, play with it, and then just switch it back to GNOME

1156
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,780
for work on Monday.

1157
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,060
It's never failed me so far.

1158
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,120
It's so reliable, in fact, that I grabbed one of these cheap Beelink mini PCs that you

1159
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:23,760
recommended, threw NixOS and GNOME at it, and set up a VPN so my dad can plug it into

1160
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,760
his television.

1161
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,680
My dad is a 65 year old and always seems to find a way to break software in new and interesting

1162
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,680
ways.

1163
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,880
He's been using it for a month now and loves it so much that he's getting a Thalio and

1164
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,600
having me replace his Intel Mac Mini.

1165
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:44,080
NixOS turns out to be a bit of a unicorn where it's great for tinkerers like me, but also

1166
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,840
a bulletproof setup for friends and family.

1167
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,320
Thanks again for all you do and getting me on track on what has been my favorite Linux

1168
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,840
experience ever.

1169
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:59,080
P.S. I even wrote an article doing a deep dive into why NixOS is so great.

1170
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,800
Which we'll have linked in the show notes.

1171
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,960
I had not even considered that.

1172
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,560
I've been having some upgrade struggles with my mom's laptop doing a little tech support

1173
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,760
and sort of reconsidering like, well, you know, she's on the latest Ubuntu LTS at the

1174
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,960
moment with Monte.

1175
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,160
She likes it fine, but I don't use that platform a whole lot.

1176
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,560
It's not the best thing for me to support on.

1177
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,920
I'd never considered NixOS, but gosh, Mike.

1178
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,320
You might be onto something here.

1179
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,640
You know, I have to say it was really nice on that Thalio when Linux 6.0 came out and

1180
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:32,000
the NVIDIA driver wasn't compatible instead of doing a system upgrade and rebooting and

1181
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,560
discovering we didn't have 3D graphics on a system that we were specifically using 3D

1182
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,560
graphics on.

1183
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,080
It's really nice just to have it say, no, I don't want to do the upgrade.

1184
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,080
You got a problem here.

1185
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,080
You got to sort it out first.

1186
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,080
That's so nice.

1187
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,080
It is.

1188
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,760
It's exactly that kind of like nice remote safety to where it's like, OK, well, I can

1189
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,840
upgrade you next time I'm there, then I don't need to do this remotely.

1190
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,920
One other thing I'll say that's really nice about Nix that hasn't always been the case

1191
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:59,000
for me on some Linux distributions is it's real easy to install software for the most

1192
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
part.

1193
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,560
Some people like Linus Tech Tips sometimes mess that up, too.

1194
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,720
But it is for the most part, you got a lot of software to choose from.

1195
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,720
It's pretty easy to find it.

1196
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,040
It's pretty easy to install it.

1197
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,080
That's great.

1198
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,040
Not always the case when it comes to removing the software, though.

1199
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,960
That sometimes breaks things or people have run into issues.

1200
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,520
I've heard from listeners that just say, I never uninstall anything.

1201
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,040
I just install it and I never uninstall.

1202
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,240
That's not the case with Nix.

1203
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,500
You remove something, it's like it was never there.

1204
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,680
It's like it's just never even a trace of it.

1205
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,680
It's just glorious.

1206
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,340
It's completely cleaned up.

1207
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,340
Love that about it.

1208
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,060
And it's super easy to just spin up a little environment to have it to play with something

1209
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,080
to know that when you're done, it's just gone.

1210
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,940
And Chris, did you have to do anything special with Nix OS to get the Thalia working the

1211
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,940
way you wanted?

1212
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,800
Was there any special treatment you had to give it compared to some of your other systems?

1213
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,800
I actually started with my config file from my dev one.

1214
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,760
So I just took my Nix config over from my dev one.

1215
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,080
And on the Nix wiki, I found like there was like three lines of code I needed to add to

1216
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,560
support the NVIDIA driver, which is so nice.

1217
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,320
You know, it's such a hit and miss experience.

1218
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:11,200
And on Nix, it was like, add these three lines that you got from the wiki and rebuild.

1219
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
You're good.

1220
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
You got the NVIDIA driver.

1221
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Now you're done.

1222
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,560
There's no like going to the NVIDIA site and trying to go find the right version of the

1223
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,280
driver and getting the link.

1224
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,280
Yeah.

1225
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,280
Yeah.

1226
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,280
Just so great.

1227
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,320
And you could specify if you want the beta driver, if you want the stable driver.

1228
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,080
And like what we decided to do is we switched the machine over to the LTS kernel and you

1229
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,720
just change that in the Nix config, right?

1230
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,600
Yeah, it's great, you know, and then reboot and done.

1231
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,540
And it gets the right NVIDIA modules for that automatically, builds them, installs them

1232
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,720
and you're done.

1233
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,680
So we made that modification, but not otherwise.

1234
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,680
No.

1235
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,560
Because I started with a bare Nix box, move the config over.

1236
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,680
I did a rebuild and I was 95 percent the way there.

1237
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,680
It was so awesome.

1238
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,880
Well, that's great to hear and it sounds like you're still in love with Nix.

1239
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Oh, yeah.

1240
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,040
It's it's a struggle not to make every episode about Nix still, right?

1241
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,720
Because I all I 100 percent agree with Mike.

1242
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:10,260
It's the most exciting thing in Linux that I've come across in years.

1243
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,760
And you know, they just voted to have like a new community organization that we should

1244
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,320
dig into that at some point.

1245
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,080
It's so great.

1246
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,320
So grateful that I found Nix and I love all the other distribution still.

1247
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,320
I mean, we have them.

1248
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,520
We actually don't have any Nix in the studio.

1249
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,120
Right tool for the right job kind of stuff.

1250
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,160
But maybe one day.

1251
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,960
Aaron wrote in suggesting maybe this might be another love letter as well.

1252
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,600
P.S. loving all the extra Brent on the different podcasts as of late.

1253
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,720
When will J.B. launch the Brent hosted podcast Bug Squad?

1254
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,080
This could include Brent's weekly bug find trying to reproduce bugs from issue trackers

1255
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,920
or that tedious bug of the week.

1256
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,480
People either love it or hate it.

1257
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,440
I don't know at the rate you find bugs, I might need to be a daily show.

1258
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,440
Yeah.

1259
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
OK.

1260
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,200
Can you tell their listener that Brent picks the emails to the extra funny part is I got

1261
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,640
a twin brother and his name's Aaron.

1262
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,760
I don't think he wrote this, but I can't be sure something like Aaron on the side of caution

1263
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,640
and it's you and your brother finding bugs, I think that'd be pretty great.

1264
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
Adorable.

1265
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,640
I mean, this is your life.

1266
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,120
So you might as well make content out of it.

1267
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,120
You're constantly finding the bugs.

1268
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,120
That's a good point.

1269
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,480
They say write what you know.

1270
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,480
I'm down.

1271
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,840
We'll make a we'll make a special event out of it.

1272
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,840
A little extra Brent.

1273
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,840
It's just the right amount.

1274
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,320
A little bit of Brent here for brunch.

1275
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Yeah.

1276
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
You know, nobody's making me brunch anymore.

1277
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
No.

1278
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Well, you'll have to come this way, Chris.

1279
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
Yeah.

1280
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,800
I better get up there before the served in the hot tub and I better get up there before

1281
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
the snow.

1282
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Right.

1283
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
I hear that's the thing.

1284
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,240
We do have a good batch of boost grams.

1285
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,600
Our first boost comes in from Tim White 101 with nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety

1286
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,600
nine sats.

1287
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:51,160
He was almost a baller, but he was edged out by John A's maneuvering and he boosts in.

1288
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,800
I'm a new fountain user and this is my first boost.

1289
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,200
I've been listening for a few years.

1290
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,880
You've inspired me to try a few things.

1291
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,840
I'm building the Alman nine NAS for my Plex set up to VMS and I'm ditching Google photos.

1292
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
Nice.

1293
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Nice job, Tim.

1294
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:13,200
So I'm looking for a non ZFS storage to leverage my two ten terabyte seven K drives plus one

1295
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,640
consumer MVME cache.

1296
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,120
I'd like a little bit of bit rot protection.

1297
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:21,840
I like that LVM integrity, maybe some caching, but it's not supported with LVM.

1298
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,440
Stratus can import LVM integrity mirror and apply basic cash, but I'd love to do it all

1299
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,080
in LVM or Stratus, but neither seem to allow both.

1300
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,640
Do you gentlemen have a better way?

1301
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,920
Well, no, I'd probably just use ZFS.

1302
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
I would use ButterFS.

1303
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,280
I really would.

1304
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,840
For this set up, I honestly would.

1305
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,640
For two disks, I don't know, ZFS is a lot.

1306
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,160
It's not built into the kernel, so you're taking that on.

1307
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,640
So now you've got to mitigate that kind of problem that sometimes crops up.

1308
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,840
Whereas with ButterFS, it's like we were talking about with the Intel arc driver.

1309
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
It's upstream.

1310
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,420
It's in every release.

1311
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,200
Every kernel version is basically slightly improving it, whereas ZFS, it's a much slower

1312
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,600
development pace.

1313
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,760
It requires the proprietary module, which sometimes can break.

1314
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,580
I mean, you could definitely do a two drive mirror in ZFS, plus you got that MVME.

1315
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,580
You could definitely do it.

1316
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:15,320
I would definitely just consider ButterFS.

1317
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,320
I think it's sort of a shame that Red Hat has gone the way of Stratus.

1318
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:25,560
I mean, I love XFS and I love LVM, but I think the future in that regard is ButterFS.

1319
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,820
And if you think I'm wrong, try it.

1320
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:34,840
Because I was one of the loudest ButterFS haters on the internet, but they got better.

1321
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,980
They invested, things improved.

1322
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,520
We started deploying it.

1323
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:46,040
And now I have many, many, many, many terabytes in ButterFS, and we're not losing data over

1324
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,040
here.

1325
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,520
In fact, it's always the ButterFS arrays that come back up without a problem after an upgrade

1326
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
every single time.

1327
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,400
You know, there's some shiny new stuff, too, in these recent kernels, like in 6.0.

1328
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,520
I think some stuff landing in 6.1, so it's also a nice time to be a Butter user.

1329
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,520
Yeah.

1330
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:06,080
There's gonna be some really, there was some really nice stuff in 6.0, and I'm very excited

1331
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,360
about what's in 6.1.

1332
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,360
Very excited.

1333
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,560
Didn't they fix a major issue in ButterFS that's been talked about for years now?

1334
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,560
Right.

1335
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,320
We need to do some testing, but apparently that RAID 5.6 whole issue has been solved

1336
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,720
in Linux 6.0.

1337
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,840
Let's take some of Brent's most precious data, configure it on a new array, and see what

1338
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
happens.

1339
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,400
Soham boosts in with a row of ducks.

1340
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,400
Long time, first time, I've been listening for five plus years now.

1341
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,280
Here's a blast from the past.

1342
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,400
What happened to Castablasta, you know, the one made with Hugin?

1343
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,240
And he sent in another thousand SATs.

1344
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,880
Whatever happened to the clear Linux project from Intel?

1345
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Double boost, let's go!

1346
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,760
Thank you for the double boost, Soham.

1347
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:52,040
So let's start with what happened to Castablasta, which is our internal publishing tool.

1348
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,240
It's still going.

1349
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,360
We just don't talk about it very much.

1350
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,360
Cast it away in the background.

1351
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,360
Yeah.

1352
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,720
I mean, it is very much an internal tool.

1353
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:03,160
I think we invasioned like something that would have something that anybody could pick

1354
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,160
up and use.

1355
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,000
But as time went on, we created something that meets all the edge cases for all the

1356
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,720
various shows of ours that have all these weird historical legacy dependencies and stuff.

1357
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,640
And the particular tools that we happen to be using at the time?

1358
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,080
I think it's safe to say like Castablasta 2.0 may be in the works.

1359
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:25,440
Wes and I are getting serious in the conversations about self-generating all of our own RSS feeds.

1360
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,000
A lot of times it's either done by a hosting platform or like a WordPress plugin or some

1361
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,360
tool that generates the feed.

1362
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,320
Oh, I was going to pitch you on a WordPress plugin.

1363
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,320
Just kidding.

1364
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
Yeah.

1365
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
We'll have it.

1366
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,320
We'll build it into our Hugin.

1367
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
We'll make it a subdomain on our Hugin site.

1368
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,720
And it's like feeds dot no, no, we're going to try to generate our own feeds here soon.

1369
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,480
And it may be the Castablasta tooling.

1370
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:52,120
I'd say it really represents a set of tooling and Hugin, H-U-G-G-I-N or Hugin, is a free

1371
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,560
software version of if this, then that, that you can host yourself.

1372
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,240
And that's been a really valuable tool for us.

1373
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,360
Yeah, it's a nice way to just accomplish a few, you know, scheduled tasks, check on some

1374
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,920
various things, push things from here to there in a reactive way.

1375
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Yeah.

1376
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,800
When something shows up over here, kick off a process to then do this thing.

1377
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,800
And yeah.

1378
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,800
And it's been really nice.

1379
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,240
And Wes has put a lot of good work into that for us to make it much simpler to publish

1380
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,440
to all of the destinations that we have automagically.

1381
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:23,480
And guys, how would you both rate the stability of Castablasta since it's been kind of put

1382
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,480
up?

1383
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,760
I don't really hear us talking about it that often, actually.

1384
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,760
So how's that been?

1385
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,280
I would say if anything, it's the services around it that we use that frequently have

1386
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,320
issues.

1387
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,380
And then it's like, okay, every time you hit one of those, do you update the tooling to

1388
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,380
handle it?

1389
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,440
Or do you just wait for the service provider to fix it?

1390
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,840
So we run into that kind of stuff.

1391
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Yeah, true.

1392
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,840
Because there's a lot.

1393
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,080
I mean, it's really just pushing bits around from a few places, a little transformations

1394
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,280
with the encoding and such.

1395
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,720
But yeah, it's relying a lot on, like, syncing to various platforms or configuring things

1396
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,640
or making sure database entries get the right way.

1397
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,320
And the longer we go, the more we're like, oh, we should just be doing that.

1398
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
Yeah.

1399
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
We should just be taking that on.

1400
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,320
Because, like, you start fixing all that problems and you really build something great.

1401
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,400
And then all these external services start having issues.

1402
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,880
Or maybe they don't support, like, the podcasting 2.0 stuff or whatever.

1403
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,880
Yeah.

1404
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
So, Clear Linux.

1405
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,200
So we asked, what happened to Clear Linux from Intel?

1406
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,400
You know, they're still out there.

1407
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,920
There was rumors that were sent to us by people at Intel.

1408
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,200
So there were rumors that it was going to shut down completely.

1409
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,220
It seems that they've done, like, a focus shift.

1410
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:32,160
After 2019, they released a desktop installer ISO in 2019.

1411
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,380
And that, I think, piqued a lot of interest.

1412
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,380
After that, though, they kind of quietly moved it more towards what they call a general purpose

1413
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:45,520
distribution that's designed to be used by IT pros, dev ops, application developers,

1414
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,760
cloud computing.

1415
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,120
For example, like, they're targeting Azure and AWS.

1416
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:54,360
And they're kind of creating something that is more built for that whole world now.

1417
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,680
And not so much creating a general purpose Linux distribution anymore.

1418
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,680
Fair enough.

1419
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,200
I could see how Clear Linux kind of does lend itself to that sort of use case.

1420
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,760
Kind of a bummer, though, because it was like somebody out there building a sports card

1421
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,760
Linux.

1422
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Yeah.

1423
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,480
You can't really check out from time to time.

1424
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,480
We'll keep an eye on it, though.

1425
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,480
We'll let you know if anything changes.

1426
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,320
Should have put Clear Linux on the old Thaleo, huh?

1427
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,200
Forged Foe boosts in with 6,400 sets.

1428
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,800
Coming in hot with the boost.

1429
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,100
Answering a question we asked a few episodes ago about what it would take to trust a new

1430
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,520
product from Google.

1431
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,080
And Forged Foe says, I love the threat of it going GPL.

1432
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,960
When Google starts a new project, the repo is verifiably mirrored into a third-party

1433
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,960
escrow.

1434
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,280
Then, as soon as Linux Unplugged reads the news of the project's demise, Chris, Wes,

1435
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,360
and Brent simultaneously turn their keys that activates the decryption process.

1436
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,640
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the triumvirate resurrects the source code from

1437
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,640
the Google graveyard.

1438
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,640
Yeah, right.

1439
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,240
That works for me.

1440
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,360
That is, I think, exactly.

1441
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,960
I would totally be willing to install a key box here on the desk.

1442
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,960
Yeah.

1443
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,960
We could go on over to Brent.

1444
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,620
Get like a little wire guard tunnel, a little pie inside the box, so you turn it, it like

1445
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:13,040
triggers something, and it just sends out a little message.

1446
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,480
I think we could totally do that.

1447
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,920
Does it require all three keys to be turned at the exact same time?

1448
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,280
I mean, I think what we do is we build like a five-second window because of internet lag.

1449
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,960
We are really good at counting to four already.

1450
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,960
Yeah, that's true.

1451
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,960
We could do a four-second.

1452
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,960
We know how we can do that.

1453
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,620
So yeah, I think that's something that you should pitch to Google.

1454
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,440
The threat of GPL would probably keep them on it, actually.

1455
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,920
And they would never let go.

1456
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,760
Vectron boosts in with 4,200 sets.

1457
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,920
I'd be down to contribute to a meetup alternative if you guys start building one.

1458
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,480
Just get the parted starty and I'll join in.

1459
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,560
I am interested in this.

1460
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,960
We heard rumors on the road, right, of a new meetup being built.

1461
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,200
So we'll keep you posted, Vectron, and let you know.

1462
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,360
We would like to create something that the community could use to self-organize their

1463
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,040
own meetups and something we could use to organize our meetups that isn't meetup.com.

1464
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,720
Yeah, exactly.

1465
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:10,200
Sam's Quanch boosting in with 16,180 Satoshis.

1466
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,860
You know, Jerry, I'm not going to tell you that these will increase in value or even

1467
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,280
hold their current value.

1468
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,960
The truth is you bought them because you like them.

1469
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,320
They have value to you.

1470
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,320
That's what matters.

1471
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,320
It's true.

1472
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,240
Just a thank you to the group and to your voice, Chris.

1473
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,080
I've been listening nonstop since Christmas break 2006.

1474
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,080
Whoa.

1475
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,080
Wow.

1476
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:38,280
Been a rabid listener since university, through my career as an engineer and now dev manager.

1477
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,280
Keep killing it.

1478
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,160
You keep killing it, Squanch.

1479
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,160
That's awesome.

1480
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,740
I love knowing that kind of stuff, new or longtime listener.

1481
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,740
But it's been great.

1482
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:50,740
A theme of the Boost this week is a lot of long timers getting on the Boost.

1483
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:57,960
And it's really great to see that as the podcast market is rushing towards dynamically inserted

1484
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,640
ads as an easy way to just monetize podcasting.

1485
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,840
I think this is how you push back on that kind of stuff.

1486
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,960
And so I appreciate the long timers getting it.

1487
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,600
They're getting it.

1488
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,360
Michael B. wrote in with 3,000 sets.

1489
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,360
Make it so.

1490
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,600
My listening habits.

1491
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,520
I'm just listening while driving from one place to the other.

1492
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,120
As I can work from home, that happens not a lot.

1493
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:24,060
Depending on that, I sometimes fall behind three to four Linux unplugged episodes.

1494
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,240
I think it happens.

1495
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,940
I think the way they phrase that, though, it makes it sound like they catch up.

1496
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,760
So I really appreciate you making that effort.

1497
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,760
Yeah, no kidding.

1498
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,460
I like picturing Michael just getting in the car just to listen to an Atlantic's unplugged

1499
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,720
and going for a drive.

1500
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,200
It sounds really nice, actually.

1501
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,380
Yeah, actually kind of does sound nice.

1502
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,380
That's a great idea.

1503
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:44,720
I with the gas prices, I've kind of stopped doing joy rides, but I feel like we should

1504
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,720
bring it back.

1505
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,200
Shouldn't let big oil control my joy rides.

1506
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,680
I mean, there are bicycles or an electric joy or a walk.

1507
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,720
That'd be good, too.

1508
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,720
You have a VR set up.

1509
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Oh, there you go.

1510
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,720
There you go.

1511
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,720
Yeah, thanks.

1512
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:07,360
Now boosted in with two thousand and six sets, two thousand six is the year we got the first

1513
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:13,760
ever Linux World Conference and Expo in San Jose, California, which stood as the first

1514
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,120
trade show style conference the Linux community ever held.

1515
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,400
I remember the citation, according to the Linux Journal.

1516
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,920
As such, it being twenty twenty two currently and very and thankfully far from there, I'm

1517
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,360
still going to Ohio Linux Fest this year and I do plan to record audio for you guys.

1518
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,440
I'm curious if you know a decent recording device not called my phone.

1519
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,200
Oh, now, if you're listening live or close to live, Amazon has a great sale on Zoom audio

1520
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
recorders today.

1521
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,480
I mean, if you're going to treat yourself, there you go.

1522
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,440
You might be surprised if you've got a modern smartphone, you might be surprised.

1523
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,520
New little test recordings.

1524
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,380
I like the voice recorder app on iOS and Android because it shows you real time levels unless

1525
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,160
you save as wave if you set that.

1526
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,200
And sometimes the camera app knows how to utilize the mic array and can also get pretty

1527
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,200
good.

1528
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,200
The video can actually get pretty good audio depending on your phone.

1529
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,520
So you might experiment with that, otherwise for sort of on the scene type recording, you

1530
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,280
know, because like you're not like in a booth studio sound wall, a little ambience and you're

1531
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,120
walking around when you start walking around with a microphone and a recorder, like it

1532
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,120
kind of sets a vibe.

1533
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,120
Right.

1534
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,480
But if you just got a cell phone, like, like we had to get all of our professional recording

1535
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,720
gear out of JPL, which was a Zoom and a and a and a microphone.

1536
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,720
And a bread.

1537
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,720
Yeah.

1538
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,720
And but we could use our cameras.

1539
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,560
Everyone in the group could record as much as we wanted with our cameras on our phone.

1540
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,120
And so it's just it's like people just see it differently.

1541
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,880
And so you might just consider consider trying it or look at the Zoom devices.

1542
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,880
You got any suggestions, Bradley?

1543
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,840
Well, one thing I would say is no matter what you get or try, give it a shot before you

1544
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,480
get to the conference.

1545
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,800
Learn from our mistakes and try your device.

1546
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,800
Try recording some stuff that might be similar.

1547
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,400
You know, go to a place that I don't know, maybe even a restaurant or something.

1548
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:05,060
I mean, don't push people's privacy, but test your equipment first and just see like what

1549
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,560
situations it behaves well in and which situations it kind of falls down.

1550
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,480
Yeah, that is a great suggestion.

1551
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,640
Go to a diner, go to a coffee shop, go somewhere where there's people talking and some background

1552
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,520
noise and see how clear it is.

1553
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,520
Yeah.

1554
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,520
So are you clipping?

1555
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Do you need to turn up your levels?

1556
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,000
What all what all things need to get tweaked?

1557
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,440
We should just say, Neve, thank you.

1558
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,240
Yeah, that is so awesome.

1559
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,240
So thank you very much.

1560
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,240
Even if you don't nail it.

1561
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,640
I mean, we'll keep working with you on that kind of stuff because we really appreciate

1562
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,640
that.

1563
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,840
That's some great value for value right there.

1564
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,880
Mr. Quackers boosted it with a row of ducks.

1565
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,600
That's two thousand two hundred and twenty two sets.

1566
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,600
Quacka Wacka.

1567
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,600
It's a treasure.

1568
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,600
Yippee.

1569
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,040
Huge shout out to Wes for stating something that bothers me about the Linux community

1570
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,040
in general.

1571
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,600
Is that my Snap package rant?

1572
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,600
No.

1573
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,600
I think we are too hard on new projects.

1574
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,640
I've played around with Rust bindings for GTK and even though the devs did a really

1575
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:01,560
great job at it, it still feels like C came first and Rust came second because that's

1576
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,600
exactly what happened.

1577
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,880
Iced sounds great and I'm interested in giving it a shot.

1578
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,160
Yeah, there's been an interesting split here.

1579
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:16,080
We talked last week about System76 going with iced and in that process, a conversation

1580
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,960
around GTK and GNOME and the conversation that typically picks up.

1581
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,160
There's a real split in our feedback.

1582
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:27,920
End users seem down to clown with this and they like the take that, hey, what's the damage

1583
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,920
in letting them try?

1584
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,680
They're a good sized distro to experiment and it's not going to blow anything up if

1585
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,920
things go wrong.

1586
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,600
Maybe something interesting gets built here, but the longtime developers in the community

1587
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:43,500
that have given us feedback feel like this is egregious and everybody should just be

1588
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:48,360
making GNOME better and make these things and work upstream and settle your disagreements

1589
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,640
and there's just been a real interesting like end users seem to be down for it.

1590
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,480
Developers in the community seem to be a little more against it.

1591
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,040
There's a gradient to that too as well.

1592
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,940
It's funny how these technical decisions can get our community so riled up and they're

1593
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,120
just details that you would never even know about on a commercial platform.

1594
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,560
Who knew we all cared so much about toolkits?

1595
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,160
Yeah, people care Wes.

1596
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,920
They care a lot.

1597
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,000
Hey citizen boosted in with 6969 sats.

1598
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Hey citizen.

1599
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,760
Another long timer boosting in this week and he says it's quite simply just le boost.

1600
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,440
And now it is time for le boost.

1601
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,440
Thank you.

1602
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,440
Hey citizen.

1603
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,440
We appreciate it.

1604
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,440
Thank you to user 256.

1605
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,360
They're a first time booster who earned some sats on fountain and sent in 600 sats.

1606
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,680
Now user 256, you got to go set your name in fountain.

1607
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,560
We get 6900 sats from Dean L 70 says love the show.

1608
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,320
There's always something new to listen to and learn.

1609
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,320
Keep up the great work.

1610
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:51,600
Dean L, Danelle Dean 70 hasn't caught on that we just started cycling from the back catalog

1611
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,600
months ago.

1612
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,600
I'm sorry.

1613
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,520
I don't get your name right, but I do appreciate the 6900 sats and I'm glad you're enjoying

1614
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,520
the show.

1615
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,240
Thank you everyone who sends in a boost to the show.

1616
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,240
We read all of them.

1617
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,040
We are selecting some on the show and not putting all of them on the show necessarily

1618
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,880
kind of scanning them for content.

1619
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,460
But every boost does matter to us.

1620
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:12,240
Every boost motivates us and every boost is sent in over a totally decentralized peer

1621
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:17,100
to peer free software payment system that's not tied to any commercial organization.

1622
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,680
And I find that absolutely awesome.

1623
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:24,640
If you want to send a boost to the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

1624
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,640
or you can get breeze if you don't want to switch apps or you can try out Alby.

1625
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,640
I mean, there's so many options.

1626
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,640
What about boost CLI?

1627
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,400
Yeah, there's so many options over there.

1628
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,960
So go check them out at newpodcastapps.com.

1629
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,560
So we made it an executive decision for the picks this week.

1630
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:44,200
We looked at our picks because I thought we would, I mean, we have a roundup of picks.

1631
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,100
It's a pick like brigade, it's a pick buffet.

1632
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,760
It's like when brunch gets made and there's way too much food.

1633
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,720
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know anything about this brunch.

1634
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,440
Something about leftovers?

1635
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,080
I actually think we could make an episode out of our picks.

1636
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,200
So we're going to hold the picks this week.

1637
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,960
No pre-show, no picks, getting crazy around here.

1638
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,920
But instead, what we're going to do is we're going to do something fun that we're going

1639
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,840
to open up to the live stream.

1640
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,000
So we're going to kind of expand the idea and I want to put the invite out there now.

1641
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,600
If you'd like to join us next Sunday over at jupyter.tube at Sunday, noon Pacific, 3

1642
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,720
pm Eastern, we're going to have something that we're going to make publicly available

1643
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,520
for everybody to kind of bang on and produce something out of and see how far we can push

1644
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,880
a system.

1645
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,720
And so I'd like to get that out there now so you can come participate in that.

1646
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,840
You got a little bit of a week's heads up if you're listening.

1647
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,400
One more reason to join us live.

1648
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,400
Yeah, yeah.

1649
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,360
And of course, what stinks is that if you're a couple of weeks behind, you're missing out

1650
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,360
on this.

1651
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,380
We'll try to figure that kind of stuff out too for the future, kind of keep that in mind

1652
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,740
for all you work from homers that do slip behind from time to time.

1653
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:49,240
If you want more show, remember, we actually have an entire additional Linux news podcast

1654
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,480
at linuxactionnews.com where we broke down more of the ArcGPU stuff, some of the deets

1655
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,480
there.

1656
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,440
We're always following stuff at linuxactionnews.com.

1657
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,320
If you're in the industry, it's like one not to miss.

1658
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,120
Just get the background you need to take part in the silly discussions we then have on the

1659
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,120
show.

1660
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,120
That's true.

1661
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,120
There is some additional context you'll pick up on.

1662
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,680
We'd love to have you there.

1663
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:13,400
So linuxactionnews.com for that, jupyter.tube for the live stream, or of course, the last

1664
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:19,900
URL I'm going to throw in your face, linuxunplugged.com, slash, four, eight, zero.

1665
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,660
That's links to what we talked about today.

1666
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:27,480
Our contact form is over there for the emails, I don't know, anything you really want.

1667
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,480
What else do you need?

1668
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:34,000
We have an RSS feed that you can put in what you might call a podcast client and then just

1669
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
get our MP3s that way.

1670
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Could do.

1671
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Could do.

1672
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,720
You can also find us at podcastindex.org.

1673
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,680
Oh, I wasn't going to do any more URLs.

1674
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
Dang it.

1675
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,880
Did you mention PeerTube?

1676
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,400
I was going to try to sneak in jupyterbroadcasting.com because we've got the new website with all

1677
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,880
the other shows, but I didn't want to do any more URLs, so I didn't say that.

1678
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,760
We're switching to QR codes.

1679
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,240
Maybe some sort of audible tone.

1680
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
Anyways, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode.

1681
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,920
See you right back here next Sunday.

1682
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:40,000
We have a link to the Nix team creation stuff I was talking about in the show, if people

1683
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
are curious.

1684
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,760
I got to read through this before I wrap my whole naggersome around it, but it looks like

1685
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:52,100
the community has voted to create a team that will be responsible for ownership of the Nix

1686
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,100
source code.

1687
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,280
The owners will be accountable for deciding on changes, commit sufficient time, and have

1688
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,920
the authority to make them happen.

1689
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,840
This includes, but is not limited to, establish, communicate, and maintain a technical roadmap,

1690
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:10,280
enable contributors, ensure capacity for reviewing PRs and addressing issues, define and assert

1691
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:16,380
quality criteria, keep code healthy, documentation up to date, manage release life cycles, regularly

1692
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:20,400
publish reports on the work that's being done, and engage with third parties on the interest

1693
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,400
of the project.

1694
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,840
And they have some folks that they've already assembled here that they have listed in this

1695
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,840
post.

1696
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,920
Seems like a good thing, you know, a little more professionalization or whatever you might

1697
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,040
call it, but getting a little more serious since I think, you know, Nix is doing well.

1698
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,160
Yeah, it's funny how it seems like all of a sudden it's just, I think it's really the

1699
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,560
container era we live in has really contributed to some of the recognition it's got because

1700
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,780
Nix OS makes a great base for that, or the Nix package manager works really great across

1701
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:49,400
multiple distros and OSs, so that's really handy.

1702
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,880
It's not the Linux unplugged effect.

1703
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,280
Oh, I'm sure that's it.

1704
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,120
But I always get a little bit apprehensive when I hear about structure changes when something's

1705
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,360
been working, but I don't know if we're necessarily exposed to all the inner workings.

1706
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:06,240
Like some stuff has been like a single contributor, and sometimes these changes are for the best,

1707
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:11,280
and it does make it safer for more people to depend on the project, I would say.

1708
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,560
But I always am a little apprehensive.

1709
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,760
It sounds to me like it's almost a maturing of the project in some ways, like putting

1710
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,200
some safeguards in place and just thinking about maybe that bus problem that always comes

1711
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,200
up from time to time.

1712
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:27,320
I suppose it's probably a good idea when you're getting to, you know, a decade old plus, it's

1713
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,760
probably time to start thinking about it.

1714
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,280
And think about how disappointed we'd be if something, you know, something stopped working

1715
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,760
in Nix OS and, you know, didn't have the support structure in place, we wouldn't know what

1716
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,100
was going on.

1717
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:51,680
Even like not renewing their SSL cert, that'd be so embarrassing.
