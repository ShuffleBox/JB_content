WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
Winter may be coming to an end for us, but it's just beginning for the Mars Linux copter

00:05.220 --> 00:07.660
You know that things made 27 flights

00:08.480 --> 00:15.560
Unbelievable, but recently the little Linux copter on Mars has been struggling dust has settled on its solar panels

00:15.560 --> 00:21.640
And it's having a hard time recharging its six lithium-ion batteries. You know I just had this problem Brent

00:21.640 --> 00:23.640
I had to get up on the roof and clean off my solar panels

00:23.680 --> 00:27.240
Are they gonna hire you to clean off the the wings of this little copter too?

00:27.240 --> 00:31.580
Yeah, I don't know what the big deal is just get out there and dust it off. Yeah, just blow it off

00:41.240 --> 00:46.840
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show my name is Chris and my name is Brent

00:47.080 --> 00:50.540
Hello Brent Wes is out on assignment this week

00:50.540 --> 00:54.680
I think he's actually at the airport as we record right now well coming up

00:54.680 --> 00:57.920
We still have a heck of a show Nvidia has done it

00:57.920 --> 01:02.720
They have kicked off the process of open sourcing their compute and GPU driver, so let's chat about that

01:03.000 --> 01:04.640
Let's chat about what you can expect

01:04.640 --> 01:07.320
Let's chat about what's happening first and break it down for you

01:07.320 --> 01:11.960
And then later on in the show one of the co-founders of tail scale is going to join us

01:12.080 --> 01:16.360
Let's see if we can get a sense of maybe what makes tail scale so different by chatting with him

01:16.360 --> 01:21.880
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts some pics and a lot more so before we go any further

01:21.880 --> 01:26.880
Let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug hello. Mumble room

01:29.360 --> 01:31.880
Hello guys, thank you for joining us today. I

01:32.920 --> 01:35.940
Might sound a little different. I am remote on location

01:35.940 --> 01:43.200
I am down in Southern Oregon getting the very last bits of damage from the Denver Road trip fixed on lady tube

01:43.200 --> 01:49.840
She her suspension took a beating on the way into Denver, and there's just one bit of repair needed still before

01:49.840 --> 01:54.240
We're ready for our summer road trip because we are working on another JB road trip

01:54.240 --> 01:56.320
And we'll have details on that soon, so I'm down here

01:57.040 --> 02:02.040
And of course it's right after my star link died on me if you heard last week's episode my star link is out

02:02.040 --> 02:08.060
So I'm doing this an older school way low bandwidth, so if I sound weird that might be why?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.760
But and Brent you're back at home now all done traveling

02:11.760 --> 02:16.320
I am it feels funny that we kind of switch spots you're traveling now, and I'm home so

02:16.320 --> 02:21.120
It feels good for my end. This is funny for me though because I traveled over 400 miles

02:21.120 --> 02:25.560
it was like nearly nine hours of driving yesterday, and I get down to Southern, Oregon and

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
I park and

02:28.360 --> 02:33.960
Everything's where I've left it. It's the weirdest thing. It's like I'm in a different climate because it's much nicer down here

02:34.600 --> 02:37.040
But all my stuff is in the same drawers

02:37.240 --> 02:42.080
It's almost like when you when you close all the windows blinds and stuff. It's like I'm I really never left

02:42.080 --> 02:47.960
I feel like I'm still in Washington, but then I step outside of course. I'm in a totally different different spot

02:47.960 --> 02:50.880
But I love it jubes did great on the drive down

02:50.880 --> 02:55.660
We hit some traffic, but other than other than that she did so good, and you know the cellular system

02:55.660 --> 03:01.680
I have now just so seamlessly switches between different networks that we remain connected the entire drive these days

03:02.280 --> 03:06.960
Which is so awesome, so we're you know streaming podcasts and stuff and listening to him on the way down

03:06.960 --> 03:07.680
We towed the car

03:07.680 --> 03:12.720
And so it's just the wife and I the kids are at home because just a quick trip and I'll be down here for a couple

03:12.720 --> 03:18.320
Of episodes that I'm recording one linux unplugged and one coda radio, and then we'll be heading home

03:18.560 --> 03:20.600
But it's nice. It's nice to be on the road again

03:20.600 --> 03:24.960
It's nice to be getting ready for the road trip that we're gonna do later this summer

03:24.960 --> 03:31.280
So we'll be sharing details on that road trip and office hours if you're curious, but let's let's talk about the big news

03:31.280 --> 03:33.280
Let's just get right into this

03:33.880 --> 03:35.520
because I

03:35.520 --> 03:38.800
Don't know if I ever thought this would happen every now

03:38.800 --> 03:44.000
And then there have been these just ginormous Everest sized mountains

03:45.000 --> 03:47.640
for the linux desktop that we had to climb and

03:48.360 --> 03:52.640
Once we're on the other side looks like life has changed for linux users forever

03:53.040 --> 03:56.300
This was definitely the case with Wi-Fi a long time ago

03:56.920 --> 04:02.000
Automatic X configuration, I think maybe could even get this treatment. There's been certain milestones

04:02.000 --> 04:09.540
milestones that we have hit that have just changed life for all future linux users where us old-timers look back and go

04:11.000 --> 04:13.920
If you only knew what we had to do back in my day

04:14.640 --> 04:16.480
This is one of those weeks

04:16.480 --> 04:23.000
Nvidia has announced that they are releasing the GPU kernel modules as open source

04:23.440 --> 04:29.120
It's starting with compute with so a focus on CUDA and that kind of stuff with an eventual

04:29.120 --> 04:34.400
Solution for desktop graphics as well, and I think there's already some example code on their github

04:34.840 --> 04:38.360
this is going to change the game for distributing the Nvidia driver on

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Linux and

04:39.800 --> 04:44.840
We have a couple of really great links in the show notes for you to read up if you're curious about the details and then

04:44.840 --> 04:52.760
also, I want to mention that Christian Schaller joined us for Linux action news 240 and we dedicated the entire episode to our

04:52.920 --> 04:55.200
conversation with him to get some of the details and

04:55.200 --> 05:00.680
Christian is here now as well live in our mumble room Christian. Welcome back to the show. Thank you

05:00.680 --> 05:01.880
Thanks a lot for having me

05:01.880 --> 05:02.920
this

05:02.920 --> 05:09.520
Must have been the hardest secret to keep there must have been a point where you realized this was really going to happen and that

05:09.520 --> 05:10.880
Must have been thrilling

05:10.880 --> 05:16.840
Yeah, no for sure. It's it's one of those things where I you know, even it was even top secret inside Red Hat

05:16.840 --> 05:21.320
So I mean I had even conversations with all the Red Hatters. They're like you're saying oh we realize you can do something

05:21.320 --> 05:23.320
Yeah, that would be nice

05:23.320 --> 05:28.640
Because I couldn't confirm or this what you call it not affirm it until it was public

05:28.640 --> 05:31.640
So yeah, definitely a hard secret to keep for a long time

05:31.640 --> 05:36.680
I bet I I mean it wasn't too long ago that Matthew Miller was on Twitter saying, you know

05:36.680 --> 05:40.600
This is something we've really got to address as a community getting the sense

05:40.600 --> 05:43.440
Yeah, a lot of people didn't know it was coming in in part

05:43.440 --> 05:49.120
I have to imagine this is something that they have to manage carefully because it is as a company

05:49.120 --> 05:55.920
It's kind of an indefinite commitment to now supporting something on an engineering level, isn't it? Yeah. No, I mentioned Matthews

05:57.120 --> 06:03.200
Twitter thing. Yeah, we ended up reading me into the news after that think like yeah, maybe you need to let Matthew know

06:03.200 --> 06:06.720
So he knows that maybe this isn't exactly the best time to stir the boat

06:08.600 --> 06:14.440
That's fair enough probably a good idea I suppose so I'm curious I know I got I got a couple of questions for you

06:14.440 --> 06:19.760
Since we chatted I suppose as you'd expect there has been some skepticism around the announcement

06:20.200 --> 06:22.200
But I think probably the most prominent

06:22.960 --> 06:27.960
Skepticism has been around this sort of line of thinking. Well sure they released the stuff

06:27.960 --> 06:30.000
That's gonna touch the kernel is open source

06:30.000 --> 06:35.600
But they just moved all this stuff to the firmware and now there's a 34 megabyte firmware blob required

06:36.160 --> 06:38.280
And I've heard this from a couple of different people

06:38.480 --> 06:41.400
I'm curious to know what your take is on that not like, you know

06:41.400 --> 06:45.720
What the official position is but just your opinion on on this method of driver development

06:46.680 --> 06:52.800
Okay, so from a purely sort of ideal stand, but I would love for everything to be open including firmware that that said

06:52.800 --> 06:53.360
I mean

06:53.360 --> 06:57.400
I I guess the one reason felt it was little unfair when people started going off that was that

06:57.760 --> 07:02.880
Everyone is doing this model of having a binary firmware and then you know the driver being

07:04.240 --> 07:11.040
Mostly sort of connecting that up. So I mean it's it's yes, it's a little unfortunate, but it's it's what everyone does

07:11.040 --> 07:13.480
So this is not I don't feel it's right to single out in media

07:13.480 --> 07:16.120
Then you have to basically go after more or less every vendor out there

07:16.120 --> 07:22.040
I mean the Linux firmware file is you know growing for every release due to more and more people putting more more functionality into the firmware

07:22.040 --> 07:26.480
So that's that's just the way it is. And it's sort of something we as a community has accepted it gets for a long time

07:26.480 --> 07:29.960
No, yeah, a lot of vendors are doing it this way

07:29.960 --> 07:32.880
and I think the only thing that's a little unfair about the criticism is

07:33.640 --> 07:39.120
The file size is being used as like like a negative, you know, 34 megabytes of firmware

07:39.120 --> 07:41.660
But if you actually look at the firmware

07:41.880 --> 07:47.000
There are just a ton of architectures that that 34 megabytes supports

07:47.000 --> 07:53.080
In fact Longhorn on Twitter did just that he says the 30 megabytes supports multiple GPU

07:53.280 --> 07:57.000
generations as well as a bunch of other ELF sections and

07:57.320 --> 08:03.200
things specifically for ampere and Turing and all kinds of little bits in there that aren't necessarily like

08:03.680 --> 08:06.920
Control mechanisms and stuff like that. So you can't really derive

08:06.920 --> 08:10.880
Anything from that 34 megabyte file size. That's that's a bit of a red herring

08:11.760 --> 08:12.720
additionally

08:12.720 --> 08:16.240
It seems to me that that means the problem solved on the Linux side

08:16.240 --> 08:22.340
So now as a consumer, this is just a different set of pros and cons that you have to weigh

08:22.880 --> 08:29.020
But it's clearly a benefit because it's gonna make it easier for manufacturers like system 76. They're shipping Nvidia hardware

08:29.020 --> 08:32.260
It's gonna make it easier for folks that have existing Nvidia hardware

08:32.260 --> 08:38.180
But it's also going to be a benefit for the Nuvoo driver too, which I think is sort of been missed in all of this

08:38.180 --> 08:44.020
And I don't can you share any details there Christian about what what's kind of maybe the next steps for the Nuvoo driver?

08:44.220 --> 08:46.220
Yeah, I mean it opens up

08:46.980 --> 08:52.860
opportunities for us right to so as I mentioned in my blog and this is that so historically what happened was that

08:53.420 --> 08:58.260
When then we just switched to sign firmware. It basically meant that the wall couldn't use that firmware

08:58.260 --> 09:02.600
So so we had we reached out and you know Nvidia was kind enough to work with us to say, okay

09:02.600 --> 09:08.520
Let's let's make a firmware that make let's know what keep working that of course end up being a big effort for it for Nvidia

09:08.520 --> 09:12.640
Because they had maintained an extra firmware and it took time to get features in

09:12.640 --> 09:16.700
I mean one big feature people kept of course missing was the ability to reclock the GPU

09:17.600 --> 09:23.840
Because Nvidia GPUs and I assume others by default the fault is sort of like almost like a power saving level of GPU

09:23.840 --> 09:28.200
So so if you are less stuck in that, you know, don't get a lot of performance out of your GPU. So

09:29.040 --> 09:34.320
So they were in talks with them what like how do we fix this and then you know when this thing became a thing

09:34.320 --> 09:36.820
We said like, okay, maybe the solution is that we can then you know

09:37.560 --> 09:42.240
Tie things together with your new release and then we have a shared firmware between you know

09:42.240 --> 09:46.480
Then we just back in MSS stack, right? That is exciting. That seems like massively

09:47.040 --> 09:51.400
Simplification of engineering efforts and just way easier to maintain long-term. Yeah, exactly

09:51.400 --> 09:57.480
Exactly Casey points out in in the IRC to that, you know for 30 for a 34 megabyte firmware

09:57.480 --> 10:00.160
You get a massively parallel computer with 12 gigs of RAM

10:00.960 --> 10:04.680
Anyways continue Christian. I know you had another point there. Yeah, I was just gonna save it firmer

10:04.680 --> 10:06.600
I think also I sort of

10:06.600 --> 10:09.600
Came to terms it firmer in general when we launched LVFS

10:09.600 --> 10:13.380
I felt that after that I couldn't really go out there and you know scream murder every time I saw

10:13.480 --> 10:19.560
Former firmware out there being available close source. I bet being involved with LVFS does give you a pretty good perspective on that

10:19.560 --> 10:24.480
I feel like this is one of those stories that after we were done recording LAN

10:24.480 --> 10:28.120
I just wanted to take the rest of the week off like I was so excited

10:28.320 --> 10:32.800
It's like what else could happen in Linux that would even matter this week. It's such a big deal

10:32.940 --> 10:34.940
But now really in a in a weird way

10:36.040 --> 10:38.600
Now a lot of the hard work starts, right?

10:38.600 --> 10:43.240
Like I look at the github and I see all these issues that are being opened up by the community and people that are jumping

10:43.240 --> 10:47.660
In and right now we're really just looking at a solution for compute as well

10:47.660 --> 10:53.080
And so we should probably set our expectations. I mean, maybe it's not even unreasonable to

10:54.200 --> 10:58.520
Expect maybe summer of next year before there's something people are gonna want to install on their machine

10:58.760 --> 11:00.600
What do you think you think that's reasonable?

11:00.600 --> 11:04.880
Well, I mean I think if you really want something to just run compute like, you know

11:04.880 --> 11:07.080
We need the I want the driver and you want to sign it

11:07.680 --> 11:13.680
Yourself for the time being to run on let's say your blade machines to use you for compute and you're definitely ready to use it

11:13.680 --> 11:18.320
But you you need to wait until the graphics comes in for one before able to run to the desktop

11:18.320 --> 11:22.920
and of course at the same time we in the distro world are of course making figuring out how we got to deal with signing and

11:22.920 --> 11:27.160
Packaging this thing and you know, it's not an upstream drive yet. That's another thing people need to remember

11:27.160 --> 11:29.680
I did still an auto tree driver. So that has you know

11:30.200 --> 11:31.720
Like any other tree driver

11:31.720 --> 11:35.480
It's only set of challenges for us in the distro world to deal with but you know

11:35.480 --> 11:40.280
I think the pieces will fall in place and and it will make make things easier as we had

11:40.280 --> 11:43.560
Going forward. Well, this was you know

11:44.000 --> 11:50.820
Really the result of years of investment in a relationship and those details and more are in Linux action news 240

11:50.960 --> 11:58.560
Where Christian covers all of that, but I think this is a obvious win. I know some people are very skeptical but to me

11:59.400 --> 12:05.140
This means that people can now buy laptops or desktops within video hardware and you know within a year's time

12:05.680 --> 12:09.180
It's gonna work out of a out of the box like your AMD or Intel graphics does

12:09.180 --> 12:15.140
That's just indisputably a win if that means some some of the functions are in a blob. Yeah, it's maybe it's not ideal

12:15.260 --> 12:17.260
But it seems to be the compromise

12:17.340 --> 12:23.840
We have decided to live with and it does mean we deliver on the best end-user experience that we can right now

12:23.860 --> 12:25.860
and it is such a

12:26.140 --> 12:29.820
Tectonic shift from where we were a week ago

12:31.100 --> 12:36.740
That I think people just haven't really even processed what this means so extremely excited and Christian

12:36.740 --> 12:41.940
Thank you for giving us the scoop on all of that and so we can help people understand what's going on and set their

12:41.980 --> 12:46.140
Expectations accordingly and again, I will link to your blog post in the show notes

12:46.140 --> 12:49.980
Which I think everyone should give a read over as well because you put a lot of great info in there

12:50.220 --> 12:53.860
Thanks for joining us again. Yeah, my pleasure and just maybe one last item

12:53.860 --> 12:58.980
I mean I would ask everyone to try to be patient with Nvidia here too because you mean this is a big change for them

12:58.980 --> 13:02.060
Too right and they have to come up with how they deal with the community around the driver

13:02.060 --> 13:07.140
And I mean and we'd have done open source before and various things. It's not like they're completely new to it

13:07.140 --> 13:11.060
But this is like, you know the heart of the hardware, which is not the heart of their business

13:11.060 --> 13:14.700
So, you know if things doesn't all go super smooth from day one

13:14.700 --> 13:17.260
You know give them have some patience and I'm trying to work with them

13:17.260 --> 13:22.820
I say, you know iron out their own interaction with the community that will spring out and spring up around the driver

13:22.820 --> 13:29.660
Linode.com slash unplug go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and it's a great way to support the show

13:30.420 --> 13:37.540
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years and their mission has remained unchanged since that begun make cloud computing simple

13:38.060 --> 13:44.900
Affordable and accessible to everyone. It's led to the best-in-class experience, and it's why we host everything on Linode

13:44.900 --> 13:49.300
We look at the options. I hear from some of you sometimes tell me about some great bargain-based

13:49.300 --> 13:54.660
deal you got and then usually about six months to a year later. I hear about why you switched to Linode

13:55.860 --> 13:57.860
So take advantage of the hundred dollars

13:58.460 --> 14:04.100
It's just a great way to go try something and Linode has a lot of one-click deployment applications as well

14:04.460 --> 14:10.540
Some of the apps that we've talked about here on the show one-click to get going zoom replacements. Yeah, they got Jitsi up there

14:10.540 --> 14:14.860
You want to try GitLab? Yeah, they got that fact some of the services. I'm gonna deploy soon for

14:14.860 --> 14:19.180
Some back-end stuff that I'll probably talk about in the future. I'm just gonna use one of their one-click deployments

14:19.180 --> 14:23.340
They've also got a great one for WordPress and they're always adding new ones like just constantly

14:23.580 --> 14:26.980
So I check in there from time to time and I'll just deploy a project and try it out

14:26.980 --> 14:29.340
And it's a great way to try out that hundred dollars, too

14:29.340 --> 14:33.780
So from development tools to game servers to the back-end infrastructure for your business

14:33.780 --> 14:38.940
So I'm talking like scaling from a personal project to something for millions of users

14:39.940 --> 14:44.020
Linode is a great way to go try something and Linode is a great way to go try something

14:44.020 --> 14:50.460
Linode has you covered and then they back it by the best support in the business and they've got a bunch of nice features like

14:50.460 --> 14:54.340
s3 compatible object storage cloud firewalls DDoS protection a

14:54.860 --> 15:00.500
Powerful DNS manager and of course your info management to kubernetes terraform ansible

15:00.500 --> 15:05.620
They've got support for all of that with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than those duopoly

15:06.100 --> 15:09.220
Hyperscalers that want to lock into their crazy esoteric platform

15:09.220 --> 15:15.060
Go use the real internet and go build a system either from the ground up or with one-click deployment

15:15.460 --> 15:22.500
Linode makes it easy and their community support runs deep go get $100 support the show and try something out Linode calm

15:23.460 --> 15:25.460
unplugged

15:28.060 --> 15:31.740
Tail scale is a mesh VPN powered by wire guard

15:31.740 --> 15:37.420
We've talked about it on the show before and I should disclose they are a sponsor on coda radio and self-hosted

15:37.420 --> 15:43.420
They don't sponsor this show but you can go to tail scale comm slash coder or tail scale comm slash self-hosted if you want to

15:43.420 --> 15:49.340
Sign up and it's a tool that we all use as a team and there's a lot of great tools out there

15:49.340 --> 15:54.540
We've mentioned nebula in the past. We've also talked about s shuttle or shuttle in the past

15:54.540 --> 15:59.500
We've covered all kinds of mesh VPN solutions like tink and others. It's always a problem

15:59.500 --> 16:02.980
We've been trying to solve but tail scale really has seemed to solve it the best for us

16:02.980 --> 16:09.180
And I have an opportunity to sit down with Avery pen around who is one of the co-founders of tail scale

16:09.260 --> 16:15.680
He spent the previous eight years at Google where he launched some of their first p2p payment systems for Google wallet

16:15.680 --> 16:20.460
He was involved with Google fiber and working out the Google fiber mesh Wi-Fi strategy

16:20.700 --> 16:23.820
He's been involved in other high-profile alphabet projects

16:23.820 --> 16:29.380
so it was just a great chance doing these podcasts sometimes just gives me a chance to talk to people I normally would not get to

16:29.380 --> 16:36.500
Talk to and I wanted to get kind of an insight into tail scale because it just almost seemed too good to be true

16:36.500 --> 16:40.620
And I was hoping maybe to get some insights and I walked away from this conversation

16:41.180 --> 16:43.780
With some of those I think so I wanted to share it with you

16:44.180 --> 16:51.300
Avery sat down with me just recently and we were chatting just before we got started about some of his previous projects that I was

16:51.300 --> 16:53.300
familiar with I

16:53.540 --> 16:56.100
have been looking to solve my

16:56.100 --> 17:02.380
Desperate network problems for years and I've been rolling my own crazy solutions

17:02.380 --> 17:05.060
I had tried a few different things with wire guard

17:05.060 --> 17:07.060
but I actually started with shuttle and

17:07.260 --> 17:13.940
We talked about it a long time ago on the show and I believe you were the original creator of shuttle VPN, correct that I was

17:14.660 --> 17:18.820
2009 I think so you've been thinking about VPN stuff for a while

17:18.820 --> 17:24.860
I take it was wire guard like the missing piece for you wire guard was definitely a missing piece

17:24.860 --> 17:29.420
I've actually been thinking about VPNs all the way back to 1997 when I wrote my first one

17:29.780 --> 17:34.940
for my the first startup that me and my roommate started in our dorm room in university and

17:35.540 --> 17:41.020
That particular one made some you know major structural mistakes that you should not make when designing a VPN

17:41.020 --> 17:43.900
We we we didn't exactly roll our own crypto

17:43.900 --> 17:47.180
But we took the crypto primitives and we put them together in ways you probably shouldn't do

17:47.180 --> 17:51.740
I learned a few lessons from that we did TCP over TCP which you should not do in a VPN

17:51.740 --> 17:56.220
But it was it was educational and in fact this this carried our product forward

17:56.220 --> 18:01.660
We had a company we it was the thing that actually launched us this VPN because it was on a network appliance server

18:01.660 --> 18:05.820
You could install in small businesses. It was quite easy to configure compared to other VPNs at the time

18:05.820 --> 18:09.940
But it had these other flaws, you know fast forward to the shuttle days. I'm like, okay

18:09.940 --> 18:10.900
I learned a lot of lessons

18:10.900 --> 18:15.740
I know what a few things not to do and I'm a little frustrated that you know

18:15.740 --> 18:19.620
Our product got acquired by IBM IBM sort of dismantled it and killed it

18:19.620 --> 18:26.460
No more VPN that I liked alternatives are like PBDP and IPSec which are pretty terrible or open VPN

18:27.460 --> 18:33.020
So shuttle the motivation was like I don't want to do the encryption myself and I don't want to do TCP over TCP

18:33.540 --> 18:37.620
So SSH has good encryption. Let me just like piggyback on top of SSH

18:38.100 --> 18:40.780
You know rather than sending the packets over SSH

18:40.780 --> 18:47.100
I'm going to disassemble the TCP sessions and then reassemble them on the other side which bypasses this TCP over TCP problem

18:47.100 --> 18:49.820
That actually worked quite well. It was an open source project

18:49.820 --> 18:52.580
I didn't try to commercialize it, but I used it for all kinds of things

18:52.580 --> 18:57.340
It helped you know any any server that supports SSH can be your VPN server, which is quite handy

18:57.340 --> 19:02.700
The performance wasn't the greatest but it was perfectly good for like transferring some files around and doing some remote terminals

19:03.020 --> 19:05.580
With tail scale when when WireGuard showed up

19:05.580 --> 19:09.220
I was really excited because it is like look I don't have to do my own encryption

19:09.380 --> 19:14.020
But I can understand the encryption that these people are doing which means I can take this like a simple

19:14.020 --> 19:19.500
Primitive for encryption and plug it into a bigger picture of the way I want the world to work

19:19.900 --> 19:25.660
Right a really simple VPN that I control everything about the way the experience happens

19:25.660 --> 19:31.700
But I'm not sacrificing security. It is deceptively simple on the front end as a customer experience

19:31.940 --> 19:37.600
It's a very simple application to install. It's very simple to authenticate. It uses my existing single sign-on provider

19:37.820 --> 19:39.820
It really couldn't be smoother

19:39.820 --> 19:46.180
And so I'm not surprised to hear that you've been thinking about this since 97 because when I first tried tail scale

19:46.180 --> 19:52.320
I thought they must be pulling some real magic off on the back end to make this feel so simple

19:52.420 --> 19:56.300
So what are some of the more complicated things that are being solved on the back end to make it?

19:56.380 --> 19:59.340
Just such a seamless thing for me to have a flat network of all my devices

19:59.580 --> 20:03.940
There's quite a bit of magic in there. The first step is just this key management

20:03.940 --> 20:10.580
So in shuttle we got out of key management by just saying like look it's your job to do SSH key management

20:10.580 --> 20:11.860
You already know how to do that

20:11.860 --> 20:14.860
We'll just piggyback on top of that which is great except that in fact

20:15.180 --> 20:19.980
Many people do not know how to do SSH key management. And so there's a bit of a limited market

20:19.980 --> 20:23.220
It's only people who can figure out how to manage their SSH keys effectively

20:23.220 --> 20:27.260
Which at least is most developers if you wanted to deploy that company-wide for example

20:27.460 --> 20:33.060
most of the people in your company are not developers and so they don't know how to set up SSH keys and so shuttle was

20:33.060 --> 20:38.740
Never a you know a useful product for the general community even if even if pushed by an IT team

20:38.860 --> 20:45.140
So tail skills key management instead of using SSH keys, we used what is now, you know, 12 years later

20:45.780 --> 20:47.780
13 years later

20:48.100 --> 20:55.140
Keep losing count 13 years later really common which is the single sign-on system that people are using on web apps, right?

20:55.140 --> 20:58.500
The click click here to logging with Google click here to signing with github

20:58.500 --> 21:03.980
This stuff in the intervening years has become like the standard thing to do. Everything is turned into a web app

21:03.980 --> 21:06.860
All the web apps have a button for like login with Google

21:06.900 --> 21:12.820
So we make tail scale look like a web app for the purposes of authentication, right?

21:12.820 --> 21:14.100
You load up the tail scale app

21:14.100 --> 21:19.140
Which is a native app on your phone or your PC or your Linux machine and it gives you a URL which sends you

21:19.140 --> 21:23.620
To a web browser which then acts like a SAS app which can use your single sign-on

21:23.620 --> 21:30.260
So that's that's the first trick we piggyback again on somebody else's authentication just like shuttle did but this time we're piggyback on

21:30.580 --> 21:32.580
authentication that everybody knows how to use

21:32.660 --> 21:36.140
The second thing we did is what we call NAT traversal

21:36.420 --> 21:41.060
So this is especially magical other VPNs I've built myself and have used

21:41.580 --> 21:46.660
Require one end of the VPN connection to be on a public facing open firewall port

21:46.940 --> 21:50.660
Which is not that shocking the whole internet kind of runs on this principle

21:50.660 --> 21:55.300
The client can be behind a NAT or a firewall, but the server has to be outside waiting for your connection

21:55.300 --> 21:57.300
Otherwise, how is it going to work? The problem is

21:58.180 --> 22:02.500
People setting up a VPN or trying to make a connection between two devices

22:03.060 --> 22:08.980
This is really limiting to what kind of connections you can make it essentially turns the whole internet into the centralized system

22:08.980 --> 22:11.620
Where nowadays the only people that get a public IP address

22:12.260 --> 22:16.340
Are cloud providers and then you have to rent one from a cloud provider and now everything is like

22:16.340 --> 22:20.500
The hub is the cloud provider and the spokes are everybody else, right?

22:20.500 --> 22:24.020
You're paying rent to these cloud providers to do anything you want to do on the internet

22:24.260 --> 22:28.820
So tail scale the magic involves like you could literally have you in a cafe

22:29.140 --> 22:32.660
With your laptop and your co-worker in a cafe with their laptop

22:33.140 --> 22:37.860
They log into tail scale on the same domain. Those two devices will find each other

22:38.420 --> 22:42.900
They will not go through an intermediate server. They'll actually make a direct peer-to-peer connection

22:42.900 --> 22:48.020
Between those two devices and now they're connected you can go to a service that your co-worker is running on their laptop and try

22:48.020 --> 22:51.380
Out that web service or you can ssh into their device or do file sharing or whatever

22:51.380 --> 22:54.500
Well, this is sort of what i've discovered using tail scale is that

22:55.220 --> 23:01.780
It is essentially allowing me to create my own decentralized internet and it's kind of a sneaky way to do it

23:01.780 --> 23:07.700
It's not really like tail scale selling itself as build your own decentralized internet, but that's kind of the end result, isn't it?

23:07.700 --> 23:13.380
Well, I mean the word the word decentralized has become a bit dirty now because every time someone says decentralized they assume

23:13.380 --> 23:18.180
We're talking about blockchains and bitcoins and stuff. Sure. Yeah. Yeah or any kind of weird crypto

23:18.420 --> 23:20.660
Yeah, and that's that's not what tail scale does

23:20.980 --> 23:26.740
The way I like to think of it is like look we actually did decentralization in a way that's actually decentralized

23:27.220 --> 23:32.580
Therefore like achieves engineering goals, right? We're not we're not doing decentralizations for like religious reasons

23:32.820 --> 23:36.020
We're doing decentralization because it's the most efficient way to solve your problem

23:36.020 --> 23:38.340
Well, and it really is about connecting my devices, isn't it?

23:38.340 --> 23:44.020
That's the issue is I don't have a great way to connect all of these disparate devices double nat different cloud providers vps

23:44.020 --> 23:47.620
Some of them are locked behind vms or containers it flattens all of that

23:48.020 --> 23:53.140
So the neat thing about tail scale is that it's sort of what I call a hybrid centralized decentralized system

23:53.380 --> 23:59.620
The control plane the part that decides which devices can talk to which other devices the part that sends your public keys around

23:59.620 --> 24:03.860
In the same way that you would send a public key to an ssh server and put it in your authorized keys file

24:03.860 --> 24:07.380
That part is centralized you go to the tail scale sass product

24:07.620 --> 24:12.820
We run a little tiny thing that we call the control server that is basically just a collector for public keys

24:12.820 --> 24:19.060
But also connects to your identity system, right? That is where everybody else goes to rendezvous

24:19.220 --> 24:24.020
So me with my laptop in this cafe you with your laptop in the other cafe both of our laptops

24:24.260 --> 24:26.260
Contact the control server and say like hey

24:26.980 --> 24:30.180
Where are my friends? Right and you find out the ip address in the public key

24:30.180 --> 24:34.260
Go back to that and then those two laptops do the data plane

24:34.820 --> 24:39.460
Actually sending packets back and forth initiating connections with each other in a purely decentralized way

24:39.940 --> 24:46.820
This ends up being a really elegant algorithm because it's extremely inexpensive to run a centralized control plane where they only use it occasionally

24:46.820 --> 24:48.820
And there's no latency sensitivity

24:48.820 --> 24:54.980
But it's extremely inexpensive to run a data plane where we don't have to transfer any of the bytes for you

24:55.060 --> 24:59.940
Right keeps the infrastructure cost down. In fact, you have to pay a lot of money to run a centralized control plane

24:59.940 --> 25:05.300
You had a blog post that I really liked. It's titled how our free plans stay free and you write in there

25:05.780 --> 25:10.660
All this is to say our costs are carefully managed like other sas companies. We don't build physical infrastructure

25:10.660 --> 25:14.580
We avoid touching your packets for privacy, but also to reduce our costs

25:14.900 --> 25:19.140
We fix bugs and docs instead of answering the same questions over and over again

25:19.460 --> 25:24.020
Our control plane is lightweight and our dep network is cost controlled

25:24.020 --> 25:31.480
This allows us to maintain a healthy operating margin so that a free tier isn't competing for resources with our paying customers

25:32.020 --> 25:37.860
And I think there's a lot of insights just in that paragraph right there that I felt like I got about the company

25:37.860 --> 25:39.860
And about you, I mean first of all

25:40.260 --> 25:43.300
It's very clearly plainly written. It's very easy to understand

25:43.460 --> 25:47.140
You don't really mince any words there and it makes a lot of sense as a customer

25:47.620 --> 25:52.100
My first concern was well, is this thing going to stick around and is that a problem that you have discovered?

25:52.100 --> 25:56.980
Are customers worried that this thing is too good to actually stick around that happens pretty often

25:57.060 --> 26:01.620
One of the most common bits of feedback we get is like, please please don't cancel the free plan

26:02.020 --> 26:05.000
Please please don't get acquired by you know list of competitors

26:05.540 --> 26:09.460
Please don't add any more features to the product because I like it just the way it is

26:09.540 --> 26:12.020
And I know what happens when companies add features to their products

26:12.420 --> 26:17.460
I feel like the whole industry at this point has kind of been scarred by a bunch of software companies that have been

26:17.940 --> 26:19.940
I guess kind of selfish they care more about

26:19.940 --> 26:22.260
Their business model than they care about their users

26:22.260 --> 26:24.740
It feels like the VC model in particular is tricky

26:24.740 --> 26:28.020
And so I wonder if we could speak to that for a moment because also a congratulations

26:28.020 --> 26:33.220
I know you recently raised a Series B round of funding and it looks like you have a blog post that addresses that as well

26:33.220 --> 26:39.860
And in here, you know, you kind of address that issue is like some people are concerned after they hear about some series funding

26:39.860 --> 26:43.540
That there's going to be a whole bunch of feature creep that all of a sudden it becomes this giant platform that

26:43.860 --> 26:47.060
Like a chat system has to be built on top of what are your thoughts around that?

26:47.060 --> 26:53.460
The biggest concern that people and even me when I see announcements like this have is

26:54.180 --> 26:58.100
If you had to raise money, does that mean you were going to go to business if you hadn't raised money?

26:58.900 --> 27:02.180
Because if that's the case then you're on what we call the VC treadmill

27:02.980 --> 27:04.180
where

27:04.180 --> 27:09.620
You have to keep running faster and faster just to not fly off the treadmill and smack into the back wall

27:10.420 --> 27:16.260
Most startups find themselves in that situation and when that happens the desperation level rises and rises

27:16.260 --> 27:22.980
And so you'll see a product that starts off really good, but they didn't quite find their footing couldn't figure out quite the right business model

27:23.540 --> 27:28.180
Didn't make quite enough money to pay their expenses and they had this tough decision. Am I going to lay people off?

27:29.140 --> 27:31.300
Or am I going to raise more money and keep trying?

27:32.020 --> 27:36.420
And most of the time the companies go and try to raise more money and keep trying but that you know

27:36.420 --> 27:38.820
They keep trying and it may not ever find their way, right?

27:38.820 --> 27:42.580
That's where you get these more and more desperate weird things where like I'm going to add a chat system

27:42.580 --> 27:49.700
Or a chat bot to my unrelated product. Tailscale is a little different and I tried to get that across in this blog post

27:49.700 --> 27:54.100
So we announced a Series B funding of a hundred million dollars, right? Which is pretty big for a Series B

27:54.580 --> 27:56.580
We're not raising that money

27:56.900 --> 28:00.900
Just to stay in business. We actually had a bunch of money still left over from our Series A

28:01.140 --> 28:03.800
We were on track to be profitable by the end of 2022

28:04.420 --> 28:08.580
Kind of inefficiently because in fact, it's it's all you know, if you're going to raise this much money

28:08.580 --> 28:11.060
You should actually spend it. Otherwise, you've kind of wasted your equity

28:11.060 --> 28:15.860
Selling it to investors. So we we intend to spend a hundred million dollars, but we want to do this in a way

28:16.340 --> 28:23.140
That we never end up at that desperation level. Like we want to be the ones in control. We're tracking our spending rate

28:23.940 --> 28:26.980
Related to our revenues and because we've got extra money

28:26.980 --> 28:31.060
We're trying to sort of clear out this buffer of extra money by spending a little faster than our revenues

28:31.060 --> 28:37.060
But the revenues we look carefully at how fast we're growing so we could become profitable at any time we want

28:37.060 --> 28:43.140
And that's a really important attribute to maintain in a company where you don't want to end up with this level of desperation

28:43.140 --> 28:47.460
So we believe we can do it. I mean, you know, there's famous last words. We could always make mistakes

28:47.940 --> 28:51.060
But we really really put a high premium on

28:51.620 --> 28:57.220
Not screwing this stuff up because all three co-founders we're we're getting a little older now. We're into our 40s

28:57.460 --> 29:01.140
We've seen this before we don't need to make a million dollars tomorrow

29:01.140 --> 29:07.780
We don't need to make a million dollars tomorrow, but we are really tired of spending five or seven years building something

29:07.940 --> 29:12.740
And then it fails and gets canceled out from underneath us or acquired and then somebody, you know tears it apart

29:13.060 --> 29:15.620
Right. I don't want that to be my legacy as a person

29:16.500 --> 29:20.740
When I retire is every project I've ever done has been ripped out from under me and torn apart

29:21.300 --> 29:26.340
I've noticed what seems to be a consistent long-term thinking in a lot of this and a lot of what you communicate

29:26.660 --> 29:29.860
You're currently thinking about like what we're doing today, but you're also thinking about

29:29.860 --> 29:35.700
Where things are going long term and I wonder if is there something particular in your past experience that has

29:36.020 --> 29:40.420
Has really drilled this into we have to be careful when it comes to vc funding and we have to think in a certain way

29:40.420 --> 29:44.260
Is there something that you went through an experience you went through that really codified that?

29:44.420 --> 29:47.460
I mean my first startup of course was was in this category

29:47.460 --> 29:54.020
We absolutely got ourselves into this trouble where we built some really cool technology including that vpn. I mentioned the pre-shuttle one

29:54.420 --> 29:58.420
It also had a bunch of other stuff. We found the traction users were getting excited

29:58.420 --> 30:01.540
We never quite figured out our go-to-market model

30:01.700 --> 30:07.220
So we could sell the product but the expense of having salespeople calling people

30:07.780 --> 30:09.780
To try to find the ones who were willing to buy it

30:10.900 --> 30:13.620
Was always a little bit higher than the actual revenue we got

30:14.260 --> 30:18.020
From selling the product, right? And this is in the pre-software as a service days

30:18.020 --> 30:22.180
So it was kind of weird back then you would you would sell something once and not a monthly subscription

30:22.420 --> 30:26.740
And that you know the whole mathematical model of that is very different from the monthly sales, right?

30:26.740 --> 30:32.580
So if you have a sales team today each salesperson say can add 50k of arr per month, right?

30:32.580 --> 30:37.540
Then that's great. You you just have this one salesperson and they keep going and the arr keeps going up

30:37.940 --> 30:40.980
And of course, you're going to have churn and so on so sooner or later it maxes out

30:41.300 --> 30:45.460
But you have this really nice model when you have people selling one shot each time

30:45.780 --> 30:49.380
Then your revenue doesn't keep going up over time, right?

30:49.380 --> 30:54.580
The salesperson that you have selling a certain amount per month means you get that much revenue per month

30:54.580 --> 30:58.500
Not that much additional revenue per month. So the models are very different

30:58.500 --> 31:01.540
But back then, you know, we were selling appliances you bought appliances

31:01.780 --> 31:07.060
The device was you know, there was no subscription element to it. And so we got ourselves into this treadmill of

31:07.780 --> 31:11.940
The long-term value of a customer was slightly less than the cost of acquisition of a customer

31:12.100 --> 31:15.620
And eventually we ran out of money related to the dot-com crash and everything else

31:16.020 --> 31:17.460
Or we ran I shouldn't say we ran out

31:17.460 --> 31:22.180
We never actually ran out of money we ran low on money and eventually we had to look for an exit strategy

31:22.180 --> 31:26.180
The exit strategy we find was through acquisition, right? So our investors made their money back

31:26.500 --> 31:28.580
But none of us got super rich from it, right?

31:28.660 --> 31:30.500
And then I worked at google for a while

31:30.500 --> 31:33.620
I don't want to say too much about google because everybody talks about google all the time

31:33.700 --> 31:40.660
But I saw many many projects inside google succeeding and failing for many many different kinds of reasons and I'm extra curious about that stuff

31:40.660 --> 31:46.020
So I talked to a lot of people while I was there to understand what was working in their project and not working in their project

31:46.500 --> 31:51.540
Like there's definitely patterns to the things that work and don't work and a lot of it involves just sort of like

31:51.540 --> 31:58.180
I think i'm not i'm not a real sports person, but some people call it like getting ahead of your skis, right when you over invest

31:58.580 --> 31:59.700
money

31:59.700 --> 32:02.820
And start spending faster than you understand the business model

32:03.220 --> 32:08.180
That's when you get yourself on this treadmill and it happens just as much in startups as it does in teams and large companies

32:08.580 --> 32:13.860
Do you feel like larger teams are more susceptible to that problem than smaller teams and smaller companies?

32:14.260 --> 32:19.940
It's not so much about team size about money, right? So the the curse is having too much money

32:19.940 --> 32:23.620
And not having the self-control to know that it's too much money

32:24.340 --> 32:30.180
Back in the old dot-com days people used to say this about amazon losing money on every sale, but making up in volume

32:30.580 --> 32:35.140
Right a lot of startups to this day still try to do that and it still doesn't work

32:35.220 --> 32:39.060
Amazon was not actually doing that amazon was doing something else which is why amazon's so successful

32:39.060 --> 32:42.020
But it kind of looked like that and there were a lot of startups that were doing that at the time

32:42.100 --> 32:46.340
But they still do it now if you have a business model that you can't make money per unit

32:46.340 --> 32:49.780
At small scale, you're definitely not going to make money per unit

32:50.420 --> 32:52.420
At 10 or 100 times that scale

32:52.420 --> 32:57.220
I want to shift gears but kind of in the whole business model arena tail scale is open source

32:57.220 --> 32:59.140
And most of the times when I talk to ceos

32:59.140 --> 33:03.300
They tell me that they can't open source their software because somebody would just copy it

33:03.700 --> 33:08.100
Stand up a clone and take all of their profits and that doesn't seem to be a concern of yours

33:08.580 --> 33:11.540
I mean, it's a concern it is it's also a backup plan

33:11.540 --> 33:16.340
So like I said, one of my number one concerns is like when I retire I want my stuff to still exist

33:16.340 --> 33:20.020
And one of my favorite things about shuttle, which is actually one of our competitors

33:20.020 --> 33:25.540
Is that no matter how much I lose attention in it, no matter how much money it doesn't make

33:25.540 --> 33:27.540
Shuttle is still around, right?

33:27.540 --> 33:32.660
There's no company that can just disappear and vaporize the software that was attached to it

33:32.660 --> 33:34.900
And I really like that about open source

33:34.900 --> 33:40.340
I think there's a lot of people out there who open source things and that's like at least half the reason they do it

33:40.340 --> 33:44.980
Is so that when the company they're working for goes away or when they leave the company they're working for

33:44.980 --> 33:50.740
They can still have access to all that source code that they wrote is not destroyed, right?

33:50.740 --> 33:53.140
So I have to admit I have an element of that

33:53.140 --> 33:58.020
Like I personally want to make sure this thing can never die and this is one way to do it

33:58.020 --> 34:00.980
That said, it's also beneficial to our customers

34:00.980 --> 34:03.380
First of all, you can get bug fixes and contributions

34:03.380 --> 34:08.500
Secondly, people don't like installing proprietary VPN clients in their Linux machines

34:08.500 --> 34:13.860
Just generally speaking, you've got almost the whole stack you're using in your cloud servers is open source

34:13.860 --> 34:19.060
If you have this one proprietary VPN server, it very much slows down the adoption

34:19.060 --> 34:24.580
And thirdly, we do, there is a component of Tailscale called the control server that we operate that is not open source

34:24.580 --> 34:27.540
Now there is an open source control server called HeadScale

34:27.540 --> 34:30.900
It's not maintained by us, but we contribute to the HeadScale development

34:30.900 --> 34:32.660
We work with the developer and so on

34:32.660 --> 34:35.060
It doesn't have as many features as Tailscale

34:35.060 --> 34:39.140
It doesn't integrate in exactly the same way, but it works with the same Tailscale clients

34:39.140 --> 34:43.700
So people who are really concerned, they want to have a 100% open source system can do that

34:43.700 --> 34:46.820
Yeah, I was going to ask you about HeadScale, so I'm glad you touched on that. Thank you

34:46.820 --> 34:51.140
Looking at Tailscale, I think a lot of people identify it as one of those quintessential

34:51.140 --> 34:54.420
This is how I get my work done now tools and there's others out there

34:54.420 --> 34:56.500
Slack and Dropbox come to mind

34:56.500 --> 35:01.380
Do you watch some of those companies or are there companies that you watch and go, okay, we're not going to do that

35:01.380 --> 35:03.140
What are you looking for not doing?

35:03.140 --> 35:05.460
I'm curious as a customer, what are you not going to do?

35:05.460 --> 35:06.820
That's an interesting question

35:06.820 --> 35:10.100
In the case of Slack, I really like the way they've done their business model

35:10.100 --> 35:14.900
The way they did their authentication was a series of missteps that I think they're finally getting to

35:14.900 --> 35:17.460
Correcting many years into their existence

35:17.460 --> 35:20.500
So we're probably not going to copy the way Slack did authentication

35:20.500 --> 35:26.660
But I really love their business model, the way that individuals in a company can adopt Slack

35:26.660 --> 35:30.980
They don't even need to necessarily know that other individuals in the same company are adopting Slack

35:30.980 --> 35:33.300
In different Slack instances

35:33.300 --> 35:39.220
And then at some point, you can group all those instances together and say, okay, we're all using Slack here at this company

35:39.220 --> 35:42.500
Why don't we get by a company subscription and get a discount?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.580
That is a really nice business model

35:44.580 --> 35:50.500
That's something that in the security world and infrastructure, which is where Tailscale finds itself

35:50.500 --> 35:51.780
You almost never see that

35:51.780 --> 35:56.580
There's almost no such thing as a security product that is adopted in this bottom up way

35:56.580 --> 35:58.260
And the reason for that is pretty simple

35:58.260 --> 36:02.340
It's that security products almost never solve the problem you have right now

36:02.340 --> 36:05.140
If you're a software developer, you're trying to get something done

36:05.140 --> 36:08.660
The only thing a security product tends to do is stop you from getting that thing done

36:08.660 --> 36:10.420
That's the job of a security product

36:10.420 --> 36:15.620
So it tends to be enforced top down by the CISO saying, look, I know you guys have a lot of work to do

36:15.620 --> 36:20.660
But could you please not do these five things that are horrific security holes that are going to get us in trouble?

36:20.660 --> 36:22.340
And then they slow you down

36:22.340 --> 36:28.100
Tailscale has this nice model where it comes in as an infrastructure tool, a problem solving tool

36:28.100 --> 36:32.420
And then coincidentally on the side, it's also really secure

36:32.420 --> 36:36.660
So the default thing you do with Tailscale is way better than the default thing you would have done otherwise

36:36.660 --> 36:40.500
So the security people who are in charge find out you're using Tailscale

36:40.500 --> 36:42.740
And instead of saying, oh, no, no, please stop doing that

36:42.740 --> 36:46.340
They're like, oh, thank goodness you stopped doing that thing you were doing before

36:46.340 --> 36:48.820
Let's maybe formalize this Tailscale thing a bit

36:48.820 --> 36:49.860
It makes sense

36:49.860 --> 36:54.740
It does definitely feel like a bottom up tool that people are discovering and just falling in love with

36:54.740 --> 37:00.420
I'd like to kind of wrap it up by just kind of getting your thoughts on sort of the state of the tech ecosystem

37:00.420 --> 37:03.220
You know, you look out there, we have some major, major tech companies

37:03.220 --> 37:07.300
And it feels like eventually if you're playing on their platforms, you get their attention

37:07.300 --> 37:12.580
And I'm wondering if that's on your radar at all as far as maybe Apple goes or Microsoft or Google goes

37:12.580 --> 37:15.460
Have you shown up on their radar yet? Have you had conversations with them?

37:15.460 --> 37:22.180
Are you concerned at all about them influencing or trying to influence the direction of features on the mobile app or something to that regard?

37:22.180 --> 37:25.700
I mean, we've had interactions with pretty much all of them

37:25.700 --> 37:30.100
I would say that in general, they're all pretty happy that we exist

37:30.100 --> 37:34.260
We're not hurting anybody's platform by creating this functionality

37:34.260 --> 37:37.700
There's no like embrace and extend model for them

37:37.700 --> 37:44.100
Because I mean, if you imagine Apple, for example, there actually was a Tailscale like product that Apple launched quite a few years ago now

37:44.100 --> 37:47.140
Quite a few years ago now called Back to my Mac, right?

37:47.140 --> 37:52.580
It did almost that exact same thing, except it only worked on Apple products, right?

37:52.580 --> 37:56.980
Which sounds neat, but almost never solves your problem, right?

37:56.980 --> 38:02.740
And similarly, Microsoft, I just found out yesterday there was a product called Windows Mesh, I think

38:02.740 --> 38:06.980
Came out apparently with Windows 7 or near the time of Windows 7 that did similar things to Tailscale

38:06.980 --> 38:08.740
But it only worked on Windows

38:08.740 --> 38:15.380
Tailscale has a feature called Taildrop, which is a lot like AirDrop that Apple has that lets you move files between your devices

38:15.380 --> 38:20.500
Except Tailscale's one works on all your kinds of devices and it doesn't care about physical proximity

38:20.500 --> 38:26.740
Apple's AirDrop only works on Apple devices and even then only sometimes and nobody's quite sure why it doesn't always work, right?

38:26.740 --> 38:34.100
And AWS, for example, they've got an AWS VPN, they've got VPCs, they've got IPSec connections, but it only works inside AWS

38:34.100 --> 38:40.500
So if AWS was going to try to make a Tailscale, it might not make it easy to connect to other kinds of clouds

38:40.500 --> 38:44.180
Because they really have no incentive to make it easy to connect to other kinds of clouds, right?

38:44.180 --> 38:48.820
But if Tailscale is sitting out here independently making all these things work

38:48.820 --> 38:53.700
Then it actually makes it easier for you to use AWS, easier for you to use Windows, easier for you to use Linux

38:53.700 --> 38:58.260
And easier for you to use Apple, it connects all these things together, it makes all these platforms better, right?

38:58.260 --> 39:05.700
So we don't see a lot of interference from the platform owners because we're not really hurting their business at all

39:05.700 --> 39:09.860
We're just making it so that their thing works better with everybody else's things

39:09.860 --> 39:14.340
Yeah, really, it makes it so I can get more work done on their devices, it's what it does

39:14.340 --> 39:15.620
Exactly

39:15.620 --> 39:19.700
Well, Avery, I'm just a huge fan, so thank you very much for all of the hard work

39:19.700 --> 39:23.380
And of course for everyone there at the team and thanks so much for coming on and chatting with us

39:23.380 --> 39:25.140
Yeah, thank you

39:25.140 --> 39:34.340
I really enjoyed that chat with Avery, it's not many founders I can sit down and talk everything from TCPIP to big tech economics

39:34.340 --> 39:39.140
So that was really great, and again if you want to sign up, that wasn't sponsored, that wasn't paid for

39:39.140 --> 39:44.660
But if you want to support one of our shows, tailscale.com slash self-hosted or tailscale.com slash coder

39:44.660 --> 39:52.980
The whole idea of mesh VPNs that can defeat double NAT, carrier grade networking has been a topic on this show for a long time

39:52.980 --> 40:00.500
And when we were in Raleigh, I was kind of leaning over to Brent and I was saying, you know, you got to try this tailscale thing out

40:00.500 --> 40:08.820
I think you would really like it specifically because you do kind of travel around and you've kind of got places you visit frequently now

40:08.820 --> 40:14.180
Tailscale feels like it could be a good solution for you, and I know you didn't get a chance to try it out while I was there

40:14.180 --> 40:21.940
But I think you have since then, so what is like the, I don't know, let's say the Brent review of tailscale, what are your thoughts?

40:21.940 --> 40:33.300
Well I got to say I'm relatively new to it, it's been maybe a week that I've been into it, and maybe a day since I've really dove into it on my own systems here

40:33.300 --> 40:38.580
But whenever you nudge me towards something I know I need to be listening, and so thank you for that

40:38.580 --> 40:45.140
I have in the past, you know, with travel in mind, set up a WireGuard exit node

40:45.140 --> 40:52.820
So I have a little VPS somewhere that just purely accepts my connections wherever I happen to be, that makes me feel a little bit better

40:52.820 --> 40:59.700
Because there are certain places that I go with my laptop that I don't feel like open traffic is necessarily a good thing

40:59.700 --> 41:09.140
But that being said, now I have access to a VM that Alex set up for me where I've been doing some Ansible playing with

41:09.140 --> 41:23.380
And I guess I also have a Bitcoin node sitting over there that I can access from here now, and so the more I dive into it, the more I realize it's solving a lot of my various issues that I have had in the past

41:23.380 --> 41:32.340
And have found solutions that were a bit annoying, but also solutions for problems that I've had that I haven't had a solution for yet

41:32.340 --> 41:44.660
So I know, Chris, you use it a whole bunch, but I'm like tingling with excitement now of diving into Tailscale and really getting a sense of how it can just make things easy and seamless for me

41:44.660 --> 41:57.700
For me, the progression was, at first, for like a month or two, I set it up and I was like, oh yeah, finally I can connect my RV server systems and the studio systems all on one flat network

41:57.700 --> 42:10.740
That was a huge thing for me, because until Tailscale, I never opened up the RV's network to the internet, and there's a ton of dashboards and control panels and statistics and data that the system in the RV is collecting all the time

42:10.740 --> 42:13.780
And sometimes I'm at the studio and I want to check in on that stuff

42:13.780 --> 42:22.180
So that was the first problem I solved, because it takes 30 seconds to get it installed on a Linux box, if that, and they have Raspberry Pi packages and stuff

42:22.180 --> 42:28.100
So I was like, all right, this is great, yeah, okay, sweet, I got a VPN, all right

42:28.100 --> 42:30.100
I didn't really get hyped about it

42:30.100 --> 42:36.900
I don't know why it took me like three months, so you're way ahead of me, dude, until I realized I could install it in a VM

42:36.900 --> 42:43.060
And I had several VMs and projects, like a lot of the Nix stuff, the Nix challenge stuff I was doing in VMs

42:43.060 --> 42:56.900
And it dawned on me that, wait a minute, I could set up a Nix VM, install Tailscale, which is awesome on Nix, and then I could access this VM from literally all my machines, like it's right here

42:56.900 --> 43:03.460
And I could continue the Nix challenge from anywhere, which was great because we were traveling to North Carolina and all of that

43:03.460 --> 43:08.820
And that's when I realized, oh, wait a minute, I actually could run it in this container

43:08.820 --> 43:16.420
Oh, and look at this, Umbral has a Tailscale app that runs in Docker, and now I can get access to my Bitcoin, and it just

43:16.420 --> 43:17.620
That is cool

43:17.620 --> 43:25.460
Yeah, that's when it clicked, when I was like, oh, I could do it in VMs, I can do it in containers, and I can do it on my physical devices, including my mobile devices

43:25.460 --> 43:33.540
And so I just sort of built out a bigger and bigger network, and then it kind of clicked, oh, I can also, you know, support my kids' computers this way

43:33.540 --> 43:39.780
So I really like it, I've probably crossed over where I have more systems using Tailscale than Nebula

43:39.780 --> 43:47.220
Nebula is great because there's like no centralized service, there's nobody getting involved, but it's a lot more of a bring up

43:47.220 --> 43:53.220
So it just didn't quite hit the sweet spot for my, like my laptop and my phone and my Raspberry Pi

43:53.220 --> 43:59.620
But it was, it seemed like a really sweet spot for the VPS and the servers on the studio LAN

43:59.620 --> 44:06.420
But now Tailscale I think has kind of eclipsed some of that too, and it has some really nice DNS stuff, you can actually, if you wanted to, do an easy mode

44:06.420 --> 44:15.780
You can put a Pi-hole in your Tailscale network, and it will start resolving DNS for all of your machines on Tailscale

44:15.780 --> 44:18.020
So you can start referring to all your machines by machine name

44:18.020 --> 44:19.300
That is very cool

44:19.300 --> 44:24.820
Yeah, I like it, it's also been really handy while I'm on the road again, every freaking time I'm on the road

44:24.820 --> 44:30.900
That's how I, a lot of the boosts and feedback, I do all of that through a VPN

44:30.900 --> 44:32.660
It's really nice to be able to just have that right there

44:32.660 --> 44:34.900
So it's a, it's a hell of a thing

44:34.900 --> 44:39.860
I'm really impressed with the service and that's why I was hoping to get some insights into how the heck they're going to keep it running

44:39.860 --> 44:50.900
And the thing that he touched on in there that I liked is they've set it up in a way where the free accounts don't compete with the paid pro users

44:50.900 --> 44:59.220
Which is always like this collision that it seems like all of these services that offer a free version are always heading towards this iceberg

44:59.220 --> 45:05.140
Where inevitably the sales team feels like the free accounts are competing with their benchmarks

45:05.140 --> 45:09.380
And you know, we end up, you always see like the free stuff getting cut back

45:09.380 --> 45:12.180
And the idea that they've kind of designed it in a way where that doesn't happen

45:13.300 --> 45:16.340
I feel like that shows some really good long-time thinking, long-term thinking

45:17.140 --> 45:19.220
So it was nice to see that

45:19.220 --> 45:23.220
Like I said, I'm relatively new so I've been diving into some of their documentation

45:23.220 --> 45:29.060
Just to get a sense of how it all works and what I could possibly do with it

45:29.060 --> 45:34.420
And I found their documentation to actually be really, really great and also fascinating

45:34.420 --> 45:36.580
Which I don't say very often about documentation

45:37.220 --> 45:41.380
It's, it's slightly, I'll say it's ever so slightly confusing

45:41.380 --> 45:45.380
They have a section for documentation which I think is a little bit more on the technical

45:45.380 --> 45:49.700
It's a simple explainer of the technical side of things which I found very, very helpful

45:49.700 --> 45:55.620
So getting DNS set up for your whole network and those kind of useful tips

45:56.340 --> 46:00.500
But they also have sections that I would encourage people to just go browse

46:00.500 --> 46:05.780
One of them is called the Tailscale Guides and the other is Tailscale Solutions

46:07.140 --> 46:09.140
I don't quite know the difference between them

46:09.140 --> 46:13.140
They seem very similar but there's some amazingly fascinating stuff in there

46:13.140 --> 46:17.780
So they have a guide on like accessing a Pi Hole or Raspberry Pi from anywhere

46:17.780 --> 46:22.900
Which I think is a really nice place to start maybe if you are trying to play with this

46:22.900 --> 46:26.260
But they also have, you know, a guide on Tailscale and NixOS

46:26.900 --> 46:30.820
A new Minecraft server in 10 minutes which sounds really fun

46:30.820 --> 46:32.740
Tailscale in LXC containers

46:32.740 --> 46:34.500
I know we talked about that a little bit last week

46:34.500 --> 46:37.860
So that might be a place to go if people are interested

46:38.420 --> 46:42.180
And the last one that really caught my eye was setting up a dog cam

46:42.180 --> 46:44.020
With Tailscale Raspberry Pi in motion

46:48.180 --> 46:50.100
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

46:50.100 --> 46:52.980
Get started with a free trial of Teams or Enterprise

46:52.980 --> 46:57.140
Or for an individual when you go to bitwarden.com slash Linux

46:57.140 --> 47:03.300
Simply put, it's the easiest way for individuals or businesses to store, share, and sync sensitive data

47:03.300 --> 47:05.220
Bitwarden is fully customizable

47:05.220 --> 47:07.780
You can turn certain features off that you don't want

47:07.780 --> 47:11.540
And of course it's what I use for my password and secret information storing

47:11.540 --> 47:14.660
And I'll also add my two-factor authentication token

47:14.660 --> 47:16.420
I put it all in one package

47:16.420 --> 47:19.220
And man is that handy when I'm traveling

47:19.220 --> 47:20.820
Oh my gosh, you guys

47:20.820 --> 47:22.100
I won't name names

47:22.100 --> 47:25.620
But some of my friends out there, they don't use Bitwarden

47:25.620 --> 47:28.820
And I have been on a campaign to convert them

47:28.820 --> 47:34.980
Because it is painful when I sit down and watch them try to log in on some service

47:34.980 --> 47:36.900
When they don't have a password manager

47:36.900 --> 47:38.260
Like maybe they set up a new box

47:38.260 --> 47:41.140
Or maybe they're using a system in the studio temporarily

47:41.140 --> 47:43.060
Oh my god, it's painful

47:43.060 --> 47:45.220
Bitwarden makes it so much simpler

47:45.220 --> 47:48.900
They make it easy and safe to store sensitive data

47:48.900 --> 47:51.220
For yourself or when you're working with a team

47:51.220 --> 47:54.180
Wes and I use it to manage our passwords and two-factor codes

47:54.180 --> 47:56.580
And other sensitive data all the time

47:56.580 --> 47:58.260
I use it to work with team members

47:58.260 --> 48:00.500
And I really think it'd be great for open source projects too

48:00.500 --> 48:05.300
And one of the things they've just recently added which is brilliant is a username generator

48:06.180 --> 48:08.740
Stop using the same username at every site you go to

48:09.380 --> 48:10.740
I never really thought about it

48:10.740 --> 48:11.860
But that's crazy

48:12.740 --> 48:16.660
Anything you can do to improve your security online is going to be good, right?

48:16.660 --> 48:19.140
But like I'd say number one is passwords

48:19.140 --> 48:20.660
And number two, I never really thought about it

48:20.660 --> 48:22.100
But of course it's usernames

48:22.100 --> 48:26.260
Because if a service is compromised and their database leaks

48:26.260 --> 48:29.300
Then that username is going to be the same username across multiple sites

48:29.300 --> 48:31.540
At least it is for me, I'm embarrassed to say it's true

48:31.540 --> 48:33.940
So having a different username for each website you use

48:34.740 --> 48:36.180
That's going to make it difficult

48:36.180 --> 48:40.100
I'd say impossible for a hacker and attacker to track you across sites

48:40.100 --> 48:43.220
And of course their generator supports your email service

48:43.220 --> 48:45.780
If it has like the plus addition for an email

48:45.780 --> 48:47.220
So like Gmail for example

48:47.220 --> 48:50.660
User plus your actual like fake thing at gmail.com or whatever

48:51.380 --> 48:52.500
It's really nice

48:52.500 --> 48:54.340
And it's so intuitive the way they do it

48:54.340 --> 48:55.940
Because it all just stores in Bitwarden

48:55.940 --> 48:58.260
Then when I try to log into a service on my phone

48:58.260 --> 49:00.500
I have a nice secure password for that too

49:00.500 --> 49:03.140
And I'll admit before they got really good password management on the phones

49:03.140 --> 49:04.420
This just wasn't a great option

49:04.420 --> 49:05.780
And Bitwarden nails it

49:05.780 --> 49:07.940
And then on the iPhone it ties in with face ID

49:07.940 --> 49:08.980
So it's scanning my face

49:08.980 --> 49:12.260
It's importing the password I mean it just happens so smooth so flawlessly

49:12.260 --> 49:12.740
I love it

49:12.740 --> 49:14.980
And like I say when I'm traveling tools like this

49:14.980 --> 49:16.660
I don't know I don't know how I got work done without them

49:16.660 --> 49:19.140
Something like Bitwarden it's the only way I'm going to go

49:19.140 --> 49:20.340
And I love that it's open source

49:20.340 --> 49:21.940
And I love that they have a self-hosted option

49:21.940 --> 49:23.700
And I love that they got a giant community

49:24.340 --> 49:25.300
Go try it out for yourself

49:25.300 --> 49:28.740
Or maybe recommend it to a friend and family member like I've been doing recently

49:28.740 --> 49:32.260
Or maybe it's time for your workplace to kind of get their act together in this regard

49:33.060 --> 49:34.180
No shame in that game

49:34.180 --> 49:36.020
It's just you know the way things have been in the past

49:36.020 --> 49:39.300
But now Bitwarden is changing it and they've got great team plans too

49:39.300 --> 49:41.140
Individual or team go try it out right now

49:41.140 --> 49:43.060
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

49:43.620 --> 49:46.180
Go to Bitwarden.com slash Linux to support the show

49:46.180 --> 49:48.980
And to get started with the best password management

49:48.980 --> 49:52.420
And I'll say it my personal way to keep all my secrets

49:53.220 --> 49:54.180
What's in there?

49:54.180 --> 49:56.100
Bitwarden.com slash Linux

50:00.100 --> 50:01.780
We got some great feedback again this week

50:01.780 --> 50:02.900
Thank you everyone

50:02.900 --> 50:03.700
Lyndon wrote in

50:03.700 --> 50:07.140
I was just listening to episode 457

50:07.140 --> 50:09.460
I'm a heavy user of Ansible and LXD

50:09.460 --> 50:11.860
And thought I'd share a couple of useful tips

50:12.500 --> 50:15.620
One is the ability to use LXD to manage hosts with Ansible

50:15.620 --> 50:16.980
No SSH required

50:16.980 --> 50:22.180
If you configure a local LXD client to connect to a remote LXD server

50:22.180 --> 50:25.620
You can specify the name of the host and containers in your inventory

50:25.620 --> 50:29.380
And configure the Ansible host variable as follows

50:29.380 --> 50:30.740
He gives an example we'll include

50:31.300 --> 50:32.580
I think that's kind of neat

50:32.580 --> 50:34.340
I know Alex got real excited about that

50:34.340 --> 50:35.620
So that's sort of fun

50:35.620 --> 50:36.580
They continue

50:36.580 --> 50:39.300
I know you folks are also Bitwarden users

50:39.300 --> 50:43.460
Rather than store secrets in multiple places and use Ansible vaults

50:43.460 --> 50:47.940
I found a plugin that lets you use the Bitwarden command line client

50:47.940 --> 50:49.460
To retrieve Ansible secrets

50:50.340 --> 50:52.100
So we'll leave a link to that

50:52.820 --> 50:54.820
That is awesome

50:54.820 --> 50:56.820
I didn't really even think of that

50:56.820 --> 50:57.700
It's so great

50:57.700 --> 50:59.540
Why not use Bitwarden for the secrets?

50:59.540 --> 51:00.660
You know what he touches on here

51:00.660 --> 51:03.540
About being able to deploy a LXD container or a server

51:04.100 --> 51:06.260
With just like a couple of things that you specify

51:06.260 --> 51:07.380
And then Ansible does the rest

51:07.940 --> 51:10.980
I do really appreciate that when we did the NixOS challenge

51:10.980 --> 51:13.620
We did a bit of a comparison between Ansible and Nix

51:13.620 --> 51:15.460
And that's sort of what's brought up all this Ansible feedback

51:16.020 --> 51:17.940
And it wasn't really a fair comparison

51:17.940 --> 51:23.780
Because the Nix system lets you manage the Nix package and the NixOS possibly

51:23.780 --> 51:26.340
But you could run the Nix package manager on just about any distro

51:27.140 --> 51:29.380
And it lets you manage that world, right?

51:29.380 --> 51:35.780
Where Ansible is like multi OS, multi distro, multi container platforms, right?

51:35.780 --> 51:36.980
And so that's the big difference

51:36.980 --> 51:41.060
Now, I think there is a totally valid argument for only needing to learn a Nix system

51:41.060 --> 51:42.420
If that's the scope of your work

51:42.420 --> 51:46.100
But I think it's also really valid to say, you know, there's a lot more I want to get done

51:46.100 --> 51:48.100
And so Ansible is the way for me

51:48.100 --> 51:49.540
And I totally appreciate that

51:49.540 --> 51:53.860
And I feel like I've gotten a whole new set of insights on how people use these tools accidentally

51:54.580 --> 51:55.860
Like we just stumbled into this

51:56.500 --> 51:57.940
And I'm learning a lot

51:57.940 --> 51:59.700
So I guess that's a good thing, right?

51:59.700 --> 52:04.580
So yeah, and I think that's the really the beauty of some of the feedback we keep getting

52:04.580 --> 52:06.740
We're in a position where people just giving us

52:06.740 --> 52:10.100
Keep giving us some great tips on things we didn't know we needed

52:10.100 --> 52:11.140
And turns out we do

52:13.380 --> 52:16.740
And now it is time for Le Boost

52:16.740 --> 52:19.140
As always, we get some great boosts as well

52:19.140 --> 52:21.060
SirLurksalot is back

52:21.060 --> 52:23.780
1337SATS seems oddly specific

52:24.580 --> 52:27.540
Feather for the tinfoil hat, if you will

52:27.540 --> 52:28.900
Starlink knows where you are

52:28.900 --> 52:31.300
Even if you bug out in the middle of nowhere

52:31.300 --> 52:36.420
Considering how Elon's car company collects an enormous amount of data about its customers

52:36.420 --> 52:39.460
You have to at least wonder how that data is being used

52:39.460 --> 52:40.340
Or sold

52:40.340 --> 52:41.380
Or in what form

52:41.380 --> 52:43.140
Who actually has access

52:43.140 --> 52:48.500
And how securely it really is in the hands of yet another tech company that dabbles in hardware

52:49.460 --> 52:52.900
Are your internet habits and travels valuable to hacker loot?

52:53.620 --> 52:55.540
Hmm, maybe some bacon here, Chris

52:55.540 --> 52:57.540
Oh, man

52:57.540 --> 53:04.340
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about the fact that now there's one more company that's tracking my exact location

53:04.340 --> 53:09.380
And they do, you know, they have to know where the dish is in order for it to connect to the satellites up in space

53:09.380 --> 53:12.420
And the dish is always aware of its longitude and latitude

53:12.420 --> 53:15.620
And I must have GPS in there too

53:16.420 --> 53:17.460
You know, it's such a trade-off

53:19.220 --> 53:23.140
I don't know why, but I probably am more comfortable with Starlink than I am

53:23.140 --> 53:25.700
Verizon or AT&T or T-Mobile

53:26.260 --> 53:30.820
I feel like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile probably have like an automated system

53:30.820 --> 53:35.940
That law enforcement can just check a box and get your location info for like the last year

53:35.940 --> 53:37.540
Maybe Starlink will do the same

53:37.540 --> 53:42.580
But it's the trade-off of getting connected to the worldwide community, right?

53:42.580 --> 53:45.140
How else can you get connected to an internet like that

53:45.940 --> 53:48.900
Without some trace unless you use someone else's system

53:48.900 --> 53:54.660
And JOOPS does have, on the roof, I have a 7-in-1 antenna array

53:54.660 --> 53:59.140
And a couple of those antennas are dedicated to 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi

53:59.140 --> 54:02.340
I can pick up Wi-Fi from quite a range

54:02.340 --> 54:08.420
So every now and then there is, I do have the capability of doing like some sneaky network joining

54:08.420 --> 54:10.660
Careful of what you admit to here

54:10.660 --> 54:12.580
I know, I'm sort of realizing right now

54:12.580 --> 54:15.940
But, you know, when you're out in the middle of nowhere and you have to bring your own internet

54:15.940 --> 54:17.380
Yeah, that would be a problem

54:17.380 --> 54:18.420
Boost to graph

54:18.420 --> 54:20.580
Marcel wrote in with a thousand sats

54:20.580 --> 54:22.900
So when does the Star Trek podcast come out?

54:22.900 --> 54:24.900
I'm kidding, of course, but I would definitely listen to that

54:24.900 --> 54:26.260
You seem very passionate about it

54:26.260 --> 54:29.620
I just finished Enterprise and I have mixed feelings

54:30.180 --> 54:34.580
On the pre-show for the member feed, I think we got into Star Trek again, didn't we?

54:34.580 --> 54:36.100
I think it was all Coder Radio's fault

54:36.100 --> 54:37.780
It happens from time to time, we get up

54:38.740 --> 54:41.300
With age does come some wisdom

54:41.300 --> 54:47.620
And I have realized that there are some hobbies and passions that I have

54:47.620 --> 54:49.380
That I shouldn't make content out of

54:49.380 --> 54:52.340
And I should keep them for myself to enjoy

54:52.980 --> 54:56.100
And I've decided that Star Trek is one of those things

54:56.100 --> 54:59.300
And I have dabbled in the past with Star Trek related content

54:59.860 --> 55:06.020
And I have found that Jupiter broadcasting is its strongest when we really stay on mission and focused

55:06.660 --> 55:08.820
And so that gives me an opportunity

55:08.820 --> 55:12.340
That is an excuse to just keep Star Trek for something I personally enjoy

55:12.340 --> 55:15.620
However, I do love a good Star Trek conversation

55:15.620 --> 55:18.900
And I will always jump in if something's going down on stream related to Star Trek

55:18.900 --> 55:23.460
And I would love to, like, if one of my friends out there starts a Star Trek podcast

55:23.460 --> 55:25.540
I'd love to join them for an episode sometime

55:25.540 --> 55:29.140
Because, yeah, I'm a bit of a fiend when it comes to Star Trek

55:29.140 --> 55:31.780
But I don't plan to launch a Star Trek show

55:31.780 --> 55:35.460
I think I'll leave that out for all the other folks out there that want to make podcasts around it

55:36.340 --> 55:39.620
We got several just like thanks for doing a show, Boose

55:39.620 --> 55:40.340
These are great too

55:40.340 --> 55:45.860
We got a couple from Crashmaster18 and Winebearer in a total of about 6,000 SATs

55:45.860 --> 55:47.540
They just sent in some thank yous

55:47.540 --> 55:49.380
So I just want to say thank you guys for boosting

55:49.380 --> 55:52.260
We also got some folks that are doing the SAT streaming

55:52.260 --> 55:57.300
So you can set an amount and while you listen, it'll stream a SAT every now and then back to us

55:57.300 --> 56:01.460
And the great news is that with the price of Bitcoin down, SATs are on sale

56:01.460 --> 56:04.100
They're the same SATs, one SAT still equals one SAT

56:05.220 --> 56:07.620
So get them cheap while you can right now

56:07.620 --> 56:12.340
I'll probably be on sale for a little while as the market's going to just be in the tank

56:12.340 --> 56:16.020
So go get some cheap SATs and load up a podcasting 2.0 app

56:16.020 --> 56:18.740
You can get them at newpodcastapps.com

56:18.740 --> 56:22.100
Podcasting 2.0 has a lot going on

56:22.100 --> 56:30.180
Including they're working right now very diligently on incorporating live audio streaming into the app

56:30.180 --> 56:32.020
So you just open up your podcast app

56:32.020 --> 56:37.780
And if Linux Unplugged is live, it'll just show as in your feed list, it's live on air

56:37.780 --> 56:43.780
And you can tap it and you can listen to our live stream in your podcasting 2.0 compatible app

56:43.780 --> 56:44.820
Not all apps support it yet

56:44.820 --> 56:47.060
Like I don't think Fountain or Castamatic do

56:47.060 --> 56:50.420
But some of the web apps, there's some really good web podcasting apps, by the way

56:50.420 --> 56:50.900
Who knew?

56:51.620 --> 56:55.860
Podverse is great because it's a web app that syncs to a mobile client as well

56:55.860 --> 56:58.260
All of these are listed at newpodcastapps.com

56:58.260 --> 57:03.220
But I can't wait for live streaming and transcription and a whole bunch of other stuff

57:03.220 --> 57:07.380
That's all part of the podcasting 2.0 spec along with the value block

57:07.380 --> 57:10.420
You can check out a lot of all that info in Office Hours

57:10.420 --> 57:15.140
We covered a bunch of it last week at officehours.hair for that

57:15.140 --> 57:18.020
And go try out a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

57:18.020 --> 57:22.260
And if you don't want a new podcast app, because I know a lot of you love AntennaPod

57:22.260 --> 57:23.700
That's very popular in our community

57:24.340 --> 57:26.580
So is Overcast on the iOS side

57:26.580 --> 57:29.860
And actually Apple Podcast app is always a strong contender

57:29.860 --> 57:30.980
And Pocket Cast, of course

57:30.980 --> 57:34.820
I know you guys love those apps and you don't want to change

57:34.820 --> 57:35.860
Go try Breeze

57:35.860 --> 57:39.860
You can send in some boosts via the Breeze app and you don't have to switch podcast apps

57:39.860 --> 57:41.300
That's pretty, pretty nice

57:42.100 --> 57:42.980
Guess what?

57:42.980 --> 57:43.700
We got a pick

57:45.700 --> 57:46.980
And it's on theme

57:48.020 --> 57:48.820
Like, I likes it

57:49.380 --> 57:50.820
Brandon, how do you think you pronounce this one?

57:50.820 --> 57:52.100
Oh, I think I got this one

57:52.100 --> 57:52.820
You do?

57:52.820 --> 57:53.780
Oh yeah, go for it

57:53.780 --> 57:55.780
I think it's called We're On

57:55.780 --> 57:58.020
Ah, yeah, yeah, like we are on

57:58.020 --> 57:58.660
Right, you see that?

57:58.660 --> 57:59.860
Yeah, we're on

57:59.860 --> 58:01.460
I think you nailed it

58:01.460 --> 58:08.500
So this is a secure overlay network based on WebRTC

58:08.500 --> 58:09.620
That is interesting

58:09.620 --> 58:11.140
Yeah, this is weird

58:11.860 --> 58:14.580
But it's on theme for this episode

58:14.580 --> 58:16.020
Wes found this actually

58:16.020 --> 58:17.540
So it's a shame he can't be here

58:17.540 --> 58:20.820
So maybe if we ever give this a go with him, we'll bring it up again

58:20.820 --> 58:22.740
Because I think he actually wanted to talk about it

58:22.740 --> 58:28.740
But the idea is with We're On is that it gives you access to nodes behind a firewall, behind an ad

58:29.300 --> 58:32.900
Using WebRC to establish the connection between the nodes

58:33.540 --> 58:37.780
And actually this stuff has been built into WebRTC all the time

58:38.420 --> 58:40.020
And nobody ever built the tooling around it

58:40.020 --> 58:46.100
And it always drove me crazy because we basically use WebRTC now for video calls and audio calls

58:46.100 --> 58:47.620
And that's really where we stopped

58:47.620 --> 58:52.100
But it could, you know, you can actually build a freaking CDN on top of WebRTC

58:52.100 --> 58:57.300
So they're using the underlying suite of tools that are available for this

58:57.300 --> 59:03.940
And the project claims it's pretty low overhead and it's pretty surprisingly good performance

59:03.940 --> 59:04.740
That's ridiculous

59:04.740 --> 59:09.780
If you use it between nodes on a LAN, they say, you may not even notice a performance overhead

59:09.780 --> 59:11.620
Which is just wild

59:12.580 --> 59:13.140
I don't know, man

59:13.700 --> 59:14.340
I don't know

59:14.340 --> 59:17.380
But it's actually pretty easy to get up and going on a Linux box

59:17.380 --> 59:21.700
You basically can just pull down a binary and get it up and going

59:21.700 --> 59:24.020
So we'll put a link in the show notes to We're On

59:24.580 --> 59:29.060
And I could see someone who wants a temporary mesh network

59:29.060 --> 59:31.780
You know, maybe it's up for the day or maybe it's up for an event

59:31.780 --> 59:32.900
I could totally see that

59:32.900 --> 59:33.700
Oh, yeah

59:33.700 --> 59:33.940
Right

59:33.940 --> 59:37.700
You're doing a corporate event or a Linux event and you want to build a temporary mesh network

59:37.700 --> 59:41.780
You don't necessarily want to assign to anyone's particular account or anything like that

59:41.780 --> 59:44.420
You could use We're On to stand that thing up in five minutes

59:44.420 --> 59:46.580
And now you got yourself an overlay network

59:46.580 --> 59:50.100
All running off of WebRTC, which everybody has support for on their box

59:50.100 --> 59:52.820
Not really something we need because we're pretty much set

59:52.820 --> 59:54.660
But gosh, you could see that

59:55.540 --> 59:56.180
You never know

59:56.820 --> 59:57.380
That's it

59:57.380 --> 59:57.780
That's it

59:57.780 --> 59:58.580
We're wrapping it up

59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.460
I just want to make a mention that we do this show live on Sunday

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.100
Even if that means I got to set up some sort of hack together

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.300
Set up run over cellular from Southern Oregon

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.260
We're doing it live

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.620
And that means that we get great folks like Christian from Red Hat that stopped by

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:14.260
And if you're in our if you're in our Mumble Room

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.460
And you got a question about this Nvidia open source driver

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.060
You can ask one of the guys that has the most knowledge about the situation directly

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.420
That's a unique opportunity

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.980
And it happens right here on Linux Unplugged

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.620
But also hanging out live just lets you listen in real time

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.300
Give us feedback in the chat room

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.980
And if you get Mumble, you can actually just hang out in the quiet listening room

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:36.180
Then you get an Opus codec quality of the show

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.940
With probably lower latency than Brent and I have between each other right now

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.500
It's great and it's a totally free software stack

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.540
And then you got it

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.700
You can join us and you can do things like office hours

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.940
Which we also do on Mumble and other network shows that use Mumble from time to time

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.860
And if you're in the tech industry or you're just curious about what's going on in the world

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.300
Of free software and open source

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.260
Don't miss an episode of Linux Action News

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.620
LinuxActionNews.com

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.260
Christian worked with us to make sure that we had the most accurate information possible

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.940
So literally the moment the Nvidia news dropped

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.420
Linux Action News dropped

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.380
So that way you could have the context and the information first

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.260
And you could make sure that you were commenting

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.580
Or if you were saying something online, it was accurate, right?

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.220
I mean, you see a lot of people just popping off with their opinion

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.340
But JB listeners got the facts

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.660
Just by being subscribed to Linux Action News

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.220
So it's something to consider because when something goes down

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.340
We're going to try to cover it there as accurately and as fast as possible

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.740
So LinuxActionNews.com

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.020
Big plug for that, I guess

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.980
Hope to see you next week

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.580
Join us, we'll be live on a Sunday

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:44.820
But of course, you is always, always welcome to subscribe

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.900
Enjoy the show any way you want

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.980
Live is just one of the options

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.860
And of course, we appreciate any value you can return to the show

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.580
Maybe it's a membership at Linux Unplugged Core

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.180
Maybe it's jupyter.party for the whole network

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.540
Maybe it's a boost

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.860
Or maybe it's just telling someone about the show

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.220
That matters a lot too

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.420
Maybe it's a review, I don't know

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.180
I don't know you

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.180
I can't tell you what

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.300
But we appreciate you listening

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.940
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:37.860
And we'll see you right back here next week

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:57.700
So obviously to make it clear

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.540
Because I was not sure that no Nvidia driver for the future

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:08.340
Is only possible with the right current version of the Nvidia GPUs

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.340
And the future GPU cards

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.980
And it is not possible to use that one with the 1060 for example, right?

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.340
No, not with 1060

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.780
Wow, is the 1060 that old?

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.940
Wow, yeah, it looks like

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.220
Yeah, but in fact, so it could be that

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.140
If for the 1060 a working row driver is running

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:31.220
Then somehow we could profit from that new initiative, right?

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.420
Maybe

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:32.980
Yeah, maybe

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.500
I'm not sure

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.620
Because I mean, once again, right

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:38.260
The driver consists of multiple parts, right?

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.580
This is a current driver and then there's a user space with Mesa

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.700
And then there's also the firmware

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.100
And we need all three of them to be able to work together

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.260
And I don't think the firmware can work with the such old cards

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.580
The other thing I had just because it comes in my mind now

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.980
And the firmware, if I understood it well

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.940
Before, all right, the firmware actually has some shared code

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.500
That is also used on Windows, right?

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:08.980
So the Linux and Windows driver with the firmware share some code, right?

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.060
I usually get someone from NVIDIA to go on details there

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.860
I mean, another driver in general is shared between Windows and Linux

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.220
And if there is exactly the same firmware, I think it is

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.700
But I don't know, between Windows and Linux systems

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.180
I mean, they try to, I mean, of course

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.180
For ease of maintenance to keep things as aligned as possible between the two

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.140
Here's what I'm wondering

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.660
And this is, we'll just see and it's gonna depend on developer resources

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.300
But imagine we're four or five years into this, right?

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.820
So we've all been using an open source NVIDIA driver for a while

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.340
We've got the open source AMD driver

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.180
We've got the open source Intel driver

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:51.220
Do we start to see one common interface to start to change some of these settings

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.420
Or whatever is maybe gets exposed that in the past required an AMD control panel

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:57.940
And an NVIDIA control panel

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.700
Like, do we start to see maybe some basic settings

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.420
Just get baked into the plasma desktop or GNOME desktop

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.620
And on the back end, they're figuring out if that's for an NVIDIA card or an AMD card

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:13.380
Like, it feels like the integration and control that could eventually come to the desktop

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.460
Is going to be at a whole new level

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:18.660
When all of the major video card drivers are open source

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:21.700
Yeah, I think my thoughts around there is that, you know

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.420
They are continuously expanding, you know, what Wokid can do

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:30.420
So, I mean, you know, I mentioned this to you afterwards over interview

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.580
But I'm really excited by the fact that, you know

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:39.300
There is Vulkan extensions coming out to do H.264, H.265 and VC1 encoding and decoding now

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.700
Which means that instead of, you know, up to this point having to deal with like, you know

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.260
Special encoding library for NVIDIA

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.380
Special encoding library for Intel and so on

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.020
We can now, as application writers, right

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.460
Have one API we target and we will get GPU accelerated encoding and decoding

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.380
So this is something I'm really excited about

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.980
And I think, you know, I think we'll see a lot more things moving into Vulkan over time

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.060
Because I think they're definitely going to go on beyond maybe, you know

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.780
Well, as we see with the video, just doing 3D graphics

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.740
Christian, as a last question, I'm curious about

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:17.860
What was your personal favorite part about working on this initiative for you personally?

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.180
Well, the main thing, of course, is that I know that for Fedora users

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.100
And RAL users too, of course

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.340
But it's been a pain point for years to have to then deal with going out

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.340
Or first realizing, oh, okay, I need a driver for my hardware

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.900
Because I think on Linux people sort of assume everything is just there

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.900
And then maybe not finding it or maybe they found the wrong version

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.620
Or they found a version that was harder to set up

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.980
I mean, I know a lot of people, of course

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.580
Ended up getting the upstream NVIDIA driver, which they then have to build themselves

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.500
And, of course, I did that myself back in the day

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.260
And it was, you know, a great learning experience

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.660
But, you know, it would have been a lot easier for people to, for instance,

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:58.580
Have found the repository of RPN Fusion to just get it pre-set up for them very easily

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.900
So I think just being able to get beyond that and sort of say, yep, graphics is not going to be

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.700
Something where I, you know, have to read a review for a new Fedora release

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.220
And people saying, oh, this broke

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.060
That's the big thing for me

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:14.740
Oh, I can't wait
