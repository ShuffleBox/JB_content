WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.380
I know I know a little something you guys don't know West told me before the show started that he managed to pull off a

00:06.380 --> 00:09.120
heroic measure with one of his arch Linux systems

00:09.120 --> 00:15.660
And I gotta give respect because both beer and I have been there you got an arch box something falls off your radar

00:15.660 --> 00:17.660
You don't update it for weeks

00:17.720 --> 00:23.840
Maybe even months and then it comes it comes due and you got to fix that box. Maybe even years. Yeah

00:23.840 --> 00:30.560
Maybe what happened not quite a year is probably like nine months. I moved this laptop perfectly serviceable laptop

00:30.560 --> 00:36.440
But right now it doesn't have a working battery. So it's like a desktop laptop. Let's call it hadn't updated, right?

00:36.440 --> 00:38.440
So I finally set it up set it up on a desk

00:38.620 --> 00:42.500
Started looking around. Oh, yeah, right. I was running. I had awesome set up and some other things

00:43.380 --> 00:44.820
Couldn't install anything

00:44.820 --> 00:49.540
But it really wasn't I had to add a update a bunch of GPG keys

00:49.540 --> 00:53.700
I had to purge all the caches get rid of all the key stores that I had then

00:55.060 --> 00:57.900
Work my way back through the arch home page

00:58.580 --> 01:00.860
resolving each and want every one of the little you know

01:01.460 --> 01:04.860
user intervention required example, but I

01:05.340 --> 01:08.940
Mean, I've done those before I would have had to do them anyway, so it was really just paying my dues

01:09.440 --> 01:16.580
Work just fine now. I'm really no problems. It's the GPG keys that that you really got a that was the that was the

01:16.580 --> 01:21.820
Triggiest bit. So what does this box do? It's like a home server. No, it's just a it was another laptop that I have

01:21.820 --> 01:22.340
Oh, okay

01:22.340 --> 01:26.340
I was about to give you a hard time for on your home server on arch because I have been there

01:26.340 --> 01:30.540
I do have a home server on arch my route my router runs arch you maniac

01:31.620 --> 01:35.260
This is Linux unplugged episode 214 for September 12

01:35.260 --> 01:47.580
2017

01:47.580 --> 01:48.180
Oh

01:48.180 --> 01:53.920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show. That's loading snaps installing sound boards and playing clips

01:54.060 --> 01:58.700
My name is Chris. My name is what and of course the beards here. Hello beard. Hey, hello, sir

01:58.700 --> 02:01.160
Beards fresh off rebuilding our mumble PC

02:01.160 --> 02:06.720
I could do the show today like legitimately four minutes before the show started. I told you I timed it, right?

02:07.480 --> 02:11.300
We got a good show today. So I'm really glad you got a fix cuz holy smokes

02:11.300 --> 02:16.900
You've been hearing about this Equifax breach. There is a small open source story. We'll tell you about that aspect of it

02:17.180 --> 02:18.700
Linus has got some good ideas

02:18.700 --> 02:24.680
We'll tell you about those after we get through some community updates including some potentially new man. Jarrow hardware

02:24.680 --> 02:31.360
Thank you. Gnome 3.26 goodness and benchmarks our replacement for Nileus and an update from Ubuntu

02:32.040 --> 02:35.980
We're gonna get into Kali Linux for a bit. I revisited Kali Linux

02:36.120 --> 02:40.640
I'll tell you about my adventures and why I decided to hack my IOT devices

02:40.640 --> 02:46.940
I decided to blow off some steam and try to break all my IOT devices. You've never been very trusting anyway

02:46.960 --> 02:52.620
So I'll tell you the tools that I used and the way you could audit your own network with Kali Linux

02:52.620 --> 02:55.900
It's been a little while. We'll give you a little history on Kali as well. And then

02:57.060 --> 02:59.060
at the end of the show

03:00.140 --> 03:03.060
By popular demand you've been waiting to macOS

03:04.300 --> 03:10.220
Pretty close to that. We'll cover the new iPhone event. No, no, no, no. No, it's the Gentoo challenge

03:10.780 --> 03:11.900
finally

03:11.900 --> 03:16.860
Finally after a month of waiting after absences and travel

03:16.860 --> 03:24.480
We're gonna get to the Gentoo challenge. We've been building software for weeks and we're here to tell you how it all goes through

03:24.480 --> 03:26.000
the roof

03:26.000 --> 03:30.900
But before we get to all of that, we got to bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings L mumble

03:31.480 --> 03:33.040
Hello

03:33.040 --> 03:36.260
Hello everybody good to have you here today. So

03:37.040 --> 03:40.760
There's not a lot that I feel like we could add to this Equifax story

03:40.760 --> 03:43.840
In fact our friends over there at the Techsnap program just covered it today

03:43.840 --> 03:47.080
So that'd probably be where I would point you but at this point in time

03:47.080 --> 03:50.240
Everybody's heard about the credit bureau here in the States getting hacked

03:51.080 --> 03:56.120
nearly 200 million identity and really personal identification information has been stolen and

03:57.560 --> 03:59.560
It turns out it's all open sources fault

04:00.400 --> 04:04.180
It's all not again. It's not Equifax's fault. It's not shoddy

04:04.680 --> 04:10.160
Network hygiene it's not poor update practices. It's not bad security auditing

04:10.160 --> 04:15.440
It's open sources fault you I know you know about this story because you're talking about it on Techsnap sure did

04:16.080 --> 04:20.640
So it comes down to they're simply blaming a patch Apache struts

04:20.640 --> 04:25.800
Mm-hmm, and Apache struts is like a it's a obviously it's from the Apache projects

04:25.800 --> 04:30.160
it's an open source offer programming model view controller like an MVC framework for Java and

04:31.200 --> 04:32.400
it's

04:32.400 --> 04:35.840
it is at the core a lot of these old business applications and

04:35.840 --> 04:37.840
And

04:38.400 --> 04:43.640
They had Equifax they Equifax hired an auditor to come in and this auditor

04:43.960 --> 04:48.020
Discovered that they were using a version of struts that has a vulnerability

04:48.020 --> 04:51.280
That's just recently been disclosed as of a couple of days ago, September 5th

04:53.360 --> 04:56.400
But of course the hack happened earlier in the year

04:58.040 --> 05:00.040
Somewhere between mid May through July

05:00.400 --> 05:05.400
So we're not actually sure if it was this vulnerability or baby a different one that came out in March that they just never patched

05:05.400 --> 05:12.640
again right and then those two stories are like are very different it is totally possible that at the core of its struts was the

05:12.640 --> 05:16.040
Issue, but I'd like like your take on this West because in my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong

05:16.040 --> 05:18.040
Maybe I'm just too much of an open source defender

05:18.120 --> 05:23.600
But to me it seems pretty obvious you can have vulnerable software be a proprietary or open software

05:23.600 --> 05:29.840
And it's about like an onion layered approach to security you you build your network assuming. There's going to be compromises

05:29.840 --> 05:37.600
Yeah, I think so. I mean you're definitely right about that and while there there may be cases where you know some software open-source

05:37.600 --> 05:45.920
Or proprietary does lead to information disclosures despite best practices being followed but before before that and like obviously we want to get this patched and

05:45.920 --> 05:47.240
upgraded

05:47.240 --> 05:53.800
You do have to understand some of the like what is the update hygiene patch policy Etc that Equifax is is is using?

05:53.800 --> 05:58.840
And if that's not up to speed that is really the problem not whatever vulnerabilities may exist in the

05:58.840 --> 06:04.280
I'm sure myriad of different open-source software that they're using yeah at the end of the day there is a there is a flaw in struts

06:04.280 --> 06:07.280
There's right. There's a problem. No one is disputing that well plus

06:07.280 --> 06:11.400
You know Chris the codes open so they can just look at that code and find all the vulnerabilities

06:11.400 --> 06:14.760
Yeah, that's how it works. You just read it like you would a nice book. Yeah. Oh

06:16.760 --> 06:18.760
I need something else to make me feel better

06:18.760 --> 06:22.480
I need something nice like wimpy you got a new piece of hardware

06:22.480 --> 06:26.600
I see you talking about there in the discord like that like the smallest little portable phone

06:26.600 --> 06:28.760
I think I've seen in a long time. Do you have it with you? I?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.880
Put it down, and I can't see it because it's so small

06:32.880 --> 06:39.440
What what is this little thing is this is this an Android device? You've got here the jelly Android device the jelly Pro

06:40.040 --> 06:44.300
Yep, and you have it next year to a pie zero to give us some scale in this picture Wow

06:44.640 --> 06:49.280
Yeah, so it's about the size of a pie zero so if you imagine a business card

06:49.520 --> 06:53.620
It's about the form factor of a business card, but a bit narrower nice

06:53.620 --> 06:57.180
And is it is it a performant device?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.420
It works very well. It's a quad-core

07:01.760 --> 07:08.120
Cortex a53 it's got two gigs of RAM. It's got 16 gigs of internal storage

07:08.880 --> 07:10.880
to SIM cards

07:11.240 --> 07:13.040
microSD card

07:13.040 --> 07:15.480
Wi-Fi with 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

07:16.360 --> 07:21.780
And Bluetooth front and rear facing cameras a torch and FM radio

07:21.780 --> 07:24.700
How did you get this is this is not even shipping yet? I?

07:25.300 --> 07:32.220
Backed it. Oh wow, so they're so they're really on top of it there. That's great. This looks so cool

07:32.220 --> 07:37.060
It's it's a a really nifty device. I'm

07:37.620 --> 07:43.100
Very impressed with it. I have to say and I got mine with a few accessories and the accessories are extremely well made as well

07:43.100 --> 07:45.020
What kind of accessories?

07:45.020 --> 07:50.620
Well the reason I got this is because when I go out and do my walking and exercising or having a strapping a bloody great

07:50.620 --> 07:53.700
Big you know five and a half inch phone to your arm is a bit much

07:53.700 --> 07:58.100
This is why we and I were just talking about watches like this is almost a reason to get a watch these days

07:58.420 --> 07:59.700
So yeah

07:59.700 --> 08:05.860
I got this with a an armband a case with an armband and I'm gonna use this as my effectively my fitness tracker

08:06.220 --> 08:09.480
So I've got my fitness tracker and Spotify installed on it

08:09.480 --> 08:15.060
And this is what I'll go out and use for exercising so this thing is small enough to fit in a jeans

08:15.620 --> 08:17.100
watch pocket

08:17.100 --> 08:21.740
Yes, it's really small and it has to sim and an SD slot. Yep. Wow

08:23.260 --> 08:24.940
Holy smokes

08:24.940 --> 08:26.460
What's this thing called?

08:26.460 --> 08:32.100
It's the my ones the jelly Pro and then there's the the smaller that well, it's not physically smaller

08:32.100 --> 08:37.300
But there's a lower a lower spec version just called the jelly. Is it USB C?

08:38.300 --> 08:44.460
No, it's micro USB. Okay, so almost perfect does have a headphone jack though. So it does have a headphone jack

08:44.460 --> 08:48.260
There's something for that luxury. This thing looks so neat

08:48.860 --> 08:55.820
It's it's actually very good. I mean, um, I'm genuinely surprised at how good it is

08:55.820 --> 09:02.100
What about reading on that screen like the Twitter feed or a news article? Is it is it just painfully? No, it's it's perfect

09:02.100 --> 09:07.900
It's perfectly usable. I mean you can imagine how big you know watch screens are and this is about three times the size of a watch

09:07.900 --> 09:09.180
screen

09:09.180 --> 09:15.260
It's quite low resolution, but it's it's remarkably good. I mean as a small device, obviously, you know

09:15.260 --> 09:22.160
You're not going to be typing long messages into it, but you can overcome that using the you know, the voice input. So

09:23.500 --> 09:27.820
I'm not very good at using voice but on this device you kind of use it by default for everything

09:28.460 --> 09:31.980
Surprise, it's just it's very very good. It's a really nifty little device

09:32.100 --> 09:37.540
I'm not sure how long I'm gonna hold on to it because my daughter's seen it and she quickly worked out

09:37.540 --> 09:43.860
This is sort of exactly the right size. Yeah. Yeah, my son would love this too. Yeah

09:43.860 --> 09:46.880
It's and also they're not expensive either. I think I

09:47.540 --> 09:53.820
There are about 120 bucks. Yeah. Yeah, they have some early birds that are still available for under $100 even

09:54.300 --> 09:59.060
Yeah, so, you know for a phone for a child that you just want them to you know

09:59.060 --> 10:05.240
Be able to make calls and get in touch and not worry, you know, if the phone gets ruined. It's it's quite a nice device

10:05.240 --> 10:07.240
Yeah, that is

10:07.440 --> 10:13.720
Hmm. Hmm. And with the dual SIM when you come over to the States into into New York you could in theory

10:14.600 --> 10:19.680
Put a ting sim in there and just pay for what you use while you're here. Yeah, I feel like that

10:19.680 --> 10:24.720
You know, this is totally totally spontaneous, but I'm gonna mention that go to go to linux.ting.com

10:24.720 --> 10:26.720
Just do that. Just do it right now

10:26.720 --> 10:27.360
You know

10:27.360 --> 10:31.480
Seriously when you come to the States and anybody else that's coming to the States that wants to be able to use their phone

10:31.480 --> 10:34.360
And doesn't want to get totally just unless you have some amazing plan

10:34.360 --> 10:36.920
Go to linux.ting.com when you're coming

10:36.920 --> 10:41.400
I hear from the audience that they do this because one of the things people always give us feedback on is well ting is a

10:41.400 --> 10:42.640
US only

10:42.640 --> 10:48.080
Opportunity so I can't get outside the US but when you travel here Alan Alan has done this

10:48.080 --> 10:51.660
This is this is something that I really think I wish I could do

10:51.660 --> 10:53.780
I wish I could do the opposite of this when I leave the States

10:54.400 --> 10:59.200
Linux dot ting comm it's a really great simple way to get easy pay for what you use wireless

10:59.720 --> 11:03.960
You just pay for the minutes you use and the megabytes you use while you're here and there's no contract

11:03.960 --> 11:06.680
No early termination fee you can log into the website and turn off the line

11:06.680 --> 11:12.040
It's really nice pay for what you use nationwide coverage CDMA and GSM with a great dashboard

11:12.040 --> 11:15.480
That's I'm gonna do like a quicker one because I didn't plan to do the ting read there

11:15.480 --> 11:19.040
but then when I see that device, it's so it's so perfect because

11:19.800 --> 11:24.960
You can buy this thing for a hundred bucks 140 bucks. You can put a ting sim in there

11:24.960 --> 11:30.440
I wonder if you could switch between CDMA and GSM live too. Oh, that would be slick. Hmm

11:30.440 --> 11:35.080
Well, that's really really cool wimpy and I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on it later

11:35.080 --> 11:38.400
Have you tried like the built-in speaker? How's the sound on like for podcasts?

11:39.080 --> 11:45.120
It's good enough. I mean, it's it's just it's for what it cost and its size

11:45.680 --> 11:51.280
It's a pretty remarkable little gadget. I am I am very very happy with it. Nice

11:52.560 --> 11:54.200
Yeah, I'm

11:54.200 --> 11:57.120
Surprised surprised and impressed by just how good it is

11:57.120 --> 12:02.080
I was just reading an email on here just to answer your question. Yeah, perfectly read

12:02.080 --> 12:06.600
I assume you put telegram on there telegram performs. Okay, I haven't put telegram

12:06.600 --> 12:12.280
I've kept it just to the things because there's only two gigs of RAM. I've just decided to keep it to the minimal

12:14.400 --> 12:18.840
Exercising yeah, but I was thinking I I did put a 32 gig

12:19.760 --> 12:22.960
microSD card in it and used the option to

12:22.960 --> 12:29.640
Merge that with the internal storage. So it's now got about 40 gigs of internal storage available

12:29.640 --> 12:34.160
You know as it reports as a a single file system, so it's um, yeah, it's pretty great, really

12:34.160 --> 12:38.280
Yeah, I say good on you to to keep the distractions off the exercise device

12:38.280 --> 12:43.000
That's pretty neat and it's you know cheaper than a Fitbit a decent Fitbit

12:43.440 --> 12:46.640
So that's pretty cool the jelly the jelly smartphone

12:46.640 --> 12:53.560
This jelly probe the smallest everybody's going big and this is the smallest and then you know like again just free free pluggy here

12:53.560 --> 12:59.240
But you put on the ting network. That's that's two things. I like this. I like small indie stuff. That's that's cool

12:59.240 --> 13:03.280
If you break it, it's not the end of the world. Mm-hmm. It makes me a bit jelly. Yeah

13:03.840 --> 13:09.840
I see what you did there. I see what you did there. So Linus has an idea. How about instead of hacking Linux?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.720
Okay, stay with me instead of hacking Linux

13:12.720 --> 13:18.440
You join and participate, huh? You mean hack online? Yeah, whoa

13:18.840 --> 13:24.760
Actually, you know I joke but this is legitimately an advantage that open-source software has so Linus is you may not be able to reach

13:24.760 --> 13:31.080
Absolute security but people that deploy default models are so much better off today. We're making obvious improvements

13:31.160 --> 13:33.160
He's talking by the way

13:33.280 --> 13:34.760
about the kernel

13:34.760 --> 13:41.440
Torvalds also noted that technical persons that have that have been impressed that have impressed him have been people who go after the Linux

13:41.440 --> 13:43.800
Code there are smart people doing bad things

13:46.400 --> 13:51.400
Yeah, yeah exactly I wish they were on our side and they could help us Torvalds said

13:51.800 --> 13:57.480
Where I want us to go is to get as many smart people as we can before they turn to the dark side

13:57.520 --> 14:04.080
We would improve security that way and get those who are interested in security to come to us before they attack us

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
That's all it would take Wes

14:07.040 --> 14:13.840
I mean you're right that that is an advantage of open-source is that like yeah, come join us come make it better

14:13.840 --> 14:18.560
Yeah, yeah, you know, maybe I mean you can still still exploit it on the side to make money

14:18.880 --> 14:24.440
He's not saying that you can't do that. Just also fix it upstream afterwards. We'll save that part for the Kali Linux

14:24.440 --> 14:29.840
Yes, right. That's right. Well, so gnome three two six lands tomorrow

14:29.840 --> 14:36.280
I think is it this Wednesday this coming coming up? Yeah tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, so if all goes well, which I believe it will

14:36.280 --> 14:37.480
Yeah

14:37.480 --> 14:40.000
By the time most people here in this show, it'll be old news, I guess

14:40.680 --> 14:45.760
Think about that guys. That's frightening right now. We're living in the pre gnome three two six world

14:45.760 --> 14:50.040
But the people listening they got the edge up on us. They're already in a gnome three two six world

14:51.160 --> 14:55.800
It's just if I just pac-man a little harder. Is it well I get it now. Can I do that?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.960
Yeah

14:59.040 --> 15:02.100
And there's some interesting benchmarks over at Veronica

15:02.100 --> 15:07.540
Michael larbel has posted benchmarks of gnome three dot two six on

15:08.460 --> 15:09.820
Wayland

15:09.820 --> 15:11.820
versus your x11 and

15:12.400 --> 15:15.820
notes at the Wayland desktop loads slightly faster I

15:17.180 --> 15:23.140
Like that, there's no real significant difference in memory and battery consumption between Wayland and X at this time on

15:23.140 --> 15:31.480
the benchmarks that use Wayland directly there's no significant difference between mutter and using with modern Wayland or mutter and X org and

15:32.240 --> 15:35.000
On benchmarks that were forced to use X Wayland

15:35.840 --> 15:43.000
There's about a five frame per second loss using X Wayland versus straight X org. Hmm

15:43.880 --> 15:48.160
But what struck me about this? This is my summation of reading his article. What struck me about this is

15:48.160 --> 15:54.400
That it wasn't a huge penalty to use Wayland that it wasn't a dramatic issue to use Wayland

15:54.400 --> 15:57.440
like we that Wayland is essentially at

15:58.000 --> 16:03.040
Competitiveness with X org right now. Don't you think that's kind of don't I don't beer we then to me?

16:03.040 --> 16:08.360
That seems pretty remarkable. Actually, I would have figured it would have either been way behind or way ahead

16:09.120 --> 16:12.760
Yeah, right. I mean this it isn't in performance

16:12.760 --> 16:17.640
This is what these benchmarks are talking about like it doesn't talk about the fact that it's missing a ton of features, right?

16:17.640 --> 16:22.000
It's just frame rate low desktop time. Yeah, I guess I expected Wayland

16:22.000 --> 16:26.920
I thought we'd be palin a Wayland price for sure. We'd be disappointed that it's not a lot faster

16:27.160 --> 16:34.480
Well, that's what the Internet's taken away from this the the average internet comment reads like see I told you X works fine

16:35.000 --> 16:39.360
That's always fine. We don't need anything else. There's this guy. He's flying around an airplane outside the studio right now

16:39.360 --> 16:44.360
He's running excellent. He has a big banner says X org is fine. Yeah. Yeah, that's that is that is what's happening right now

16:44.360 --> 16:49.040
And I take I take from this at least that part of the transition this

16:49.360 --> 16:54.440
Singular isolated part of the transition to Wayland. Hopefully won't suck too bad. That's what I took from it

16:55.160 --> 17:00.520
No, I'm three dot two six gonna be in that there Ubuntu too. I believe gonna be there then that's it is

17:01.560 --> 17:06.160
Gonna know there's a there is a there's a negative side to 326 though

17:06.800 --> 17:11.480
Removal of the API for the system icon. Yes, we talked we talked about it a little bit

17:11.480 --> 17:17.480
And it's worth touching on because I don't really understand what I'm gonna do other than load the top icons extension

17:17.480 --> 17:19.120
It's like they've forced my hand

17:19.120 --> 17:25.640
There's actually like a weird situation where the top icons extension currently works now and will not work in the future

17:28.200 --> 17:34.080
So they pointed out that you know in the in the post they're like, well if you're going to continue using top icon stuff

17:34.080 --> 17:34.800
That that'll be available

17:34.800 --> 17:42.360
Yeah, but they didn't point out in the comments that in the blog post that GTK for removes the support for what top icons

17:42.360 --> 17:43.800
uses oh

17:43.800 --> 17:49.700
So that it's not even gonna be possible to use type icons. It's going to be deprecated automatically. This is why I'm switching a unity

17:50.160 --> 17:52.160
well, there's there's actually a

17:52.680 --> 17:57.680
One to notice that and saw that that's that's going to be a going away. There is a different

17:57.680 --> 18:05.280
Extension called case status notifier app indicator or something like that. It's it's really long. It's hot. Yeah, they

18:05.840 --> 18:11.680
They forked that and are using that because it doesn't depend on the same API that top icons uses

18:11.680 --> 18:17.560
That's why the new Ubuntu version has that so in theory if you in the future

18:17.560 --> 18:20.920
You could use that extension instead of hot top icons. Okay, I

18:22.640 --> 18:25.720
Look at I'm looking at mine right now and I see Spotify

18:25.720 --> 18:32.040
I see Dropbox and I see Skype and I see mumble and I think out of all of those the only one that has any chance

18:32.200 --> 18:35.240
Of updating you with any reasonable amount of time is mumble. Mm-hmm

18:36.400 --> 18:41.600
Dropbox isn't gonna give two shits. Are they is what do you know anything about that rotten is is is this uh, I

18:42.400 --> 18:47.400
Don't think mumble is gonna carry that I don't honestly either but if any of them was going to right, I mean, yeah

18:47.400 --> 18:50.520
They're the best likelihood. Yes, I I think that

18:51.480 --> 18:53.000
it's it's

18:53.000 --> 19:00.440
It's because they're their gnome is looking at it as if because they don't like something they think something is antiquated

19:00.440 --> 19:07.640
That means everybody else should just follow suit. Whereas, you know the platform people switch from have this incredibly

19:08.520 --> 19:09.720
No

19:09.720 --> 19:18.120
Long ingrained. Yeah, they're expecting this type of thing to exist and then you just remove it regardless of what people think like

19:18.120 --> 19:24.840
Yeah, yeah, that's problematic at best. This is this is my issue now that is tempered by the fact that

19:25.320 --> 19:32.680
Gnome 326 also has the new settings pain. Oh, yeah new redesign and excited for that more like

19:34.360 --> 19:37.640
Mac OS 6 I know if you guys remember Mac OS 6 from the 80s

19:37.640 --> 19:42.320
But it's more like that control panel and it's way better what what is old is new again. Yeah

19:42.320 --> 19:44.280
That's really is but that is how computers work

19:44.280 --> 19:49.560
It's way easier for my brain to process a list on the side and then I click it and then the you it's gonna be

19:49.560 --> 19:51.560
More like gnome tweak, but it looks way better

19:51.960 --> 19:53.400
and um

19:53.400 --> 19:57.880
That's in 326. So like 326 is like a mixed bag for me because it's a good release

19:58.280 --> 20:03.240
It's got updates to epiphany. It's got updates to gnome photos, which I just like for just basic photo viewing

20:03.960 --> 20:09.480
But it's got this like like producer. Michael was just talking about this removal of the system tray icon support

20:09.480 --> 20:15.880
Which every time we go through this is a huge pain in my arse and it's a constant source of questions

20:16.360 --> 20:19.480
And it's probably like one of the top five extensions people use in the first

20:20.920 --> 20:26.360
Yeah, I got all I got all worked up. I think was it last week about the gnome project recommending people install an extension

20:26.760 --> 20:32.840
Yeah, no, I think are yeah, that's just they also they recommend other things too for extensions because they don't really want they don't see

20:33.400 --> 20:35.560
So little things they want to do is default

20:35.560 --> 20:42.120
Default it's uh, it's problematic. But if if they were managing the extensions that'd be one thing

20:42.360 --> 20:48.200
But they just you know letting the community do it. What if someone what if they remove some api like they're doing for this?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.320
What if they?

20:49.320 --> 20:55.960
Just annoy someone enough where they just give up and stop maintaining them. Like I mean you're you're exactly you're setting it setting it up to fail

20:57.320 --> 20:59.480
Do you uh when you hear stuff like this?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.280
Do you think boy if I wasn't already using plasma as my main desktop i'd switch

21:04.280 --> 21:07.960
Because it makes me think I got to be honest ron. It makes me think just screw this

21:08.040 --> 21:13.400
i'm, just going to go use the plasma desktop and make it work because I was a gnome maintainer for extensions

21:13.960 --> 21:20.360
At one point and I quit because they the example I gave people abandoning it is because I was one of them

21:20.440 --> 21:23.640
yeah, I maintained 10 10 extensions and

21:24.280 --> 21:31.000
Every single time there was a new update all of them broke and and there was nothing wrong with my extensions

21:31.000 --> 21:36.200
Like they they all worked. I even adopted other extensions from other people and like fix them

21:36.760 --> 21:42.040
And most of the time like the auto the audio input switcher like there was nothing wrong with it

21:42.040 --> 21:45.480
It worked perfectly fine. The only thing it needed was to have a version update

21:46.040 --> 21:48.040
so

21:48.280 --> 21:50.040
Like the fact that that's like, you know

21:50.040 --> 21:54.440
Not only you're not going to make a system where when it updates it's going to like check to see if it works and then

21:54.520 --> 21:58.440
Say if it works or not and give you like a flag where you have to update it or something

21:58.440 --> 22:02.920
Update it or something. It's just we're going to assume it's automatically broken and just break it

22:03.560 --> 22:09.480
So like at that point where I had to update 10 and then I started getting requests from people updating stuff

22:10.120 --> 22:12.120
and then I was like, you know, I

22:12.280 --> 22:17.080
After about I think I tend like the most I ever had was like 16 at one release and I was like i'm i'm done

22:17.160 --> 22:24.040
I don't i'm not trying to fix this right? Yep. And so here's where i'm at right now and um

22:24.040 --> 22:29.080
Um, i'm kind of waiting to see but I feel like maybe as gnome grows

22:29.400 --> 22:33.960
And as the as they move the platform forward and as they make decisions that they feel are the best that

22:34.440 --> 22:36.440
the decisions to make for them, uh

22:37.880 --> 22:41.320
Maybe we are moving into a world where if you're going to use the gnome desktop

22:41.720 --> 22:48.200
You need a high level curator like canonical to come along or like fedora to come along and

22:49.240 --> 22:53.080
Really sort of think about this stuff think about how to do the doc extension

22:53.080 --> 22:57.240
Think about the system tray icon notification problem. Think about the theming issues

22:57.720 --> 23:01.080
Uh, think about all of the things around that and implement it correctly

23:01.320 --> 23:05.880
and that's really the only way to have a usable workhorse gnome desktop perhaps and

23:06.760 --> 23:11.720
And rolling it yourself on a gentoo or an arch which we'll get to here in a moment. Um,

23:12.680 --> 23:16.360
You know is is it's two hacked together unless you really follow this stuff

23:16.680 --> 23:19.320
Like if you listen to every episode of this show, you could probably make it work

23:19.320 --> 23:25.080
So yeah, I would agree with that except I would point out that fedora is on the same side as gnome as far as like

23:25.160 --> 23:28.280
The top icons and stuff like that. They made a blog post about yeah

23:28.520 --> 23:30.520
it was hilarious because they made a blog post about like

23:30.920 --> 23:35.800
And these developers are not getting uh are not updating their application. What's wrong with all these developers?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.600
They're not following the whims of the gnome team. What's wrong with them?

23:39.560 --> 23:42.440
And I mean I do feel the alter of like they want to be able to update but

23:42.760 --> 23:45.400
When you are shipping things that people use in a stable way

23:45.400 --> 23:50.360
You have to do that in a non-breaking way or at least try especially hard not to like producer michael's saying

23:50.360 --> 23:54.760
Especially when it's something that is a is like a paradigm of how you interact with your desktop. Yes

23:55.800 --> 24:01.800
The the question then becomes for me is do I really want to be using a desktop where the developers?

24:02.360 --> 24:07.720
Can't do that work themselves and you have to have an additional maintainer to make the desktop good. Well, at least it can be done

24:08.520 --> 24:11.960
You know at least you can have somebody create their quote-unquote saying defaults

24:11.960 --> 24:18.120
Yeah, maybe there's a there's another issue of what about you know, how like for a long time gnome has been like

24:18.680 --> 24:22.280
I don't know like the powerhouse as far as like what de's are based on

24:22.760 --> 24:24.840
but if you look at like budgie where it was

24:25.880 --> 24:30.840
Um, there's they did announce that they're going to switch to cute and other applications other things that are switching to cute already

24:30.840 --> 24:34.760
Like LXQT, yeah, but like if you look at the code of budgie

24:34.920 --> 24:39.960
There's some weirdness in there like where they actually have to pretend to be gnome in certain cases. Yep

24:39.960 --> 24:44.040
It's like so like it when you said that they were making decisions that worked best for them

24:44.040 --> 24:47.880
It's like I think that's like the detriment to them. Yeah, maybe you know

24:47.880 --> 24:52.440
They're trying to have a vision and they're trying to have a philosophy. And so part of this

24:52.980 --> 24:55.880
Notification tray icons thing is that philosophy in their world?

24:56.520 --> 24:58.680
The user never had any control

24:59.480 --> 25:04.840
You installed that son of a bitch application and that sucker put that tray icon down there. You never asked for that

25:04.920 --> 25:08.520
You never asked for that stupid notification or that spinning sync icon

25:08.520 --> 25:10.680
Spinning sync icon and you you know

25:10.680 --> 25:14.600
You really have no other way to interact with the application other than guess what that tray icon?

25:14.840 --> 25:17.880
And so gnome wants to give the power back to the user

25:18.120 --> 25:22.520
It's a philosophy and it's one that I can I can I can understand and appreciate

25:22.920 --> 25:27.240
But there's a there is a practical aspect to this and it feels like they're kind of far away

25:27.320 --> 25:33.560
Separated from like the day-to-day support concerns of someone using that right? Whereas a bunch who knows how to do that

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
That's a great point. So let's pause right there because that's

25:36.040 --> 25:39.960
Damn, you just nailed it. Um, because I want to talk about what they're doing and uh,

25:41.080 --> 25:47.880
Specifically there's a new post, uh about uh, uh gnome shell in ubuntu 1710

25:48.120 --> 25:52.120
I'm trying to trying i'm trying to be like cautious about what I say because I don't want to give too much away because I

25:52.120 --> 25:56.360
Really want us to roll into it. So let me start by saying thanks to linux academy for sponsoring this here show

25:56.600 --> 26:00.840
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. Thanks to you guys for going there and

26:00.840 --> 26:06.040
And letting linux academy know hey on the unplugged program. I heard about you

26:06.280 --> 26:11.480
I came here you have that in your log now, you know that they sent me and as a thank you

26:11.480 --> 26:15.720
They'll give you a seven-day free trial linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. So why am I sending you there?

26:16.520 --> 26:18.520
Well, it's in the name linux academy

26:18.520 --> 26:25.320
It's a platform to teach you everything about linux created by linux enthusiasts linux professionals people that really love linux and want to spread it

26:25.560 --> 26:27.560
people that honestly I think

26:27.560 --> 26:34.680
Have the intention of getting more users to linux and I really could connect with that because anthony the guy that founded linux academy

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
I talked with him for ages before he was

26:37.080 --> 26:42.200
An advertiser before he launched the platform just talking about how to get linux out into the hands of more people

26:42.440 --> 26:44.760
So when they launched I was so excited

26:45.320 --> 26:48.600
To be one of their launch partners to have a sponsorship here

26:48.840 --> 26:51.880
I remember talking to anthony while they were building the virtualization system

26:51.880 --> 26:59.400
That'll spin up servers on demand that match the courseware you've chosen for debian or redhat or ubuntu. They'll also do aws azure

26:59.640 --> 27:01.640
Open stack courseware. They're really high level stuff

27:01.880 --> 27:08.120
They'll help you focus on certifications if you need to go that route offline study is no problem at all it again

27:08.200 --> 27:10.200
It's a real platform for this kind of stuff

27:10.520 --> 27:16.360
It's the linux academy new to the world of linux azure and aws open stack and devops

27:16.360 --> 27:22.440
A sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed meet linux academy an online

27:47.900 --> 27:49.580
Slash unplugged

27:49.580 --> 27:55.100
so we have another post from didrocks and we've been linking to these for quite a while in the show notes and

27:55.500 --> 28:03.260
I love this. It's the it's like a blog journey to 1710 and the decisions that they're making and this week we talk about gdm

28:04.200 --> 28:06.200
collaboration and theming

28:06.200 --> 28:13.080
Now i'm covering this for many reasons because uh, it's it's historical to watch canonical make the switch here on the show

28:13.240 --> 28:15.240
Can't believe we're documenting this

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
Think about that for a second

28:19.080 --> 28:20.600
Wow

28:20.600 --> 28:24.280
Wow, it's really hitting me like right now as i'm talking to you guys. It's really hitting me that

28:25.240 --> 28:27.240
I watched I have been podcasting

28:28.440 --> 28:30.840
I have been podcasting since ubuntu was created

28:32.200 --> 28:33.880
I podcasted

28:33.880 --> 28:39.640
The announcement of unity wow brian lunduke and I covered it at linux fest that because it was news then

28:40.680 --> 28:43.960
I remember the episode that we covered the announcement of unity

28:45.080 --> 28:47.240
I remember watching the um

28:48.360 --> 28:53.640
Netbook edition of ubuntu. I remember watching that be born and unity inspired from that

28:55.800 --> 28:57.160
Gnome 3

28:57.160 --> 29:01.320
All of it i've watched all of it and now i'm watching them transition back to ubuntu

29:01.320 --> 29:04.840
No, and the weight of that is really hitting me as we record this episode right now

29:04.920 --> 29:10.600
Like I am I i've really watched the transition here and I got to tell you watching them re-land back into gnome

29:11.160 --> 29:12.360
um

29:12.360 --> 29:16.520
If if you had asked me to make the most optimistic prediction of how they would handle this

29:16.840 --> 29:23.240
I wouldn't have gotten it this close. I I couldn't have I couldn't have asked for a better re-landing into the gnome world

29:23.480 --> 29:25.880
So this week we're talking about gdm. It turns out gdm

29:25.880 --> 29:33.480
The gnome display manager that login screen that ugly login screen that runs in the background and takes up a ton of memory

29:33.560 --> 29:35.080
It's a really a son of a bitch

29:35.080 --> 29:40.520
Uh, it's also hard to theme and it's one of the areas where the gnome developers have been particularly protective of

29:40.840 --> 29:43.560
Because if you're having any kind of problem in your gnome session

29:43.720 --> 29:46.840
They don't want gdm to be affected because you got to get back to your login screen

29:46.920 --> 29:51.320
Right so you can choose like it keeps everything running in that sense. So one of the ways that they have

29:51.320 --> 29:56.300
Accomplished that the gnome team is they have hard coded the theme for gdm

29:56.380 --> 30:00.060
So that way it just uses something simple and it always works

30:00.700 --> 30:01.820
and it's

30:01.820 --> 30:03.820
rock-solid regardless of whatever

30:04.300 --> 30:10.700
Crazy lunatic theme you've loaded in your gnome shell your gdm session rock-solid add wadia, buddy

30:11.820 --> 30:13.500
Unless you don't want that

30:13.500 --> 30:19.340
Which pretty much no distro maker wants they want to re-theme gdm to make it match the login

30:19.340 --> 30:24.240
Of course, and they want the login. I mean the desktop sessions the login session matches the desktop session. It's a big kumbaya

30:26.700 --> 30:32.380
And it's something that i've noticed some people are commenting in the early betas of ubuntu about already the gdm theme here and there

30:32.540 --> 30:35.180
Um, and it's something that the poppa west folks have been working on

30:36.540 --> 30:40.540
And this is where we end up today this little problem

30:41.500 --> 30:46.380
The guys over at system guys and gals over at system 76. They want to solve the problem of an ugly gdm

30:46.380 --> 30:52.140
And canonical also has a problem. They want to solve they want to be able to apply their ubuntu style

30:52.700 --> 30:56.380
Without stepping all over the toes of anybody that might be deriving off of ubuntu

30:56.940 --> 30:59.660
And they'd like to do it in a way that is maintainable and upstreamable

31:00.940 --> 31:04.780
And uh, I believe these two things are not 100 aligned, but they're pretty close

31:05.180 --> 31:10.460
So it sounds like over the last couple of weeks canonical worked with system 76

31:10.460 --> 31:16.780
Worked with jeremy over at system 76. Wow, and together they came up with a way to sort of fix this problem to sort of

31:16.860 --> 31:21.020
Apply a patch to gdm that would work upstreams that people could change the theming

31:22.460 --> 31:27.900
Now I don't really know I don't really you know when I start to gloss over when you start talking about applying css themes to gdm

31:30.300 --> 31:34.940
But I do see that this is a wider problem that we've been running into for a while and

31:36.220 --> 31:39.260
It's nice to see a proposed solution. Nothing's going to happen. Nothing's going to happen

31:39.260 --> 31:41.820
Proposed solution. Nothing's really been accepted upstream yet

31:43.180 --> 31:44.700
but uh

31:44.700 --> 31:49.980
I I feel like there might be there might be a a larger ramification larger impact here, which i'll get to in a moment, but

31:50.380 --> 31:51.340
uh

31:51.340 --> 31:55.820
wimpy if your ears are burning because i've missed or i've gotten something wrong if you want to jump in with any corrections at

31:55.820 --> 31:57.820
This point probably a good chance before I keep going

31:58.220 --> 32:02.860
Well, you have me a disadvantage actually because i've i've been away. Oh, yeah for a while

32:03.340 --> 32:07.580
So, um, I haven't had the chance to catch up with my colleagues and so let me wrap this real quick

32:07.580 --> 32:13.580
And let's talk about that. So, uh, uh short the short version of this is is that diddler and uh,

32:14.860 --> 32:22.540
And jeremy are working together to come up with an upstreamable version where patches can be applied where people won't be stepping on each other's toes

32:23.100 --> 32:28.220
Uh, I I will save my commentary for now on how this could be our first example of pop os

32:28.680 --> 32:34.780
Development colliding with the wider ubuntu development. I'll save that for future commentary because i'd love to hear about

32:34.780 --> 32:38.940
Wimpy's trip to perry. He just got yeah. Yeah, I saw some I saw some

32:39.580 --> 32:43.500
Once in a lifetime selfies come across wimpy's twitter feed over the last week

32:44.780 --> 32:48.540
I've got to go find those because you know, whenever you can get the eiffel tower in your selfie

32:48.620 --> 32:52.220
That's a that is a rather good selfie. So where were you wimpy?

32:52.940 --> 32:58.700
Uh, well, we were in paris so and we were at uh ubucon europe

32:59.100 --> 33:02.140
Uh, which was being hosted by the french

33:03.020 --> 33:04.540
loco

33:04.540 --> 33:07.340
At a massive museum, uh in paris

33:07.980 --> 33:09.980
That is too cool. That sounds awesome

33:10.220 --> 33:16.380
Ubucon ubucon boy all these conferences you got new york coming up soon. You got paris. You are a world traveler wimpy

33:17.020 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, so ubucon is an entirely community

33:20.060 --> 33:22.620
Um created event and they happen

33:23.340 --> 33:25.340
all over the world and different

33:25.820 --> 33:31.900
Locos and lugs and what have you organized these events around the world. So when the ubucon happens in

33:31.900 --> 33:33.900
uh, california, it's usually

33:34.760 --> 33:37.200
Coinciding with scale and happening at the same

33:38.160 --> 33:41.360
Venue, um, you know a day or so beforehand. Yeah

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
Uh, but this one's just a standalone

33:45.280 --> 33:47.280
This was um

33:47.280 --> 33:50.640
Yeah, it was um, it was a four day four day event

33:50.960 --> 33:52.080
um

33:52.080 --> 33:56.640
so it started when it was a a three day event for the ubucon, but there was um

33:56.640 --> 34:03.540
Um, I sort of a get together the day before it started with sort of the um, the core organizers

34:04.480 --> 34:06.320
um to come together

34:06.320 --> 34:09.520
Uh and sort of, you know, make sure they were all set and ready to go

34:10.080 --> 34:16.000
Uh, and we were fortunate enough to be there and catch up with them that evening and some of the early arrivers

34:16.640 --> 34:23.360
uh, some of you know our friends from the ubuntu community from around europe and it's you know, great to catch up and socialize so

34:23.360 --> 34:26.000
you know during the day it's um,

34:26.960 --> 34:30.640
tracks of talks and workshops and um

34:31.920 --> 34:37.440
Uh, there's even a gaming room set up, you know with pcs with games running and all the rest of it

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
um and rooms with

34:40.400 --> 34:46.560
All the audio equipment. So, um the various podcasters can go and record, you know live podcasts and what have you

34:46.560 --> 34:52.960
So there's you did right? Yeah, so poppy and I participated in two podcasts whilst we were there

34:56.080 --> 35:02.560
We um, we both appeared on the on the spanish podcast and then we were part of

35:03.200 --> 35:06.160
a podcasting panel so we had um

35:07.280 --> 35:12.160
Uh the guys from lubuntu podcast in france poppy and I from ubuntu podcast

35:12.160 --> 35:18.320
I don't know the name but the I think it's um ubuntu podcast portugal and then ubuntu fun

35:18.560 --> 35:20.560
so there were six or seven of us

35:21.200 --> 35:23.200
and sort of um

35:23.200 --> 35:28.640
Scripted by the german guys, you know, we had some show notes and then very much ad hoc

35:29.120 --> 35:34.240
In front of um a live audience. That sounds like a lot of fun. It's always good fun. Yeah

35:34.320 --> 35:38.560
That's some fun. I uh, so I was inspired by a slide that uh

35:38.560 --> 35:44.960
It was from a talk that I think dustin kirkland was giving at ubicon where he listed like the top 10 features

35:45.280 --> 35:48.340
Uh or the top 10 new features for ubuntu 1710

35:49.040 --> 35:52.080
And I wanted to take that list. I want to I want to put it in text somewhere

35:52.160 --> 35:55.520
So I want to I actually kind of like to get your your take on it

35:55.520 --> 35:59.520
But I expanded on the list and I actually think is I already have more features to add to it

35:59.520 --> 36:01.940
But let me know if i'm missing anything. So 1710

36:03.040 --> 36:06.160
Um, and I I want to I want to preface before I say this i'm

36:06.160 --> 36:11.280
I don't have any skin in the game. Uh right now I run solace the machine to my left

36:12.000 --> 36:12.880
runs

36:12.880 --> 36:17.440
Arch the machine the next machine to my left runs arch. What are you running right there to my right?

36:17.520 --> 36:22.160
This is running arch. Okay, so we have and then we have two arch systems upstairs

36:22.320 --> 36:24.960
We have an arch server here and a proxmox server

36:25.280 --> 36:30.240
The only ubuntu system in the jupyter broadcasting studio is the one running the mumble machine that noah installed

36:30.800 --> 36:34.960
So I don't I don't have like an agenda here. I don't have any there's nobody paying me to say this

36:34.960 --> 36:37.440
No agenda, but i'm going to say that I will say this

36:38.080 --> 36:39.440
um

36:39.440 --> 36:44.080
I would ask both of you and anyone in the mumble room to tell me what what distribution release

36:44.800 --> 36:48.240
Has ever had a feature list like this and I haven't even added all of them yet

36:48.320 --> 36:52.320
This is what I have right now the top 14 new features for ubuntu 1710

36:53.040 --> 36:55.360
And gnome replaces unity number one, obviously

36:56.400 --> 36:59.360
Tons of bluetooth improvements a thousand bug fixes a new blue z stack

36:59.920 --> 37:01.200
number three

37:01.200 --> 37:05.600
Switch to lib input number four improved 4k multi-monitor and scaling

37:06.320 --> 37:13.600
Technology support we've talked about that high dpi improvements number five upgraded to network manager 1.8 much improvement big improvement

37:13.600 --> 37:18.000
There number six new sub sub equity equity, whatever. It's the zoo server installer

37:18.480 --> 37:24.080
Number seven is the minimal images 36 megabyte 20 smaller images huge. That's a huge that's a huge savings

37:24.720 --> 37:28.640
Number eight finally for fuck's sake auto remove of old kernels from slash boot

37:28.640 --> 37:34.960
Number nine extended for encryption with fs encrypt number 10 improved cuda and cpu acceleration support

37:35.280 --> 37:41.120
And this one i'm i'm feeling like could almost be two but i'm including hardware accelerated codecs in that one

37:42.240 --> 37:44.240
Hardware accelerated codecs

37:44.320 --> 37:47.120
I'm going to say it one more time hardware accelerated codecs. Just going to mention that

37:47.680 --> 37:53.280
Uh new doc that we've talked about with the upstream collaboration the gschema support for uh

37:53.280 --> 38:00.320
Elegantly handling settings changes and disappearing when you turn on dash to dock and now with the status icon support, which is great

38:01.920 --> 38:07.920
Net plan by default switching from if config is number 12 number 13 is gcc7 out of the box

38:08.960 --> 38:12.960
And number 14 is wayland by default and number 15

38:12.960 --> 38:16.240
Which I don't have on the list yet because it hasn't happened yet because all of these have happened

38:16.800 --> 38:19.440
All of these have happened what is about to happen?

38:19.440 --> 38:24.560
What is about to happen potentially is kernel 4.13 as well, which will be feature 15

38:24.640 --> 38:27.440
And i'll have a top 15 list for ubuntu 17 10

38:28.400 --> 38:33.600
Now I haven't seen anybody put a list together quite consecutively like dustin did now i've built off of dustin's list here

38:35.040 --> 38:38.960
But I challenge you to tell me one other release of any linux distro

38:39.440 --> 38:44.960
Ever since you've been following linux that has been this packed full of features and this big of a change

38:44.960 --> 38:51.840
Hmm chris, I can't think of one dude. I can't either. Like this is this is big. This is really big

38:52.640 --> 38:55.680
And this is this is in the middle of a company restructuring

38:56.640 --> 38:58.640
Reorganizing of the company

38:58.720 --> 39:03.840
Like there are some companies where that would put them on their back heels for a year just to sort that shit out

39:06.880 --> 39:13.360
Well, I gotta be honest chris I have been through distro after distro lfs as you know, uh, gen 2

39:13.360 --> 39:15.840
Arch the whole nine yards and I gotta say

39:16.480 --> 39:22.000
I'm more impressed with this new ubuntu spin than all of that. Yeah

39:22.960 --> 39:26.480
Yeah, it is and that's and I haven't even finished the list yet. No, you haven't

39:27.120 --> 39:27.760
You know

39:27.760 --> 39:33.440
I can think of things with individual components like maybe system d switch or other things that were that were of similar scale

39:33.440 --> 39:34.800
but these is a

39:34.800 --> 39:40.800
It's a far-ranging set of changes. This isn't even the lts like if all this stuff is decent in 17 10

39:40.800 --> 39:45.440
All this stuff just has to be even decent in 1804 for the lts to be great

39:46.000 --> 39:50.240
Like yeah, but that's that's exactly the fact. I have to test it for the lts

39:50.560 --> 39:54.080
I mean you can't introduce these to the lts. You have to test them first

39:54.320 --> 40:00.160
It's the way to do it though. It is it's a classic ubuntu style development approach. It's a tried and true method

40:00.960 --> 40:04.240
So if I can just add to to that list, yeah

40:04.960 --> 40:06.000
the

40:06.000 --> 40:11.600
Um dustin gave a couple of presentations whilst he was at ubicom

40:12.080 --> 40:17.520
Um, and the slide that you've used there was from he was doing the closing keynote

40:17.600 --> 40:22.000
So he did the the keynote that that that that wrapped up the event

40:23.120 --> 40:24.240
and

40:24.240 --> 40:26.240
What he was presenting

40:26.240 --> 40:33.520
was all of the feedback that had been captured from those various user surveys that

40:33.520 --> 40:35.520
That he's been running

40:36.400 --> 40:41.620
Through hacker news and reddit and slash dot and omg ubuntu

40:42.720 --> 40:47.360
And all of those things that were on um, dustin's slide

40:48.080 --> 40:55.200
Were the top thing so they he did a whole load of natural language processing to actually figure out what people were asking for

40:55.760 --> 40:57.280
and basically

40:57.280 --> 41:01.680
Everything that was in dustin's slide were the top things that people were asking for

41:01.680 --> 41:05.280
And therefore they got addressed in this cycle

41:05.920 --> 41:11.280
So that was the the crux of his presentation in that your feedback is important and matters to us

41:11.840 --> 41:13.840
And here's us

41:13.900 --> 41:19.360
Actioning the things that are most important to you. I i'm not going to name names of other distros

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
There has been distro releases recently

41:22.560 --> 41:24.800
where legitimately the new wallpaper is

41:25.920 --> 41:29.360
Part of the release notes because that's like the the minimal amount of change

41:30.240 --> 41:31.360
um

41:31.360 --> 41:35.040
I I just I really am impressed. I am really impressed like when

41:35.600 --> 41:40.400
When when mark made his initial initial announcement, I just was having a conversation with somebody about this yesterday

41:41.360 --> 41:49.040
That's somebody being michael dominic when mark made his announcement that uh canonical was done with unity and that ubuntu would be shipping

41:49.120 --> 41:52.880
gnome, I think a lot of people walked away with the impression that it was sort of like a

41:54.000 --> 42:00.240
Wiping the hands. We're just gonna we're just gonna give you a stock gnome. We're not gonna bother with it and uh have at it

42:00.240 --> 42:06.320
That the desktop wasn't being focused anymore. Hope you enjoy your stock gnome. We're done and uh,

42:07.200 --> 42:09.200
I I just I

42:09.200 --> 42:15.120
I have a I have a loose appreciation from the outside of the amount of work that must have gone into this

42:15.360 --> 42:18.240
Which means it must have been 10 times the amount of work that i'm picturing

42:18.800 --> 42:24.880
So it was anything but that it was the opposite of what a lot of people were pontificating was the end of the ubuntu desktop

42:24.880 --> 42:30.800
It's uh, yes, and that's top 14 new features that like are worth like talking about how many of those are like server?

42:31.200 --> 42:34.800
Features, right? There's a lot of stuff here that shows like they they're they still care

42:34.800 --> 42:40.240
They are innovating on these things right and seeing this kind of feedback cycle and work that's exciting, too

42:40.400 --> 42:44.480
And one of the reasons i'm excited for kernel 413, which is on target, you know

42:44.480 --> 42:49.760
We it's not locked in yet, but it's on target for 1710 is it's got the baked in mainlined app armor support

42:50.560 --> 42:53.120
So it's like it's sort of like a

42:53.120 --> 42:56.720
It's like it's sort of like a coming of age in a way for app armor

42:57.040 --> 43:00.400
which snap confinement's based on which is the which is the

43:01.040 --> 43:04.320
mandatory access control horse that both susa and ubuntu have bet on

43:04.880 --> 43:07.680
And it's my preferred out of s between se linux and app armor

43:08.320 --> 43:12.560
Having worked with both of them production. I clearly understand app armor and se linux

43:12.640 --> 43:17.200
I just sort of funnel my way through and so if I had to implement one I would prefer to use app armor

43:17.200 --> 43:23.040
So talking about the kernel as of yesterday 413 is in the proposed pocket

43:24.400 --> 43:27.600
That's awesome. Yeah, that is I will update that list

43:27.600 --> 43:31.760
I can't I'm holding that as my 15th feature to add to the list because that's okay

43:31.840 --> 43:37.200
Well the one to add alongside network manager is in addition to network manager 1.8

43:37.200 --> 43:44.160
The captive portal stuff is enabled and fully working now and lots of people were making good use of that

43:44.160 --> 43:51.040
Um at ubu con because everything was behind a captive portal and it was kind of fun to see them all sort of

43:51.760 --> 43:57.040
Blinking and then grinning at the captive portal screen just popping up when they joined the wi-fi networks

43:57.200 --> 44:00.640
I have no idea what to expect network wise while i'm in new york

44:00.800 --> 44:05.920
Uh, we're trying to decide if if we should try to do user air from the hotel room while we're in new york

44:06.000 --> 44:08.640
So no one we're gonna be there should I think so?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.280
I but we just don't have we have no idea what the connectivity is gonna be

44:11.280 --> 44:16.240
You know, I wish there was a way like we need like a database. Mm-hmm has a captcha

44:16.320 --> 44:21.920
Has you know requires you use their dns like well all these like little qualifiers, you know, google has this database

44:21.920 --> 44:23.280
They just don't share it with us

44:23.280 --> 44:28.320
So getting that built in into network manager or is it is a part of network manager wimpy or is it a component?

44:28.400 --> 44:35.600
Alongside a network manager. I wasn't clear. Yeah, so there's there's two pieces to it. There's um a component in network manager that needs to be enabled

44:36.640 --> 44:40.480
um that actually does the um detection of

44:40.480 --> 44:44.880
Of um, you know your connectivity state and whether you're behind a captive portal or not

44:45.520 --> 44:47.680
um and that that emits, um

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
over dbus and then there's

44:51.200 --> 44:53.200
a component that's

44:53.660 --> 45:00.400
Hardwired to the gnome shell that then looks at that to determine what the network status is and when it

45:01.040 --> 45:04.160
Picks up the signal that you're behind a captive portal

45:04.160 --> 45:10.640
It fires open a web view and takes you to that captive portal brilliant. I really will appreciate that

45:10.640 --> 45:12.720
That's become very important recently in my life

45:13.280 --> 45:17.280
um now I got oh go ahead I will just say because

45:18.240 --> 45:21.680
Let's just get this out of the way because there are people that care about this stuff

45:22.400 --> 45:28.640
In order for that to work. It has to ping some known host in order to look for various status. Oh sure. Yep

45:28.960 --> 45:30.820
Okay, and that's connectivitycheck.abuntu.com

45:30.820 --> 45:32.500
abuntu.com

45:32.500 --> 45:37.940
In the privacy settings for abuntu 1710 is the option to disable

45:38.820 --> 45:43.060
That connectivity check so if you don't want it to leak, you know stuff

45:43.780 --> 45:49.140
Um, then you can just disable that and you will have no captive portal automatic detection

45:49.860 --> 45:53.540
And if you want to run like that an interesting feature I noticed in firefox

45:53.540 --> 45:56.980
Which I don't know when it cropped up, but i'm told fairly recently

45:56.980 --> 46:03.940
If you open firefox and it's behind a captive portal firefox detects that now and prompts you accordingly as well

46:04.340 --> 46:10.740
That's nice. That is really nice. That has been something that has kind of been wonky on some setups in the past and

46:11.540 --> 46:15.460
Really hurts inexperienced users. I think so. I have two more items now that you're here wimpy

46:15.460 --> 46:17.460
Just that I would love to chat with you about

46:18.020 --> 46:23.060
um i'd love to sort of back our way into 1710 matte edition of abuntu here because

46:23.300 --> 46:25.860
Um, I know that there is a big feature for me

46:25.860 --> 46:31.640
That uh, I loved when I was on the unity desktop that has made its way into abuntu matte 1710

46:32.260 --> 46:34.260
And I don't know if you saw the feedback

46:34.500 --> 46:37.300
I imagine you must get all kinds of different feedback for this stuff

46:37.540 --> 46:44.340
But one thing that I saw people talking about which seemed really misinformed was well now I have to drop matte because it's just

46:44.420 --> 46:50.900
Adding all of the bulk and cruft that modern desktops have and what i'm alluding to is pretty much full-on

46:51.220 --> 46:55.140
And correct me if i'm wrong full-fledged hud support like we had in unity 7

46:55.140 --> 46:57.140
Unity 7 in abuntu matte

46:57.700 --> 47:00.900
If you go with the mutiny theme you turn on hud support you turn on compiz

47:01.140 --> 47:06.580
You're getting really close to where you were with unity 7 and it's got certain people certain neck beards

47:07.780 --> 47:13.300
Upset and so I got this email from this guy who says that he's switching now to xfce

47:13.700 --> 47:15.620
Because matte is getting too bloated

47:15.620 --> 47:18.500
So I thought maybe if you explained a little bit of how hud works

47:18.820 --> 47:23.780
About how what what what talks to hud and how that all happens and maybe help people understand how it's not a bunch of bloat

47:23.780 --> 47:25.780
And tell people what the feature is

47:26.980 --> 47:31.220
Well, the feature is the ability to search the menus

47:31.300 --> 47:38.200
So, you know your file edit view tools help menus that you see in all of your applications

47:38.980 --> 47:43.380
It's the ability to search through those so you hit the alt key

47:44.020 --> 47:47.700
An overlay appears and you start typing to filter down

47:48.260 --> 47:51.940
What features of the menus you want to see you could type print for example?

47:51.940 --> 47:55.860
Instead of having to go grab your mouse go to file go down to print

47:55.940 --> 47:58.980
You could just keep your hands on the keyboard and type in print and that would come up

47:59.540 --> 48:07.700
Yeah, and it's particularly useful for applications that have lots of filters. So audio editors, um, you know the office suites and

48:08.240 --> 48:10.020
inkscape and

48:10.020 --> 48:17.220
Gimp, yeah, you know when when there are no convenient key bindings to complex filters. It's a great way to find them very quickly

48:17.220 --> 48:22.500
Now behind the scenes the way this all works is through um, gtk models

48:23.060 --> 48:27.380
model menu and some dbus services, um, and

48:28.340 --> 48:32.420
What's providing that dbus registrar is the new global menu?

48:33.380 --> 48:37.060
So the global menu provides that dbus registrar and then we also

48:37.860 --> 48:42.260
Load a gtk module which is called unity gtk module

48:43.860 --> 48:45.860
Which is kind of a misnomer

48:45.860 --> 48:49.940
What it's actually doing is providing the app menu model stuff

48:50.020 --> 48:55.780
It's got very little to do with unity itself. And so to just sort of clarify your point there a bit

48:55.780 --> 49:01.220
What's happening is these menu options are being exposed via dbus. So it's not like there's some

49:01.620 --> 49:05.720
Global scraper running in the background that's reading all of the menus of every application

49:05.860 --> 49:11.780
The applications are advertising these features to dbus dbus then enumerates that to the hud and

49:11.780 --> 49:16.900
That's already happening in the background regardless. It's not a big bulk out of processing, correct?

49:16.900 --> 49:23.140
Yeah, and if and if you run one of the themes that doesn't use the global menu, then none of that stuff is there

49:23.140 --> 49:26.500
Anyways, none of that stuff is resident in memory. Okay. Okay

49:28.260 --> 49:32.580
Now what I would say is if you

49:33.380 --> 49:37.000
Really feel that that is an unacceptable additional

49:37.860 --> 49:39.860
amount of memory and it's

49:39.860 --> 49:41.860
Not much by the way

49:42.500 --> 49:49.380
Then fine run libuntu run zebuntu go elsewhere. That's absolutely fine

49:51.140 --> 49:56.260
From the very first day that we created a buntu mate. I have an objective in the

49:57.300 --> 49:59.300
In the objectives of the project

49:59.700 --> 50:01.700
the application choices would

50:02.340 --> 50:04.340
feature feature rich

50:04.340 --> 50:09.400
Applications and wouldn't um chase after lightness or whimsy. Mm-hmm

50:10.840 --> 50:12.840
and

50:13.880 --> 50:17.400
Ubuntu mate still runs on a raspberry pi with one gig of ram

50:18.200 --> 50:23.960
If you've got less than one gig of ram and you're upset that ubuntu mate doesn't run well in you know

50:23.960 --> 50:29.640
One gig of ram then fine go elsewhere. I that's absolutely fine by me. I think it's a perfect balance

50:29.640 --> 50:32.040
I think the I think the project I mean is

50:32.040 --> 50:39.320
Is constantly evaluating this question and striking such a good balance between modern-day desktop features and a traditional computing paradigm

50:39.720 --> 50:43.640
It's it's with as much as I talk about 1710 right now

50:43.960 --> 50:47.960
I'm not necessarily sold on running straight ubuntu 1710

50:48.920 --> 50:54.440
I'm also heavily considering giving the ubuntu mate spin a try simply for all of these little added extra perks here

50:54.680 --> 50:57.960
How is the how's the new alpha been received by the community?

50:57.960 --> 51:02.040
How's the new alpha been received by the community? Uh, very

51:02.680 --> 51:09.320
Very well, it's beta one now, right? It's it's beta one. Yeah, um, I did a presentation about it at ubucon

51:09.960 --> 51:17.240
It was very well received. Um, yeah, uh and where I was also um when I was at ubucon

51:17.800 --> 51:20.280
The etienne is our new qa lead

51:20.280 --> 51:25.080
He's been involved in the project for some considerable time but has recently taken on the role of qa lead

51:25.080 --> 51:29.800
Oh congrats, and he lives in france. So he made the trek up from the south of france to paris

51:29.880 --> 51:34.280
And we met for the first time over the weekend. Oh, very good and spent some time together planning

51:34.360 --> 51:39.080
So that was really great, you know to to meet people on a project who you know, you've not met in person

51:39.640 --> 51:43.320
Um, I absolutely love that. That's one of the reasons i'm looking forward to going to new york

51:44.120 --> 51:48.280
Yeah, and this thing about you know, i'm gonna rage quit a particular distro

51:48.280 --> 51:55.320
Um fine, but the thing is is you're talking about leaving a distribution where all of these options are options

51:55.880 --> 52:03.960
And you could just use a different, you know, we've preserved that traditional layout the the as granddad remembers it to panel layout

52:04.040 --> 52:08.280
That has been there forever with gnome 2 is still the default layout

52:08.280 --> 52:15.320
Yeah, and it doesn't use indicators and it doesn't use the hud and it doesn't use compiz or any of this stuff

52:15.320 --> 52:21.880
So I don't understand the rationale for right i'm rage quitting because it's got all of this stuff

52:21.960 --> 52:27.480
Yeah, but I have to go and turn on that is not default. It's crazy talk. Yeah. Yeah, I agree

52:27.800 --> 52:32.440
All right. So the second item I have before you can uh before you can stop talking so much is uh, this is all

52:32.440 --> 52:35.880
This is your fault just as I was coming to closure

52:36.440 --> 52:42.280
On the lais and one. Oh, yeah, just as I was getting to some sort of peace with that

52:42.280 --> 52:49.080
You tease me with mail spring, which isn't actually available for download yet. No, but it is a fork of nalaya's mail now

52:49.080 --> 52:53.160
Wes, I know uh, you myself wimpy. We've we've been a little community here

52:53.160 --> 52:59.240
We've been big nalaya's users in the past and then they announced that they were shutting that ass down turns out their api

52:59.240 --> 53:06.360
Makes them a bunch more dough. I guess. Yeah. Yeah, so wimpy found uh, mail spring at get mail spring.com. Say hello

53:06.360 --> 53:13.000
Say hello. I'm kind of looking forward to this looks nice though. Yeah, it has essentially all the same features that you came to love

53:13.080 --> 53:19.960
And expect uh from the lais it has uh, the really creepy but yet advanced and surprisingly useful open tracking features

53:20.520 --> 53:22.600
I don't know about self-hosted or any of that

53:23.160 --> 53:28.840
Uh, but i'm thinking about signing up none of that. None of that self-hosting is required. So nihilus mail

53:29.240 --> 53:32.360
Um or nihilus n1 was the original mail client

53:32.360 --> 53:38.040
Mm-hmm that used all of the cloud services to do all of the mail syncing, right?

53:38.440 --> 53:44.840
The nihilus mail which was the open source was more like an offline had that sync engine integrated locally

53:44.920 --> 53:46.920
So you didn't have to go elsewhere

53:47.640 --> 53:51.880
now what's interesting about uh, get mail spring is that um

53:52.680 --> 53:57.240
Ben gotto who was one of the original members of the nihilus mail team, right?

53:57.240 --> 54:02.440
Right. His company is now stewarding this fork

54:03.160 --> 54:07.320
And he was the principal developer of nihilus mail. That is interesting, isn't it?

54:07.720 --> 54:12.520
Yeah, and what they're already doing is they're like reworking that sync engine

54:13.000 --> 54:15.560
So the sync engine was written in java script

54:15.640 --> 54:22.140
I imagine node and they've already replaced it with a new sync engine which is implemented in c++

54:22.140 --> 54:27.340
Plus and they're claiming that it's uses 50 less ram and it's considerably

54:28.700 --> 54:30.300
faster and

54:30.300 --> 54:32.300
improves battery endurance

54:32.860 --> 54:35.740
So it looks like they're trying to get all that new that

54:37.000 --> 54:39.900
refactored sync engine integrated before they

54:40.620 --> 54:42.620
They make uh make it available for download

54:42.620 --> 54:45.020
but i've i've already signed up to this to

54:45.580 --> 54:51.180
Stay informed of developments and i'm very very interested to see how this pans out. I'm thinking about doing the same

54:51.180 --> 54:57.580
I I I really I really liked nihilus mail specifically in one but nihilus mail, too. So i'm thinking about doing the same

54:58.380 --> 55:02.620
What do you think wes you you think it's possible? Maybe like a new hope. Maybe it's a new hope wes

55:02.860 --> 55:09.020
Yeah, well, I mean I appreciate a lot of what what they had done and having a bunch of this all be open source anyway

55:09.500 --> 55:14.300
Yeah, right like why not? This is this is what we continually talk about as being an advantage

55:14.700 --> 55:19.660
So if there's even a shot that it works out for us i'm i'm on board i'm I wouldn't uh, I

55:19.660 --> 55:20.700
I'm

55:20.700 --> 55:23.660
Not always in favor of c++ strictly better than node or not

55:23.660 --> 55:30.780
But if it's actually faster and more performant, it seems like they are like what I got out of those summaries is

55:31.660 --> 55:37.420
Like a you know craftsmanship and a care and a loving tuning that I would love to see

55:38.140 --> 55:43.100
Um, and uh, I think it's it's a good sign that it's one of the original authors. Mm-hmm

55:43.100 --> 55:49.660
Um, thanks for pointing out to me. Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait to see how this develops. Um, because

55:50.140 --> 55:56.540
Uh nihilus was the great white hope for the you know, the the new generation of mail clients pretty mail clients

55:58.140 --> 56:05.260
And I I was only saying, uh to poppy a few days ago, you know when when these projects die somebody, you know

56:05.260 --> 56:11.580
There's usually like, you know five or six rage forks immediately afterwards and there was none of that with nihilus

56:11.580 --> 56:17.340
Probably because it's a complex code base and then I saw this and I was like, yes, this is this is what we wanted

56:17.900 --> 56:21.020
I know it sounds you're saying it sounds kind of silly but I I

56:21.340 --> 56:26.780
I really got my head around email for a few months there like I haven't for years and after they announced they were killing it

56:26.780 --> 56:34.060
Off I switched back to my traditional like webmail thunderbird kmail combo, which is horrible and um,

56:35.340 --> 56:37.500
I don't I don't think i've opened my inbox this week

56:37.500 --> 56:42.300
Because I've just been when I get busy like that without the ability to see the thing that nihilus gave me was

56:42.620 --> 56:45.980
Two things that were so great was the I snooze for later

56:46.140 --> 56:51.100
So I could set a reminder and I could come back to it so I could I could clear them out of my inbox

56:51.100 --> 56:53.100
But but get back to them

56:53.580 --> 56:57.980
and the other thing that I found super useful was it's surprising the the

56:58.620 --> 57:00.620
creepiness and and

57:00.700 --> 57:05.500
Well done implementation of tracking they had where they had some sort of server-side component

57:05.500 --> 57:11.420
With embedded code that was really good at at detecting when you opened the email

57:12.140 --> 57:16.140
Which is an incredible indicator for when you're about to get an email it turns out

57:16.220 --> 57:23.180
And this is what I learned after using and one was that almost everyone who emails me on a reoccurring basis

57:23.660 --> 57:29.820
Opens the last email that they got from me and just hits reply and changes the subject deletes the body and sends me an email

57:30.780 --> 57:33.260
Like everybody does that. I thought that was just something I did

57:33.260 --> 57:38.380
Everybody does that and so what happens is when they open up the old email I get a notification

57:38.380 --> 57:41.180
And I know in about five minutes. I'm gonna get an email from a sponsor

57:41.260 --> 57:47.020
And so I know this sounds dumb, but I can mentally prepare myself for that communication

57:47.020 --> 57:50.620
I can I can like clear psychologically clear my schedule, okay?

57:51.500 --> 57:55.420
I'm gonna respond to this. I'm gonna think about this and I actually was getting email done

57:56.140 --> 57:59.820
It was a couple of just snoozing and really good notifications

57:59.820 --> 58:05.660
Snoozing and really good notifications. Um, yeah, I really loved it. So i'd love to see a fork

58:06.060 --> 58:07.900
You know i'm gonna be watching that with some some interest

58:07.900 --> 58:09.900
We'll have a link to that the show notes if you want to check it out

58:09.900 --> 58:14.300
I have a quick mention before we move on with cheese. We still have oh my gosh

58:14.300 --> 58:19.580
We still have backtrack and the gen 2 challenge to get to wow. Oh my gosh jam packed

58:20.860 --> 58:24.300
This is a lot going on. Um, so just a quick mention. I wish we could quick now

58:24.300 --> 58:30.620
I wish we could spend more time on this. Uh, the mangero project is happy i'm sure I would assume

58:31.100 --> 58:33.100
To announce that they got an oem

58:33.420 --> 58:36.220
To ship a laptop pre-installed with mangero

58:37.080 --> 58:39.340
xfce edition, so uh

58:40.300 --> 58:42.300
There you go, joe

58:42.300 --> 58:47.580
It's good for you. Uh, and it's uh, it's the spitfire mangero special edition

58:47.900 --> 58:52.140
It's powered with a seventh generation intel processor 32 gigabytes of them rams

58:52.140 --> 58:55.260
dual drive bays and um, it can

58:56.620 --> 59:02.140
Pretty much probably take whatever you throw at it's got a 1080p ips display. We don't talk much about mangero

59:02.380 --> 59:04.380
I mean, I haven't used it for a while

59:05.260 --> 59:10.940
Yeah, well, you know, uh growing up. My grandma always told me if you ain't got nothing nice nothing nice to say

59:12.380 --> 59:14.380
I can't even I I um

59:14.860 --> 59:19.580
Yeah, i'm not a big mangero advocate. I don't we don't review mangero very often

59:19.580 --> 59:24.540
I don't talk about mangero, but I know there's a portion of our audience that that definitely has had success with it

59:24.540 --> 59:27.420
So I and I mean they seem like they have a fair amount of momentum

59:27.500 --> 59:29.500
They've got their own community going which is great

59:29.580 --> 59:32.620
I this is why I thought we could have made a segment out of this because to be honest with you

59:32.700 --> 59:34.700
It feels like a trend

59:35.240 --> 59:37.820
Distributions more and more are starting to ink deals

59:38.220 --> 59:41.980
I think probably the most prominent and successful one is the entryware about to

59:42.300 --> 59:47.580
Mountain one because to me that's sort of like the best of both worlds great hardware great company great distro

59:47.580 --> 59:54.780
Uh, and you're starting to see elementary os with different trying and solace rumors and all this all these things that seem to be brewing

59:55.100 --> 59:59.340
And it seems that all of them sort of have one common denominator and it's clevo

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:05.500
And I think that's the enabling technology here because clevo is providing the base platform of the laptop

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.900
uh, the

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.020
Oems can then focus on the software implementations a bit more

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.020
And so what you are getting and it's going to take a little while for the consumers to catch up

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:20.080
I would think except for our audience is you're going to get different levels of implementation

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.300
So you're going to have some clevo resellers that have a really solid implementation. They really have nailed the firmware issues

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.020
They've nailed compatibility issues. They've worked back and forth with clevo

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.660
Maybe they even have some leverage

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.940
I wonder if at some point we'll see like a clevo competitor

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.780
so that

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.220
so

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.220
Yeah, I was I was going to say

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:44.060
It's not always clevo undoubtedly clevo features

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.620
Is could you give me an example of one that's not clevo?

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.220
uh

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:54.780
The first couple of generations of the entra where apollo were top star. Yeah top star. Uh, but this one is clevo

01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:01.760
Uh, the current generation is yes. No, no, no, I mean, yeah, sorry. No, I mean the station x the the mangero spitfire

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:09.740
Is um, i'm not familiar with what what's being shipped there, but it could be it looks i'm just saying that yes

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.060
It's the these linux oems are not

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:22.060
Absolutely always clevo. Okay quite often they are but there are other odms that get used as well. Yeah. Okay. That's a fair point

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.900
I think that's a fair point. I think this one is this one. Um, I can't remember

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.460
I I got the clevo make at one point, but i'm pretty sure I I tracked it down to a particular clevo make which is

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.780
similar to probably the

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:38.460
Apollo galago line of machines i'm not I I to me I feel like that's um

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:43.580
Um that only matters in so much as how good is the oem at doing the implementation? Yes

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:50.780
What kind of constraints does that put on the whole process and you can't get around obviously do you like the clevo hardware?

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:56.380
Like that's a component some people do some people don't that's fine. Yeah, um, but I do feel like these odms

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.540
top star or

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.420
clevo or whoever are making it possible for

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.180
distributions to offer a out-of-the-box distribution experience so instead of

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.780
Of buying a box of cds now you can buy a laptop

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.940
And how long did we talk about how that that was important for the linux desktop, right?

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.220
Even if it's not the hardware we want or even the distribution we want

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:22.380
It's certainly a different category than I have to buy and hope that this will work

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:25.980
Yeah, and it you know, if you think about it in terms of selling a box set of dvds

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.940
I used to buy the susa box set. It was like six discs

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.180
Um, you know, I used to get the free cd from uh, ubuntu

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.980
Um, man, jero and mandrake was mini disc. This is kind of like that same thing. Don't you think?

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.740
What and what's important about this is that you know, we've we've said for years and years and years

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:49.980
The reason why linux isn't more widespread is because you can't go into brick and mortar stores and buy it

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.860
Yeah

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.580
Now the next best thing to that is having online retailers that make it available

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.660
Um, and you know, we've seen a number of these

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.420
Uh linux vendors popping up recently particularly in the uk

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.980
um, obviously intro where i've been around for some years now, uh, but we've had

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.220
Station x star labs and I think this one called nimbu or something like that

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.940
So there's been three pop up in the uk in you know, quite quick succession

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.940
And then another one that i've known about in spain

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.980
But um had the good fortune to meet at ubucon this weekend is slimbook

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.340
And they have some very very nice gear

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:37.820
That they had on show and there were lots of us and ours and lots of people saying i'm going to struggle not to buy

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.020
One of these they had some really terrific kit

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.460
Um and chassis that i've not seen before so I don't know where they're coming from, but they're really impressive

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.940
That's exciting. And and they're the company that are providing that kde neon book

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.660
Oh, yeah, very good

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.220
huh, okay, so

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.180
This the more we talk about it. Um, I I not only did I see this taking off more and more

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:07.420
But I can also kind of understand why system 76 feels compelled to ship pop os imagine if they had

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.660
Um an inside track or they saw the way this thing was blowing

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:15.420
This wind was blowing this direction where you're going to start having super specialized

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.860
you're going to have solace laptops and elementary os laptops and

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.620
ubuntu mattei laptops and mangero laptops

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.380
and

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:29.820
Then you're going to have the large vendors like hp and lenovo and of course dell

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.260
shipping stock ubuntu

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.100
So they don't have that extra value add area

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.620
There's a gap there. I can see the logic path. However

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:47.020
My my counter argument to that would have been there's still a market for somebody to do a really rock-solid

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:52.540
Vanilla ubuntu implementation because at the end of the day that's going to sell way more than any of these things do

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.220
Probably combined especially with what we were just talking about like customer feedback. Like

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.420
I like I have no problems with dell but like

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:04.940
Close customer feedback about software design is not something that they have a ton of experience with compared to say

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:10.620
Let's like system 76 is a little bit closer with their customer base. I would say yeah, and I could so you can see that

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:17.660
That path. Yeah, you know, you look skeptical beard. No, I was just gonna say it's still really interesting to me that it's

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:24.060
It's manjaro that's coming out with a laptop. Like if I made a list they'd be pretty far down on who I would have expected

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.420
To come out with the laptop. I guess that's who you know, right? Yeah, I guess

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.460
Because you could see like certain distributions

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.700
Well, I guess yeah, are you implying that maybe it's it's uh implying

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.060
More growth to manjaro than we realize is that what you're saying? Like maybe there's maybe there's more going on than we realize

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.460
like

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.020
I I feel like they they must think that they have a fairly large user base if they're coming up with hardware now

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:56.300
Yeah, I mean they gotta figure they're not just manjaro, but whoever's shipping the laptops must think they have enough user base as well

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:00.700
That's it is it is that statement, isn't it? It's the they somebody did the business math here

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:05.900
So it's now time for the manjaro challenge. So where's my integrus laptop? Yeah

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:11.340
Well, but that's the thing. I mean the thing is is that you know, there are lots of people using arch linux

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.500
Or so the internet would have you believe

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500
Yes, it would I

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:23.500
I would suggest that most of those people that say they're running arch linux have either installed antergos or manjaro

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.540
There are probably very few actually installing arch

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.940
Do you think that's true? I mean really though wimpy because once you install arch

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.100
You don't really have to install it again

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.420
Like it's just installed and it can be installed for a very so you can install it once six years ago

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.380
And then have you ever installed arch linux? Yes. Yeah, I have and I would say it you have have you yeah

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:47.980
You've not always just installed and gen 2 and gen 2 but I always I will I will grant you

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.140
That if I were if I were in the last two years going to install arch

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.500
I would absolutely go integros and not even consider going stock arch. It's just why waste the time

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:03.100
My point exactly it's all about time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay fair enough fair enough

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:08.860
I always just boot into an integros live cd and then install stock arch really? Yeah

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:14.700
because then you have a gooey you have chrome or whatever and but otherwise I can install everything in antergos and like

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.380
Two pacman commands if I was going to do it today if I for some

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:23.900
Reason wanted to install stock arch today. That's probably maybe how I would do it if I was going to think about it

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.900
Huh?

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:31.100
It's just I think you're right wimpy is it really is. Uh, it really is like uh, it's

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:37.180
Now it's a it's a badge of honor in a sense on the internet to run arch and so everybody proclaims they run arch

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:43.500
But maybe the most maybe you're right. Maybe the majority of them are really mangero users. Maybe they're all mangero users

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.260
That's not arch

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.940
I mean, I hate to be that guy. I hate to be that guy because I hate that guy

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:54.620
I hate that guy when you're like looking for a problem. He's like, oh you're using mangero. Sorry can't help but it's not arch

01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:00.380
I can't believe that mangero has more users than antergos though

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.940
It's been around longer

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:08.780
No, not by much. Yeah, but you remember people used to really buy into that mangero is tested arch thing for like years

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.860
Yeah, like they have the delayed release. Yeah people that always pushed me away from it though

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:17.900
Well, yeah, because if you thought about it for more than 30 seconds, of course it would but people that didn't think about it

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:21.420
That that sounds like yeah arch but tested like debian does well shit

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.420
I'll put that on my rig. I mean, you know, if you hear it like that, that sounds good

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:33.020
It's like arch but all that. Yeah, but then when you you know, yeah, of course if they only have maybe 3000 people running the testing version

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:40.060
It doesn't really do anything other than just slow down the updates. That seems like a bad idea, but that takes 30 seconds

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.660
I feel like we're suddenly crapping on mangero and I feel bad

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:49.500
Yeah, I mean, you know, you're right if you have nothing to say we should be celebrating

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:55.580
We should their glorious success of getting an oem behind. Yeah, because it's a big deal for any

01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.740
Validation and it's a big deal for linux because it means you know, we've we we saw those

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:10.060
Uh net craft is it net data? Yep, statistics three point something percent. Uh linux uses a growing trend there

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.460
There is obviously a growing market for these oems to sell linux devices and linux laptops

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:23.980
And we should be applauding that and encouraging it because it doesn't actually matter what distro is being sold. That's one more

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.980
laptop

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:30.620
One more person joining us and one less of them and more resources spent like getting

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:37.100
Getting firmware getting polish ironed out things that are in theory somewhat portable to whatever you want to run one

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.900
You know you think about two the other the other net effect

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:46.700
This is having is it's another reseller who is pulling on clevo to support linux better. So

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.820
There could be a come because of this because of this market now

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.780
There could become a point where clevo is one of the best supported

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.660
Out there because they got all these people selling clevo machines

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.900
And I know that some of these oems that are using you know

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:06.300
The likes of um clevo are starting to talk to the firmware update guys to actually get these

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.760
You know the firmware and bios for these devices

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.100
Supported by gnome software and firmware update

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:19.340
So, you know if this trend grows there'll be more people putting more pressure on these odms

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:20.860
to

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.860
Release their bios and firmware

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:29.660
under licenses, um or agreements that enable these things to go into these public repositories so they can

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:35.340
benefit from automatic updates and we don't have to be like barbarians booting off, you know

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.180
Yeah, yes, this is a serious

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.980
This is a serious tip of the hat to the managerial project because like we said earlier somebody did the business math here

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.580
And decided it was worth their time which is a real validation to the project

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.500
This is the kind of like real supply chain

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.540
Like you were just saying like the supply chain stuff that will make longer term change that is very different than just

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:59.180
You know some software. I want to know your thoughts wimpy though on them choosing to do a customized xfce spin

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.500
That's been quote unquote tailored for the hardware

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:07.420
I don't know anything about xfce. So you're asking the wrong guy. I'm sorry. What do you think? I mean, really?

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.740
What do you think it means to say? Why why xfce? What's that about? Is that a mangero thing?

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:17.420
I thought that was the default desktop for mangero. Maybe I thought only masochists use xfce

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:22.860
I can't I can't I can't joe's not listening. You do know one. Yeah

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.060
I can't you know, you spot you thought of speaking of speaking of joe the market research

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:34.140
Uh, I did a little digging for linux action news a couple episodes one episode ago and uh got some of the

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.220
Insk got some of the information behind where that market share number came from

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:44.700
And um why we hear about it from time to time and how many sites are involved in that information

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.220
So I would recommend you check out recent episodes of linux action news

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.460
I think it was 16, but that's off the top of my head

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.300
Where I kind of did a little deep dive into where that three percent number is coming from

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300
It's actually um

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.780
Of course i'm saying this but uh, I actually think that three percent number is low

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:07.340
And I only and I I say that I say that after I researched how they're getting to the number

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.860
And once I realized how they're getting to the number i'm pretty confident, but I don't know of course

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.900
But i'm pretty confident saying that it's low and you you think so too wimpy. Well, pauline hub tells us so so

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.100
Yeah, well, yeah. Oh my god

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.980
Oh, yeah, well, yeah. Oh my god

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.060
Okay, so it's true they publish the stats every year

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.860
We've got significantly more perverts than three percent. Well, let's be honest. I mean, it's a great platform for porn

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.700
We've said that before it truly is

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.100
It's the best platform for porn as far as i'm concerned

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:44.860
Because and I think uh, you know porn shops have been good to linux running linux servers on the back end serving tons of video

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:51.020
Absolutely, the server side the infrastructure side and the fact that we don't launch executables has been really great for

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.060
linux, yes

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.060
Oh man, well there's be safe everybody

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:03.020
This is the more you know on the unplug program

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:08.060
Okay, so we have many things still to get to I don't know if this is going to work

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:13.340
Uh, but we I do I I spent some time to blowing off some steam this week

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.780
Uh, I got a lot going on. I got a lot. I got a lot in my head

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:21.740
I got a lot i'm trying to figure out and I thought what better way to focus all of this random energy

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:29.900
Than to try to break my tp link and belkin, uh smart devices turns out my tp links run a 26 kernel

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.300
linux 26

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah, yeah, so I had some fun and uh, what is this 2005?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.700
Kali linux, we're finally going to talk about it. We should have we really should have led with this

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.940
I didn't really we just kind of meandered this whole episode

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.180
Uh, but we're going to talk about kali linux here in a moment. But first, let's take a moment and get real

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.520
Let's get real about digital ocean go to digital ocean.com

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:56.060
And use our promo code do unplugged. It's one word after you create your account. This will give you a $10 credit

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.940
You can spin up a server. It could be a buntu. It could be fedora can even be free bsd or centos or debian

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.020
I mean

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.020
Do you have any free bsd droplets beard?

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:11.180
Hmm, why would anybody do that? Yeah, I don't know. I mean wes would you have any reason for a free bsd droplet?

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.700
Well, maybe you want to run some jails. That'd be a great way to run like yeah

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:22.380
I guess if you want end-to-end zfs, I just prefer the industry standard docker on my uh, on my uh industry standard abuntu

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.700
I mean, I just me, you know, it's just me wes

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.980
I don't I don't know why I am still needling the bsd now guys and I don't know why it's like

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.580
It's just something I just it's in your blood

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.900
Now this is my moment in the show to needle the bsd now guys and I take it almost every week

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.900
I take it almost every week

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:43.340
But anyways, we're gonna catch you with the net bsd droplet someday and you are gonna have so much shame

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.980
You know chris is probably because i'm bsc now. They need a less. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:53.180
Why would anybody install linux? Uh, I was just gonna say, uh digital ocean has been saving my bacon recently

01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.580
I spun it up by droplet to run open vpn

01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:00.940
And that's been very very very handy, but uh, i'll save that for another story because I believe uh, mr

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.020
wimpy has one from the

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.320
ubucon ubucon

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320
Yeah, I do

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:14.280
Poppy and I did a couple of snapcraft workshops at ubucon as one does

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
One on the saturday one on the sunday

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.120
And we went into a classroom and it wasn't set up the way we needed

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.600
so we span up a bunch of do droplets and

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.960
configured all of the course material on it and we did it all with do ctl

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:39.800
And a simple script to go and zap all of the machines with what we needed and we ran our classrooms off do droplets

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:45.160
Ah, very good. That's nice. And then afterwards do you destroy them or do you still have them just destroyed them?

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.040
Yeah, and it cost us a few pennies to run, you know

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:54.920
Several hours of classes on on dozens of droplets that reminds me of the time that uh, just this last linux fest northwest

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.720
I think it was this last one. I can't remember if this was the event

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:02.200
But during the live stream we spun up a digital ocean droplet transferred some stuff over to it

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.280
And then when we were done we destroyed it

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.640
And it's I it's I don't know there's something about that

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.320
This feels ultimately powerful

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.960
Like it's really a lot of incredible compute power

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.840
On demand and you can spin it up and you can use it and you can run your linux that you like to use

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:23.160
And there's great documentation and a simple dashboard and an elegant api and they got data centers everywhere

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.640
And it's just available to you when you need it

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.040
If it makes you feel a little bit like tony stark and I I just love it if you use our promo code

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:34.200
Do unplugged one word you get the ten dollar credit and then you can play around

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.960
Run like the three cents an hour machine with our ten dollar credit

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:45.000
It's great digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged after you have created your account over digital ocean.com. And by the way

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.720
In their community documentation section

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.040
They have a new tutorial on I guess it's really an introduction to load testing your box

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.240
So if you want to test network latency cpu memory disk io all that kind of stuff

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.080
They got a really great tutorial on it and it's it's applicable to anybody running linux

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.480
But it's just an example of the value that they add to digital ocean users too

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:13.960
Because obviously it's applicable to digital ocean droplets. I want to give a challenge to the community chris. Oh, yeah, I want them

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.880
to

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.640
Come up with things

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.120
To do with a digital ocean api that nobody's ever thought of. Ooh, that would be good

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:29.640
I want to see ridiculous things like stuff. They never plan for yeah digital ocean.com create the account that user promo code do unplugged one word

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.960
now

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.480
Finally, let's talk about kali linux

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:39.000
And I feel like the only way to appropriately talk about kali linux would be to talk about backtrack linux because last time you and I

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080
spoke about this audience

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.240
We were really talking about backtrack linux and it was a solid distribution

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.640
People came together and they created something that was kind of unique. It was kind of the

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.020
uh smashing together of slacks and

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.780
Opix

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:59.660
And then they would sort of smash it together and do these big releases with all these kind of features and I really loved it

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.180
um

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:07.260
Full disclosure. I I used it professionally to make a living for a while. So obviously i'm a little biased about backtrack, but loved it back

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:15.660
Really was a great tool and um, but but things move on people move on projects change and they later on down the road decided to

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.260
Essentially change things up and rebase

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.140
And they rebased on debian

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.100
And around this time they launched and they called it kali linux

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.900
and kali linux is a

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.820
Penetration testing distribution that's targeted towards ethical hackers. So let's crack open a beer here

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:39.020
and talk a little bit about kali linux because this week I was having some fun and I

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.540
I want to say there's a few different ways you can use kali linux you

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:52.140
Surprisingly could legitimately use it as your desktop distribution gnome 3. They've got a couple of extensions installed like the applications menu

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.100
In fact wes if you want

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.740
This thing right here I was running it this week on the i'm going to turn on you see

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:03.900
Let's see if the studio cams working because if I don't know if it is or not because I want people to find out

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:10.220
I want people to see this thing here. So i've got it here on the dell precision 7720 laptop massive, which is just a

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.820
Monster and the thing about this laptop is it reminds me a lot of the bonobo that I had back in the day

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:17.900
When I was doing penetration testing

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.540
And uh, so here wes i've got this is oh, yeah

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:26.620
This is kali linux running off of the live uh thumb drive there and take a look at like the application menu stuff and whatnot

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.980
It's um, you could just use that as your daily driver. I'm running gnome here. It's not bad

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:38.460
Yeah, gnome 3 and they also have uh support for vmware. They have in fact vm kernel 4.9. Yeah

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.420
Yeah, it's you know, it's they got vmware fusion

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:46.460
Boot images and all kinds of different ways. What is this traditional style menu plugin?

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:49.740
They've got installed and one of the nice things they support is persistent mode

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:56.060
So you can still boot off a live media but save your data on a gpg encrypted persistent state. That's excellent

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.820
Yes, it is. It is excellent

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.500
It's very nice when you're doing different kinds of work when you're doing a multi-day project

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.580
And that is a very nice feature. Oh, they've got open vos in here. That's one thing I was going to mention

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.780
Well, let's talk about that. So open vos is where I wanted to start

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.860
so I want to I want to walk people down breaking their own network and

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:16.860
You got to start by discovering your own network and there's a lot of different ways

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.940
You can do this end map is a great tool as well

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:23.020
But I want to point you to net discover it's installed by default on kali linux

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:28.060
And it's a network address discovering tool and it will really quickly it'll if you if you pull that

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:35.420
I've got some screenshots. So anyways, it'll it'll quickly it identify all the machines on your network and the vendors who make the hardware

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:42.300
So I could very quickly see all of the tp link and the belkin and the three amazon echo devices that are on our network

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:47.980
Because it gave me vendor and what I assume it's doing although I don't know this for sure. But what I assume it is doing

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:53.180
Is in the background it's looking up the mac addresses of these devices with a vendor database

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:57.820
And it's matching mac address to vendor and then it's saying okay. Well it has these ports open

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.700
It has on this network ip address and this is the hardware

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:08.140
So within about 30 seconds using net discover and the command is really simple in my case. It was net discover space

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.840
192.168.0

01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.420
Dot zero slash 24

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:17.100
And that told it to scan my entire network

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:24.240
192.168.0.0.24 now my network is a 192 network if you had a 172 or a 10.1 network

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.840
You would need to adjust your command but net discover space 192.168

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:36.840
Zero dot zero slash 24 you execute that command and within seconds net discover will find every device on your network

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.840
It'll give you the manufacturer information about it

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:45.680
And see this seems super helpful because there's a lot of tools I've used where I've been very frustrated with like a like an NMS

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.400
That does auto discovery, but does a bunch of other stuff, too

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.280
So if I could just have one tool that would keep me apprised of changes to my network

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.600
But without having a bunch of nonsense, I don't know that too great for that. It's really great

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.640
yeah, so then you get your list of machines you want to go after the machines you want to attack or audit and

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:08.320
For me it was the TP link devices, and this is where open vos comes in so how did you know about open vos?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.600
Oh, I'd looked at using it at various employers before yeah, so there's there's several different

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:22.080
assessment tools these are tools that will scan a host IP and just bang on every single port try executing different commands if it

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080
Gets a telnet connection

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:28.320
It'll try to log in like it just does everything to abuse a box and you can have it abuse an entire network

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.160
Or you can have it just hammer a machine, and it's not necessarily going to execute a payload

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.320
But it's going to tell you what doesn't work. What is vulnerable

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.360
If it leaks a certain time stamp that could be used to decrypt data

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.720
It tells you all these things about a host which I was curious about with these TP link devices

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.140
Which didn't really give me much information

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.700
Unfortunately, but open vos or open VAS the reason why I went with it

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:57.980
It stands open VAS by the way stands for the open vulnerability assessment system

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.800
That's what the VAS is is the vulnerability assessment system

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.800
And I started using it because it reminds me a lot of a tool that I used back in the day called Nessus

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.280
Oh, yeah, the Nessus vulnerability scanner. Yeah, so this is along that same line

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.420
It's an open source vulnerability scanner that subscribes to a database guys

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:23.460
This is key it subscribes to a database and it pulls down all of the latest vulnerabilities and exploits constantly

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.900
So you have the latest

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:29.620
That's where the real like automation stuff that you don't have to do anymore and by the way the first word ever doing

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:33.640
And all of the open VAS packages are in Kali by the way, so it's real easy

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:39.480
there's a meta package you can apt-get you can apt install open VAS and it pulls down the common and the core and

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:45.040
There's a first-time setup wizard you can run under Kali Linux and it will go down it will set up the database

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:48.040
Which I believe might be Postgres by default on Kali

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:55.280
Excellent pulls down all of the vulnerability assessment updates which on on our hundred megabit connection here at the studio took 45 minutes

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.840
Download so it will take a long time and do it where you have a fast connection

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:05.340
But once it's done you can throw the weight of the security community's entire knowledge set at a system

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.780
And you can just punish it to see what it what it is vulnerable to

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.320
And one of the things that's a lot of fun is once you get results in open VAS

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.260
And there's other ways to do this under Kali open VAS is the way I like to do it

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:21.880
But there's other ways but what I do is I take the data set I get from open VAS and I run it through

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.200
something called Metasploit

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:31.440
Metasploit is more like a list of known exploits and and it's like

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.640
Macros to execute them Metasploit is like

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:41.520
Imagine a whole bunch of shell scripts that do bad shit on your system. Only it's everything. It's like remote RPC connections

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:46.480
It's sequel database connections. It's HTTP stuff and you tell Metasploit. This is the host

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:53.000
This is the vulnerability it has which I got using open VAS you tell Metasploit now. Okay, here's the IP. Here's the port

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.560
Here's the it's running Apache go execute a shell on that system. So you say here's Apache. Here's the IP now go give me shell

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.140
That's what Metasploit does and it's it's so much fun because you can look at a system with open VAS and go

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.560
Oh, they have a vulnerability in MySQL and then you go tell Metasploit go talk to MySQL at this IP

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.220
And now you own the box. Yep, and it can be a great way to go verify that

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:21.440
Did your patch sets actually apply go Metasploit it if you get in then? No, they didn't yeah

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:30.400
Exactly, and I've linked in the show notes an article on the Kali Linux docs page about using Metasploit and it's a it's it's

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.800
Something you could load to your machine and have it and dedicated to a hard drive or something like I'm doing we can have

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.440
On a thumb drive and from time to time you fire it up and just do an audit of your network a little Kali and Docker

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.600
Yeah, I like to think of Metasploit as like unit tests for vulnerabilities. Mm-hmm

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.320
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's um

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:54.280
Kind of complicated to set up. It's not hard. I won't say hard, but I'll say it's complicated to set up

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.840
But once you get set up, it's pretty easy and met and Metasploit. It's pretty much set up out of the box on Kali

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.120
Yeah, which is really cool. So what I decided to do was just sort of bang on these TP links now

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.880
They don't really return much. So what I noticed is TP link is

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:15.520
They have they've they've changed all of like the return codes all that although like they had the the version identifiers doesn't return any of that

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.520
Stuff so I think when people say they have like a hardened Linux they have Linux

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.040
It doesn't respond to any ports except for the ones they need and the services that respond don't give you any identifying information

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.640
So if you somehow knew the version of like some software that was on there

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.920
via like another leak of the companies like if there was a TP link a

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.680
TP link leak about the version of Linux or the version of

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.760
Node or the version of NGINX that they have on that little tiny little plug

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.280
Then you can attack it with Metasploit, but because when you do a vulnerability scan

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.000
They're not revealing any version information. They're not except for the kernel version, which is exactly what you would want

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.680
That's that's what you you don't you don't want somebody be able to come into your network and scan your network and get all the version

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.200
Information for the embedded Apache server and the embedded database server. You don't want that so

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.520
Based on my just really quick scans of both the Belkin Wiimote devices and the TP link smart switches

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.080
While they're running old versions of Linux these little smart plugs they're running old versions of Linux

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.840
There's $65 computers running Linux or $35 if you buy them on sale, right? Yeah, but they're

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:32.160
They're like bastard I'd bastard eyes versions of all of the software that have been modified and gimped to not fully be functional or report

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.920
Themselves correctly, which I guess at the end of the day. I'm happy about I wouldn't necessarily want them to

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.760
but it was sort of it was sort of like a

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:49.640
Revealing in a sense to just even get like the kernel version and the ports and all of the IPs and all of the Mac

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.640
Address like I felt like I had a better

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.080
Understanding of my network. Yeah, even though I didn't really crack a TP link

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.000
I didn't crack one of these Belkin's and I didn't I kind of didn't really try too hard

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.160
I kind of didn't really try too hard. I

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.600
Did walk away with the sense that now I have like a complete picture and I took screenshots, too

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.720
So like now I have like all the IPs of all my network devices

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.720
What their Mac addresses are what the vendors are so I know how many you know, it's a nice baseline, right?

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.240
So that you add future stuff and it looks way different or you see a bunch more activity like you can now

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.320
Benchmark against. Yeah. Yeah, I I really I

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:30.520
I really just would say just just for fun go spend an afternoon banging around with Kali Linux

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520
I highly highly recommend it and

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.000
If you're if you're looking for different implementations go check out their download page

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.200
They have several I've linked to a couple different ones that I use but they have Kali hunter or net hunter

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:47.460
They have the VM version. They have 64-bit and 32-bits. They have Katie Matei

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.040
enlightenment 17

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.460
It's just to have like a hundred different spins and I just I just went for the stock 64-bit Kali ISO

01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:02.640
Which is a gnome 3 based and you can find it at K a li org slash downloads for that and

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.580
If you got an extra one pour one out for backtrack, that was a real tool back in the day

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.360
I really like that guys. We are we are plum overtime. We're not just out of time

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.260
We are over time right now and I and I wanted to mention before we go

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:23.460
So let's you know what? Okay. Alright, so let's do this. Let's I hate to do it. I can't believe it

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.060
I see the pain in your eyes

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:31.460
Let's punt the gentoo challenge to next week because before we go I just want to give everybody a heads up about I know

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:36.500
I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But before we go, it's okay Chris. I'm still compiling

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:42.540
Anyway, there's a community announcement. I want to make the our friends over the Ubuntu podcast have something special in the works

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:47.420
Whippy, are you still here? Can you tell us about what's going on in regards to a giveaway over at the Ubuntu podcast?

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.900
Well, it's not a giveaway. It's a a hard-earned competition

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:57.300
We ran a competition in partnership with intro where

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:05.900
We reviewed the intro where Apollo the current generation and they allowed us to use that as the prize

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.700
and in a competition

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:14.540
Which we've been running for many weeks and the winners of that competition will be announced this Thursday

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:22.460
we've been tweeting all of the entries via the Ubuntu podcast Twitter channel over the last three days and

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:29.940
On our subreddit all of the entries are there so you can go and upvote those entries

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:37.600
We've already picked our winners. We're interested in seeing what the audience thinks compared to what we've picked as the winners

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.500
So you can go and have a look at people that have composed music written stories

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
Poems

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.540
created applications

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.940
Drawings there's just a a wide range and the theme was

01:30:54.300 --> 01:31:02.260
20 so create something in 20 colors or 20 shapes or 20 lines of code or in 20 minutes and

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.300
people have really

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.820
Run with it. We just really interesting selection

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:12.860
We got it. I got a you and I have to consult next time because we just gave away the XPS 13 we just gave

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:18.780
It away and you got you got real stuff. You're like comics and music. Yeah. Yeah, that is great

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:22.780
Yeah, it's so interesting because every time you do a contest like this, of course

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.460
I can say this for you because I don't know if you guys want to

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.140
You really discover how awesome your audience is

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:36.620
Absolutely, I mean we we loved looking over these entries and they they're all fabulous and

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:42.420
It's we opened it up because we didn't just want a load of people giving us a bunch of code

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:47.220
we deliberately opened it up so that our listeners, you know who are

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:55.620
Authors or artists or musicians and not coders could also, you know compete on a on a level playing ground

01:31:55.620 --> 01:32:02.860
And it was absolutely brilliant. I think that's great. So check out the Ubuntu podcast and I look forward to hearing that episode now

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:09.020
Unfortunately, that means the gentoo challenge will be punted. Whoa. Who saw that coming?

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:13.980
I didn't see that coming couldn't have happened couldn't it couldn't have been predicted couldn't have been all those times

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:19.820
I hours spent compiling for nothing. It's darn it this time. I'm going with dash o3, you know what?

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.820
I'm gonna wipe the whole thing and do it all over again

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.740
Oh come back next come back next week Beardsley

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:30.820
Where should people find you throughout the week twitter.com slash your Kyle P or Oh rec dotnet rec dotnet

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:36.100
Mr. West at West pain and you can follow me at Chris Elias at Jupiter signal and Linux unplug dot red dot com

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:55.100
See you back here next week

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.100
Oh

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:13.060
Okay, oh, yeah

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:18.360
Well since we didn't do the gentoo challenge, I got a different idea for my my title

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:25.220
Suggestion is changing. I feel like maybe we should go with the Kali Linux segment instead since that's what we in. I

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:32.580
Guess the sad part is I was just about to install good. No, you should still do it

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.180
You can you can report back next week about how installing gnome went

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:41.420
And I'm doing it without system D from a third-party repo as well. Oh you crazy girl. You crazy

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:48.420
That is save it for the future. We'll definitely talk about yeah, I'll save it for next week man. Don't worry. Okay, okay

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:52.100
Speaking of the abundant podcast contest that you know as you know

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:58.420
He opened it for designers and things and as a designer and a writer I submitted some Python code. Hey, oh

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:03.900
I also installed a boon to 17 just now by the way

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:10.300
I know the it's ironic that we're trying to do the gentoo challenge because all I really want to do is just load all the different

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.300
versions of a bunch of

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.540
Yeah, it's a good for them though good for the by the way

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:21.120
I put it on my macbook that I got for my birthday really a new one or a used one

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:26.280
It was one off of eBay because my dad didn't want it. What's the year? What's the year? What's the year?

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:33.280
2013 late version 15 inch with Nvidia graphics. That's what I have. That's that is the sweet spot right now

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:36.780
I mean and you know what? It's still a good system. It's still

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.840
The high dpi display on it looks crisp as hell. Yeah, I know I

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.200
I've night cuz I had had you know, it really sucks though

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.940
The only thing is the only good desktop that looks on it with the no display. No, I'm

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.840
Yeah, I know. Oh, I know

01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:02.200
I that really bites because you can't do XFC. You can't do Katie. You can't do none of that with but it looks

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.420
Amazing. It looks like the screen good it

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.120
But please don't don't like the screen. Yeah

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.000
I've had high dpi on a 13 inch screen

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.760
But when we put Linux on the MacBook Pro with a 15 inch high dpi whole nother level, but yeah, it's a whole nother level

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.080
It's so good. The only thing that I've had troubles with is getting this graphic switching to work properly

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:30.000
Oh, I don't even bother. I just run the Nvidia all the time. Yeah, I get you. I tried gentoo on it

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Oh talk about a nightmare
