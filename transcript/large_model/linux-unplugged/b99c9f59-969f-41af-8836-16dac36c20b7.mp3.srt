1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
it's called slap and it's a sublime like terminal based text editor so yes sublime

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,120
text comes to your terminal I think it's actually I don't know it does I think

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,720
it's actually a pretty beastie installation because it runs on I think

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,680
it runs on node and you have to install it using npm but it didn't try no I

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
wasn't I wasn't I wasn't actually compelled but I don't know is a big

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,060
sublime text fan so I sent this over to him this morning to give us his full

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,520
review isn't that funny like I think for some people the you know if you're if

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
you're a javascript dev then it's a it's probably like a super easy installation

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,520
for you that's a good point this beer is delicious West I know right I was

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,240
surprised it is really good oh it's a blonde ale yeah for an easy beer in the

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,080
in a warm afternoon mm-hmm all right I want the West take on the VR

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,800
backpack it's a PC that doubles as a backpack for VR but then you can put in

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,840
a big old docking station whoa it's a desktop PC HP is making this thing what

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,240
do you think of these backpack PCs have you seen many of these so my first worry

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,960
what if you're walking uphill you're working up a sweat on a sunny day is

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,120
that going to ruin the PC water damage yeah I mean yeah yeah well I think they

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,160
envision like you're in the living room still it's for VR but without having to

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,820
have all the cords all over right I I actually think it'd be awesome is like a

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,800
live stream broadcaster like put put Linux on this put OBS on this connect it

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,600
to some LTE modems and now you got yourself a portable broadcasting machine

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,080
on your back seems like it'll all come down to weight distribution and heat you

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,120
know like is it comfortable to wear can you do it right multiple hours right it

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,560
could enable citizen journalism in fact if you built an LTE modems into this

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,880
thing I mean I enable citizen journalism with like a pie and cell phone to just

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,840
yeah Nexus 5 well I guess you don't really need a PC you know what they ought

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,880
to do you know they ought to do us they ought to just make the VR headset

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,200
super-powerful here's an idea why don't they put a PC in a headset that's crazy

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,440
talk or I was thinking like it what's the size like on this can you get

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,520
smaller could we get like a knock and then one of the little things that you've

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,800
just duct-taped on your the back of your shirt yeah it's got a 1080 graphics card

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,720
it's got the Kaby Lake a7 processor you got to buy the dock separately the

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,520
dock is $600 on top of a $2,500 computer and I'm sure that dock works with all

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,560
kinds of other systems you're like yeah I'd say that's definitely future-proof

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,320
look at all those ports I see three I mean how could you not buy this with all

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:48,920
of those killer VR apps this is Linux unplugged episode 200 for June 6 2017

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,200
welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's been going for

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,240
200 episodes strong my name is Chris my name is West hello West I don't think

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,200
we've missed an episode I don't think so we've had like some holiday specials

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,960
yeah flashbacks oh absolutely this week we're postpone we're perspiring for

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,880
perspirating perspiring perspiring conspiring and postponing it is getting

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,320
a little warm here we're gonna hold off on the 200th birthday celebration for

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,120
July 4th more about that in a little bit instead after we get through kind of a

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
shorter compact amount of project updates and stuff we're gonna do a love

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,640
letter a love song and maybe maybe a maybe a little more they'll tell you

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
more about that for gnome 3 I'm you know I'm loving gnome 3 I think it's a great

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,200
desktop and we're gonna cover some ways you can make it better and why I'm

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,440
pretty positive on the future of the gnome shell some things that are coming

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,680
up very soon to gnome at things that are long long down the road but I think are

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,360
gonna have great long-term impacts in fact one of them is developing even

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,120
today as we go on the air so we're gonna cover things to make known better for

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,480
you today even if you're not a gnome user please stick around as after we get

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,200
through the updates because I kind of want to just show you how the other side

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
is living this week better or for worse we want to get your feedback on that and

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,080
then we'll talk about sort of where GTK is going where the gnome shells going

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,560
improvements to mutter GTK for and a company out there that's making some big

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,920
hires that could have big long-term impacts on the direction of no so 200

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,320
a packed episode a packed packed episode and before we go into it too far you

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
know we have one thing we got to do every single week we got to start it we

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,280
got to start right here sometimes I like to wait a little bit but I'm feeling I'm

60
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,680
feeling in the community spirit time appropriate greetings virtual log

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:49,880
greetings so we have we have the virtual lug joining us every single week but to

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,840
celebrate our 200th episode on July 4th on America's birthday now known as

63
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,560
Linux own plugs birthday we're gonna have a virtual lug barbecue the virtual

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,800
lug becomes real at least some of us yeah yeah way it's official the meetup

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,280
is set up you can find it at meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,400
make it we'll be cooking and grilling and sous vide all the things yeah yeah I

67
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,560
think my lady will be here is that right yeah idea will make it the kids will be

68
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,560
here this could be a lot of fun I think Angela's gonna make it so you are you

are also welcome to bring a significant other or or somebody else we won't say

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,880
no yeah what happens at the studio it stays that's right that's right it's

71
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,400
like mini Vegas right here so meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting that's

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,480
when we're gonna be celebrating our 200th episode but since we're not doing

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,120
that today we have some work to get done oh we got some really really great

74
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,880
information in an interview that happened over at Engadget or no I'm

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,060
sorry ours technica with folks on the Android project they talked to Android

76
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,440
execs Dave Burke and Stephanie's yacht kubertson I you know what I shouldn't

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,040
have even started nope I shouldn't have I'm trying to learn just Android execs

78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,560
just yeah and I could have just left it at that nobody would have cared no it

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,920
would have been fine but I just kept going you'd think I haven't been doing

80
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,120
this maybe 101 you'll be oh my gosh anyways you don't care about half the

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,720
stuff in here I'm betting unless you're a huge Android fan and you're probably

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,280
listening to different podcasts if you are or additionally but there was

83
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,040
something in here that was really good and juicy for us Linux users they talk

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,880
in here about the really freaking old Linux kernels and if you have not

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,960
listened to a recent episode we've kind of gone over this a little bit current

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Android pixel the one that like Wes has got there is that in his pocket it is

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,980
shipping with a really old version of the Linux kernel one from 2014 and that

88
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,400
was an LTS kernel which is no longer being maintained by Greg KH pointed he

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,840
made on Greg is a point he made a lot of noise about in fact he even did like one

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,880
more like sympathy release of patches because he knows so many Android devices

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,280
oh yeah 3.18 dot 31 yeah which is no longer getting support upstream so

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,880
Google is now essentially running a unsupported unmaintained version of

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,000
Linux kernel and hopefully back porting fixes I mean it works so well for my

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,920
router Chris I thought maybe on the phone it would be good too of course and

95
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,520
this is by the way best-case scenario this is on the pixel so if you got like

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,080
a Samsung s6 or something in your pocket I'm betting it's even worse and so

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,120
rightfully so rightfully so ours asked them about this and they say what is

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,000
your thinking about the Linux kernel you ship a super old one right now from 3

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
dot 18 that's from 2014 what are you gonna do about this you're stuck

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,440
maintaining this until 2019 because the pixel yeah and and so Burke comes right

101
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,080
back and says well we have 4.4 working internally now here's the problem with

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,640
4.4 is that means they're not shipping it yet it means it might be shipping on

103
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,320
the next Android device possibly that's a possibility the next official Google

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,840
Android device but if they don't have shipping now that's not that's not very

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,160
4.4 is already getting old yeah and it's maintained until February of 2018

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,420
Google wants to provide three years of security updates so it's gonna have to

107
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,680
maintain kernel 4.4 on its own from 2018 for basically the beginning of 2018

108
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,360
until 2020 it's a long time so even though they're just so we it's great

109
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,160
they got 4.4 internally but it's it's like not enough too little too late it

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,920
is I think a big problem and I think it's one that could really kind of bite

111
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,960
them in the butt especially because what's holding them back isn't their

112
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,320
their effort or their enthusiasm for it it's silicon manufacturers and this if

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,240
you recall goes back to project treble yeah where they're trying to abstract

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,200
away the hardware manufacturers so they say take the pixel for example it's a

115
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,760
Qualcomm device so we have to stick with what Qualcomm supports now we're gonna

116
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,080
try to be more prescribed about which kernel version you have to ship with a

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,680
new device and we're going to work with the Lenaro community where's my bell

118
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,480
that's a key that's a key point the Lenaro community that is an

119
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,600
organization in group that is structured in kind of like two main

120
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,800
parts Lenaro is for my understanding and this is my rough understanding is Lenaro

121
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
has a has a core fork of the company that's super focused on Linux kernel and

122
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,680
drivers and Linux core subsystems on ARM then they have another fork of the

123
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,200
company the second branch of the company which is really focused on ARM chips you

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,040
know the whole system on a chip ecosystem environment getting those

125
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,560
vendors to work with patents and licensing and all that stuff that's

126
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,440
that's my rough understanding of Lenaro so what they are planning to do from

127
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,280
reading this entire interview now I'm summarizing for you is they're planning

128
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,200
to work with Lenaro to essentially pick up Greg KH's work and Lenaro may become

129
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,680
sort of an extended LTS maintainer with their own fork of the Linux kernel that

130
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,160
Android is using and they say in the interview that they're gonna get more

131
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,680
directly involved with that interesting so we could have like an Android fork of

132
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,600
the kernel that gets maintained for an additional year outside of what the

133
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,200
standard I should be like pleased because I want more official or better

134
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,880
maintenance or more upkeep or to be like this feels like a compromise on all sides

135
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
mr. Veritunda you had a question about communities maybe moving to other

136
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,240
projects well it just occurs to me okay right that there are hold on say again

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,680
you cut yourself off it just occurs to me that there are already embedded links

138
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,960
projects out there like you know open wrt and LED project which have recently

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,320
merged again which already target no Android or sort of you know on

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,400
platforms I don't understand quite why okay everyone's trying to reinvent the

141
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,560
wheel okay when it comes to sort of like these kind of projects because I mean

142
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,140
you know open wrt very up-to-date with their lake of tunnels they get in lake

143
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,160
expects and they have a good ecosystem in packages and stuff so why can't they

144
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,960
base it around that well you know I don't think they're gonna base it on

145
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,720
open wrt that if they're gonna do it they do it something like a fuchsia or

146
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,080
whatever it's called their new the new OS that's not Linux based that they're

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,600
toying around with I think though the real answer is is that Android is just

148
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,080
simply its own beast now it's its own ecosystem it's its own everything it's

149
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,560
it's it is its own market force and so it just doesn't matter what you what

150
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,560
else is out there because it's so huge you you still enjoying the pixel are you

151
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,220
it's are you well I just heard a lot of questions about the WWC event and the

152
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,880
pre-show and I thought maybe Wes has been looking over the fence and you know

153
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,160
because I I look at these things and I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go on some

154
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,080
sort of Android rant here but I find it a little disappointing I feel like

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Google is a pretty big company with a lot of really smart people and I think a

156
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,040
lot of them get open source and Linux there I think you're right about that

157
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,920
yeah but yet it feels like they've really compromised on this stuff and

158
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
they just keep compromising on this stuff and I mean I would certainly say

159
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,080
it is not up to it's not it's not so far away but it's certainly not up to the

160
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:24,800
fit and finish of iOS or an iOS device for me that's okay the pixel is at the

161
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,400
point where it's like pretty much good enough in that like it's not ugly it

162
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,360
doesn't offend me to have in my pocket or carry around the performance is good

163
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,520
it doesn't bother me with lots of the old Android you know oh why is my app

164
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
just stalling or whatever so I don't see those things so it is like day-to-day

165
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,120
use cases the camera I like and it's fast so those problems are mostly gone

166
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
at least in my day-to-day uses yeah it doesn't have the kind of

167
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,720
seamlessness it doesn't have all the thought that's put into it obviously but

168
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,500
you're touching on something there at WWE I'm not I'm wondering are you an

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,480
Android user WWE yes I'm stuck on some older versions right now unfortunately

170
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,960
I think I'm on KitKat on my phone is your phone nearby because if you go in

171
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,160
today about I'd be curious and what do you think do you think like this stuff

172
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,080
like the kernel version on the phone and stuff is it just something that only

173
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,440
matters to me because I even understand what a Linux kernel is it maybe I'm the

174
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,520
only one that thinks this matters because it works right at the end of the

175
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,520
day it's a tool I think it matters because you want it to be secure I think

176
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,840
most people would want their phone to be secured in the most average of users

177
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,240
because of the ecosystem how people like the vendors are pretty much it's Google

178
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,920
works with these third-party vendors whoever it is that they're not in

179
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,920
control of it like Apple is they're the ones who are being bent over the barrel

180
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,760
and being told oh no we're not going to support this right there's no if all

181
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,560
calm says we're done they're done yeah exactly so it's like like I want this is

182
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:02,020
why I'm sad like a good to phone or edge or whatever didn't take off as well as

183
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,600
it should have because or in Firefox mobile sure yes and do well because we

184
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,280
were stuck with these companies that don't you know get that there are people

185
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,440
that want these phones either cheap secure ones or maybe they want a more

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,920
for a better one that's secure and it's not happening yeah I would I would love

187
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
so the pixel to me seems like a premiumly priced phone so I would love

188
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
if that meant you get premium and I would love it if it meant you got

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
premium security to how has there not been more of an enterprise angle here

190
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,720
to say that again run I said or reasonable security I mean the fact that

191
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,080
it's they're gonna update to that was released two years ago I mean you think

192
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,000
they're back porting right they're back porting fixes and whatnot well they say

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that but we don't know yeah I mean and part of it is well that's a good point

194
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,560
like part of it is they're back porting they're back porting the big things that

195
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,880
they are aware of that doesn't mean they're getting everything I think it's

196
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,440
I think it's a little naive to assume that every fix makes it onto the bug

197
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,800
list and every security patch isn't just which isn't just considered a bug fix is

198
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,480
properly addressed in fact Linus himself says that he considers security fixes

199
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
and but and just like bugs to be the same kind they're the same level of fix

200
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,600
it they're just fixes and I wouldn't be surprised if that mentality isn't a bit

201
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
pervasive and so sometimes things that might be a little iffy on the

202
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,880
security side are just marked as a bug fix nobody notices because the

203
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,440
developers himself found it or herself found it makes the fix submits it it

204
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
gets accepted and it's patched and it just rolls out the next version of the

205
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,680
kernel and because there was never a CVE attached to it it means that it just

206
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,000
sits there rotting in these old kernels right I mean it's like it works okay I

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,760
guess if you have the you know just update your kernels which I think is

208
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,400
pretty much what the kernel community would tell you right just update your

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
kernel we try hard not to break things update your kernel that doesn't work

210
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,240
when you have based your project on this 14 relationship so ww's on 3.4 kernel

211
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:10,000
3.4 ouch I have an Android 6 I think that's not super old but it's in there

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,360
it's getting there now well I also have a Nexus device so I you know the fact

213
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,720
that I'm and I think it's some like probably six months or so they said

214
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,480
they're gonna just continue my device entirely so that's fantastic oh wow yeah

215
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,640
I so very tune do you think it's kind of a shame that Android isn't known for one

216
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:36,080
of Linux is better traits which is supporting older hardware yeah there you

217
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,840
go you're good you're good you just got to hold down that push to talk you're

218
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,280
good you just got a hold of that yes okay so the like I said okay I mean

219
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,480
Linux is pretty much well known for running on old hardware and you know

220
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,080
even if you go back to sort of like the the kind of last incarnations of you

221
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,600
know PCs ten years ago you can still run a pretty modern kernel on that kind of

222
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,100
hardware you try and do that on a phone not a chance because you know for one

223
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,280
thing here are the hardware match actually stand up start to update the

224
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,560
drivers to fix you know new problems Carol and new systems or anything like

225
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,640
that so I don't know what's going on with that yeah it is it is a bit it's a

226
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,160
bit of a shame you know that's a bit of a downer let's talk about a part of a

227
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,600
solution this is just a natural segue it's ting I mean really a part of it is

228
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,480
the carrier there and ting is a mobile is mobile in a totally different it

229
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,920
totally different light it's a much simpler approach it's a much more

230
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,880
understandable way to do mobile and they don't have like this huge branding

231
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,600
strategy where they need to integrate in a certain part of their branding to the

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
phone which holds up releases they just they don't even play in that arena

233
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,640
that's why I love ting those are the top features for me but what really draws

234
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
people in is the way that the payments system works so it's it's just six

235
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,560
dollars for a line just six thought so you want two phones you want one phone

236
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,200
okay it's six dollars one second phone six dollars you want third phone six

237
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,000
dollars really simple and then you're just your usage on top of that so your

238
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
minutes your messages and your megabytes and it's really clear and you often the

239
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,800
average ting bill for a line is like 23 bucks they have nationwide coverage

240
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,600
there's no contracts there's no real determination fees you just pay for what

241
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,640
you use they have a very very well built control panel they have a full range of

242
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,320
devices or you can bring your own CDMA or GSM you pick and if you bring one

243
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,600
they'll just give you a service credit which probably pay for more than your

244
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,040
first month they have such great customer service too and check out their

245
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,320
blog as a small business owner who uses ting I got to say it really does work

246
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
well for a small business and they've been featuring a couple of different

247
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,720
businesses recently I I probably would say I encourage family plans Morris you

248
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,320
know if you got kids or people you just want to have several people or in my

249
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,480
case when we had a nanny for a while we actually got her a phone so we always

250
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,160
knew we'd have good reliable communications with her when she had the

251
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,960
kids and to us that was worth the six bucks a month and now you look at it and

252
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm now I think about it so much more as a business owner about how I can when we

253
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,240
have events and things like that how I can use ting and they actually just

254
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,240
highlighted a lavender farm oh yeah business pretty cool you can get

255
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,680
started by doing us a favor visit linux.ting.com linux.ting.com take $25

256
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,040
off a device or get a service credit and then visit the blog and read around if

257
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,880
you even if you're not ready to switch yet check out all the stuff just so you

258
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,080
are familiar with so when that time does come and it will my friend you will be

259
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,200
ready you will be prepared linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for

260
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,560
sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com little community service

261
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,120
announcement before we move on because I've seen a few people getting caught by

262
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,600
surprise your old version of Skype that you've been hanging on to clinging on to

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,560
version 4.3 yeah the cute version of Skype is being retired before our

264
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,760
barbecue on July 1st 2017 well it goes away no more Skype for you you will not

265
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,520
be able to use it you must switch over to the new Skype for Linux beta which I

266
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,800
think as we record right now is at version 5.3 it's really getting pretty

267
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,560
good actually yeah I was gonna say what do you what do you think about I know

268
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,040
like there were some early issues we had here in the studio with it you tell me

269
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,400
you've been using it now for weeks on tech snap working pretty good yeah it

270
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,800
really does seem to be the video picture seems fine the audio quality seems

271
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
pretty good I haven't had any crashing or it seems like much better than it was

272
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,440
when the beta first launched and it's nice that it has you know the Linux

273
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,160
hopefully this time around there you know it feels like they're doing Linux

274
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,320
with Linux in mind from the get-go so hopefully we won't end up with like oh

275
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,080
yeah never mind you'll never get updates again yeah I know the word on

276
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,840
the street is is that that that Linux client is the new Skype for life like

277
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,600
all platforms guys see that they're treating it seriously yeah so it is

278
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,080
actually pretty decent the thing is is there's they really they have no choice

279
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,920
because all the competitors are getting pretty damn good too and WebRTC is maybe

280
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,600
yeah thing now yeah WebRTC is looking pretty good like Jitsi is is great I use

281
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,440
that a lot for guests yeah because I can just send them a URL and Skype really

282
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,280
has to up their game that's pretty much what it comes down to I have I'll leave

283
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,880
this more as a resource linked for folks in the show notes but I hear this

284
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,920
question a lot what's the difference between Google Chrome and Chromium on

285
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Linux specifically like why do I want to run Chrome over Chromium or do I maybe

286
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,200
want to run Chromium for privacy reasons so I guess the main difference is just a

287
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,760
couple is colorful logo on Chrome blue only logo for Chromium obviously user

288
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,240
metrics are sent if they're turned on report crashes are sent if they're

289
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,080
turned on out-of-the-box video and audio codecs for Chrome are AAC, HD64, MP3, Opus,

290
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,520
Theora, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, and WAV. It has the sandbox to PP API non free flash

291
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,160
plug-in which they maintain it's code tested specifically the sandbox is

292
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,360
turned on by default single deb and RPM package and it stores them in slightly

293
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,200
different locations because one's called Google Chrome and one's called Chromium

294
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,320
the major differences on the Chromium side so here's what you don't get by

295
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,320
using Chrome you don't get HD 64 out of the box it's dependent on your distro it

296
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,280
does support the Netscape API and those are unsandboxed which is how it runs

297
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,480
flash which means it's a little more dangerous version of a flash living on

298
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,840
the edge it's quote-unquote considered maintained by distributions not by

299
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,640
Google directly and the sandboxing depends on the distribution you can go

300
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,920
to about colon sandbox to confirm if yours is on or not pretty much

301
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,440
configures that in the same save in the same place except for the folders hold

302
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,400
Chromium also you don't get that colorful logo right new only and maybe

303
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,080
the other big thing is is the new releases are and testing are depending on

304
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,200
patched up by the distro right which is kind of a big difference whereas when

305
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,760
you install the deb or RPM of Google Chrome it adds a repo and then you get

306
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,600
updates from the gooks I end up running Chrome myself I just go straight Chrome

307
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,880
I have Chromium like over here on a system I don't use a lot it's not like

308
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,400
one of my mains my mate like the soundboard system right here I have

309
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,480
Chromium on that but this system that I'm here presenting I want to make sure

310
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
that HD 64 and a AC work that's kind of if it's just a browser because hey I

311
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
might need to look up something on Stack Overflow works just yeah so I just wanted

312
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,700
to pass that along so that way you guys would just maybe could reference this or

313
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,280
reference that link in the show notes that people ask you because I get the

314
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,800
question at time yeah you know the Google GOG they're not good old games

315
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,520
anymore they're having a sale the AI war fleet command is the one I picked up

316
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,680
today it's pretty cool-looking game it's like this you you have a whole

317
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,540
bunch of bots and you send them to fight off against each other and it's that

318
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,920
sounds fun it actually it was but you're telling me there's a Linux oh oh my god

319
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,600
jeez good old games autoplay fail oh sorry guys if you didn't just so you

320
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,560
know that hurt me more than hurt you this is oh yeah oh yeah full-on full-on

321
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Linux support $1.99 right now for some of these games it's like some of these

322
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,120
games are 80% off or something that's why I mentioned it it's their summer

323
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,280
sale going on right now okay I'm gonna have to take a look after the show no

324
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,480
sponsorship intended no no what is it called no product placement this is just

325
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,640
the loose of the game I picked up this morning before the show and it looks

326
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,560
pretty good and with that big old sale going on it's kind of neat it's kind of

327
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,600
neat they have a whole bunch of other stuff on there too so yeah $1.99 crazy

328
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,680
$1.99 you can't go wrong with that can't go wrong with that all right mr. West we

329
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,680
are gonna be talking about gnome a lot today that's kind of what I wanted to

330
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,640
make the bulk of this show about was just so we had an episode that was just

331
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,680
sort of dedicated to this where the title kind of matches with the contents

332
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,840
about assuming we have a gnome title you can do it guys hint hint hint hint

333
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,920
hint so this is one of our last community updates for the week before we

334
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,080
get into the gnome topic and that's just because it sort of segues us perfectly

335
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,680
into it there is a collaboration going on right now at canonicals office in

336
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,640
Taipei where gnome developers and Ubuntu developers are in attendance and

337
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,920
they're working to greatly improve gnomes high DPI support oh so hot damn

338
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,880
if canonical hasn't even yet shipped an Ubuntu based desktop and they're already

339
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,320
I mean this is the exact kind of collaboration I wanted to see yeah when

340
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,960
Ubuntu switches to gnome and they're working on something called a

341
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,880
fractional scaling which is more like how unity and I think elementary OS is

342
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Luna desktop instead of just like one or two you can have like in between there

343
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,800
yes exactly and it kind of requires a whole reworking our gnome supports one

344
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,760
to one and two to one scaling only and on multi monitor systems is the same DPI

345
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,080
scaling across all displays which drives me crazy and so it's annoying some of

346
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,040
the issues this hack fest is aiming to fix is to support different fractional

347
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,280
scaling values in mutter and gnome shell by upscaling the widgets and then

348
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,760
downscaling to the requested value at the compositing time so they want to

349
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
draw shell you at a higher resolution they're going to draw the UI for the

350
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
shell at a higher resolution than what the logical pixels correspond to then

351
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,120
they'll do non integer scaling adaptations and they're also working on

352
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,480
ex whale and client support to a degree so I I'm I'm really really really happy

353
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,040
about this because this particular type of high DPI support is really sort of

354
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,520
next-level high DPI so yeah and this is one area that I would like I mean it you

355
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,720
know it impacts buying decisions it impacts how I want to build system oh

356
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,200
yeah sure so that's good really change a lot of stuff yeah and so there's more

357
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,680
info in the blog post at the blog.nome.org site that we have LinkedIn here

358
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,080
for the developer who's going a really cool to see this happening also crazy

359
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,520
the canonical as offices in Taipei yeah they're just all over the place today I

360
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,200
learned today yeah indeed so that's pretty neat and when when do we see the

361
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,080
fruits of that labor who knows who knows maybe that but maybe that'll get things

362
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,320
a little bit just a little bit closer so that way your terminals look even better

363
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,400
I actually can't need those sexy terminals I actually kid but you know

364
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,120
the the high DPI terminal that's no joke that is that is no joke Wes you know

365
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,320
you're a gnome user right that's right okay so let's let's get let's get ready

366
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,900
to talk about gnome because I I have many things to discuss here and the

367
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,880
future looks bright Wes is running the gnome shell I'm running the gnome shell

368
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,800
live in person we probably have some people in the chat room and in the

369
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,600
mumble room running the gnome shell maybe you at home are running the gnome

370
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,920
shell that's so exciting so let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for

383
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,480
digitalocean.com let's start with my favorite gnome

384
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,680
extension getting a really solid update this is the one that I think everybody

385
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,160
who starts installing a gnome extensions installs this one and I want to

386
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,080
actually maybe stop for a second because I know I just realized I'm gonna get

387
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,240
flamed but yes I I'm this is gonna come across as like hey load your gnome

388
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,280
system up with all these extensions and have that at Haas just go crazy this is

389
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,280
a disclosure here the Linux unplugged show recommends that you have a balanced

390
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,980
diet approach to your extensions don't overdo it moderation is key people we're

391
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,440
just gonna give you some cool ones right here off the top we're not advocating

392
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,100
you run a thousand extensions and a lot of you plasma users will probably be

393
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,520
laughing at us as we do this but so dash to dock is a very popular gnome

394
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,720
extension maybe the most popular that takes the favorites and puts it as a

395
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,680
dock a persistent dock that can hide well version 59 which is available right

396
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,920
as we go on the air has added multi monitor support boy we're getting real

397
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,240
folks yeah multi monitor groups now it's just the same damn dock on each screen

398
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,080
right now but there are a couple of nice things there's also improved high DPI

399
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,120
support ding ding ding ding and if you're not using something like the app

400
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,240
indicator extensions that puts them up in the by your clock if you're like you

401
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,200
still have that little tabby default gnome thing where all your tray icons go

402
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,280
they've specifically built in some smarts to to make sure that they're not

403
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,120
blocking that anymore so dash to dock solid extension you already knew about

404
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,080
gets a pretty good update so go update now let's start with something new that

405
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,320
maybe you haven't seen big props to Joey over at OMG Ubuntu for just really

406
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,560
killing it yeah dude is recognized a need for a gnome coverage and is

407
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,200
killing it arc is a new applications menu for gnome shell so not everybody

408
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,400
likes the activities overlay this fixes that arc menu is an alternative app

409
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,920
launcher for gnome shell replaces the activities button the top bar with a

410
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,480
traditional start menu style launcher and it works nicely with things like

411
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,800
dash to dock and panel extension what happens when you super key does it does

412
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,280
it can I still type to complete that's what I want to know I think so although

413
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,360
the big thing I miss from other versions I don't know see for me I'm not big on

414
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,520
this is being existed in an extension I will not be installing yeah I like just

415
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,160
that yeah super key to type three letters and launch I'm good but I want

416
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,320
you know this comes up because I'm kind of playing with like what systems would

417
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,160
I have for my mom right and so one of the problems I have I like the like

418
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,720
mate approach of you know explorable but it doesn't work well once they've

419
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,800
migrated to like they know the applications it's way too tedious yeah

420
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,240
they do need some I like that like I love that about the gnome desktop and I

421
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,080
don't understand why they chose arc as the launcher name it's a bad name it's

422
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,520
named it's good it's overlapping with the most popular gnome theme and I I did

423
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,480
some digging I can't tell I don't think the projects are related I don't know

424
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,940
it's very confusing very confusing this one's also gonna confuse a lot of you

425
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,880
xmonad awesome tiling window manager users out there g tile is an extension

426
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,440
for gnome that turns gnome when you want it into a tiling desktop and once it's

427
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,900
installed you click a little tile icon in the gnome menu up top you'll see a

428
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,240
little overlay come up with a whole bunch of squares the g tile overlay will

429
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
hover over an open window and then you can click one or more of the squares to

430
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,660
place the window in that area so it's like a grid the row of icons then

431
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,320
display the dimension control and the controls of the screener is titled right

432
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,000
there so you can see what the screen title is if you just want to divvy up

433
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,400
your screen into 16 equal chunks you can do that by choosing four by four the

434
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,280
really nice thing about g tile is you're not locked into tiling new windows

435
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,880
aren't automatically put on the grid boom and existing windows aren't locked

436
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,120
so you have the best of both worlds and that's one that I might actually end up

437
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,000
installing because there are times where I want to organize AF and then there are

438
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,920
times where I want to just be wild yeah that one's one of my favorites

439
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,520
especially because like the default of just left and right is not enough oh go

440
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,880
on yeah it's not worth even bothering oh really it's it if the reason to do

441
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,600
tiling is because you're you're using your keyboard g-tiles a hundred percent

442
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,600
miles controlled oh the reason I yes I guess I kind of agree the reason why the

443
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,640
reason why I like tiling though for me we just before organizing a whole lot of

444
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,960
windows and stuff right every time you every time you close that window or you

445
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,160
know the next day you open it it's not there that you the reason I do it is I

446
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,880
organize my tiling so that it the next time I load the application it's all

447
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,100
tiled together in the same way yeah g-tiles always you have to do it

448
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,760
manually every single time what I really want is I want perfect never fail

449
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,440
placement of my windows when I hook up my second screen I want I want all my

450
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,800
windows to go right back where I had them perfectly there's there is a an option

451
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,840
for people who want the tiling that does have features that are more like recall

452
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,120
into tiling this called a shell shape and it's not really an extension it's a

453
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,160
replacement for gnome shell so it's it's gnome shell but it's a modified gnome

454
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,280
shell to make this possible because the reason why g-tile doesn't have these

455
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,880
features is because gnome itself can't do the the full-blown structure based on

456
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,220
the way it's built well Michael you're a you're a you're a fan of the gnome

457
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,240
workflow so what is it about the gnome quote-unquote workflow that you try to

458
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,560
adapt over on the plasma desktop well I'd say the the the style of having

459
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,640
everything all in one so when you like the act the activities overview where

460
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,160
you have the windows and you have the the the top bar and the the dock and the

461
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,520
workspace I guess it's a dock to all that in one thing and also the flow of

462
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,120
having all the workspaces in a vertical structure rather than a grid yeah

463
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,720
because it's a lot easier to scroll up and down on your mouse or rather than

464
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,080
having a keyboard shortcut where you got to do the different arrows in different

465
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,160
directions and stuff you know there's that but the I don't know if you could

466
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,720
give the whole one-click button start searching for whatever you want as a as

467
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,840
a gnome thing I'm not really sure what started that just like a launcher thing

468
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,400
in general and krunner does a fair job of that I mean windows does that yeah so

469
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,700
yeah yeah when it's actually I know I think about it's probably when I give

470
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,640
the nod to quicksilver myself I think that's where it started was quick so

471
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,440
quick silver and then the gnome dude came over in synapse and yeah well

472
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,640
Windows Vista had it and now I think about it huh so what's older quick

473
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,280
silver somebody in the chat room go do some sleuthing online you what's older

474
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,160
the mag launcher quick silver or Windows Vista I wonder although Windows Vista

475
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,160
probably was in development before a quick silver ever hit the market so

476
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,520
there's that okay I've got I just got a couple more extensions unless would you

477
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,080
have any other workflow things well I mean the other thing is I do like the

478
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,160
dynamic workspace and that's the only thing that's not possible in plasma I

479
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,160
that would be really nice to have but as far as like the gnome workflow that is

480
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,520
really cool yeah yeah I do like to have workspaces as well there's there's also

481
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,280
this one more thing that has absolutely nothing to do with anything and it's

482
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,960
really the only thing that bothers me that I can't have on plasma there's an

483
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,480
extension in gnome called quick close overview and all it does is allow you to

484
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,600
middle click a window in the overview to like grid thing and just close it from

485
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,200
there and that is such a huge time-saver hmm you know what this is so stupid but

486
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,000
you know what I miss when I'm on plasma is none of the plasma applets whatever

487
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,640
they're called the check the Bitcoin price work they all just unfortunate and

488
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,760
I and right now it's just it's so much fun right there you're watching at it

489
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,480
it's fun I really that's the glint in your eye I really you know there's small

490
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,520
things about like I really like the top bar on gnome especially when I have the

491
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,200
top icons extension that way all of my system tray stuff is up there and then

492
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,280
it's the rest of the UI is completely just my my application I'm using full

493
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,600
screen I just have a very tiny thin bar with the time day an elegant little bar

494
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,720
I like it yeah especially what's very functional theme and then you hit you

495
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,640
hit the super key and you got a you got a pretty good built-in launcher they can

496
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,760
even launch things like the display control panel and stuff like that which

497
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
is between that and then like the improvements to dash to dock it's really

498
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,160
kind of the whole deal so quicksilver came out three years before Vista oh it

499
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,800
might be quicksilver then damn that is a long time ago yeah I'm surprised even

500
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,640
remember the name of it or surely someone will tell us about an obscure

501
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,480
window manager that was doing it totally I would think so let us really yeah and

502
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,040
the command line actually yeah right the original launcher I got one more

503
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,640
extension okay am I the flight I might have to and again I'm just telling you

504
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,560
these are this one kind of feels like maybe a lighter one that maybe wouldn't

505
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,960
wouldn't wreck things this is a Nautilus a git integration extension now hold on

506
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,720
don't get don't get excited what don't get excited it's not like you're not

507
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,680
checking in out of github with Nautilus here I actually think it's better than

508
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,560
that though it is instead a simple extension that just adds important

509
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,700
information about the current local git directory you're browsing so when you

510
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,720
browse into a git directory on your file system it gives you relevant things like

511
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,200
the git directory info the status of the git files you can open a remote URL you

512
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,600
can select a specific branch you can compare commits in Nautilus so this

513
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,920
again I the reason why I bring this up because I have this picture I have this

514
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,240
picture after going to Dell of developers that buy smart Sputnik laptops

515
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,360
by the millions to SSH into Ubuntu boxes and they're they're pushing and

516
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,600
pulling help me cloud github with their continuous integration and they're doing

517
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,920
all this stuff and now when they want to browse a local github directory they've

518
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,640
checked out they get a bunch of great additional information just overlaid

519
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,440
right into their file manager I'm gonna have to try this and because the damn

520
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,120
thing's not trying to be a whole github client it's not like it's some huge hack

521
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,120
in the extension it's just pretty simple information yeah wow it's pretty good

522
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,000
that's great I mean I know a lot of people get this kind of you know you

523
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,120
already have it maybe in your terminal and stuff so it seems super helpful yeah

524
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,320
yeah I think it's pretty nice it would be great if they added things like side

525
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,240
by side diff and there's PPAs out there if you're on the Ubuntu's and of course

526
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,640
it's up on the GNOME extension site and github and then ladies and gentlemen the

527
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,160
one that out of all of these I think I will be setting up for our studio

528
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,000
machines if they stay known is app folder management so this is an

529
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,040
extension that allows easy management of app folders directly from the

530
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,480
applications view that looks nice yeah so you can create folders and as a

531
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,600
bonus feature it's possible to change columns in the folder and stuff like

532
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,320
that so it's actually you can you get additional nice features but you can

533
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,320
create new app folders you get a nice dialogue to do it you can add those

534
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,520
applications with cool sub menus and stuff you can remove applications from

535
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,080
the folders you can delete the app folder and the files go the application

536
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,440
icons go back it's sort of like how on Android or iOS you can you can move all

537
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,320
of your launcher items into folders and it creates a dynamic folders and it kind

538
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,800
of seems like a obvious feature like I when I thought about this is like I was

539
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,000
kind of amazed that this isn't built in so this adds that a lot of the kind of

540
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,240
customization that you would probably assume that you do so here in the studio

541
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,040
I could do like you know we could have in one folder we could have the x32

542
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,400
mixer stuff you could have the Skype stuff the mumble stuff easy for me yeah

543
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,440
and we are back so no I'm just crashed on us that's kind of ironic I'm not

544
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,400
joking summary of the show folks this is a this is a bit of an awkward thing for

545
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,120
me right now this is my love song to gnome because I think it's such a great

546
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,200
desktop and I think it has such a strong future and yet I think I'm switching

547
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,880
away and I'm gonna be talking about that more but I just I want to continue

548
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,280
being positive about gnome but I do have to acknowledge that we just had to stop

549
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,760
broadcast and we had to stop and re-edit here and all of that because no crashed

550
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,340
on us again so we are going down a path but and this is a system by the way the

551
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,320
one that crashes the most is the system with almost no extensions just for the

552
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,560
record the only extension that has is dash to dock and the ping extension

553
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,560
yikes there you have it yeah yeah it's good times it's good times do any other

554
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,480
machines suffer from this in the studio we have three gnome desktops that crash

555
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,680
every day they're all similar hardware Nvidia arch core i7 like a generation

556
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,800
ago yeah it's happening quite a bit that's kind of wow yeah yeah that's a

557
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,520
bit of drag it really is like yesterday I was in the middle of working and so on

558
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,200
my system upstairs gnome crashes three times it crashed crashed crashed and the

559
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,960
reason I know is because I was looking at the log and looking at journal CTL and I

560
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,760
can see it crashing reloading crashing and then reloading and every time it

561
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,320
crashes I just get a segfault and then I then I get a whole bunch of like a

562
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,840
bunch of errors from extensions and I get a whole bunch of garbage from when

563
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
gnome starting up and looking for icons and loading caches and stuff and then

564
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,360
and then it dumps again and then it tries again dumps again and here it

565
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,040
seems to dump twice or something like I haven't quite because it's always when

566
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm in the middle of like broadcasting so I don't like I don't study it like I

567
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,320
do at my workstation and then on Sunday before Linux action news I was just

568
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,080
sitting here nothing was happening on this computer in front of me with except

569
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,720
for Chrome but I wasn't even using the mouse or keyboard I was just sitting

570
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,240
here chatting with Joe before the next action news and it crashed on me that

571
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,000
sucks yeah so that's three different systems all with similar builds though

572
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,720
yeah I haven't seen very much of that but I don't have any Nvidia systems

573
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,080
running gnome right now or systems that are up for very long it's making me like

574
00:41:52,080 --> 00:42:00,440
rethink like goes go minimal go small go go X F C E go L X D E just go tiny

575
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,280
desktop for the OBS machine because I just don't want that to be a factor

576
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,080
instability we wanted big like we have a lot of people that are you we have

577
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,440
different people some people use Linux more some people use Linux less they're

578
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,620
using all of these systems yeah and so we wanted something very approachable we

579
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,760
wanted something people who might be familiar with and so gnome shell seems

580
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,160
like a good idea yeah yeah and it's also my if I'm gonna use a Linux desktop it's

581
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,040
my preferred Linux desktop so if I gotta sit in front of a bunch of Linux

582
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,320
machines all there it just works yeah and then I'm comfortable and I'm quick

583
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,360
when I'm on air and my my my sort of muscle memory to use the computer I can

584
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,760
rely on that while I'm talking so I can edit something on OBS while I'm still

585
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,120
talking and I it it all changes when you're in a desktop environment you're

586
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,120
not super familiar with but I think the crashing it almost it almost impacts does

587
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,200
it hit tech snap yet oh it's you know maybe not it's almost hit every show

588
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,480
I've done I'm sure it will at some point this same machine before it was running

589
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,640
gnome ran for a year with I was gonna say yeah right and it's only been and

590
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,120
these the machines that are exhibiting crashes now it's only been with the last

591
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,080
couple of months because they too have been running gnome 3 on arch for quite a

592
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:15,560
while now so anyways yeah yeah there you go I guess that's all I have I don't

593
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,960
see oh yeah you're right beards totally right that's what I was thinking I was

594
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,760
getting confused because it's happened on this show multiple times yeah yeah I

595
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,720
couldn't quite but it did happen it did happen to text nap yes that's kind of a

596
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,600
trick it's kind of a trick and it's even with systems that are pre minimal gnome

597
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,680
shell desktops they're just kind of the stock basic stuff yeah yeah it happens I

598
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,340
guess it happens anyways we shouldn't let it drag down the show because there

599
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,640
is still actually a lot of really good stuff to talk about for gnome what's

600
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,560
coming up and things like that so you can find links to all the extensions we

601
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,560
talked about I think the the one that was sort of appealing to me a bit was

602
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,640
g-tile for light usage but I don't actually think I'll end up using it but

603
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,440
app folders the one we were just talking about app folders does seem like it

604
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,280
would be a good way to go especially if you have other people using your system

605
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,680
and if you are using get a lot the get integration stuff yeah I'm gonna give

606
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,400
that a try just because you know I don't know how much I'll actually use it but

607
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
it seems like it would be handy if I just happen to navigate into a git

608
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,720
folder why not now I'm gonna just toss randomly a topic bomb into the mumble

609
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,760
room there but does anybody else have like a gnome tweak or extension or

610
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,560
setting or something that they do for their gnome desktop that makes it great

611
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,320
and usable for them that you would want to pass along to somebody else trying

612
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,520
out gnome for the first time I got two real quick here I get caffeine should

613
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,560
probably be talked about caffeine is pretty useful yeah the other one that I

614
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,480
don't have installed now but I've used in the past is like it's one that just

615
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,360
installs a Wi-Fi refresh button it doesn't refresh when you open the list

616
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,280
of Wi-Fi those are two great ones caffeine keeps your system awake and

617
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,480
yeah the refresh button should just be built into gnome to refresh the Wi-Fi I

618
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,240
thought so I thought I might be heard something the moment yeah I was just

619
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,280
gonna say that I think auto move windows is an extension that's pretty

620
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,360
much vital for my usage okay I've seen that one a lot what does it do it allows

621
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,160
you to specify what applications which which workspace and a specific

622
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,400
application goes to do you get to say where in the window or is it just go to

623
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,280
workspace to but you don't get to say where in workspace to technically gnome

624
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,000
remembers where you want it if you have this like the location of the pixels

625
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,840
wise but it doesn't remember the workspace and this kind of makes it

626
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,200
combine the two the only negative thing it doesn't have is that it doesn't if

627
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,040
you have more than one monitor it doesn't remember the other monitor but I

628
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,320
think there are is someone else working on a different extension for that that

629
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,680
function okay I kind of like that when I have multiple monitors that my second

630
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,440
monitor stays static when I switch workspaces so I'll throw slack chat

631
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,840
telegram maybe a live stream I'm watching VLC something like that I'll

632
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,040
throw that on my second vertical screen and then I'm switching between four

633
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,400
virtual desktops on my main screen and the slack chats and all that stuff stay

634
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,400
persistent across those desktops lights I can definitely you know there are use

635
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,800
cases for both ways I think yeah oh yeah yeah yeah that's the hard part yeah

636
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,920
because you sometimes it is nice to have a separate that's all yeah yeah there's

637
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:05,640
one more it's the Maximus to extension it's a automatically removes a title

638
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,920
bar or you know the top part of the window when you maximize hmm nice oh

639
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,520
oh yeah okay okay make it a little tighter oh yeah so it like gives you

640
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,080
more more real estate for your window yeah yeah okay good one anybody else in

641
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,280
the number room have any other ideas they don't want to toss in for their

642
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,640
perfect gnome setup chaotic has a sound input output chooser that's a good one

643
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,640
yeah and that's really nice because you hit the menu and then right there in the

644
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,040
drop-down menu you can choose what your output devices and that's handy it's

645
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,720
really nice if you have like a couple of Linux systems of mine in the past when I

646
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,040
booted up they always defaulted to the HDMI audio out and so I always had to

647
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,440
just change that really quick and that drop-down makes that super easy now what

648
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:53,240
I want yeah exactly yeah one that I find quite useful is the num lock and caps

649
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,800
lock indicator on the top bar as well as my keyboard doesn't have that at all

650
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,600
doesn't so yeah I got a couple of keyboards that like smaller keyboards now

651
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,360
that I have that don't have any lights on them for what the keyboard and them

652
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,200
like yeah so that's a good one too yeah all right and then Yuri in the chat

653
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,000
room says that not only does he give a plus one to caffeine but the taskbar

654
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,320
which I played with a bit oh I have not yeah it's it's kind of nice to have a

655
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,320
taskbar so it just puts a really small taskbar of all your open windows across

656
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,160
all your desktops and it's nice but I find myself because I've used known for

657
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,800
so long now that I never click it I very rarely click it because if I really lose

658
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,560
a window I just hit the activities overview and I see everything and I feel

659
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,560
like it's it's one of those things where if you just switched from a desktop that

660
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,600
has a taskbar you're gonna be inclined to add it and you're just gonna probably

661
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,520
use it forever however if you sort of follow my take a balanced approach to

662
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,320
how many extensions you have I would encourage you to just try to follow the

663
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,840
workflow of gnome and maybe cheat by putting dash to dock on the side where

664
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,480
you can see dots for which apps are running back in my day we learned the

665
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,440
gnome workflow and we stuck to it you know I've said it I've said it a hundred

666
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,800
times but you know that's what happens when you have 200 episodes the way I

667
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,160
made gnome work for me when I first switched like back when 312 came out

668
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,440
yeah oh those were the days yeah that was like the note 310 3.8 310 and 312

669
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,680
were like okay no I'm starting to get no it's like where plasma has been now for

670
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,240
like releases and after release where it's just unquestionably getting better

671
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,360
and better and it's like features that you like every release has several

672
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,640
features you want and I decided at that point alright I'm gonna try to make a go

673
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,840
of this and what I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna spend 30 days and every day

674
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm gonna try to do something the gnome way that I was sort of resisting and I

675
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,600
that included trying it without maximize and minimize buttons which I decided

676
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,320
after trying that for a couple days wasn't for me but I gave it a shot yeah

677
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,280
but like the things I did get wrapped my head around was dropping the taskbar

678
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,080
using the super launcher and not like installing gnome do or synaptic just

679
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,680
like using the built-in note like using the multiple desktops embracing

680
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,400
maximizing my screens more than I used to I used to just have tons of windows

681
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,680
all over my screen and now I have one or two windows and then I then I switch

682
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,480
over to another virtual desktop and using some of the snapping out aspects

683
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,920
of gnome taking that 30-day quote-unquote challenge which was just

684
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,560
I was personally doing for myself made my process of adopting no more of an

685
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,560
adventure and it made tolerating the rough edges I felt at the time easier

686
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,120
because what's only for 30 days and but then by the time I got done with it I was

687
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,800
like oh shit oh no I'm actually working faster and better than I ever have on

688
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,000
the Linux desktop before oh that's what they were going for and then I was a

689
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,480
convert and it's really only been until recent stability issues and shell

690
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,800
performance issues that I've really been and obviously the constant improvements

691
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,800
of plasma and the great future of Qt that I've been drawn into the plasma

692
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,560
desktop more and more but gnome shell isn't sitting still no it's certainly

693
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,800
not I mean there's a lot of good things I think we'll both be very curious to

694
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,360
watch this Ubuntu canonical yes we already just talked about some of the

695
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,640
fruits of that labor already and there's other companies they're getting

696
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,760
involved with gnome that I think are gonna make a big difference we'll talk

697
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,240
about them here in a moment there's a big release of gnome coming up just

698
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
around the corner and there's an application that I think is gonna change

720
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,960
Gnome Shell has a big release coming and on the road to that release we're

721
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,960
getting Gnome 3.252 it's the second milestone in the development cycle of

722
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,200
Gnome 3.26 which is the big one and is expected to launch around September 13th

723
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,640
the fall goes as planned now they've been doing steady improvements and

724
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,360
there's many things we could call out I'm just gonna call out a couple of

725
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,720
things because there's a lot that may or may not make it but what has landed is

726
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,800
mutter 3.252 and it's a big update to mutter it fixes some performance issues

727
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,480
not the big ones that I've outlined in user error but it fixes some especially

728
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,880
on non Wayland builds it improves copy and paste operation between the Wayland

729
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,120
and x11 display servers which is huge yeah and it fixes some glitches that

730
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,680
hoping that occurred when opening windows and maximizing windows under

731
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,080
Gnome and a few other issues that people have talked about including support for

732
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,160
other stuff so new mutter really great super excited about the new mutter

733
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,720
which will be landing in the new version of Gnome like I said there's gonna be

734
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,760
other stuff in Gnome some which may make it some which may not but it looks like

735
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,920
one that is gonna make it is a new Gnome disk utility this is great this is

736
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,520
getting to be a fully baked application now it's available for testing if you

737
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,360
want to try it and it's gonna bring a number of improvements under the hood

738
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,600
and cosmetically for example it offers a more clarified meaning of the

739
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,120
encryption settings and in mounting options well that's good yeah and it

740
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,880
implements an intensive autoclear switch for unused loop devices it also is going

741
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,040
to support different types of mime reading for disk so it can give you some

742
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,280
of the names and model types and information that's on there it's gonna

743
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,200
prompt users to stop running jobs that are running on devices before you eject

744
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,760
them which is really nice I'm surprised and do that before actually and it will

745
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,160
also have the ability to implicitly autoclear the handling for the lock and

746
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,960
auto mount buttons and also will have a new app menu entry that lets users

747
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,400
create an empty disk image adds a tooltip for the autoclear switch displays

748
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,080
the UUID of selected volumes by default and implements hints for your pass

749
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:08,440
phrase fields and removes the unused erase disk dialog this is like a usable

750
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,760
tool now yeah I've kind of avoided it just because I'm more familiar with

751
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,360
other tools and what not yeah exactly but hey yeah yeah it I've played around

752
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,840
with the current version a little bit before the show and they're really

753
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,360
they're really putting something that is confusing and difficult and they're

754
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,360
making it easy to use they're gonna make it easier to create blank images so you

755
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,960
can use the ad super helpful yeah you can use them for like as volumes to

756
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,000
store stuff you know put your porn in here put your home clips in here put

757
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,240
your documents in this one then lux encrypt them and now you have these lux

758
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,760
encrypted volumes on your on your system that you can mount and unmount easily

759
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,320
using gnome disk that's really neat isn't really neat so that's a gnome 3.2

760
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,800
6 if you're a gnome user is just looking like such a solid freaking release let's

761
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,440
talk about an app that I think is gonna help the whole gnome ecosystem yeah it's

762
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,700
called builder and you can find out more with the link in the show notes it's an

763
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,720
IDE for gnome that's focused on bringing the power of the gnome and GTK platform

764
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,040
to users and developers in a way that's never really been accessible before and

765
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,040
they're they're they're doing it in such a smart way so not only is the

766
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,800
development just continuing along at a pretty good pace with great features but

767
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,760
they're intelligently adding in support for new features of GTK when the timings

768
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,680
right they've got autocompletion for some of the favorite GTK languages the

769
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,600
things go like C C++ Python Vala rust those things that's awesome yeah so it

770
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,480
makes creating gnome desktop applications much more possible much

771
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,160
easier much more straightforward using a tool that's really really well supported

772
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,000
right now by no so that's gnome builder and I think it's gonna have a big impact

773
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,800
in the long term applications for gnome making them good like look at this this

774
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,080
it's basic but it's really nice it's got an integrated system-wide profiler for

775
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,600
performance along with like I remember when they launched it a couple years ago

776
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,160
and I was like okay great that that seems neat but boy like you know now

777
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,360
it's got performance profiling for your apps and stuff to might have to give this

778
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,720
a shot just yeah some Python because that's and mark down yeah oh mark down

779
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,000
and then I want to talk about a company that in some parts in some ways I should

780
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,960
say is a little mysterious to me and I hope to know more someday but they seem

781
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,960
to have a lot of passion around gnome and they have some funding and they're

782
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,360
making some hires it's endless do you remember endless oh yeah yeah the

783
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,240
creators of the endless computer with the endless operating system about this

784
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,320
a little bit mm-hmm yeah endless OS oh look look at this

785
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,720
way look at this we can explore we can you want to do what you want to explore

786
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,040
let's we can explore in English let's do that let's explore in English endless OS

787
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,480
is a free Linux based operating system that makes using a computer simpler and

788
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,400
accessible for everyone endless OS works easily from the moment you turn it on

789
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,600
just like a smartphone apps are open from the home screen with one simple

790
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,800
click endless OS is designed to be useful even when you're offline quality

791
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,120
content is always at your fingertips so you can find the information you need

792
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,960
when you want it there's an encyclopedia with over 50,000 articles plus tens of

793
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,440
useful information about parenting health culture and so much more there's

794
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,640
a built-in App Center where you can access over 100 applications and add any

795
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,560
favorites to the desktop the best part is they're all free and pre-installed

796
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,080
endless OS is a great tool for school work or home it comes with LibreOffice

797
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,480
completely free so you never have to pay for software licenses there's a word

798
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,840
processor for creating documents a spreadsheet app for budgeting and an

799
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,400
app to make clean and professional presentations you can also open and edit

800
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,880
Microsoft Word PowerPoint and so if you're watching the video it's kind of

801
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,640
obvious this is a gnome based desktop running on top of Linux and endless you

802
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,240
might remember them they had like the bamboo covered ducks remember seeing

803
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,640
those they have these endless computers they have this circular dome computer oh

804
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,760
yeah that's right yeah this thing that kind of looks like a subwoofer almost it

805
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,960
really and then they have mission the mission mini which is so cute yeah the

806
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,760
little okay I want it I kind of want it yeah and this is this is for a different

807
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,960
market than us like the mission of one is a $249 Intel NUC that's wrapped in

808
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,640
bamboo though I mean that's that's like the most badass looking NUC ever look at

809
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:39,120
run arch on that that's fine damn right so endless is doing some hires a long

810
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:45,280
time canonical employee Michael Hall recently left canonical Wow and I

811
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,320
believe has gone to endless and other individuals I probably should name have

812
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,800
also been contracting and working with endless several actually so they seem to

813
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,840
have some funding they seem to have some products they have a couple of deals

814
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,280
with a couple of different stores where they're selling this I think in

815
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,400
California in the store so you can just go into a store that's where they're

816
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,200
based out of okay well yeah I think they have two offices right now and they are

817
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,400
actively contributing my understanding upstream to know because they they plan

818
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,400
to base this thing around no and they plan to use flat packs to distribute

819
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,360
their software it could be it could be interesting because they are specifically

820
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,600
hiring people to work on the community and to work on the code of the gnome

821
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:37,000
desktop you don't often get a lot of companies that that do that for first

822
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,440
for an end user type like you'll get companies that want to improve the ARM

823
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,080
code or the power management but you don't all I mean not a lot these days do

824
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,880
we get companies that want to come in and specifically make the Linux desktop

825
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,040
better they they're trying to build computers for like the next billion

826
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:59,120
people essentially so you know they bit ambitious bit ambitious they they say

827
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,240
our team were small but global we were in 17 countries we have assembled a

828
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,740
world-class team across design software hardware and operations united one goal

829
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,040
to make computing available for users everywhere using Linux and gnome would

830
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:17,400
be a great way to do it absolutely yeah I'm I'm fast like the gnome you know it

831
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,600
seems like their their base is pure enough for this kind of thing like where

832
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,880
you can build on it and you can get something that's simple enough for

833
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,880
people to use especially with what we're talking about like the gnome the disk

834
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,520
manager things like that where we've been griping for a long time about like

835
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,440
yeah you know we don't have these features for things you've redefined

836
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,520
things you're building from the ground up now but maybe we're at the point

837
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,160
where what we what they have is like is it's really sound if I recall the idea

838
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,960
is that they're going to they're gonna deliver updates forever or something

839
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,320
like I can't remember why I can't remember what the endless part comes in

840
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,000
but yeah you could be right West I'm gonna you know what they probably say on

841
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,320
their website endless os.com if you guys want the endless OS comes with

842
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,000
everything your family needs there you have it can we get a clip of that yeah

843
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,760
could be right West just right there yeah it's pretty cool company and they

844
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,200
seem to be pretty involved with gnome so you you combine that now with things

845
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,960
like gnome builder and the path of GTK so I also thought maybe we'd talk a

846
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,440
little bit about GTK 4 which is oh coming down the road not it's not going

847
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,960
to be like a game changer like GTK 3 was from GTK 2 there's gonna be some things

848
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,480
that change right now they're at GTK 3.91 it's available that's going to

849
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:41,280
become GTK for the toolkit they have support for mac OS now GTK apps will be

850
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,520
a target mac OS probably a smart thing cuz cute can do it yeah totally and now

851
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,320
you can run on so now you build a run on Windows you can run GTK apps on a

852
01:01:48,320 --> 01:02:00,000
Mac yeah there's a lot of other work they have queued up for GTK 4 which you

853
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,960
can follow up in the show notes if you want but it's it's actually just want

854
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,880
the cocoa apps on GTK right like that you know somebody needs to do the

855
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,240
reverse let's get some of the Mac apps on the Linux desktop yeah I either way I

856
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,400
think it's it's the future is bright if you look at GTK 4 they seem to be where

857
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,360
they really have their senses about where it's going like there's there's

858
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,280
some improvements there's some things they're adding like some nice Vulcan

859
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,440
support in there yeah I mean there's some good stuff but it's not like a

860
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,520
throwing everything away and we will have forks for a decade because of the

861
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,000
change it's not gonna be that dramatic yeah yeah it's gonna be Rick I says I'm

862
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,960
sure GTK on the Mac will be just as native as it is on Windows hey at least

863
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,760
you can run gimp on Windows it can happen and that's all that matters

864
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,600
that's all that matters I've used that really actually more times than I can

865
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,040
count so it really does it is actually quite useful yeah and you know I think I

866
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,440
think Apple killed off their X server a while ago and so did they think so I

867
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,740
just remember seeing it yeah so I think without this you wouldn't have a way

868
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,740
because you could always do X on the Mac and then run the GTK apps but now I

869
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:04,080
think with this this will solve that problem so future is bright not only for

870
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,780
GTK and GTK 4 but the future is also bright for the gnome desktop for the

871
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,080
companies you're getting involved you've got such this is such a debug term but

872
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,240
you have quote-unquote bilateral support if I could political term we have

873
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,720
bilateral corporate support for the gnome desktop we've already got canonical

874
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,280
working on ways to improve it you got system 76 working on ways to make it

875
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,600
more palatable to consumers you got endless working on ways to make it more

876
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,600
palatable to the next billion computer users gotta be endless yeah and they're

877
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,040
and they're hiring actual people and paying them to work on this stuff gnome

878
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,520
4 is just around the corner it's all pretty good it's all pretty good it's

879
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,000
happening it's funny it's like what kind of dick am I for now switching away

880
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,200
right but you're the gnome desktop Chris where are you I know it is the year of

881
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,920
the gnome desktop and I'm like all right well peace out guys thanks for all the

882
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,740
fish and I'll be over here in plasma land trying to make it as gnome as

883
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:58,160
possible this is the curse that you have bestowed upon yourself oh man I mean

884
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:03,560
what are you going to do are you go wait till Ubuntu comes out in October with

885
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:10,280
their gnome version and hope that doesn't crash get pushed to no man they

886
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:15,280
go yeah we'll take that or no it's gonna go no we're fine we're not gonna do well

887
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,720
like in the case of this fractionated coconut oil high high DPI scaling they

888
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,400
are it's a gnome developer and a canonical employee working together in

889
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,600
the same room and canonical you know has the nice thing about that is the guy

890
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,960
shared this on Google Plus canonical has a whole bunch of high DPI monitors they

891
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,160
can put in the room for testing which he didn't have access to so it's not like

892
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,880
they're just developing it in a in a in a in a room somewhere in some white room

893
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,680
and they're just gonna throw the coat over the fence they actually you know

894
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,480
have the guy on the gnome project working on this in their office so

895
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,080
that's like that's a whole new level of collaboration for them it really is it I

896
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,480
think the future is bright there maybe maybe I'll be back sooner than later you

897
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,040
know cuz this like this crashing problem if this went away the performance issues

898
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,280
I suffer with I feel like yeah you know what I could read I could reload the

899
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,440
gnome shell every few days easy enough right it's easy enough it's not ideal

900
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,800
it's easy enough but the crashing that's that's where I draw the line right that's

901
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,680
where that impacts business mm-hmm and so if but I but I am I am confident that

902
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,960
whatever it is it will eventually get worked out if it is an Nvidia bug issue

903
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:27,800
if it's a if it's a gnome issue if it's a will be green again some weird USB bus

904
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,840
issue for all I know it's weird that also when gnome shell crashes our audio

905
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,280
cuts out a little bit in OBS I don't know what that's about either way our

906
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,600
problem to figure out no one's making good progress so this is sort of my love

907
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,680
song to gnome as I begin to switch away for a little while I'm sure I'll be back

908
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,760
one day friend but thank you for all the great times gnome shell thank you for

909
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,960
all the fun extensions and the enthusiasm and energy around gnome shell

910
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,040
is higher than ever cool great extensions are being created that weren't around a

911
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:59,840
year ago Joey over at OMG Ubuntu is doing great write-ups making it clear

912
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,720
and easy how you get this stuff that he's talking about which is one of the

913
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,840
things Joey really excels at is he's like here's the thing that's really

914
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,160
great here's a few screenshots of it and oh by the way if you're on one of these

915
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,000
distros this is how you get it I love that I tried to do that too we have

916
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,020
links to everything we talked about in the show notes it is going to be the

917
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:23,120
note the year of gnome it really is so don't take my switching away as a sign

918
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,080
that it's it's going away and I'm condemning it I'll be back I'll be back

919
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:35,120
in the meantime I heard plasma 5.10 hurt hit the arch repo stable today oh boy

920
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,320
so all they got to do is go upstairs and update my system and I got plasma time

921
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,800
for Chris tries a tiling window manager all over oh don't start that again I

922
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,880
want to see this time on Wayland what about plasma desktop and window rules

923
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,120
maybe that'll just do what I want where it puts everything where I want I don't

924
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,560
know maybe I'm dreaming let me know linux unplug dot reddit.com don't forget

925
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,640

928
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:43,840
okay producer Michael did you leave or are you gonna can you break me the bad

929
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:49,200
news am I am I gonna be screwed with my dreams and hopes for plasma window rules

930
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:55,480
no that'll do it that'll do what I want good it's awesome okay good I think I

931
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,240
when I read your comment the chairman was like oh that might not be a good way

932
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:04,480
to go I said I was saying I do this okay awesome so like oh good good good window

933
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:11,440
rules is it's it's more complicated to set up but it is awesome so it's

934
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,560
actually you have to you have to set up individually so you set the window

935
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,600
however you want it and then you apply a window rule and then what the best part

936
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,920
about is that once you set it to however you want like regular just movement

937
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,200
moving around and stuff it's detecting what the current settings are so if you

938
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,920
try to just make a window rule in the system settings it's a pain in the butt

939
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,200
but if you do it from right clicking a title bar it'll give you an option is

940
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,200
like oh okay just activate this and whatever you currently have it will use

941
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,500
that setting okay so it's actually not that hard to do if you know what to do

942
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,920
in the right order okay but the other part is that plasma has built-in tiling

943
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,600
essentially it doesn't have the automatic you know it's gonna tile it

944
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,480
based on what people expect tiling window managers to do okay but it has

945
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,560
these shortcuts where you can do you know horizontal top and bottom the site

946
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,120
left left and right like people you know are used to it also does quarter tiling

947
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:13,320
so you know the bottom right tiling okay but none of that is none of that has a

948
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:18,740
shortcut by default the functionality is in the system it is there you have to

949
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,120
manually go and put what shortcuts you want that I've run into that before and

950
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:26,520
been confused trying to get those shortcuts right yeah what I do is with

951
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:33,480
my keyboard the it's perfect because the you know that the insert home page up

952
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:42,080
that little set of six things cluster I have I have a super plus the top left

953
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,440
like the insert key is top left of the screen tiling and then you know etc for

954
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,960
the rest of them and home and end or like horizontal tiling hmm it's like

955
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,000
what I do is set it up I want to can keep it however it is I just set it I

956
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,640
just use the shortcut puts it where I want and then use window rules to

957
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:07,200
remember it okay that sounds actually pretty maybe we need like a plasma 101

958
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,160
yeah I may if I end up switching to a few yeah I'm actually working on doing

959
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:18,680
that all right my idea is to like kind of how to use plasma and avoid the you

960
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,040
know the headaches of not understanding well how to use everything yeah cuz

961
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,200
like I've got the gnome thing down like I can stall gnome a couple extensions oh

962
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:42,760
yeah it's there but I don't have I would like to get there in plasma too
