1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Starting the show off with an amazing discovery, ArchiveOS,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,520
the Archive of Operating Systems.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,960
Its mission is to save great free operating systems,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Linux, of course, the BSDs, the free DOSs, Solaris,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,200
and many other independent operating systems,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,840
and make it bootable.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,880
Look at this thing, Wes.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,120
How beautiful is this?

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,160
It's like the Internet Archive in an ISO.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,480
A testament to the ages.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
So you can go check it out at ArchiveOS.org.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,440
And I'm going to look into this more.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,240
I got to try this.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,320
They say it's important to save systems

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,760
and let the next generation of users find them, try them,

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,620
and learn as much as possible.

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,280
This has been rattling around in my head.

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,520
I haven't tried this, obviously.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,280
But what's been rattling around in my head

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,360
is trying to set up some old VMs,

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,880
or I should say set up new VMs of old versions of Linux,

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,640
just to like, what was it like to use KDE 2?

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,440
What was it like to use GNOME 2?

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,720
Like, what was it really like?

25
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,480
Because we refer to it all the time.

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,360
I've been really tempted to set up some VMs to do this,

27
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,520
just to have them sitting around when I want to try it.

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,560
Oh, yeah, right.

29
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,840
And I think that's where this site is maybe useful.

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,800
A lot of times, maybe you have a disk image or a tarball,

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,200
but it's a long way from actually making things bootable.

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,880
So if you have some of this set up already to go,

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
you might actually use it.

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,440
That would be the perfect part, like one ISO you download,

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,800
you load it on your machine, and it boots the whole thing up.

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,960
That would be the holy grail.

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
Maybe they'll get there one day.

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,840
Maybe they'll get there.

39
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,080
But right now, they're just archiving

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,380
these old, great operating systems.

41
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,800
If you do want to try this, it's a great resource for that,

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,140
so you can build your own system.

43
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,800
One day, we may get to that ISO.

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,600
Somebody should build it and call it

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,940
the Linux Unplugged Booter.

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,560
No, don't do that.

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Call it something else.

48
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,320
Yeah, definitely something else.

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,800
As I look at the pile of ThinkPads stacked up

50
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
in the corner of the room.

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,080
You are building an archive.

52
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,280
Different operating systems.

53
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
How many do you have there?

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
How many ThinkPads is it?

55
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Do you want to reveal the number?

56
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
Well, from what I can see in front of me,

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,800
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

58
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Seven, I think, as I can see.

59
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
You could just have various different states of Linux

60
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,640
on each one of them, like a cross-section.

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah.

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
I kind of like them to be usable,

63
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,460
like actual usable machines, not just something

64
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,680
that you put in a cupboard and never think about again.

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,660
So there's actually two on my desk right now.

66
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,000
One of them is a machine that we use for audio production.

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't actually use it.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
Samantha uses it for audio production on the podcast.

69
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,920
But the other one that is on right now,

70
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm running offline IMAP to synchronize all my email down

71
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
from Gmail, because I quite like having

72
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,160
an offline copy of all my email.

73
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,960
Just in case anything goes wrong,

74
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,160
I can open this laptop up, and it's

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,200
got a local copy of all my email.

76
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,120
And I've got MUT installed on there, so add a pinch.

77
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
It's got no GUI.

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
I've got no graphical interface on this thing at all.

79
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
It's only command line applications.

80
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,320
And offline IMAP sync my mail, and then MUT

81
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,380
if I need to actually write an email.

82
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,560
So now I can visualize you during the zombie apocalypse,

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
hunched over this old laptop, reading your email on MUT.

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,800
It's beautiful.

85
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
And I have a lot of email to read.

86
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,320
So once the zombies come, I'll be

87
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,080
quite busy reading all my old archives.

88
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
Right, of course.

89
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,720
But on that old laptop, only seven minutes to read it all.

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,480
Yeah, right.

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 249 from May 15, 2018.

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,360
that undoubtedly should have gone to that English class

94
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
more often.

95
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,520
And my name is Chris.

96
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,440
My name is Wes.

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm just saying, it might have helped out

98
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,960
in this whole podcasting crew.

99
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
It probably would.

100
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Went into IET, ended up podcasting.

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,880
You know, Wes, we'll muddle through.

102
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
We have a great show.

103
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,760
We're going to talk about Gnome removing the ability

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
to launch binary apps.

105
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,280
That's been the hot topic in our community this week.

106
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Hot, hot, hot.

107
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,640
Yeah.

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,680
We'll do a deep dive into the new bookmark sync

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,640
stuff that's coming to Firefox, talk about System 76 and LVFS

110
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,120
back and forth, and some new features

111
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,440
that look like they could be coming to Gnome if Will Cook

112
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
gets his way.

113
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,340
Wimpy's here with a new trick.

114
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,000
And malware may have been found in the Snap Store.

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
Is everything ruined?

116
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,200
We'll get all worked up and super upset.

117
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,840
Plus, the folks from Plasma, well, some of them at least,

118
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,440
went to Berlin and came back with some code.

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,020
We'll talk about data collection in 1804

120
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,800
and some of the attempts to generate

121
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,640
controversy for ad clicks.

122
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,320
And purism gets busted by Intel.

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
We alluded to this on a recent Linux action news,

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
but now we have a lot more details.

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
And then we'll ask if Docker is dangerous

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,040
and if it's time to just drop that all GTK or all cute

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
mentality.

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
Is it still relevant today, Wes?

129
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,400
We'll find out.

130
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,480
Don't answer.

131
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600
We're going to get into that.

132
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
But before we go any further, we've

133
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,280
got to bring in that mumble room.

134
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,980
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

135
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,080
Hey-oh, hey-oh.

136
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,160
Hello, good evening.

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,720
I like that.

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
That was a good mix this week.

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
Didn't expect that one coming.

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
So I want to start with the elephant in the room,

141
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,680
and that is the story about Gnome removing the ability

142
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,840
to launch binary apps from Nautilus.

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,480
So we got the big news from last Gnome release

144
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,560
really was the removal of the desktop application icons,

145
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,200
the desktop icons from Nautilus.

146
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,360
And now it looks like this is sort of a continuation

147
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,840
of that cleanup is really launching

148
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,400
binary applications when you double click on them in Nautilus.

149
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,880
So like.bin and.run files, perhaps app images as well,

150
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,080
.desktop shortcuts, or a shell script that you might execute.

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,880
You know, like the dumb arse that I am apparently

152
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
doing things the old way.

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,360
I just downloaded a new game off of a good old games, GOG,

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
and was assuming I would just be able to double click

155
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,540
and run it.

156
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know what I was thinking.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
I should have definitely considered opening the terminal

158
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,920
and running it that way.

159
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,640
Of course you should.

160
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,760
You should be running all your programs that way, Chris.

161
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
Now, it's pretty easy to poke fun at this decision.

162
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
And it, of course, plays into that whole narrative of Gnome

163
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,880
always removing functionality.

164
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,680
I think the common reaction I've seen on the various internet

165
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,400
outlets is just when you thought Gnome couldn't

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,360
take any more functionality, they're

167
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,920
taking away the ability to run apps.

168
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
But that's a little hype.

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,640
It's not really that.

170
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,360
It's more really about how apps should

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,440
be launched from the app launcher,

172
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,240
and the files app should be managing files.

173
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,720
And they think removing the ability

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
to launch binaries from Nautilus will improve its security.

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
And, of course, there will still be other ways to launch apps.

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
So what do you think?

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,320
Initial impressions, when you hear this kind of thing, Wes,

178
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,880
are you so tired from drama that you're just sort of numb to it?

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
Or do you have a strong response to this?

180
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,520
OK, I will admit to being at least a little bit numb.

181
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
I also have some sympathies.

182
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,200
I feel like Gnome gets viewed as so many different things

183
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
and a lot of different roles.

184
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,120
Some of that might be valid, especially now

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,760
on so many desktops by default. But that's really

186
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,400
the distribution's choice.

187
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
I can see why Gnome wants to craft things

188
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,200
into a more elegant desktop for the future.

189
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,120
Maybe not all users are ready for that.

190
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,360
I can see why people want to keep a lot of standard paradigms

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
around.

192
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
I personally don't need them.

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm OK with Gnome developing into whatever

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
it is that they want.

195
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,200
I understand why it upsets people, though, because, hey,

196
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
this is a lot of people's workflows.

197
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You can't do it anymore.

198
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
You're not allergic to bees, are you?

199
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Because there is a wasp.

200
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,080
Oh, look at that.

201
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,640
Wow.

202
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Here, maybe you could put this on top of him.

203
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,400
There you go, Wes.

204
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,640
Maybe you could trap that wasp that's walking around

205
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,080
by your hand there, Wes.

206
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,480
Just a little Pacific Northwest summer.

207
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
There you go.

208
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,440
That surely won't piss him off.

209
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,040
Now he's trapped in the bell.

210
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Now let's ring it.

211
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
All right, well, I agree.

212
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,600
I think that people often lump Gnome into one singular

213
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,480
category when it's a bunch of individual developers and people

214
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
that are doing a lot of different work,

215
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,280
and it often encompasses many projects.

216
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,880
And all of those disclosures aside,

217
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,480
I can't imagine something like this ever landing in, like,

218
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,960
Kaja, for example.

219
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,000
What do you think, Wimpy?

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Would you see it?

221
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
Could you see a rationale for something

222
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,880
like this landing in a Maté desktop environment?

223
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,640
Well, probably not, because we choose not to remove features,

224
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,080
if at all possible.

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
So the only time features go away

226
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,120
is when they can't technically be supported anymore.

227
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
But then I was thinking about this.

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,920
How often do people actually launch binaries

229
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
with the file manager?

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,000
I think it's more common to a group of people

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
that this is going to most negatively impact,

232
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,560
and that's new users that get switched to Linux,

233
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,200
or people that are buying commercial software.

234
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,040
I've definitely noticed the folks

235
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,960
that I've helped move to Linux, they

236
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,360
have this habit of Google searching,

237
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,240
and then going and downloading the deb,

238
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,280
or downloading a binary file, or like when

239
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,880
you buy something from GOG.

240
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,760
Right, I can see that.

241
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
Or I use this program, oh, they have Linux,

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm finally on Linux, they gave me a tarball,

243
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
what do I do with this?

244
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,280
Yeah.

245
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,720
So a deb isn't executable though, right?

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,240
You double click a deb, and it launches something else

247
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,920
that handles the installation, or you double click an image.

248
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,400
I'm just commenting on the behavior.

249
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,760
That's just the behavior.

250
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,080
I think the instinct for Windows users

251
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,160
is to download things off of the vendor's website,

252
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,760
whoever that vendor might be.

253
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,120
Right, but even those crazy lunatic third-party app

254
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
developers create desktop files, and launchers,

255
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,840
and if you download, let's say for example,

256
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,600
a simple example like Telegram.

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,760
If you go and get Telegram from their website,

258
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,280
there's a simple executable, you run it once,

259
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,840
and then you've got an icon forevermore

260
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,320
in your launcher, your menu.

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
Right, same with the GOG game.

262
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,440
I bought that new fancy looking space game,

263
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,360
I can't remember what it's called.

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,840
Space game.

265
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
But it looks really good.

266
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,320
And it's a bin file that downloads,

267
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,720
and then when you double click it, it then launches a GTK

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,360
installer, and that does create a.desktop file,

269
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
and all that kind of stuff.

270
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,360
But you've got to double click that bin file

271
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,200
to get that GTK installer to create the desktop file.

272
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,920
But is the ultimate goal of this in the GNOME project

273
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,440
to break the habit of these bad patterns of downloading

274
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,960
something from the internet, and then just double clicking it,

275
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,240
and expecting it to work, and it not be full of malware?

276
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Maybe, yeah.

277
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
I mean, I think you could make a pretty solid security

278
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
argument from that standpoint, and you could argue

279
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
if they feel the code isn't up to snuff

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,640
that they shouldn't be maintaining it.

281
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
You could just base the argument off of that.

282
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,400
It does kind of remind me, too, of some of the,

283
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,120
you know, maybe like a Chrome OS type environment,

284
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,440
or iOS, where these newer environments that were designed

285
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,000
in the world we have now don't have some of these legacy

286
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
things, but people who are familiar enough

287
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
with the file system, familiar enough with, yeah,

288
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,720
just like running binaries, feels like a big loss.

289
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't really ever do this.

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,120
I guess the one area, it kind of sucks for app images, maybe.

291
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Other than that, it doesn't really affect me.

293
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,280
I guess I just don't agree that you can change user behavior

294
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,960
this way.

295
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't think this ever works.

296
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
I think you just piss off users.

297
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
And I think what you're going to have is.

298
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Or filter your base then, right?

299
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
And you're going to have distros that are just going

300
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
to ship another extension, just like they're shipping

301
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,960
extensions now to restore desktop icons,

302
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,600
or they're shipping extensions now to restore tray icons.

303
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Now they're going to be shipping an extension

304
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,800
to execute binary files.

305
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,560
That's likely the biggest impact,

306
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,920
is that it'll just be now the work of the distribution

307
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,720
maintainers.

308
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,520
Or they'll hold back the version of Nautilus

309
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,720
that has this patched out and patch it back in again.

310
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

311
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,200
I have a link to the mailing list discussion.

312
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Let's say give it a read.

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,880
And give the team some slack to just figure this stuff out.

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
Like, the world hasn't fallen apart

315
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
with the removal of desktop icons from GNOME 3.2.8.

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,880
True.

317
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,600
We're still here.

318
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,240
We're still holding good.

319
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
And people that really need it have extensions.

320
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,680
I think also there's like, yeah, people have extensions.

321
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,040
And if you're listening to this program,

322
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,480
you probably know that there's a bunch of other fine desktop.

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,000
So if we're having this debate in the context of like,

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,320
what should the new user experience be, or the standard,

325
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,000
that's one thing.

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,280
But for a lot of us, we just don't have to care,

327
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,520
because there's lots of choice.

328
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,240
Poby, are you still rocking Firefox as your daily driver

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
if you cave to Chrome?

330
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,320
Yep.

331
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,880
All right.

332
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Yep, yep.

333
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
No, the only reason I use Chrome is

334
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,440
to talk to Wimpy on a daily basis,

335
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,720
because the video chat thing we use only works in Chrome.

336
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,280
Yeah, I have similar.

337
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,600
I've made an Electron app of the video conferencing tool

338
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,080
we make, so I don't have to have Chrome or Chromium installed

339
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,600
anymore.

340
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,440
How do you make an Electron app of any Rando website?

341
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,760
I would love to know that.

342
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,360
I will send you a link in IRC to the Ubuntu tutorial guide

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,520
that explains how to do it.

344
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you, because I have a similar situation.

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,640
I have one app that I have to use Chrome for.

346
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,680
Yeah, that's a great app.

347
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,400
We should do that.

348
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,720
I know.

349
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,440
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

350
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,560
So Firefox is just getting better and better.

351
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,880
And Beta 61 and the Nightly 62 have a new sync system

352
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,760
that is going to address some of all of the complaints,

353
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
actually, I've really ever had with Firefox Bookmarks.

354
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,520
This is something, their sync system with Firefox Bookmarks

355
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,680
has always sort of been a retrofitted solution,

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
where Chrome was sort of engineered from the beginning.

357
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
And now, Firefox, the team over at Mozilla

358
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,320
that creates Firefox for iOS, has quite a bit

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
of experience with this, because when they created Firefox for OS,

360
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,120
they created it with syncing in mind.

361
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
And they created this whole JSON system,

362
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,800
and they created this dual database system

363
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,320
of your active bookmarks and the synced bookmarks,

364
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,720
and even a third database for conflict resolution.

365
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,280
And then they had a really great system

366
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,480
for keeping it all straight and keeping track of everything.

367
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,120
And when they engineered this, they

368
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,520
looked back at their Firefox desktop sync engine

369
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,000
and said, well, how could we apply lessons learned to the iOS

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
sync engine to the desktop?

371
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,040
And that's now essentially what they're doing.

372
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,280
They're going to have a mirror and a merger database.

373
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,800
They're going to have more of an iOS inspired.

374
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
It's not a direct three database,

375
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,040
like one for one re-implementation

376
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
of the iOS system, because there is just historical legacy

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,280
things they have to support.

378
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,040
But in a sense, they're going to be building into Firefox

379
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,960
a shadow bookmarking system that will be kept syncing separately

380
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,640
from your primary bookmarks.

381
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,040
And that's where it will work out,

382
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,160
like merging of conflicts or other issues

383
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
that crop up when you're syncing bookmarks

384
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,600
or adding new items or editing existing items.

385
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,080
And that'll be happening much faster in the background.

386
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,400
And it has a graceful way to get out

387
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,040
when there's a conflict that it can't figure out.

388
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,680
So then this is just sort of a new system being

389
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,600
added, bolted on, that will take the same data

390
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,680
and do better things with it.

391
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah, exactly.

392
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,600
And they're starting to roll it out in 61 and 62

393
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
in different phases.

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,520
I have those details linked in the show notes

395
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,080
if you want to read the whole post.

396
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,760
If you're a big Firefox fan and you're

397
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
curious about this battle and why it's sort of been

398
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
a little clunky, they even identify some of the issues

399
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,720
that I thought I was just crazy.

400
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,060
I thought these were just problems that I had.

401
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,240
And now I'm seeing Mozilla just say,

402
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,680
the list is pretty damning there, right?

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,480
Like, yeah, it doesn't make you confident.

404
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,880
No, bookmarks will be duplicated, lost, or reordered.

405
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,920
I have absolutely experienced the reordered thing.

406
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,280
And folders with different contents

407
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,840
would get smushed together.

408
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,080
New bookmarks wouldn't make their way to all devices,

409
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,960
causing them to gradually fall out of sync.

410
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,400
And moves would be partially or completely undone at times.

411
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,960
There you go.

412
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,640
Yeah, right?

413
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,140
Wow.

414
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,300
And I thought I was just using it wrong.

415
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
And I thought Chrome did it a lot better.

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,180
And that was one of the things that first drew me to Chrome.

417
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,760
I went back.

418
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,260
I feel like it's been pretty solid.

419
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,640
But I've also kind of reduced how much I use bookmarks.

420
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,920
Same, yeah.

421
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
And I'm looking forward to these changes.

422
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,760
Definitely you should check the article out.

423
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I thought it was a great level of there's

424
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,240
a lot of technical details without too much.

425
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,720
There's not a ton of code, but they

426
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,640
talk about the advanced designs of the system.

427
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,600
And it's also worth mentioning, recently I've

428
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,640
gotten a little more critical about the way Mozilla

429
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,280
communicates.

430
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
It's very corporate heavy.

431
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
And it's sort of a turnoff to, I think,

432
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,280
a lot of members of the open source and free software

433
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,920
communities.

434
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,040
And so reading that, I'd say it was very clear.

435
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,120
It was technical.

436
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,640
Felt like it was written to us.

437
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,560
I liked that a lot.

438
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
I liked that.

439
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,520
And if you want to go read that whole thing,

440
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,440
go to linuxunplug.com slash 249, and we'll

441
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,400
have a link in there.

442
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,360
I've talked a lot on this show about LVFS

443
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,480
and the whole firmware update mechanism

444
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
that I first experienced on an XPS 13 running Fedora,

445
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,440
and then later different distributions, including Arch.

446
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,760
And it was just so exciting.

447
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,960
Yeah, you're in the software updates.

448
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,920
And you go to the updates, and it's like, what?

449
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,840
There's a new firmware update?

450
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Crazy.

451
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,960
And then we really saw the value

452
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,920
of having that system when Spectre and Meltdown were

453
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
announced.

454
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,400
And this system, LVFS, it's a Red Hat project

455
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,280
that is attempting to be distro and vendor neutral.

456
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600
We've covered a lot in the past.

457
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Richard Hughes is the primary developer behind it.

458
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,880
I think he's done some great work.

459
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,040
And I love the idea of something that's cross-vendor,

460
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,480
so Lenovo or Dell could participate in it.

461
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
And you can be on Arch, Fedora, or Ubuntu,

462
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
and you're getting these firmware updates.

463
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,680
Doesn't matter, yeah, right?

464
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah, that's great.

465
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,000
So I've always been a fan of, well,

466
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,960
let's get LVFS in all of the places.

467
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,480
And so that's why I think other people have felt that way too.

468
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
And there was some interest in what was

469
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,600
System76 going to be doing.

470
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Now that they have Pop!

471
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,440
OS and that they'll be building their own hardware soon,

472
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,720
what is their intention to participate in the LVFS

473
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,600
program?

474
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,480
And then it came out that in the background,

475
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
there had been some communication between System76

476
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,280
and the project.

477
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,120
It's not like they weren't aware of it, right?

478
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,600
Right.

479
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,760
But nothing of major substance that

480
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
had really progressed anything beyond like, hey,

481
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,320
can we do this?

482
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,120
How does this work?

483
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,480
Things like that.

484
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,760
And it seems like things just sort of faded out.

485
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,920
There was some rumors that, yeah, they started talking

486
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,720
to us from the LVFS camp, but we haven't heard anything.

487
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,840
And then about a year went by, and Richard Hughes

488
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,560
posted a blog post where the crux of it

489
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,260
is this isn't going anywhere.

490
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,800
They're not going to use our project.

491
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,760
They're going to do their own update mechanism

492
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,160
that they've created.

493
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,040
And if you want somebody who supports LVFS,

494
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,080
go get an XPS 13.

495
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,520
And Carl took to the System76 blog

496
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,000
and wrote a kind of line-by-line response where he says,

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,120
we reached out to Richard over a year ago.

498
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,360
We were enthusiastic about LVFS and interested in whether

499
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,900
or not it would work for us.

500
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,760
Once we described how we needed to deliver our firmware,

501
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
we were told that it would not work well

502
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,520
and would likely not be acceptable to Red Hat Legal.

503
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,100
And they kind of post a snippet of the issue.

504
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,520
Richard Hughes says, I don't think

505
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,060
this will work for us because there's

506
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,160
no way to reference a flashing tool in the XML

507
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,120
or sign an executable on LVFS.

508
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
I don't think Red Hat Legal will like the idea of shipping

509
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,320
the flashing program.

510
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,360
We've only ever talked about the firmware files themselves,

511
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,600
although I can see the images in the.cap file

512
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
probably contain firmware executable code wrapped up

513
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,560
in layers.

514
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,840
Yeah, fair enough.

515
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
He says, I also know the Red Hat security team would

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
do more than just blink when we tell them

517
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,360
that we want to ship an untrusted, non-free binary,

518
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,840
which would run as root on RHEL customer's machines.

519
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
So that's the snippet of the conversation

520
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
that way Richard Hughes says, I don't think

521
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
this is going to work for you.

522
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,880
It's kind of, I believe, at that point in the conversation,

523
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,800
things just died off.

524
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,340
System76 is like, well, obviously, this

525
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
isn't going to work for us.

526
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,520
We'll focus on what we need to focus on.

527
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,560
They were also launching Pop OS around this time,

528
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,260
and they have plenty of things that they're doing.

529
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,720
And so he also, Carl mentions in his blog post

530
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,960
that the update capital mechanism that LVFS uses

531
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,840
wouldn't work for over a decade of machines

532
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,200
that System76 has in the field.

533
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,160
And without update capsule, and with update capsule as well,

534
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,920
it wraps everything into binary blobs.

535
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
You can't really pull it apart and reverse engineer firmwares,

536
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
and they don't like that aspect of it as well.

537
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,760
Carl outlines a few other concerns in his blog post,

538
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,120
but I kind of wanted to reach out to Carl

539
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,080
and ask him a couple of direct questions,

540
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
because there's been some that I think

541
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,360
have been rattling around the internet that we'd

542
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,080
like answers to.

543
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,040
So I sent Carl an email, and he got back to me this morning,

544
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,080
pretty promptly, actually.

545
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,920
And I asked him, I said, is one of the core problems

546
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,160
with System76 using LVFS is that it's not really compatible

547
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,840
with its upstream OEM agreements that System76 has in place,

548
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,760
with say, Clevo or whoever that might be upselling the parts.

549
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,920
Carl responds to that, System76 has no upstream agreements

550
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,600
limiting anything we can do to deliver firmware

551
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
to our customers.

552
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
This is made up.

553
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
We were told in the email we posted

554
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,160
that LVFS would technically be incompatible

555
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,560
and would likely not be acceptable to Red Hat legal.

556
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,480
We needed to still provide the functionality,

557
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,120
so we built our own tool, which I, OK.

558
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,640
Fair enough.

559
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,680
So he says that there isn't an agreement.

560
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
There is no agreement in place that

561
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,600
limits how they redistribute firmware, is what he said.

562
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
And I said, just to clarify, if customers

563
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,320
choose to buy a stock Ubuntu machine from System76, not one

564
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,800
running Pop!

565
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,760
OS, will they still get updated?

566
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,560
He said, correct, any Ubuntu-based distro

567
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,800
will work, of course.

568
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
We also had customers use the update tool on Arch.

569
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,640
Nice, yeah, OK.

570
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
And I said, in the future, when you're

571
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
building your own systems, like your own desktops,

572
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,600
do you intend to use LVFS at that point?

573
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,760
And he said that their first in-house design

574
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,360
and manufactured desktop will feature

575
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
open source firmware components.

576
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,600
So they don't need to be reverse engineered,

577
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,880
so the update capsule thing isn't.

578
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,040
But they'll still use their existing infrastructure

579
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,720
and tools to distribute the firmwares

580
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,200
when they're building their own systems.

581
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,680
And so I think it's pretty clear in here.

582
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,000
This is just simply a matter of, this is what works for us.

583
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,880
It wasn't really a statement on the LVFS project.

584
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,600
It's just not a solution that's necessarily

585
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,080
going to work for us right now.

586
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,200
And he would have, I think, I got from my back and forth

587
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,920
with him, he would have preferred

588
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,640
to just leave it at that.

589
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
Yeah, I mean.

590
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,920
I wish there was a mechanism for these different groups

591
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,600
to communicate better.

592
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,200
It's funny, we have all these different platforms, Twitter,

593
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
and email, and IRC, and Slack, and Telegram,

594
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,960
that everybody in our community uses pretty regularly.

595
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
And yet, like, these like.

596
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
It feels like we end up talking past each other in blog posts.

597
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,680
In blog posts, right?

598
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,080
And I really respect Richard, too.

599
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
I think what Richard is working on

600
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,320
is really important for a first class Linux user experience,

601
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,880
where you don't have to sit there and do the distro math

602
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,920
and wonder if there's a PPA for that system.

603
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,060
And you just know that if you get a modern system,

604
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,640
when you go to get all your updates,

605
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,400
you get your firmware update.

606
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,280
I like that.

607
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,960
I like that, too.

608
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
And there's probably a lot of different ways

609
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,440
System76 could crack that particular egg.

610
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,080
And maybe they could deliver it that way as well.

611
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
It's sort of unfortunate, though,

612
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,740
that we end up getting these lobs thrown back and forth

613
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,280
at each other.

614
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,220
In another world, I almost would like to give people a.

615
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,640
Maybe this is something we could do.

616
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,600
I almost would like to give people a space

617
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,880
to just talk it out.

618
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,160
Because you get people talking, and it just is everything's

619
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,160
fine.

620
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's hash it out now, and then not

621
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,440
have to keep talking about it.

622
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,120
And we can stop covering it on the show,

623
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,520
and everyone will be happier.

624
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah, it just seems like that would be a lot nicer.

625
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,920
Do you think there's any, was there any in the reaction,

626
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,840
any sort of open source community frustration

627
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,760
just with Pop!

628
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,200
OS, or feelings about that System76

629
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,720
may be motivated to do this for some of their not

630
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,680
appreciating forking when they don't need you?

631
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
That's an interesting question.

632
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,320
Yeah, I think that is a bit of it.

633
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,600
I think where Richard Hughes comes in is,

634
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,200
I saw some of his follow up comments on Google+.

635
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,880
He's a little disappointed, because the idea here

636
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
is this is sort of like the community thing to do.

637
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
This is the Linux, this is like a good Linux hardware citizen

638
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,360
thing to do, I think is the thinking.

639
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,640
And so there was a level of disappointment on his part

640
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,760
that System76 wasn't interested in participating

641
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
in that larger ecosystem, even if it meant sort of reinventing

642
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,000
the wheel a bit.

643
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,080
Because some other manufacturers are redoing the way

644
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,400
that they do all of this process too.

645
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
And I think that is a point you could argue.

646
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Maybe that's not necessarily true.

647
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,240
Because perhaps you could argue that LVFS

648
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,800
is not as independent as it would need

649
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,520
to be for that to actually happen.

650
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,200
It also strikes me that it's great that System76 is taking

651
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,840
this seriously.

652
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,120
And maybe if a lot of other vendors had been doing this,

653
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,280
yes, it would be a worse world where we had a whole bunch

654
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,720
of independent Linux flashing programs.

655
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,440
But imagine that, if for years you'd

656
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,280
be able to easily flash firmware from whatever big name vendor,

657
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,160
that just wasn't the world that we lived in.

658
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,120
It's cool that it's changing now.

659
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,480
But I can understand why they're like,

660
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
guys, we've been shipping this for like 10 years.

661
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,480
We just have to support our machines.

662
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,840
Yeah, the machines we already have in the field.

663
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,800
Let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

664
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,160
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

665
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,520
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial of a platform

666
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,680
that's built to teach you more about Linux,

667
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,060
with full-time human beings that can help you whenever you

668
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,760
get stuck.

669
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,060
And when you're not asking them questions,

670
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,800
they're always improving, adding, and updating content.

671
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,100
They have a course scheduler that

672
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,120
works with your busy schedule and helps set learning goals

673
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,040
and then helps you stick to those time frames.

674
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,800
They have cloud servers that they spin up on demand

675
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
when you need them as part of the courseware.

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,560
You can SSH into those systems, and they're really cool.

677
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,000
You can set the distro, and the courseware matches that.

678
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
And they also have practice exams and quizzes

679
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,400
to help prepare you for certifications and tests

680
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,860
to make sure you really have learned what you think you've

681
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,800
learned before you go take the big test.

682
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,640
Yeah.

683
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
They also have iOS and Android apps

684
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,120
so you can study while you're going.

685
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,960
They have lesson audio and study guides

686
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,580
that you can download and take with you.

687
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,120
And they have rolled out a big batch of content

688
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,600
in the last month, and it's still coming, too.

689
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,400
It's impressive.

690
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,600
There's so much to cover that they've

691
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,280
been doing live streams and just trying to bring everybody

692
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,920
up to date on all of this stuff, because it's so much,

693
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,280
it's hard to keep track of how much.

694
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,080
You don't even want to read all the stuff

695
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,560
that they have just offered, let alone all the actual material.

696
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,360
Yes, and they're updating old stuff as well,

697
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,000
so the old material is staying current.

698
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,360
It's a great, great service.

699
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,240
And you can try it seven days for free.

700
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,800
But when you go to linuxacademy.com slash

704
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
Bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba.

705
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
I like that sound effect.

706
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,360
I like that, too.

707
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,120
You should keep it going.

708
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,240
So if I say GS Connect, does it ring a bell?

709
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,880
Does that ring a bell at all, GS Connect?

710
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,440
Well, it does make me think of KDE Connect.

711
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,560
You got it, Wes.

712
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
That's right.

713
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,800
It is the gnome shell implementation of KDE Connect.

714
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,880
Yeah, without the Qt.

715
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm interested.

716
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,760
No Qt or KDE dependencies.

717
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,360
And KDE Connect, of course, is that awesome, awesome tool

718
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,840
that allows you to basically make your Android phone

719
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,480
a companion to your Plasma desktop

720
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
and now your gnome desktop with GS Connect.

721
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,160
You can share clipboards.

722
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,480
You can get notifications moved between them.

723
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
You can use it as a remote control.

724
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,400
I mean, you could transfer files.

725
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,920
There's a lot of stuff.

726
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,800
And you've got to figure, it's a feature

727
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,840
that Microsoft is eyeing.

728
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,960
They've talked a little bit at Build

729
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,480
about the new timeline feature in Windows 10

730
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,520
that requires a special launcher on Android

731
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,560
to make it all work, where none of this

732
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
is required with GS Connect.

733
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,480
And so this guy, this random guy, Will Cook,

734
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,760
some guy on the internet, he has proposed

735
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,080
that Ubuntu should integrate GS Connect as part of 18.10.

736
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
I think it's a great idea.

737
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,240
That's awesome.

738
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,280
And so he's put out there for conversation

739
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,240
on the Ubuntu community portal hub.

740
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
What do we call it, Popey?

741
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,200
Is it hub?

742
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,680
Hub.

743
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
Hub.

744
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,560
And asked for folks to give input

745
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,040
and has even named people that are volunteering

746
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,840
to do some of the work.

747
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,800
I think this would be a great and useful tool.

748
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,760
And it'd be a nice feature on the side of the box

749
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,840
like they used to say.

750
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,680
That sounds awesome.

751
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Yeah, I mean, I would certainly use it.

752
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
So if you want to get in on the conversation around that,

753
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,080
I'll have a link in the show notes.

754
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,960
And then a little birdie dropped off, a new snap.

755
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,480
New snap?

756
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,840
Right on the doorstep of the show this morning.

757
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:19,840
What is it?

758
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm dying to know.

759
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,160
Well, you know how we're big fans of the FFmpeg project.

760
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh, love it.

761
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,500
And you know what FFmpeg could always

762
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,200
use a little more of?

763
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,920
Hardware acceleration.

764
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,600
Always.

765
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,160
But you can't do that in a snap, right, Wimpy?

766
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,080
That's not possible.

767
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,920
It is now.

768
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Oh, boy.

769
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
Dish.

770
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,520
You got a dish.

771
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,200
So this is something we've had brewing for a little while.

772
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,360
You will have heard Poppy and I talking about the fact

773
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,440
that OBS is able to use an accelerated FFmpeg that's

774
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,560
in the Ubuntu 18.04 archive, which is terrific.

775
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,160
So people who want NVENC and HEVC and what have you,

776
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,800
that's all available.

777
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,800
But as is common, the 18.04 release comes out.

778
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,040
We're shipping the latest stable release of FFmpeg

779
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,360
and then days later, FFmpeg 4 drops.

780
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,240
And we've now got an 18.04 release,

781
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,800
which is never going to see that new version of FFmpeg.

782
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,000
So what we've been working on is a snap of FFmpeg,

783
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,240
which is FFmpeg 4 with the NVENC and HEVC pieces enabled.

784
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,000
So you have the hardware acceleration.

785
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,600
We've also done the work to build in the VA API stuff.

786
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,560
So there's a hardware accelerated encoding and decoding

787
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,360
for Intel and AMD as well.

788
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,840
And all of the bits that FFmpeg relies on

789
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,680
are all built from the current versions of source parts.

790
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,160
So the whole stack of FFmpeg is all the latest stuff

791
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,880
inside the snap.

792
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,400
That snap is currently classic because it's FFmpeg itself.

793
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,280
And it sort of makes sense that maybe FFmpeg, the tool,

794
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,760
should remain a classic snap because there's

795
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,440
many different ways people would want to use it.

796
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,560
But that snaps only 20 meg.

797
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,720
So it's very small.

798
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,640
Wow.

799
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Yeah.

800
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm really excited to try it.

801
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,920
I could take that anyway.

802
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,520
Yeah.

803
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,920
And what we've been doing is we've figured out

804
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:27,760
how to confine FFmpeg and open up access to the NVENC socket.

805
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,440
And what this will enable us to do is, in snaps like OBS

806
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,680
and Kdenlive, embed the bleeding edge versions of FFmpeg

807
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,080
with all of the acceleration turned on inside those

808
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,040
applications.

809
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,720
So they don't have to go looking at the host, which

810
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
may have an old version.

811
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,200
They can have the current latest versions

812
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,080
with all of the acceleration features.

813
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,720
Right.

814
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,200
Boy, that's going to be great for them.

815
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
This is incredible.

816
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,240
And they'll know exactly that everywhere that it ships

817
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,360
will have that version of FFmpeg, which is going

818
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,600
to be great for Kdenlive.

819
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,520
Maybe that's one of the biggest challenges

820
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,240
for doing video editing on Linux is

821
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,120
that people have different parts underneath

822
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
of different versions.

823
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,800
And so you can say, my Kdenlive crashes.

824
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,900
And it comes back with, OK, what version of this

825
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,440
and what version of that do you have?

826
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,520
And this solves that.

827
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,080
That's available now in the stable channel.

828
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,120
In the future, we'll be doing a bit more

829
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,080
with the Intel and AMD acceleration.

830
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,320
And a little project I'm interested in looking at

831
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,560
is we've now got the capability within snaps

832
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,360
when they're being built to make architecture decisions

833
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,560
in the build process.

834
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,280
So you can say, when I'm on an AMD 64 machine,

835
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,720
do these things differently than when I'm on a ARM device.

836
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,960
And what I'm planning to do is bring some work

837
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,240
I did on the Raspberry Pi last year,

838
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,320
where I made an FFmpeg that was specifically

839
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,160
tuned for hardware accelerated encoding and decoding

840
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,840
on the Raspberry Pi, bring that into the same snap

841
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,640
so that when you're building on ARM HF,

842
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,040
it automatically turns on all of those Raspberry Pi

843
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,680
optimizations.

844
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,760
So the same snap will be the accelerated version

845
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,280
for the different devices.

846
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,520
You are doing the work of many editors out there.

847
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
They are going to appreciate that very, very much.

848
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,160
They're going to save so many folks time

849
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,400
that would have had to figure out

850
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,040
how to get that working individually

851
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,000
on each one of their systems.

852
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Right.

853
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,480
Can you mention the different, like just a couple of years

854
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,360
ago, trying to put that all together.

855
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,600
Maybe you're manually compiling things or with sketchy PPAs,

856
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,640
and now it's just a couple of snaps.

857
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Yep.

858
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
OK, so while we're on this subject of snaps,

859
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,560
there's a big story floating around, huge story,

860
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,160
massive controversy, shaking everything to its core.

861
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
So big.

862
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,360
There was malware found in the Snap Store.

863
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,280
And as a response, there has been a post up on the blog.abuntu.com

864
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,760
talking about future steps that will

865
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,440
be taken to secure, to a degree, the Snap Store.

866
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,400
And there was one bit in here that really jumped out at me.

867
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,800
And Will Cook talked a little bit

868
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
about this on the recent Late Night Linux, too.

869
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,800
They say, on the roadmap, they have an interesting security

870
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,400
feature in the works that will improve

871
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,120
the safety of the system and also

872
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,480
the experience of people handling

873
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,560
software deployments in servers and desktops.

874
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,240
A simple but fairly effective feature that we are working on

875
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,320
is the ability to flag specific publishers as verified.

876
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,520
OK.

877
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,240
The details of that will be announced soon.

878
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,360
But the basic idea is that it's easy for users

879
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,800
to identify that the person or organization publishing

880
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,880
that Snap are who they claim to be.

881
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,960
And so, though, would that have solved this?

882
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,720
So what happened?

883
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,840
So let me back up a little bit.

884
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,920
Yeah, lay it down.

885
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,160
There was a video game in the Snap Store,

886
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,480
I think it claimed to be a version of that 2048 game

887
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
everybody loves.

888
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,480
And when you get that there game,

889
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,560
it was actually doing a little crypto mining

890
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,520
in the background, surprise, surprise.

891
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,320
Well, of course, that's what you got to do these days.

892
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,760
So it's an interesting use of, I guess,

893
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,400
what you could call malware.

894
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,280
It was really more like crypto ware.

895
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,000
Because it's in this confined Snap,

896
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
but it can still use your CPU resources and do mining.

897
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
Just raises your power bill.

898
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,020
Yeah, so it's behaving in a way that

899
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,880
was unexpected to the user.

900
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,600
But they could have been a verified publisher.

901
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,080
Right.

902
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
And with the verification, does that speak at all

903
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,640
to the procedures?

904
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,060
How do they keep their keys?

905
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,080
All those sorts of things that would actually also impact.

906
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
Yeah, maybe we'll get details on that.

907
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,760
But that's about as much as I know.

908
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm sure our friends Popeye or Wimpy

909
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,560
would have more insights on this particular topic.

910
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,200
It's been kind of interesting, but it all

911
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,160
could have been more of a shitstorm.

912
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,200
It's been kind of a mild shitstorm, but not that bad.

913
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,240
So what's been the piece that people have missed?

914
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,680
What is the definition of a mild shitstorm?

915
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,120
Well, I don't know.

916
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,160
From where I've sat, I could have

917
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,280
seen it could have been a lot worse.

918
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,160
But you were more at the heart of the storm.

919
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,400
So I'm curious if you have the same impression.

920
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,440
So whenever something like this happens,

921
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,280
and I'm not talking about whenever we regularly

922
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,560
get malware arriving.

923
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,760
I'm talking about whenever there's

924
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,520
a problem in Ubuntu, and we see the community reacting

925
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,240
in some way, we all jump to it.

926
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,480
And there are people, you could think of the Avengers

927
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,480
around the world, all coming together in order

928
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,280
to resolve this problem.

929
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,000
And I know that a whole bunch of people in Canonical

930
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,400
care very deeply about this problem,

931
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
wanted to get it solved.

932
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,160
So someone alerted us to the fact

933
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,240
that there was an application in the store,

934
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,280
and the application did something

935
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,040
other than what it said it did in the description.

936
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,720
That's effectively what it was.

937
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,600
It's as simple as that.

938
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,760
Someone said, this is a game.

939
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
It's 2048 or Hextris.

940
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,200
There was actually half a dozen, four or five applications

941
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,280
from the same author, and they all did the same thing.

942
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,520
They were, in inverted commas, masquerading as one thing,

943
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,800
but doing something else.

944
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,880
They weren't stealing data.

945
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,440
They weren't grabbing data off your machine

946
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,240
and sending it off to some third party.

947
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,720
They were basically using your CPU in order

948
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,840
to mine some kind of cryptocurrency.

949
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,640
And at the point when we found out about this,

950
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,600
I think it was early on a Saturday morning,

951
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,880
the weekend just gone, and I was standing in a field

952
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,320
watching my son play football.

953
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,560
I know Martin was in the middle of a forest with his family.

954
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Other people were spending time with their families

955
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,680
on a Saturday morning, and everyone jumped to it.

956
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,200
Telegram lit up, IRC channels lit up.

957
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,240
We all jumped on it.

958
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,960
We all pinged all the right people,

959
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,560
phoned the emergency numbers, and made sure

960
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,720
that those applications were yanked from the store

961
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
as soon as possible.

962
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,360
So we did exactly the right thing as soon as we were alerted

963
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,680
or as soon as we figured out that there was something wrong.

964
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
We pulled these apps from the stores,

965
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,280
and then started a plan of investigation

966
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,280
and debugging what the applications were actually

967
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,560
doing to make sure that this doesn't happen again.

968
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,960
And we can plan for the future to make sure

969
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,480
that people are more aware of what's going on.

970
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,760
Yeah, and so do you think this verified program would

971
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
have fixed this particular problem,

972
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
since he did have a few other apps in the store?

973
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,680
He may have been considered verified at that point, no?

974
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,920
Well, the verified, there is no verified program at the moment.

975
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,040
So I couldn't possibly say if it would or wouldn't fix it,

976
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,720
because I don't know what form that verified program will

977
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,360
take.

978
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,240
We've discussed this a number of times at Canonical,

979
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,440
and it was most recently raised a couple of weeks ago.

980
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,120
The Snap team were at a sprint recently.

981
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,760
And it's a hard problem to solve.

982
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
It's not straightforward.

983
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,440
Even if you have someone who is, whether they are verified

984
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,160
or they're not, it's not a magic bullet

985
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,520
that stops someone from doing something nefarious.

986
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,760
You have to be able to keep an eye on these things,

987
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,160
monitor what's going on, and react fast

988
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
when things do go wrong.

989
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,360
If you look at any of the other app stores, Windows Mobile App

990
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,040
Store, iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Windows Desktop App

991
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
Store, Android App Store, they've all

992
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,560
had some kind of occasion that something

993
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,240
has been put in the store that users might feel aggrieved at,

994
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
in one way or another.

995
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,720
Whether it's too many pop-up adverts or crypto

996
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,080
mining or something else, everyone's

997
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,600
had this with a rite of passage for any app store.

998
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,080
We've hit that now.

999
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
And yeah, we're going to have to come up

1000
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,560
with ways in which we can ensure that users have confidence

1001
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,520
that the applications that are coming from the developers,

1002
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,160
they can have some level of confidence

1003
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,480
that that's a valid application.

1004
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,640
One thing that we're trying to do with the Snap Store

1005
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,560
is not that you should trust us, Canonical or Ubuntu,

1006
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,480
is that you should trust the developer.

1007
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,040
It's the developer who's pushing their stuff in the store.

1008
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,320
The code is coming from their GitHub repository.

1009
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
You should be able to go and have a look at their GitHub

1010
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,440
repository.

1011
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,200
You should be able to interrogate the Snap

1012
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,200
and figure out where did this come from, who made it,

1013
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,440
what's inside it.

1014
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,360
You should be confident that the thing you're

1015
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,140
installing on your computer is what it says it is.

1016
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,720
And we've got some work to do there,

1017
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,680
because right now, we don't make it obvious where

1018
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,920
the source of the Snap came from.

1019
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,300
So there's certainly some things we can do to improve.

1020
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,600
Maybe verification will help as well.

1021
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah, it obviously will be a process.

1022
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
I'm curious to see when the details come out.

1023
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,280
Congrats on being a real software store now.

1024
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Yeah, it is a challenge, especially

1025
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
if you're going to allow submissions

1026
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,600
from the general public, which you can kind of offset

1027
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,240
to a degree by the fact that they are contained or confined,

1028
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
I guess I should say.

1029
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,720
Right.

1030
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,280
And the other thing is, it's worth

1031
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,520
noting that when we reacted, we reacted really fast,

1032
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,040
like faster than most stores react.

1033
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,060
So when we were told, within a couple of hours,

1034
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,420
it's yanked from the store, so no new users

1035
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,240
could download that application, what we also did

1036
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,080
was made sure that any users who currently had the application,

1037
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,160
we pushed out an update to those users

1038
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,500
that removed the component.

1039
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,160
That's still in progress, that removes the component

1040
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,200
that does the nefarious stuff.

1041
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,560
So they end up with the game and not the malware

1042
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,660
that came along with it.

1043
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,360
So we didn't just leave that software on people's computers,

1044
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,000
but equally, we didn't reach out to everyone's computers

1045
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,800
and delete the software from their computers.

1046
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,000
It's a fine line to walk between saying,

1047
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,580
well, you made the choice to install this software tough,

1048
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,240
and the Amazon way, which was to reach out to people's Kindles

1049
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,320
and delete a book from your Kindle.

1050
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,440
We didn't want to do that.

1051
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,400
We wanted to leave the software, but remove

1052
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,280
the bit that was bad.

1053
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,760
So it was a very delicate line and balance to walk.

1054
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,280
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.

1055
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,120
I'm glad you mentioned that.

1056
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,840
So now, we wait for the details down the road.

1057
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,040
I appreciate that little tidbit about verify.

1058
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,920
I think that is a good idea.

1059
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,800
I mean, it shows that these are concerns that

1060
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,480
take it seriously, and that goes a long way.

1061
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,020
Some of the developers that have applications in the store,

1062
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,620
we have one-to-one relationships with.

1063
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,760
So some of the applications, like those

1064
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,180
which are classic snaps, like many of the popular code

1065
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,160
editors and things like Skype, people

1066
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,080
are a little bit concerned they're classic snaps.

1067
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,160
Being a classic snap, it means it has full access

1068
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,220
to your system, very much like a dev does

1069
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,800
when it's being installed.

1070
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,480
And so people have a little concern there.

1071
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,200
And we go through a vetting process for classic snaps,

1072
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,500
where we vet the developer who has access to the snap

1073
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,640
and make sure it correlates to the upstream developer who

1074
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
owns the application.

1075
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,320
So there's additional scrutiny applied to classic snaps?

1076
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,760
We already do that scrutiny for classic snaps.

1077
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
And perhaps that will be part of what

1078
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,400
we do for our further verification process.

1079
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,160
But like I say, we haven't figured out

1080
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,800
the details of any of it.

1081
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,600
Well, thank you for sharing that insight.

1082
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,140
It's very interesting here for the behind-the-scenes aspect

1083
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,520
of watching it from the outside.

1084
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
Of course, people jumped on the bandwagon, but you're right.

1085
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,640
It is almost a rite of passage to a degree.

1086
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,920
And it's not necessarily even a new type of threat vector.

1087
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,120
We've had rando repositories that people

1088
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,040
have been adding to their sources list for years,

1089
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,840
PPAs that you plug into a system.

1090
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
I think there's always just going to be this conflict,

1091
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,440
right?

1092
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,280
It's either you have a super-lockdown store

1093
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,720
where you don't have all the apps you want,

1094
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,280
or it's easy to publish new software, and it's great,

1095
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,520
and there are just more risks.

1096
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah.

1097
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,240
And the verified step, and perhaps others, will help.

1098
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
All right.

1099
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,800
Well, I want to move on to our friends

1100
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,760
over at the Plasma Camp, who were doing a little get-together

1101
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,360
in Berlin, Germany.

1102
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,320
And some of the folks there gathered to discuss the

1103
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,840
forthcoming 5.13 release, and of course, the future of Plasma

1104
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,800
and Wayland itself.

1105
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,360
But this time, with a twist, one of the members of the Sway

1106
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,840
Window Manager team joined them to talk Wayland input methods

1107
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,040
and a bunch of other things.

1108
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,120
It looks like there was some really fruitful stuff coming

1109
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,800
out of this.

1110
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Drew Devault, the lead developer of the Sway Window Manager,

1111
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
joined the Plasma Sprint to discuss where Wayland

1112
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,400
protocols could be shared between the projects.

1113
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,080
Wow.

1114
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,680
Right?

1115
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,600
Brilliant.

1116
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,480
The team looked at their layer protocol,

1117
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,800
which covers much of the work of the current plasma shell

1118
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
protocol.

1119
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,160
We found that this protocol contained some nice ideas

1120
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,080
and suggested some improvements for the Sway Window Manager

1121
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,280
developers as well.

1122
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,600
The plasma output management protocol was also discussed.

1123
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,840
Now, get this thing.

1124
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,680
This protocol defines how external monitors are used.

1125
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,120
And Sway currently just reloads config files.

1126
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,320
So the Sway team is going to consider using the plasma

1127
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,800
output management protocol so the two projects are using the

1128
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,640
same thing for external monitors.

1129
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
That would be nice.

1130
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,560
This alleviates some of my big concerns I have about the path

1131
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,080
to Wayland.

1132
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,480
And I'm really glad to see this.

1133
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,400
There was also some talks about remote access

1134
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,440
and using pipewire, because that's

1135
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,640
the route the plasma's taking.

1136
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Right.

1137
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,320
This is exactly the thing that we were like, well,

1138
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,760
probably we'll need this in Wayland.

1139
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
And it's happening.

1140
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,760
So that's good.

1141
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,840
It's really good.

1142
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,440
They also had some new work on the new input stack for Qt,

1143
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,240
because there was a bunch of other developers

1144
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,200
there as well.

1145
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
And Sean, I think I'm going to butcher this.

1146
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,800
Rutledge, going to go for that.

1147
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,540
What do you think?

1148
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,160
Yeah, I think this time you got it right.

1149
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,440
Yeah, well, he's the lead developer of Qt's new input

1150
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,560
stack, and he joined the sprint for a few days

1151
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,000
to work on and review the new API.

1152
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,160
And this is really all about putting Wayland first.

1153
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,040
And they said they got some nice parts in that were improved,

1154
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,200
and things went surprisingly smooth.

1155
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,920
And the plasma browser integration got final touches

1156
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,600
for 5.13, which will be released next month.

1157
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Now, the plasma browser integration

1158
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,720
means that Firefox and Chrome and Chromium browsers

1159
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,760
will use Plasma's file transfer widget for downloads

1160
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,420
and the native plasma notifications

1161
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,920
for browser notifications.

1162
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,280
And more importantly for me, the media controls in your task

1163
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,840
manager will work for browser tabs and stuff,

1164
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,640
so you can mute.

1165
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh, love that plasma manager.

1166
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,120
It's nice.

1167
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,920
So lots of stuff there.

1168
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,840
Translations as well getting fixed up, other kinds of things,

1169
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,880
and some work on the Falcon web browser

1170
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,160
and getting it feature parity in terms of plasma integration

1171
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,320
like the other browsers.

1172
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,040
So some good stuff coming out of the plasma sprint in Berlin.

1173
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,280
It's nice to see that.

1174
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,200
Huge, huge fan now these days.

1175
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm all about it.

1176
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,600
I've just really become quite the plasma fan.

1177
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,280
You're biased, we know.

1178
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,240
I really am.

1179
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,160
It's been working so rock solid for me.

1180
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,320
I appreciate your restraint.

1181
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,840
You only put in this one story here.

1182
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,960
That takes a lot of self-control.

1183
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
I'm going to get you to switch eventually.

1184
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,520
Popi and I, we're still rocking it.

1185
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,800
We're still rocking it, right?

1186
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,360
Yeah, Popi, you're still there, yes?

1187
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,040
Yeah, totally.

1188
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,520
Totally.

1189
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,560
All day, every day.

1190
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,360
Really?

1191
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,560
Really?

1192
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,600
Yeah.

1193
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,440
It's an almost believable yeah.

1194
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,320
OK, so I have two computers.

1195
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,080
My main computer runs Unity on 1804,

1196
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,160
but the laptop that I go walking around with, my T450,

1197
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,360
that runs KDE Neon.

1198
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,400
I have to point out, still the same install I did just

1199
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
after I came back from your place, and it's still rocking.

1200
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,560
I love it.

1201
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,060
I don't want to steal his story because he might share it

1202
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,760
on air, but Noah has a hilarious story

1203
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,000
that is a true tribute to how stable KDE Neon was for him.

1204
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,840
Long story short, he never rebooted

1205
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,180
since the initial install.

1206
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,000
He'd just been using it and sleeping his laptop, which

1207
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,920
bit him in the arse in a major way, but I'll leave it to him.

1208
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,520
What?

1209
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,420
It's too funny of a story for me to share for him.

1210
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,420
I won't take it from him, but it's a good one.

1211
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,000
And it's been the same thing for him.

1212
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,920
Super rock solid.

1213
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,680
We're still running on all of the studio systems here,

1214
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,880
so it's great just to see the team getting together in person

1215
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,560
to put that final polish on 5.13.

1216
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,680
I think that really makes a big difference for some

1217
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,440
of these teams, so it's nice to see them have a chance

1218
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,680
to be able to do that.

1219
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,840
We have much, much, much, much, much more to get into.

1220
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,280
Still lots to discuss, so let's take a moment

1221
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,580
and thank DigitalOcean.

1222
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,280
Go to do.co slash unplugged, where you will get a $100

1223
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,920
credit at DigitalOcean when you sign up with a new account.

1224
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,840
That lasts for 60 days and gives you a chance

1225
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,560
to try out DigitalOcean.

1226
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,800
Everything's based on super fast enterprise grade SSDs.

1227
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,240
It's designed for developers, but it works for human beings.

1228
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,280
They have a dashboard that's so good,

1229
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,240
you might call it a dashboard for days.

1230
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,100
And now they have new flexible droplets

1231
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,120
where you can mix and match resources

1232
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,880
that are the most appropriate for your application.

1233
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,600
do.co slash unplugged.

1234
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,120
They have private networking if you

1235
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,720
want to have something in the back end,

1236
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,280
like a database or a cache.

1237
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,680
They have block storage that you can add to your system

1238
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,280
as you need it.

1239
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,640
I just put 250 gigs on it.

1240
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,160
Oh, big spender, but not really.

1241
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,760
Not that bad.

1242
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,640
It's pretty reasonably priced for what you get.

1243
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,880
Yeah, so for an example, my favorite rig, $0.03 an hour.

1244
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,400
What?

1245
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,480
Yeah, and that's a significantly fast rig, too.

1246
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,140
It's probably more resources than I really

1247
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,240
need most of the time.

1248
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,340
And you can get a $100 credit when

1249
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,920
you go to do.co slash unplugged.

1250
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,560
They have a great API that's clearly documented,

1251
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,600
easy to follow, and because of that,

1252
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,440
there's tons of really good open source code already written.

1253
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,280
You can integrate it into your Linux desktop,

1254
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,840
like control your droplets.

1255
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,000
You can get apps for your phone.

1256
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,680
You can get command line scripts.

1257
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,280
You can get libraries for your favorite programming language.

1258
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,320
I mean, the whole spectrum is covered for DigitalOcean.

1259
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,120
Plus, they have a ton of great distributions,

1260
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,600
all of the real distributions you'd probably

1261
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,240
want to put on a server to begin with, plus that free BSD.

1262
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,120
Really?

1263
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,680
Yeah.

1264
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,180
Wow.

1265
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,440
So go check it out, do.co slash unplugged.

1266
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,080
Get the $100 credit, and a big thank you

1267
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,360
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program,

1268
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,120
do.co slash unplugged.

1269
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,440
So with the release of 18.04, we've

1270
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,000
seen a disappointing trend of clickbait

1271
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,600
to try to make or manufacture, you might say,

1272
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,080
some drama around the, quote, data collection

1273
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
services in Ubuntu 18.04.

1274
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,560
And even the name is sort of overdramatizing what this is.

1275
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,360
If you install Ubuntu 18.04, at the end,

1276
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,040
there's a screen that comes up that says what's new in Ubuntu.

1277
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,280
And at the end of that screen, it talks about data collection.

1278
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,720
And it shows you an example of the data collection.

1279
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,160
We're going to go over one of those reports in a moment.

1280
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,080
But I've noticed a trend, particularly with YouTube.

1281
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,240
And I hate to come on here and be like,

1282
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,640
Chris yells at YouTube once again.

1283
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,880
Oh, then Chris is back.

1284
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,560
But it's pretty disappointing, because it

1285
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,400
plays to a well-trained sort of knee-jerk response

1286
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,820
that's in the audience to respond badly to anything

1287
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,080
about data collection.

1288
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,080
Because of all of the Facebook stuff, all of the Google stuff

1289
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,240
that we all know, NSA collection,

1290
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,000
since Edward Snowden, we've had it drilled into us

1291
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,320
that everybody's spying on us.

1292
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,120
Windows 10 launched with all these metrics.

1293
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,240
It's just been drilled into us that spying equals bad,

1294
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,800
data equals bad.

1295
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,480
But the reality is, if you're deploying a large-scale

1296
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,000
operating system, you have to have some insights

1297
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,440
into your customer base.

1298
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:02,960
You have to.

1299
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,000
You want that feedback cycle, yeah.

1300
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,040
And so there's a line to be walked here.

1301
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,320
And I think Canonical has walked it really well,

1302
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,560
because they could have gone further than they did.

1303
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,040
Essentially, what happens when you opt into this data

1304
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,720
collection is you generate a report about your system.

1305
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,200
And I'll have an example report linked in the show notes.

1306
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,160
And what it does is it collects things

1307
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,560
like the version of Ubuntu that you just installed,

1308
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,280
the type of processor that you have, the type of GPU,

1309
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,840
the vendor and model number, just

1310
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,320
like they would be in an Xorg report, nothing fancy.

1311
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,400
It's not like it's a super in-depth thing here.

1312
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,720
Your screen resolution, if you have live patch or auto log

1313
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,400
on, turned on, the desktop environment,

1314
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,240
and if you're using Wayland or X, then your time zone,

1315
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,880
the media that you use to install, like the ISO,

1316
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,720
if you use the minimal install.

1317
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,560
And that's essentially it.

1318
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,240
There's a couple of other basics in here,

1319
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,820
like did you download updates during the install?

1320
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,960
That's the data that gets sent.

1321
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,520
It's really quite harmless.

1322
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,360
And also, if you choose not to participate in the data

1323
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,360
collection, there is a one-time ping.

1324
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,700
All of this is just a JSON file in clear text

1325
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,000
that you can read yourself.

1326
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,680
You can just open it up and read it, and it's clear.

1327
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,280
And there's a one-time ping that's

1328
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,360
sent to Canonical that says user did not

1329
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,080
opt into data collection.

1330
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,420
There's no IP, no identifiable information.

1331
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,920
Will Cook stated they don't even store the IP address

1332
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,240
of the HTTP connection in the Apache logs.

1333
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
On the server side, yeah.

1334
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,920
Right.

1335
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,160
It's just that they opted out.

1336
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,760
So that way, they have a metric to know

1337
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,120
how many people are choosing not to use this program,

1338
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,520
so they can have idea how unpopular.

1339
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,120
Yeah, exactly.

1340
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,280
So you know how many total installs are happening.

1341
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,240
But that doesn't stop people from attempting

1342
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,200
to generate controversy, because that generates clicks

1343
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,780
and views and ad dollars.

1344
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,860
And if you look at the comments on a couple

1345
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,640
of these different YouTube videos,

1346
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,240
people are all in on this stuff.

1347
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,400
They're all in on it, because they are just

1348
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,560
looking at that word data collection,

1349
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,240
and they're freaking out.

1350
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,000
And the problem is that it actually

1351
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,120
handicaps Canonical's ability to really figure out

1352
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,920
what's popular.

1353
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,240
Like for example, 64-bit versus 32-bit.

1354
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,760
How many of their users are actually

1355
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,800
using 32-bit processors?

1356
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,480
Or how many of them are installing a 32-bit version

1357
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,760
of the OS on 64-bit capable hardware?

1358
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,920
That simple plain text data file tells them that.

1359
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,880
That's a pretty valuable piece of information

1360
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,960
that could save them tons of engineering time.

1361
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,280
Well, and also it can be very difficult

1362
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,720
to get that feedback other ways.

1363
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,120
You often see that minority communities are

1364
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,540
going to communicate a lot more.

1365
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,600
And it's hard to get a sense of just what

1366
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,360
a lot of bland default users who don't care

1367
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,200
to give feedback to Canonical, this

1368
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,840
is a way that they can be sampled in that user base.

1369
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,060
Producer Michael responded on one of the videos.

1370
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,520
He said, I completely disagree with this video being made,

1371
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,160
because none of the collection is a negative thing.

1372
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,760
The initial data collection of Ubuntu report of,

1373
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,520
it's Ubuntu Dash report by the way,

1374
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,360
when you choose not to send info only

1375
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,560
sends that you chose not to send info.

1376
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,840
The removal of the package merely to not tell them actually

1377
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,200
skews the data, because it lowers

1378
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,680
the amount of people who will be continued and counted

1379
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,120
as not participating.

1380
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,860
So these videos are advising uninstall this package,

1381
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,520
so that way you don't have anything ever sent to them.

1382
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,880
Never even a ping.

1383
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,160
Wow.

1384
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,280
But the problem is, is then Canonical has no metric

1385
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,200
to know how unpopular this is.

1386
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,560
So producer Michael goes on.

1387
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,460
If you wanted them to know you dislike it,

1388
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,320
then you have to send them the info that you opted out.

1389
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,360
They have to have that information.

1390
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,640
The reason it was made automatic and opt out

1391
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,640
is because most people dismiss the pop ups

1392
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,200
and close it anyways.

1393
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,480
The other aspect is there's some bug data collection

1394
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,240
that will automatically get sent to the background that

1395
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,640
does contain more information.

1396
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,520
But again, that's critical information

1397
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,280
that every commercial desktop operating system is collecting.

1398
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
And that's really my piece on this,

1399
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,960
is I think this is actually an example of how

1400
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,120
open source media can be, or free software coverage,

1401
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,160
or whatever label you want to apply to it,

1402
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,560
can actually be destructive to the movement.

1403
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,160
Because it creates fear and uncertainty and doubt

1404
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,040
about something that is very vanilla and very clear.

1405
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,560
You actually, when you finish the first time run wizard

1406
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,960
of 1804, you can click a button, and it will show you

1407
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,160
what it's going to send.

1408
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
So you can review all of it.

1409
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,000
We also kind of waste an opportunity

1410
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,240
to interact with the developers, with the organizations

1411
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,640
in the community.

1412
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,480
I mean, Ubuntu, I think, has been very clear about what

1413
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,440
their purposes were.

1414
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,000
There was a long period of assessment

1415
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,560
before this feature got included.

1416
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,860
So you don't have to pretend it's

1417
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,160
some monolithic corporation.

1418
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,680
It's not Oracle we're talking about,

1419
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
where you have to assume the worst.

1420
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,560
Why can't we have a good faith discussion about this?

1421
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,760
Maybe people don't like it for legitimate reasons.

1422
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,120
Let's not start it from a bunch of posturing videos

1423
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,160
that haven't bothered to have a conversation.

1424
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,240
And Gambus, do you think it's also something

1425
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,580
that software developers have more appreciation

1426
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,400
for than, say, an average user?

1427
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,280
Yeah, I mean, I've been developing some applications

1428
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,720
for the Linux desktop, and they are quite specific.

1429
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,400
And many times it happened that people just reported,

1430
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,680
oh, this thing doesn't work, and I don't know what's going on.

1431
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,320
And I just tried troubleshooting and spent many hours

1432
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,720
trying to get the information about the hardware.

1433
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,280
When if I just add in some user profiling,

1434
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,360
well, not user profiling, but some information

1435
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,000
that's useful for developers, just like an Oracle is doing,

1436
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,900
I would have had a much easier life trying

1437
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,720
to troubleshoot all these issues.

1438
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,240
And I think this is the same thing for Ubuntu.

1439
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,000
I mean, they have to make a distribution that

1440
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,960
works on such a great variety of hardware.

1441
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,120
And I can only imagine how difficult

1442
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,040
it can be to fix so many possible and potential bugs

1443
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,600
without knowing anything about the systems

1444
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,840
that those bugs are on.

1445
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,240
I mean, the typical problem that works on my machine

1446
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,960
and nobody else's.

1447
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,400
Yeah, it's hard to fully appreciate it

1448
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,560
from the support standpoint, and how do you make decisions,

1449
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,060
and how do you design your software

1450
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,520
when you have zero visibility into your user base.

1451
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,440
And if you want to see what the information actually is,

1452
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,220
if you're on 18.04 right now, you

1453
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,640
can run Ubuntu-report show, and it will generate

1454
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,840
the report that gets sent.

1455
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,080
So you can review it and see how benign this is.

1456
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,320
Wimpy, were you going to jump in with something there?

1457
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,360
I was.

1458
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,920
There's a couple of issues I have with this particular video.

1459
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,280
The first is everything about it is technically inaccurate.

1460
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,040
So it's got a wonderful click-baity title.

1461
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,360
But the first thing it explains to do

1462
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,880
is remove the Ubuntu-report package, which is actually

1463
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,800
the wrong package to remove, because that

1464
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,840
isn't the package that the GNOME first run wizard interacts

1465
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,560
with.

1466
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:02,000
And you actually see this in the video that he clicks no,

1467
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,080
and it generates the opt-out report,

1468
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,720
and he sort of skips over it a little bit.

1469
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,800
So it's removing the wrong package.

1470
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,120
He also suggests that you remove popularity contest, which

1471
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,800
is also known as PopCon.

1472
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,920
Now, that's installed by default,

1473
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,320
but it's not enabled by default. And sending a telemetry report

1474
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,920
doesn't enable PopCon.

1475
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,280
PopCon is installed by default, not enabled,

1476
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,640
and we have no plans to turn it on.

1477
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,600
So in suggesting that you remove Ubuntu-report and popularity

1478
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,520
content because these are the things that collect data,

1479
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,160
that also removes the Ubuntu standard meta package.

1480
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,520
And what that does is breaks your upgrade path from 18.04

1481
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,480
to any subsequent version of Ubuntu.

1482
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,240
So if you follow the instructions in this video,

1483
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,600
one, it doesn't actually change the behavior

1484
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,760
of the first run wizard, and two,

1485
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,920
it breaks your ability to upgrade in the future.

1486
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,040
Wow.

1487
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,400
That is really damaging in a way that I hadn't even

1488
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,200
touched on before is that a lot of times

1489
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,400
these videos are poorly researched and kind of thrown

1490
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,280
together because you need to capitalize on something

1491
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,760
while it's very popular in order to generate.

1492
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,320
There's no time for research, Chris.

1493
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,360
YouTube has this term that they tell

1494
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,360
you to score for called VPH, which

1495
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,320
stands for views per hour.

1496
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,920
And you want to optimize your VPH so that way it

1497
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,500
juices the algorithm and puts you in front of subscribers.

1498
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,280
And the way you do that is by producing a video on something

1499
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,920
that's trending at the moment, that's

1500
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,120
popular amongst your audience at the moment.

1501
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,640
And so that is a long way of saying

1502
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,320
you are incentivized to rush content on YouTube.

1503
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,080
And that's damaging as well, right?

1504
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,400
Because YouTubers are being incentivized

1505
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,960
to produce content quickly, which

1506
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,280
could be fine in some respects.

1507
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,060
But the 17 pence extra a month that this particular video

1508
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,760
is going to generate, which is trading off besmirching

1509
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,240
Ubuntu's reputation with a technically inaccurate bit

1510
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,800
of video tutorial, that is poisoning the world.

1511
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,600
It doesn't help anybody.

1512
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,440
You see all of these comments.

1513
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,880
They see data collection.

1514
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,360
They assume this is like the kind of invasive stuff

1515
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,640
that's in Windows 10.

1516
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,920
Literally, that's in the comments several times, yeah.

1517
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,280
And they make all the wrong assumptions.

1518
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,400
And there is nothing in the words

1519
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,160
that are used in the video or the title to suggest otherwise.

1520
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,400
And the source code's available.

1521
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,520
I mean, if you want to research this,

1522
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,480
you just go and look at the source code and see how it works.

1523
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,560
What I find frustrating is that Martin alluded to the fact

1524
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,720
that if you do something, there are some things

1525
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,280
that it's possible to do to Ubuntu

1526
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,520
that many new users follow blindly a tutorial that

1527
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,720
breaks their experience six months down the line.

1528
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,440
When they come to upgrade to the next point release,

1529
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,280
or if they're more conservative, they

1530
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,400
upgrade to the next LTS release.

1531
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,600
And the problem is people don't remember.

1532
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,400
In six months' time, they won't remember

1533
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,500
that a thing they did six months ago

1534
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,680
is the reason why they can no longer upgrade.

1535
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,200
We get it in the neck.

1536
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,720
And people say Ubuntu upgrades don't work.

1537
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,560
They do if you don't screw your system in the first place.

1538
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,880
But the problem is you screwed your system six months ago,

1539
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,280
and you've long forgotten any terminal command

1540
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,480
that some random dude on YouTube told you to put in.

1541
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,280
You thought it was a good idea at the time,

1542
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,400
because that's what he told you.

1543
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,000
Six months later, you're in our IRC channel

1544
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,520
or on our support network asking us, why is my system broken?

1545
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,200
I've upgraded and I've got a black screen,

1546
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,400
or it won't upgrade, or it crashes, or whatever.

1547
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,160
And we're like, well, that thing you did six months ago,

1548
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,280
no, no, no, it's you.

1549
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,120
You're the reason all this stuff is broken.

1550
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,560
It's Ubuntu's fault.

1551
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,680
And that's really bitter pill to swallow,

1552
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,760
because we try really hard to make these upgrades work.

1553
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,200
But if people actively shoot themselves in the foot,

1554
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,760
it's really hard to undo that.

1555
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,360
And that's really painful six months, two years down the line.

1556
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,000
So behind the scenes, if you do remove

1557
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the Ubuntu standard package, which people have done

1558
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,640
for different reasons in error, there

1559
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
are some heuristics in the upgrade manager

1560
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,680
that try to figure out, what version of Ubuntu

1561
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,560
did you have installed before it got

1562
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,560
gutted to try and piece together what it should

1563
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,360
do to repair the situation?

1564
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,600
But it's a best guess, because you

1565
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,240
can do so much to your system to mess with it.

1566
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,720
And this kind of thing, removing the base meta package,

1567
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,640
is just a recipe for disaster.

1568
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,520
Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up,

1569
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,920
because I hadn't watched more than a few minutes

1570
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,760
into the video where I started to read the comments.

1571
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,920
And I got really frustrated, because two things.

1572
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,320
It plays on the paranoia of a technically savvy audience

1573
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,660
about metrics.

1574
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,680
And it builds, perhaps, momentum against future projects

1575
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,280
that might want to do something similar.

1576
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,600
And I would argue that is a bad thing,

1577
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,920
because I would make an argument that these metrics are benign

1578
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,880
and that they are beneficial.

1579
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,720
And then they are much more beneficial

1580
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,040
than they are in any way benign in a sense

1581
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,160
that they could track you or that they

1582
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,760
would be identifiable.

1583
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,400
The thing is you really have to appreciate

1584
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,360
how much insight they're able to gain just

1585
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,920
out of knowing the types of processors, the Windows

1586
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,160
server, and desktop environments.

1587
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,640
That can significantly give a company

1588
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,040
like Canonical important information

1589
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,480
so they know where to focus development resources.

1590
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,480
And they're competing against commercial operating systems

1591
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,760
that are doing 10 times the level of data collection.

1592
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,200
Right, and then on the other side,

1593
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,020
you end up with complaints about, why don't we have this?

1594
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,680
Why don't we have that?

1595
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,720
How come we can't compete?

1596
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,960
And it's just a no-win game in that world.

1597
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,980
At the beginning of this episode,

1598
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,440
we talked about the Gnome project removing the ability

1599
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,600
to run binary files.

1600
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Imagine, and I'm not suggesting that this

1601
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,320
would be a good world, but let's imagine

1602
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,880
that the Gnome project did have telemetry

1603
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,360
on how people used Gnome Shell.

1604
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,480
And let's say they had telemetry that showed that 75%

1605
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,720
of their users, at least once a day,

1606
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,360
launched a binary file from their file manager.

1607
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,120
They may not be considering removing that functionality.

1608
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,320
But they have no data.

1609
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,520
They have no insights other than their gut intuition

1610
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,280
and what they grok from the drive-by feedback

1611
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,160
that they get.

1612
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,240
I have no, and I think most people in Ubuntu

1613
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
have no problem with the fact that people

1614
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,440
might want to tick the no box and say, no, I

1615
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,560
don't want to do this, right?

1616
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,320
Yeah, have at it.

1617
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,960
It's an individual decision that someone might say,

1618
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,960
you know what?

1619
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,240
I don't care.

1620
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,880
And I actually value my own personal privacy

1621
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,240
so much that I don't want to even tell you

1622
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,200
what resolution display I had when

1623
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,880
I installed the software product that I got for you

1624
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,280
for free, right?

1625
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,000
I don't want to tell you that.

1626
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,360
OK, fine.

1627
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,200
But that's another step to then make a video

1628
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,040
to tell the whole world not to do that as well.

1629
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,160
That's what gets me.

1630
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,760
Because when you socialize that whole don't allow Canonical

1631
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,360
to have any kind of data in order

1632
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,720
to plan what they're doing in the future,

1633
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,680
and then we plan things.

1634
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,280
And you say, well, what the fuck were Canonical thinking?

1635
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,680
Why were they doing those things?

1636
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:25,880
Why did they focus on laptops with 1366 by 768 displays?

1637
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,320
Well, because that's the only data we have, right?

1638
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,480
That's all we know.

1639
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,600
And if we don't know what type of displays there are out there,

1640
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,000
what types of CPUs out there, we can't make educated decisions.

1641
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,680
And if everyone is told to turn this shit off,

1642
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,320
what the fuck are we going to do?

1643
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,280
I agree.

1644
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,760
And it's going to scare other projects away

1645
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,440
from something similar.

1646
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,120
And the thing that is unfortunate

1647
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,680
is this was pretty well implemented,

1648
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,000
I really have to say.

1649
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,760
The real cherry on the top was at the end

1650
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,600
where you could see the report or the fact

1651
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,720
that you could show yourself the report at any time.

1652
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,320
You can see in a plain text file what's being said.

1653
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,280
Simple, transparent.

1654
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,160
And it's all clearly documented about what from the bug reports

1655
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,780
get sent and all of that telemetry.

1656
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,240
So even when it was done, I think,

1657
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,440
probably the most open and transparent way possible,

1658
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,760
including the very source code, the powers, all of this

1659
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,840
is open.

1660
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,840
I just don't know.

1661
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,160
It's obvious that the core issue here

1662
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,000
is that there is a financial incentive or a even ego

1663
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,600
incentive for different outlets to try to make hay on this.

1664
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,880
There's a lot of stories that just get blown out

1665
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,640
of proportion.

1666
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,880
And this is just another one of them.

1667
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,360
So I've made this point before.

1668
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,440
I won't make it again.

1669
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,680
But thanks, you guys, for your thoughts on that.

1670
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,920
And just be aware of it, even if you don't want

1671
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,240
to opt into data collection.

1672
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,800
Just be aware of the impact this kind of stuff

1673
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,440
has because I think you're completely, like Popi said,

1674
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,160
you're 100% within your right to not send any data.

1675
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,440
I do think it's pretty nice, though, to send them

1676
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,200
the I'm opting out.

1677
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,640
So that way, they get a signal.

1678
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,480
So you can essentially have a vote still.

1679
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,080
I think that's something to consider.

1680
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,200
All right, I want to just also talk about really briefly

1681
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,640
a little follow-up on the reverse engineering

1682
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,440
at Purism for some of Intel's FSP stuff that disappeared

1683
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,040
off the internet all of a sudden.

1684
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,920
Whoa.

1685
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,840
Yeah, there was a blog post that went up

1686
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,960
describing the in-depth technical process

1687
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,800
that they went through recently to reverse engineer

1688
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,480
some of this Intel crap.

1689
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,360
And we noticed on LAN that it disappeared.

1690
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,760
And so we made a comment on Linux Action News

1691
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,920
that perhaps they had been contacted by Intel.

1692
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,920
Yeah, it looks like that was the case.

1693
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,200
It looks like Intel politely asked Purism

1694
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,200
to remove their document because they thought it might conflict

1695
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,280
with licensing terms, i.e., if you want to buy processors

1696
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,600
from us in the future, you'll be taking that down.

1697
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,200
That's a pretty big fist to say no to.

1698
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,400
Yeah, and so they complied.

1699
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,240
However, the internet never forgets, as you well know.

1700
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,720
And Chris somehow found a copy in archive.org.

1701
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,720
You demon, you.

1702
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,800
So if you want to read this extremely in-depth technical

1703
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,120
document, I'll have a link in the show notes,

1704
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,360
linuxunplug.com, slash 249 to archive.org.

1705
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,040
Wes, I almost think we should save this Docker story

1706
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,800
for another day.

1707
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,000
It deserves probably a better discussion.

1708
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,480
Yeah.

1709
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,120
I'll just quickly, last week I made a comment

1710
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,120
at the end of the show.

1711
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,400
I think nobody's going to like this episode

1712
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,280
because we talked about containers too much.

1713
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,080
Wah, wah, wah.

1714
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,600
And I got a couple of emails that were like,

1715
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,080
I actually really enjoyed that because nobody else is really

1716
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
talking about that.

1717
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,280
And it's a huge part of my life these days.

1718
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,280
And it's a huge part of where software is going.

1719
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,560
So I feel like people have their heads in the sand.

1720
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,600
And then other emails were like, it's new to me.

1721
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,880
And I'm learning.

1722
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,160
So it was interesting to hear what you could do with it.

1723
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,680
Nobody really emailed and saying they hated it.

1724
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,480
But I assume some people do get tired of us

1725
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,680
talking about magical ponies and container technologies.

1726
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,360
So I'm going to save why Docker is dangerous.

1727
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,840
And it's a gamble that you will regret for a future episode.

1728
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,680
But it's out there.

1729
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,680
We'll be talking more about it in the future.

1730
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,560
Because there is still that question

1731
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,240
that I want to get to before we wrap up.

1732
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,520
I want to ask the Mumba Room and Wes if it's

1733
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,760
time to move on from the all GTK, our all cute mentality.

1734
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,240
So let's start first by thanking Ting.

1735
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,920
I'm taking them to Texas with me.

1736
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,560
This show is going to be broadcasted over Ting all

1737
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,360
the way down to Tejas.

1738
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,760
And it's perfect.

1739
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,320
It's pay for what you use wireless.

1740
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,680
So I've got a little MiFi for CDMA.

1741
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,480
And I've got a little MiFi for GSM.

1742
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,260
Because Ting has both networks.

1743
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,640
And I let them sit around for a little bit, boss level.

1744
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,880
It's $6 for the line.

1745
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,680
So you don't care.

1746
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,040
That's funny badger.

1747
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,400
And you could just deactivate the device

1748
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,200
if you weren't going to use it for six months

1749
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,800
and then just order up a SIM and pop it in and good to go again.

1750
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,080
That's actually what I've done.

1751
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:41,680
And it's great.

1752
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,360
Because then I've got CDMA and GSM with me as I go.

1753
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,700
And I just pay for the usage.

1754
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,880
So whenever I'm parked somewhere that has Wi-Fi, which I always shoot for,

1755
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
then I'm not paying anything for data.

1756
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,840
It's like I'm just getting by for free.

1757
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,140
It's nationwide coverage with no contracts.

1758
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,560
It's just $6 for the line.

1759
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,800
And you pay for what you use, your minutes, your messages,

1760
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,680
and your megabytes.

1761
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,920
There's a control panel you can log into to always check

1762
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,760
your minutes and your messages and your data usage.

1763
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,480
And you can always take total control, turn stuff on and off,

1764
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,240
activate and deactivate devices.

1765
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,440
You can set usage alerts.

1766
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,480
If I ever get talked into giving my kids a phone,

1767
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,320
I'm going to start using those usage alerts.

1768
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,080
Dylan, stop it.

1769
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:17,600
Too much.

1770
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,960
Get off them internets.

1771
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,160
And they've got lots of devices, including the new Moto devices.

1772
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,120
It's got the modules.

1773
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,520
Have you seen that where you can snap on a new camera or battery and stuff?

1774
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,360
They're selling that now.

1775
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,400
Or you can bring your device, and they'll give you a $25 service credit.

1776
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,200
Love it.

1777
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,400
Might just pay for more than your first month.

1778
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,480
So go check it out.

1779
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,360
Linux.ting.com.

1780
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,800
That's linux.ting.com.

1781
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,840
I just noticed there's a TechSnap logo there.

1782
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,040
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

1783
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,600
That threw me off a little bit.

1784
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,320
Am I doing the TechSnap show?

1785
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,880
But don't worry.

1786
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,360
You still get to type linux.ting.com.

1787
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,960
And maybe go see the old TechSnap logo.

1788
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,920
It's kind of retro.

1789
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,840
Woo.

1790
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,960
I made that logo.

1791
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,720
Look at you.

1792
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,720
Yeah, you can tell, too.

1793
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,600
Professional.

1794
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,880
You can tell I made that logo.

1795
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,480
And then we have a new one.

1796
01:08:59,480 --> 01:08:59,960
Yeah.

1797
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,760
The new logo is done by a pro.

1798
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,520
OK, so this was a question that popped up on the dumpster fire known as RLinux.

1799
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:12,640
And it was asking, is this mentality still relevant today, the all GTK or all Qt mentality?

1800
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,360
I ask this because I've seen people arguing about this online.

1801
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,760
He says, nowadays, there's a lot of disk space.

1802
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,920
So usually having two GUI frameworks installed really doesn't make a big

1803
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,520
difference on disk usage.

1804
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,680
And he says, there's also people who use GTK apps when using a GTK desktop and Qt

1805
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,840
apps when using a Qt desktop, and they only use those apps.

1806
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:36,560
And I actually will admit to when I switched back to Plasma again, I tried to just try

1807
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,360
to do Qt everything.

1808
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,080
And when I couldn't find a good Qt Twitter client, I just didn't even bother getting

1809
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,080
it.

1810
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,480
I just use the website now.

1811
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:43,960
Yeah, sure.

1812
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,360
Or I was using Corebird on GNOME.

1813
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,200
Or some Curses UI you found.

1814
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,440
It would be great.

1815
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,840
So I admit I actually do kind of try to skew all Qt now.

1816
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,280
Wow.

1817
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,600
Backing QO notes and stuff like that.

1818
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,560
Yeah, I admit I've done this a little bit.

1819
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,200
What do you think you get out of it?

1820
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,000
Do you like it?

1821
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,120
Do you feel clean?

1822
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,680
There's small things that I appreciate.

1823
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,960
Small consistency things like in my open and save dialogues, like my favorites and my

1824
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,360
bookmarks are different between my GTK and Qt dialogue open and close boxes.

1825
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,520
And that's always frustrating because I'll be working in Qt apps all day, and so I'll

1826
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,920
have a new bookmark in there.

1827
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,560
And then I go into a GTK app, and I've got to browse the file system like an animal.

1828
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,920
It's so slow.

1829
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,800
And that stuff is kind of frustrating.

1830
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,400
So that makes me kind of prefer that.

1831
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,480
And then you get other bennies usually, like the plasma notification integration or KIO

1832
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,320
slave stuff.

1833
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,280
And there's just things that are with the Qt apps that I just like to have.

1834
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,640
Better integration, sort of a first class feel.

1835
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,120
Yeah.

1836
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,600
Yeah.

1837
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,880
You're on the gnome side of things.

1838
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,360
You don't seem to shy away from a Qt app, though.

1839
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,640
No, that's fine.

1840
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,560
I don't have a ton of Qt apps.

1841
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,760
You kind of have a mixed family desktop, don't you?

1842
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,760
A little bit, yeah.

1843
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,560
But yeah, I guess I can see why you might want to do it.

1844
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,800
I can appreciate a little of the software purism, but I'm not.

1845
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,200
The theme looks a little better.

1846
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,600
Oh, that's gotten a lot better these days.

1847
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,880
I guess it depends on if it's a program that's easily replaced, then sure.

1848
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,360
Maybe you'll find a new program that you love.

1849
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,800
That's one of the great things about being a Linux open source enthusiast, right?

1850
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,000
Is you have so many choices.

1851
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,640
I'll tell you, I've taken this far enough that I've given Kmail several goes.

1852
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,480
OK, yeah.

1853
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,080
And I like Kmail in its own way.

1854
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,680
I like it.

1855
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,400
It's in its own esoteric, unique way.

1856
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,600
I like it.

1857
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,240
But Snap installed MailSpring.

1858
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,520
That's just what I ended up going back to MailSpring.

1859
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,240
Yeah, I did.

1860
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,120
And it's the Snap, too.

1861
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,960
I Snap installed MailSpring.

1862
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,800
And it's just better.

1863
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,800
But it's like this hybrid app.

1864
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,720
It's not a Qt app, either.

1865
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,840
Clearly, you've been thinking about it, though.

1866
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,760
And that bugs me.

1867
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,280
Yeah, it is something that crosses my mind.

1868
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,880
What about you guys in the Mumble Room?

1869
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,040
Anybody want to admit if they're a Qt or GTK purist?

1870
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,400
I'm not a purist, no.

1871
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,800
So I use what is the best tool for the job.

1872
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,480
So for example, I use QoNotes as well.

1873
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,640
That's a Qt application.

1874
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,880
But it's the best that's available.

1875
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,920
I use the Shotcut Video Editor and ABS.

1876
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,400
And they're both Qt applications.

1877
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,240
And I use VLC, video player.

1878
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,480
And that's a Qt application.

1879
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,960
Same.

1880
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,120
So yeah, I use what's best.

1881
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,800
Yeah, when you install MailSpring, by the way, little pro tip.

1882
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,600
If you Snap install MailSpring on the Plasma desktop,

1883
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,360
you also have to install Gnome Keyring in the background.

1884
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,440
Because it will not run without that.

1885
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,880
I have two machines.

1886
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:37,920
One is mostly with the approach of let's try to use everything Gnome.

1887
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,440
And the other machine, it's the one I develop in.

1888
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,800
That one, of course, is full of everything.

1889
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,840
Yeah, interesting.

1890
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,280
So why do you have the one that's all pure?

1891
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,160
Is that, in an ideal world, your preferred setup?

1892
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:57,080
Just generally, I would like to see the project.

1893
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,360
I started with Gnome, essentially.

1894
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,240
And I'd like to see the project to be able to be self-sufficient in all

1895
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,160
of its toolings.

1896
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,120
There's no better way to try the flow.

1897
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,400
I also am a very big fan of default.

1898
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,560
So I don't tend to use things that, by default, are not the way

1899
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,800
I tend to like them most.

1900
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,120
I really don't like fiddling around.

1901
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,880
In the beginning, that was exciting.

1902
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,800
No longer.

1903
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,440
There's no time for that.

1904
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,440
Yeah, I understand.

1905
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,640
That's how I kind of see it.

1906
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,480
Let's try to reduce the foreign aspects and have the experience.

1907
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,560
And if the experience is not it, try find something else.

1908
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,720
Generally, that's how I go.

1909
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,600
And something else might mean the whole new package.

1910
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,680
I don't care what toolkit an application has.

1911
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,600
Looking down my launcher, things that I'm running right now,

1912
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:53,640
Firefox, Telegram, Gnome Terminal, Steam, Slack, IRC, Cloud,

1913
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:00,920
Visual Studio, Zenkit, VirtualBox, Discord, Signal, and Mumble.

1914
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,440
Don't care.

1915
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,680
So if I want to talk to you, I use Mumble on this show right now.

1916
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,400
I'm not going to go out there and say, I can't use Mumble because it's cute.

1917
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,200
And I've got a GTK desktop.

1918
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,360
That's just lunacy, right?

1919
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,680
I'm using the application that I need to get the job done.

1920
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:24,040
And so I installed the right application for the job.

1921
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,440
But that's not what I'm advocating.

1922
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,040
I'm just saying that there's a preferential path that I have.

1923
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,800
And then, of course, you do one or other exception.

1924
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,480
But I think that for having that cohesive experience,

1925
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,800
you do in the beginning go through, oh, maybe there's a lack of this.

1926
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,880
And again, I have two machines, and I develop stuff.

1927
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,720
And it's also one way of seeing, oh, there's a potential target here to develop.

1928
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:57,480
And I can see how someone might want to dive fully into the elementary experience

1929
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,440
and only use elementary applications designed, written in Valor,

1930
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:06,800
delivered in the elementary app store, and designed specifically

1931
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,840
for that environment.

1932
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,480
And I can see why you might do that.

1933
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,200
But I'd be pretty sure after a short while,

1934
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,520
you'd feel like you're missing out on something.

1935
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,080
And there's a couple of applications you really need,

1936
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,760
and there's someone you need to talk to, or there's some application you need

1937
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,880
access to, or some data you need access to,

1938
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,160
that you need to install something that breaks outside of that amazing,

1939
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:31,640
though it is, Valor boundary and into Qt or GTK or whatever.

1940
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,880
It does seem inevitable from that perspective.

1941
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,280
I might want a new user to start out in a consistent world,

1942
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,600
and then you sort of eventually learn about the realities of the world

1943
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,200
that we live in.

1944
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,320
And OK, it's a little more complicated than the real world.

1945
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:43,840
Got to get the work done.

1946
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,440
Yeah.

1947
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,760
I do admit to one unique constraint I do usually tend to put myself,

1948
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,800
is to not install apps I cannot maintain myself, in case doomsday.

1949
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,000
That is actually also part of how I decide.

1950
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Some apps I really like, but for example, they're in Go.

1951
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,760
So I'm never going to use them, because I really

1952
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,320
hate that language as an example.

1953
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,560
And so I'm not going to be willing to maintain it in Go.

1954
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,920
I try to find alternatives or just put the effort in,

1955
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,040
so that it happens in another language that I feel it's the best way.

1956
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,200
I love your doomsday scenario is not, I need to find food and drink,

1957
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,880
but I need to be able to code applications I'm using on my laptop.

1958
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,520
Well, you have to maintain, right?

1959
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,480
What's the point of having source code if one day things shut down

1960
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,000
and you can't fix it?

1961
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,480
The bunker is going to have computers, obviously.

1962
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,080
They got to keep running.

1963
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,200
Yeah, I think I kind of agree with all of that.

1964
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,360
But mostly, you got to have the best tool for the job.

1965
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,760
And that's always the way I'll land.

1966
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,840
Even if it's a GDI application running via wine,

1967
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,040
I'll use it if that's what I have to use.

1968
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,200
But if there is any kind of thing that sort of tilts the preference dial,

1969
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,240
it would be if I could also get it in whatever

1970
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,680
the native toolkit of my desktop is.

1971
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,640
Well, I think that's what Architect in the IRC sums it up perfectly.

1972
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,880
Use the least offensive tool for the job.

1973
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,200
Yeah, that's very well put.

1974
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:00,720
Yeah, OK.

1975
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,180
I'd love to know your thoughts, too.

1976
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,440
Knowlinuxunplugged.com slash contact where you can send in questions

1977
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,600
to the show or if you are acute or GTK purist.

1978
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,000
There have been times, especially when using Gnome 3 Shell,

1979
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,080
I'm like, yeah, yeah, I am tempted.

1980
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,040
Client-side decorations all the places.

1981
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,600
Forever.

1982
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,120
Yeah.

1983
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,880
Let us know.

1984
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,280
Let us know how you feel about it.

1985
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,200
If you want to join our Mumble Room, we do have a setup guide

1986
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,040
that you can follow.

1987
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:24,520
Yay.

1988
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,040
If you just go Google Jupiter Colony Mumble Setup Guide,

1989
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,500
guess what?

1990
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,400
You'll pretty much find it.

1991
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,260
It's pretty much all it takes right there.

1992
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,080
You can follow Wes on the Twitter.

1993
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,560
He's at wespain.

1994
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,040
You can go get more poppy and wimpy

1995
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,760
in the Fantastic Ubuntu Podcast.

1996
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,520
New episode just came out.

1997
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,320
And you can find out how many laptops each of them have.

1998
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,320
Oh, boy.

1999
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,640
Also, Wes and I just did a breakdown

2000
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,960
of eFail on TechSnap, all of the technical details,

2001
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,820
all of those goodies in this week's episode of TechSnap.

2002
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,120
If you want to know more about eFail, what's

2003
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,500
going on with GNU PG and OpenPGP, and what the real details are,

2004
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,000
what the real deets are, it's all in that episode.

2005
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,080
All them deets.

2006
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,320
All right, thanks so much for tuning

2007
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,440
this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

2008
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,600
And guess what?

2009
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,840
We're going to see you right back here next Tuesday.

2010
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:38,560
I've never installed Linux slash Linux.

2011
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,800
Roof, roof, roof.

2012
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,200
Guard dogs on the Unplugged job.

2013
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,600
They don't want the show to end.

2014
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
No.

2015
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
Keep it going.

2016
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,600
They love the Unplugged program.

2017
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,840
Mumba Room, thanks, you guys.

2018
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,760
That was a great conversation and a bunch of stories

2019
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,120
that you had some good insights on.

2020
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,240
So I really appreciate you making it today.

2021
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,320
You're wonderful.

2022
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,660
You're gosh darn wonderful.

2023
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,000
Now we've got to name this thing.

2024
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,400
And the J-bot's still down because, long story short, it was-

2025
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,400
J-bot's down again?

2026
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Yeah.

2027
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,400
Well, you know that arch box is falling apart, right?

2028
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,400
Oh, yeah.

2029
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,400
Yeah.

2030
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,400
So I got TCP IP up.

2031
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,400
No way.

2032
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
I know.

2033
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,400
Well, it didn't get updated for a couple of years.

2034
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,880
So I got the TCP stack working again, and I got SSH up

2035
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,880
and running again.

2036
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,880
Well, those are luxuries.

2037
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,040
But I still can't get J-bot to properly function.

2038
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,040
Oh.

2039
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,840
But the OS is actually standing again.

2040
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,840
I don't know how I did it.

2041
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,840
Okay.

2042
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,840
Good.

2043
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Like a miner through the DigitalOcean console chipping

2044
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,840
away at all of the cruft.

2045
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,840
Literally.

2046
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
So what happened was-

2047
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Praise be to that console.

2048
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,120
The system hadn't been updated for a couple of years.

2049
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,320
Because it's been a while since DigitalOcean let you deploy arch.

2050
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,480
Yes, it has.

2051
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,480
And so-

2052
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,480
Years.

2053
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,480
Yeah.

2054
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,480
And it got locked to an old kernel and all that.

2055
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,760
Anyways, long story short, they had to reboot for Meltdown Inspector.

2056
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,520
And when it rebooted, it didn't really ever come back up quite right.

2057
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:57,120
And so I went in there and sort of salvaged the system and got it standing again.

2058
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,560
We figured out we had to SU to Rekai's account.

2059
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
Yeah.

2060
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,320
So we got the little esoteric, like what weird user situation we had to be in, where the

2061
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,760
scripts were to start everything.

2062
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,960
Fired all that out.

2063
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,300
And it connects up and it just generates errors.

2064
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,680
So we don't have it long.

2065
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,440
That's my long way of saying we don't have JBOT to do title suggestions.

2066
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,960
We have to just come up with it on our own.

2067
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,040
So much pressure.

2068
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,040
You can throw it in the chat room though.

2069
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,040
I saw Fudbuntu.

2070
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,800
I kind of don't like that though.

2071
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Because it sounds like a-

2072
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,080
Oh, guard dog.

2073
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,640
It sounds like a flavor.

2074
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,280
So I kind of don't like that.

2075
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,080
So other title suggestions would be appreciated.

2076
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:41,080
I also wanted to point out a documentary by DW, which somebody remind me, DW, are they

2077
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,200
out of Germany, I believe, but I'm drawing a blank.

2078
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:49,920
They just did a video called the Microsoft Cyber Attack.

2079
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,960
And it's, you know, the premise is a little, but they go to Munich.

2080
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:01,800
And during all the transition stuff and they talk about how Microsoft lobbied to make some

2081
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,660
of this transition from LibreOffice back to Microsoft software.

2082
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,280
And they cover also a French government transition to Linux.

2083
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:16,360
There is some rando shots of consultants using Unity, like at the 27 minute mark, there's

2084
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,640
a consultant that they're doing an interview with and she's using Unity on a, it looks

2085
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,640
like an XPS.

2086
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,400
And she's using the touchscreen to scroll a document that she's showing the journalist.

2087
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,440
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes if you want to check it out.

2088
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,820
The Microsoft Cyber Attack though, if you just go Google it on YouTube.

2089
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,600
And it's in English.

2090
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
They've done translations.

2091
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Oh, nice.

2092
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,600
Great.

2093
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
Yeah.

2094
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
It was a really cool documentary.

2095
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,400
I didn't think the premise started a little like too newbie, you know, I was like, ah,

2096
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,400
this is thick.

2097
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,640
But then they got into like the Linux and Limux stuff and then I was all in, which happens

2098
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,000
about halfway into it.

2099
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
All right.

2100
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,040
We got to name this thing, Wes.

2101
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,040
We do.

2102
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,040
What did we talk about?

2103
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Oh, all the things.

2104
01:21:53,040 --> 01:22:08,040
Let's make it easy.
