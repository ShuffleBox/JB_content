WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
It is really fun. There was a there was a very fun and sort of rewarding feeling

00:06.880 --> 00:11.040
to be sitting in a gravel parking lot that I just kind of found somewhere not

00:11.040 --> 00:15.540
connected to anything and broadcasting and doing a show. Totally free just yeah

00:15.540 --> 00:21.520
like it's like whoo like no wires no connection just I plopped down and I'm

00:21.520 --> 00:23.800
streaming on the internet and you know one of the funniest things when that

00:23.800 --> 00:27.200
happened is that's when that's when Anthony found us and came up and joined

00:27.200 --> 00:31.520
us for Linux Unplugged. It was like totally random and awesome and I didn't even

00:31.520 --> 00:35.600
realize the time was part of a vlog that he was doing so like he had started he

00:35.600 --> 00:39.560
had started like watching us on the rover as we came into town and so he was

00:39.560 --> 00:43.400
doing his overall vlog update to his YouTube channel and so hit the visit was

00:43.400 --> 00:46.960
part of the update so it was like a show within a show happening and I didn't

00:46.960 --> 00:53.640
even know it until the end. How about that? This is Linux Unplugged episode 113

00:53.640 --> 00:57.920
for October 6th 2015.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's once again

01:11.200 --> 01:15.360
broadcasting from the JB one studio my name is Chris and my name is Wes. Hey

01:15.360 --> 01:19.280
Wes it's good to be back with you sir. Pleasure to have you. You and Noah did a

01:19.280 --> 01:23.280
great job last week fantastic it was actually a really good collaborative

01:23.280 --> 01:26.840
production by the whole crew producer RottenCorps and the producers helped out

01:26.840 --> 01:30.240
a lot you were great Noah was fantastic. He sure was. I heard he was the Segway

01:30.240 --> 01:34.080
master. Yep oh yeah you might learn a trick or two from him. Yeah yeah the

01:34.080 --> 01:37.840
Segway master I love it although when you combine Google Glasses with the

01:37.840 --> 01:41.600
Segway that's a pretty nerdy image. Yep half robot half Noah. That's a strong

01:41.600 --> 01:45.400
brand so thank you to Noah for sitting in there for the show and I actually

01:45.400 --> 01:48.480
invited him to make it I'd invite him if he could make it he said he's pretty

01:48.480 --> 01:51.400
busy today but he might be able to stop by later in the show. Hey that'd be fun.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.800
Might join us in the Mumba room so we'll just see. You know on today's episode we've

01:54.800 --> 01:58.800
got a few things we're gonna dig into. Number one it's Microsoft Day happy

01:58.800 --> 02:03.280
Microsoft Day everybody did you enjoy that? Was that good for you? Yeah they

02:03.280 --> 02:06.840
actually had a pretty respectable showing they unveiled the Surface Book

02:06.840 --> 02:09.380
now we're gonna look at and see if it's possible it could run Linux and what

02:09.380 --> 02:13.480
that would mean and you might be surprised at the answer about that then

02:13.480 --> 02:17.040
later on in the show we're gonna talk about keeping Linux performing well over

02:17.040 --> 02:20.440
the long time I'm talking about desktops I went away on the road trip as you guys

02:20.440 --> 02:24.040
know and when I got back my tried-and-true my favorite workstation the

02:24.040 --> 02:28.600
one that never disappoints is not running very good and we're gonna talk

02:28.600 --> 02:31.460
about ways to maybe speed up your Linux system if it starts to slow down over

02:31.460 --> 02:35.160
time and maybe hopefully get some input from the Mumba room and then last but

02:35.160 --> 02:37.640
not least we're gonna talk about some updates from the Linux development

02:37.640 --> 02:41.440
community so before we dive into all of that stuff let's bring in the Mumble

02:41.440 --> 02:48.640
room time appropriate greetings virtual lug. Hello you guys it's good to hear you

02:48.640 --> 02:53.360
without dropping about 75% of my packets that's nice now I know I actually have a

02:53.360 --> 02:56.720
good connection oh yeah that's cool that's cool all right so I wanted to

02:56.720 --> 03:01.320
start with something that came out yesterday it's just sort of a warm-up to

03:01.320 --> 03:05.560
the show today and perhaps maybe something we all should consider a

03:05.560 --> 03:11.600
possibility of a world without Linux yeah well sort of this is the Linux

03:11.600 --> 03:15.120
foundations attempt to kind of make us stop and think what would the world be

03:15.120 --> 03:21.880
like if Linux hadn't come along and they just released episode 1

03:21.880 --> 03:31.480
hey what's the name of that Michael Jackson song oh how does it go

03:31.480 --> 03:38.840
right you know the one huh da da da da he something like that oh yeah shoot

03:38.840 --> 03:46.560
what is it um let me look it up

03:46.560 --> 03:51.400
he goes to the library obviously that's how you look things up there's no

03:51.400 --> 03:55.640
internet got it Billie Jean Billie Jean now it's

03:55.640 --> 04:01.880
nighttime a world without Linux would mean a world without the internet

04:01.880 --> 04:09.040
did that come out I think you're going to need these picks up the keys a world

04:09.040 --> 04:12.200
without Linux is hard to imagine thanks to hundreds of thousands of individuals

04:12.200 --> 04:16.760
and companies who support Linux we don't have to learn more and help support

04:16.760 --> 04:22.680
Linux today hashtag world without Linux of course there's a hashtag well there

04:22.680 --> 04:26.800
has to be yeah yeah so there you go the Linux so it's not bad right that's not

04:26.800 --> 04:30.520
so bad they're gonna have another episode are we there yet and then they're

04:30.520 --> 04:33.840
gonna have they're gonna like four episodes what do you think West I think

04:33.840 --> 04:37.120
North Ranger in the IRC's got it down the BST folks probably will not

04:37.120 --> 04:41.280
appreciate this that said I think it's good to point it you know well Linux may

04:41.280 --> 04:45.880
not be the only free internet scale you know operating system that exists it is

04:45.880 --> 04:48.600
widely deployed and it gives us a lot of freedoms that we would not otherwise

04:48.600 --> 04:51.840
have so I'm glad that they're doing this some of the points might be a little

04:51.840 --> 04:56.160
strong-armed but it was a nice video yeah the production value yeah it's okay

04:56.160 --> 04:59.800
yes that's actually good it was good production value I know Poby is excited

04:59.800 --> 05:02.480
about this next update I just wanted to talk about real quick before we get into

05:02.480 --> 05:07.360
the main show and it's the n1 it's a beautiful open source email app for

05:07.360 --> 05:12.160
Linux and it clocks in at a pretty hefty think like 20 megabytes or something

05:12.160 --> 05:17.600
like that but it's it's like it's here to kick Thunderbird 64 64 megabytes

05:17.600 --> 05:22.440
thank you that was 20 Wow and does anybody know like West you have a guess

05:22.440 --> 05:26.840
why it clocks in at 64 megabytes those static dependencies I believe it would

05:26.840 --> 05:32.200
be based on top of chromium it's like it's like Haru pad or Adam right the

05:32.200 --> 05:36.000
chromium and no jazz I think is bundled in there as well you got a no jazz for

05:36.000 --> 05:41.480
the events yeah naturally so I don't know do we hate this or are we okay with

05:41.480 --> 05:44.840
giant applications look at look okay what if we get a really great functional

05:44.840 --> 05:50.360
app that comes with Linux support out of the box don't we don't we like that you

05:50.360 --> 05:54.160
know if it if it works really well I'm mostly curious to see how personal

05:54.160 --> 05:56.800
deployments of the back end servers go that's what's gonna make it a break

05:56.800 --> 06:01.480
it from yeah yeah what do you think wimpy yeah I agree I'm actually I've

06:01.480 --> 06:05.640
just received my activation key for it so I'm actually oh great eating it right

06:05.640 --> 06:11.960
now yeah okay but yes I'm I'm interested as well to know how the back end

06:11.960 --> 06:17.120
integration is going to work longer term so are we just don't just what don't

06:17.120 --> 06:24.720
give them your like primary email account because yeah right well the

06:24.720 --> 06:28.280
sync engines open source right so I mean people could go poke around in there and

06:28.280 --> 06:30.960
well I guess it probably I guess if the server is closed up I'm not sure what

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
the code of the server license of the server is but I assume the server is

06:33.960 --> 06:39.080
open source too if you're installing it right yes okay so alright do we not then

06:39.080 --> 06:42.400
hate the fact this is a 64 megabyte application that you have to run just to

06:42.400 --> 06:48.080
check your email no I don't care I don't care the file size that's tiny really if

06:48.080 --> 06:51.600
it means it's gonna work and it means that when they do an update the thing

06:51.600 --> 06:55.880
isn't dependent upon some other random library on my system it all just works

06:55.880 --> 06:59.400
that's great yeah especially if that means it's easy to deploy to you know

06:59.400 --> 07:03.680
random machines that you just need it to work oh right that's a good point too

07:03.680 --> 07:07.720
huh all right I think I'm gonna containers as well I think you could like

07:07.720 --> 07:12.240
slap this in the container and you're done you know you don't have a truckload

07:12.240 --> 07:15.440
of dependencies that it needs all right I'm signing up for I'm asking for an

07:15.440 --> 07:18.800
invite right now boom oh look I can connect my github account isn't that

07:18.800 --> 07:22.960
lovely all right I'll do that too I'm not sure why I have to oh okay you have

07:22.960 --> 07:30.200
to do that and and star it and that speeds up your I wouldn't hurry too much

07:30.200 --> 07:34.400
because it doesn't work oh thank you thank you all right well I did it

07:34.400 --> 07:38.680
anyways please try to connect to your account again try again something went

07:38.680 --> 07:43.640
wrong so yeah okay so we're we're starting to see a more and more

07:43.640 --> 07:47.920
applications like I mentioned another one that I believe is also built so

07:47.920 --> 07:53.600
similar to n1 is heru pad which is the the markdown editor I use which I not

07:53.600 --> 07:56.760
only love but now I consider to be essential tool one of the things it does

07:56.760 --> 07:59.840
is not only does it hotkey all the markdown stuff but it does live

07:59.840 --> 08:03.900
rendering and you can apply your website CSS file to that live rendering so you

08:03.900 --> 08:07.280
literally see what it looks like on your website as you're writing it you know

08:07.280 --> 08:09.880
the fonts and the way you you know the way the block quotes look and

08:09.880 --> 08:14.200
everything it's just such a fan but here's the downside I mean this is a

08:14.200 --> 08:16.600
pretty fast system of course I just launched it so it's probably gonna

08:16.600 --> 08:21.160
launch pretty quick but I just clicked it I mean it's it's it's heavy I can

08:21.160 --> 08:23.960
tell it it's it's one of the slowest launching applications I have in my

08:23.960 --> 08:27.400
desktop and it's a damn text editor right yeah I find that people have

08:27.400 --> 08:31.000
similar complaints with it does not me just a little bit right but I don't

08:31.000 --> 08:34.920
give anyone a shot so all right cool guys well wimpy let me know how far you

08:34.920 --> 08:39.840
get in the process well I'm a bit further along but now it won't actually

08:39.840 --> 08:44.400
proceed through this I'm at the point where it says choose your layout style

08:44.400 --> 08:49.440
and there's a button says looks good which doesn't we have a layout style

08:49.440 --> 08:53.640
called looks good that would probably never but now you've got list view or

08:53.640 --> 09:01.040
split view so I can I can select those and I can say what key bindings I use

09:01.040 --> 09:07.400
so gmail Apple Mail or outlook your options and interesting good looks good

09:07.400 --> 09:13.720
and that's me clicking the mouse and it not doing anything I managed to get my

09:13.720 --> 09:17.560
my install done before you lot all jumped on it so I was playing with it

09:17.560 --> 09:20.920
early in the morning and was like yeah this is good then I tweet it and it all

09:20.920 --> 09:25.320
breaks and they put a paywall invite thing in front of it so oh so poppy what

09:25.320 --> 09:30.200
jumped out at you the kind of you were impressed by when you say it's good so I

09:30.200 --> 09:34.440
like the UI it's quite clean it's very familiar if you're using if you're a gmail

09:34.440 --> 09:38.200
user it's very obvious what's going on you've got the folders down the left and

09:38.200 --> 09:41.760
the emails in the middle and then you get some detail about the contact on the

09:41.760 --> 09:46.760
right-hand side it's quite pretty I'm just very wary about the fact that this

09:46.760 --> 09:52.360
server can retain my email for 60 days even after I revoke their access to my

09:52.360 --> 10:00.300
email that's yeah yeah okay it's working now oh so are you guys there is like a

10:00.300 --> 10:07.760
couple of apps there's like a mailbox is one but Google bought them but inbox is

10:07.760 --> 10:10.440
another it's sort of similar for it's like a mobile it's a mobile app that

10:10.440 --> 10:13.640
does something similar like it's almost proxies the mail and then categorizes

10:13.640 --> 10:18.560
it for you it's becoming like a service that is a little creepy and so that is

10:18.560 --> 10:23.000
an area that see the problem with email right is that you get all your password

10:23.000 --> 10:26.760
reset emails very personal you get I get credit card I mean credit card companies

10:26.760 --> 10:29.880
are now starting to email statements they're like all this kind of stuff that

10:29.880 --> 10:33.880
if somebody got compromised and it seems like anybody can get compromised these

10:33.880 --> 10:40.200
days so I'm using a gash account to get it set up it's actually running now but

10:40.200 --> 10:44.200
I had to go into Google Mail and actually tell it to have access to all

10:44.200 --> 10:50.880
mail folders you can't use the you know what the tick boxes to filter out what

10:50.880 --> 10:56.160
gets displayed in the mail client and basically somebody said it looks like

10:56.160 --> 11:01.480
Google Mail it does it looks exactly like Gmail just in a window the way the

11:01.480 --> 11:07.760
folders are laid out and I'm not actually a big fan of the Google Mail UI so I'm

11:07.760 --> 11:14.600
just thinking what's the what's the USP here hmm I guess well it can connect to

11:14.600 --> 11:18.320
multiple different accounts right it will it will look the same with it like

11:18.320 --> 11:24.960
if you're if you like the the Gmail paradigm but the way you view mail this

11:24.960 --> 11:30.120
thing can connect to Yahoo Outlook and all the others and you have that unified

11:30.120 --> 11:33.080
interface so it all looks consistent rather than having four different user

11:33.080 --> 11:37.040
interfaces for those four different accounts yeah plus I connect to your I

11:37.040 --> 11:42.720
map but see I can do that but I can do that say with Gary right now and the

11:42.720 --> 11:47.180
the other one that I was talking about earlier is Zimbra have a desktop mail

11:47.180 --> 11:51.560
client Zimbra desktop and that has integration with all the popular email

11:51.560 --> 11:55.400
services and it includes integration with you know your contacts and your

11:55.400 --> 12:01.720
calendars and that's built on web technologies as well so that's a very

12:01.720 --> 12:07.040
competent email client I think hmm I'm I'm I know and producer rotten corpse

12:07.040 --> 12:11.680
would recommend claw right now I'm I'm I don't want to I don't want to

12:11.680 --> 12:14.640
disparage you because I have a couple things they just inherently like about

12:14.640 --> 12:17.800
it is it's it looks like a pretty good product that's just available day one on

12:17.800 --> 12:21.680
Linux but now looking at these screenshots I can totally see what you

12:21.680 --> 12:25.160
guys are saying about Gmail it yeah it's I would think that is a screenshot from

12:25.160 --> 12:31.420
Gmail yeah yeah yeah so I do like though that it if you pulls in multiple

12:31.420 --> 12:34.800
services I'm going to check it out I'm just not quite sure what it's gonna give

12:34.800 --> 12:39.080
me I think I know it's gonna give me over Thunderbird Thunderbird just feels

12:39.080 --> 12:43.640
like a 90s product now I mean I love it still it's my boo and I love the fact

12:43.640 --> 12:46.520
that enigma is super easy to integrate with it that's my favorite thing about

12:46.520 --> 12:50.720
it yes but Gary and now and one are knocking on the door and the thing is

12:50.720 --> 12:55.080
email is a monster for me it is a demon that I have to slay a couple of times a

12:55.080 --> 12:59.960
week and it is a take no prisoners event and I want anything that makes me get

12:59.960 --> 13:03.200
through that as fast as possible and does a little tree and anything that

13:03.200 --> 13:08.200
helps me triage is good and that's not really Thunderbird Thunderbirds strong

13:08.200 --> 13:12.600
sweet and strong suit and it's just I could I am definitely looking for

13:12.600 --> 13:15.520
replacement the one thing I like more about Geary is it feels like it's

13:15.520 --> 13:19.600
faster to move through but important if you're doing a lot of emails yeah is

13:19.600 --> 13:25.240
this I the one thing I like about this is the label support and the starring

13:25.240 --> 13:28.680
and also it looks like a little bit of thread support and then you have reading

13:28.680 --> 13:31.720
this helpful and you have contact information on the far right pane which

13:31.720 --> 13:36.360
is useful for me too especially because then sometimes I can put faces to

13:36.360 --> 13:41.520
listeners names and stuff and that's really nice for me so that that is I

13:41.520 --> 13:44.360
something I achieved today through extensions that I would really like to

13:44.360 --> 13:48.680
have that so this I mean I emails a serious enough task for me that I'm

13:48.680 --> 13:52.040
willing to burn some drive space and CPU cycles on something that's a really good

13:52.040 --> 13:56.280
tool yeah I'd love to go to use this for my my work exchange server yeah it'll

13:56.280 --> 13:58.680
just all depend on that back end stuff yeah well they think they're gonna

13:58.680 --> 14:01.760
support they do support plugins so somebody might be able to write an

14:01.760 --> 14:05.240
exchange plug-in I think it supports exchange already no I'm just worried

14:05.240 --> 14:10.000
about these data retention no way so if I can deploy it all locally yeah you

14:10.000 --> 14:14.720
can't change mail retention yes exactly you don't want retention might not be

14:14.720 --> 14:17.640
pleased yeah but wow it does have exchange

14:17.640 --> 14:22.440
support yeah which is impressive I have to check out this open it's been in

14:22.440 --> 14:27.720
development for nearly a year okay so looking at the github repository the

14:27.720 --> 14:33.720
first commits for about 11 months ago and yeah it is working now so a little

14:33.720 --> 14:39.480
bit of a bumpy start with them how it was you know getting the setup going but

14:39.480 --> 14:44.720
now it's working now I found some of the options it's quite nice I use gearing

14:44.720 --> 14:48.200
myself at the moment I've been using that for a month or so and I think I'll

14:48.200 --> 14:54.360
give this a try basically I've just got mailing lists and everything on this

14:54.360 --> 14:59.080
account hmm so I'll use it for that because that's where I get sort of

14:59.080 --> 15:04.280
volume of email that I have to filter and work through so I'll give it a go

15:04.280 --> 15:09.480
but um it does look nice once I've got it in split for you now and that looks

15:09.480 --> 15:13.960
much better that's much more usable I might follow up with you and see how it

15:13.960 --> 15:19.840
goes fascinated yeah all right good job thank you and one nice stuff they call

15:19.840 --> 15:22.600
it a beautiful open source email app I don't know it does look like I don't

15:22.600 --> 15:24.400
know if it's beautiful it does look pretty good though it looks kind of like

15:24.400 --> 15:27.600
a Mac app to me yes it does look like a Mac don't know if that makes it

15:27.600 --> 15:34.200
beautiful it's clear to it's clear to read good yeah the screenshots it does

15:34.200 --> 15:39.360
look pretty nice yeah all right current anyway yeah yeah if you guys listening

15:39.360 --> 15:43.240
at home want to check it out we have a link in the show notes I'll give a plug

15:43.240 --> 15:47.440
now that I'm back there's probably gonna be one more rover log and the hat we

15:47.440 --> 15:50.800
have them all posted now so far at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover

15:50.800 --> 15:54.160
and there's some electrical stuff we did in there you guys probably heard about

15:54.160 --> 15:57.440
last week the rover logs I'm just give them a plug because they've people have

15:57.440 --> 16:00.640
been I think surprised when they watch them that they've enjoyed them they like

16:00.640 --> 16:04.280
they thought I actually have been I've been surprised people enjoy them in fact

16:04.280 --> 16:08.920
we've gotten some attention from YouTube over them as well they were featured on

16:08.920 --> 16:11.440
the YouTube travel section which is pretty cool turns out you're pretty

16:11.440 --> 16:14.400
interesting guy Chris well I don't know about that but the rover logs at least

16:14.400 --> 16:17.080
work out to be interesting and so if you haven't checked them out there's

16:17.080 --> 16:20.320
probably one more coming at least and then I'll decide where to go from that

16:20.320 --> 16:24.960
and speaking of the rover you know one of the things that was awesome about the

16:24.960 --> 16:28.720
road trip was the rovers internet was provided by ting you can go to right now

16:28.720 --> 16:33.240
Linux dot ting comm to get our Linux unplugged discount and support the show

16:33.240 --> 16:37.040
ting is mobile that makes sense as my mobile service provider and we have the

16:37.040 --> 16:42.040
a netgear zing on the road and I you know for the most part the netgear zing I

16:42.040 --> 16:46.520
really like it and sometimes it was a little slow for me just on the UI but I

16:46.520 --> 16:49.120
very often had to interact with the zing seems like a really good product and I'm

16:49.120 --> 16:54.120
I'm surprised that there's not more of them out there there and perhaps maybe

16:54.120 --> 16:57.040
that's just because of the networks that ting's on ting has a CDMA and GSM

16:57.040 --> 17:00.960
network and I was using the zing on a CDMA network and it's a really nice way

17:00.960 --> 17:04.480
to go because now that I'm not going to be on the road trip this is not

17:04.480 --> 17:07.800
something I would use a ton and that's what's really nice about the ting model

17:07.800 --> 17:11.080
is in aggregate it's gonna save me a ton of money because you only pay for what

17:11.080 --> 17:14.760
you use and there's no contract so it's six dollars to have the zing and six

17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
dollars for any line and then you just pay for the usage on top of that well

17:17.760 --> 17:21.920
say I go on a two-week road trip and I use a lot of data maybe that month I pay

17:21.920 --> 17:25.240
for that data right but for the rest of the year I'm maybe not on a road trip

17:25.240 --> 17:30.560
and it is incredibly cheap to have a my fi device ready to go on the ting CDMA

17:30.560 --> 17:33.560
network now like I said ting does have two networks you probably have a pretty

17:33.560 --> 17:36.760
good chance of having a compatible device and if you do and if you do when

17:36.760 --> 17:40.240
you go to linux.ting.com they're gonna give you a service credit that'll

17:40.240 --> 17:42.200
probably pay for more than your first month they also have an early

17:42.200 --> 17:45.360
termination relief program which helps you get out of a contract if you're in

17:45.360 --> 17:48.520
one of those duopoly contracts right now which come on let's be honest that

17:48.520 --> 17:52.680
contract thing is starting to feel like a dinosaur you got to get out of it if

17:52.680 --> 17:54.760
you're still in one and ting will help you save money you can go to their

17:54.760 --> 17:59.760
savings calculator and putting your actual usage in there before taxes crazy

17:59.760 --> 18:03.880
how much I'll save yeah I don't like to over $2,000 for two years which is

18:03.880 --> 18:08.320
basically you could get a computer for that I think it's you know right now too

18:08.320 --> 18:12.480
with the new with the new Nexus devices check this out West if you go to

18:12.480 --> 18:15.680
linux.ting.com they're gonna take some money off these devices so these

18:15.680 --> 18:19.240
devices are unlocked you own these right there's no contract when you buy them

18:19.240 --> 18:22.920
and I'm flipping through them right now if you're watching the video version I'm

18:22.920 --> 18:26.160
gonna land down here on the new Nexus devices where I just saw them here and

18:26.160 --> 18:30.160
the Nexus 6p you can get it directly from Ting right there look at that that's

18:30.160 --> 18:37.120
awesome the Moto X pure edition $399 unlocked directly from Ting LG Nexus 5x

18:37.120 --> 18:43.520
$379 unlocked no contract pay for what you use $6 a month for the line comes

18:43.520 --> 18:49.560
ready to go no problems that is nice that is really nice I I'm I'm attempted

18:49.560 --> 18:53.920
I I'm they finally added a freaking fingerprint sensor to the Nexus and I

18:53.920 --> 18:58.720
USBC yeah and those are I'm looking to try that that new standard out those are

18:58.720 --> 19:02.680
check boxes that got ticked for me so you can get that one 379 when you go to

19:02.680 --> 19:05.840
linux.ting.com and I think with this one they're gonna because that price is

19:05.840 --> 19:10.000
already so low they're just gonna give you a service credit so quite literally

19:10.000 --> 19:14.240
for 379 your first month you wouldn't probably even have to pay for it

19:14.240 --> 19:17.760
especially if you're Wi-Fi savvy when it comes to data usage I mean it's $25

19:17.760 --> 19:20.800
service credit is gonna last you that first month that's how low Ting is and

19:20.800 --> 19:25.680
and you I mean that's oh that's a really actually a really sweet way to get that

19:25.680 --> 19:29.960
phone unlocked linux.ting.com go over there check them out just see what they

19:29.960 --> 19:32.920
offer try out their savings calculator see if maybe it works for you and a big

19:32.920 --> 19:36.000
thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged and thanks for the rover data

19:36.000 --> 19:39.660
all right so today I couldn't help it because I was back doing tech talk today

19:39.660 --> 19:44.720
in studio and I was immersed immersed in Microsoft Day and I just want to cover

19:44.720 --> 19:48.400
it right really quickly on the Linux unplugged show the surface book yeah I

19:48.400 --> 19:52.560
get it out of your system now they call it surface book was announced today and

19:52.560 --> 19:56.680
be honest mumble room it's not a bad rig is it it actually looks like a pretty

19:56.680 --> 20:04.200
impressive piece of kit anybody disagree pretty good so it just for those of you

20:04.200 --> 20:07.480
that are not familiar with it it is a 13 inch laptop it has a high-resolution

20:07.480 --> 20:14.080
like 246 or whatever is 214 ppi screen it's really high-resolution screen it

20:14.080 --> 20:20.200
has i7 or i5 core processors it comes with an NVIDIA GPU with DDR 5 so it's a

20:20.200 --> 20:25.880
pretty current NVIDIA GPU USB 3 connectors and the key feature about it

20:25.880 --> 20:29.240
is that it breaks off and it actually also becomes a tablet when you break it

20:29.240 --> 20:32.360
off from a tablet it still has pretty good battery life it switches to Intel

20:32.360 --> 20:36.520
graphics on the fly you snap it back together and now it's it's a full-fledged

20:36.520 --> 20:40.900
laptop and Microsoft has developed this latching technology that actually

20:40.900 --> 20:45.760
electrifies the latch so it's not like a spring-loaded latch they created this

20:45.760 --> 20:49.840
tough wire that they call it and when they add current to it it seizes and it

20:49.840 --> 20:53.800
latches it and you're able to from the hands-on demos say you can hold the

20:53.800 --> 20:56.720
laptop in the corner of the screen and bounce it and it feels like a solid piece

20:56.720 --> 21:00.960
of connected machinery and then you hit the release valve and it discharges the

21:00.960 --> 21:05.200
tough wire and it comes right out and it disconnects from the base now when it

21:05.200 --> 21:09.800
disconnects from the base it goes to an integrated GPU but otherwise it remains

21:09.800 --> 21:15.560
a pretty nice machine now here's the full specs it weighs in at 3 pounds 13.5

21:15.560 --> 21:20.480
inch pixel sense display with 3000 by 2000 resolution which does work out to

21:20.480 --> 21:26.600
be a 267 ppi as a sixth generation Intel core i5 or i7 processor that means you

21:26.600 --> 21:31.000
get the HD graphics the 520 graphics and then the discrete is the NVIDIA GeForce

21:31.000 --> 21:35.300
graphics you can get an 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM up to a 1 terabyte of

21:35.300 --> 21:41.840
SSD has 802.11 ACBGN Bluetooth 4 obviously 2 USB 3.0 ports and mini

21:41.840 --> 21:46.560
display out 8 megapixel rear 5 megapixel front windows hello face

21:46.560 --> 21:52.240
authentication and up to 12 hours of battery life ships with Windows 10

21:52.240 --> 21:58.120
obviously price of 1499 base you get it with an i7 and even 512 megabytes of

21:58.120 --> 22:02.160
storage now it is PCI Express storage and that price very quickly shoots up to

22:02.160 --> 22:09.120
$2,700 in some of the configurations that we were trying but in the demos

22:09.120 --> 22:13.400
they showed it actually has pretty impressive performance they showed live

22:13.400 --> 22:18.640
transitions in premiere they showed live edits and AutoCAD and the thing can flip

22:18.640 --> 22:23.160
around and and act as a tablet it can break off and just be a standalone

22:23.160 --> 22:25.780
tablet but you can flip it around and have it on the keyboard still have the

22:25.780 --> 22:31.000
GPU and discrete have our still and having tablet form factor we started

22:31.000 --> 22:34.360
looking into the specs trying to figure out how likely this thing could run

22:34.360 --> 22:39.040
Linux and PCMag had a hands-on at the Microsoft showing and they were looking

22:39.040 --> 22:43.320
specifically at the latching mechanism and they talk about how the GPU is

22:43.320 --> 22:46.800
located in the base of the system back where the keyboard is and supposedly a

22:46.800 --> 22:50.240
pretty decent keyboard too and they say the latching mechanism has a wide

22:50.240 --> 22:55.240
electrical connector and they say no doubt a PCI based interface to

22:55.240 --> 22:59.960
facilitate communication between the GPU and the rest of the system so we were

22:59.960 --> 23:03.600
speculating the pre-show that if this is a truly a PCI interconnect between the

23:03.600 --> 23:08.440
top of the machine and this keyboard accessory it is very possible that the

23:08.440 --> 23:12.920
keyboard and that trackpad are coming in over USB on that interconnect and the

23:12.920 --> 23:16.200
battery obviously is coming over the PCI connector now we don't know exactly

23:16.200 --> 23:19.400
what the solution would be for graphics but it's very likely this would work

23:19.400 --> 23:23.720
with Linux yet that if it has enough standard compliance stuff that you know

23:23.720 --> 23:26.840
we can with a little work people can get drivers adapted for that would be great

23:26.840 --> 23:31.080
and I'm thinking worst case scenario you would have to just use the discrete

23:31.080 --> 23:36.760
graphics or just the Intel graphics right if this was a reasonable approach

23:36.760 --> 23:40.280
West if you if you were in the market for a really high-end quote-unquote

23:40.280 --> 23:45.320
laptop and you wanted to run Linux I would consider it you know I mean it

23:45.320 --> 23:48.720
depends on how well the laptop part works I do a lot of stuff on the command

23:48.720 --> 23:52.440
line obviously but it's really interesting to see Microsoft as a

23:52.440 --> 23:56.320
hardware vendor if they do make stuff that Linux can run then I wouldn't be

23:56.320 --> 24:01.040
opposed to it you know I don't need their included bundled OS and let's say

24:01.040 --> 24:05.200
let's say a work is buying well if it works fine yeah I would definitely

24:05.200 --> 24:09.040
consider it yeah if it ran Linux with the you know only a reasonable number of

24:09.040 --> 24:12.320
tweaks then I would definitely consider it so if yeah if you were like I say you

24:12.320 --> 24:14.720
worked in a workplace and they were decided to start buying the Microsoft

24:14.720 --> 24:20.800
gear I don't know I hope you would you like this would you try this would this

24:20.800 --> 24:26.840
be something you'd be willing to run well well my first reaction is when you

24:26.840 --> 24:30.560
when you suggest like you break down the connectors and how things interconnect

24:30.560 --> 24:36.720
that's all magic and great but have you tried an Nvidia Prime or you know

24:36.720 --> 24:41.560
bumblebee based system how long have they been around and they're two GPUs in

24:41.560 --> 24:45.520
one laptop without any wacky connector that pulls them apart and puts them back

24:45.520 --> 24:49.160
together again and we can't even get that working properly yeah let alone

24:49.160 --> 24:53.720
something that dynamically appears and disappears off the PCI bus where there

24:53.720 --> 24:58.480
may or may not be you know data currently in flight so then is this

24:58.480 --> 25:02.440
Microsoft successfully bringing a type of convergence to the market in your

25:02.440 --> 25:07.160
opinion no I mean we've seen this before there's this I mean that that

25:07.160 --> 25:12.680
device is not glaringly different than the surface ASUS ASUS transformer or the

25:12.680 --> 25:15.520
transformer yeah I mean or something like that if you think about it it's

25:15.520 --> 25:18.000
not that much but really if you think about it it's not that much different

25:18.000 --> 25:22.880
is it than the surface Pro well the fact that they've put some of the brains

25:22.880 --> 25:30.360
inside the keyboard is a bit interesting and it's a bit different but I'm not

25:30.360 --> 25:34.400
interested if it's if it's running Windows to be honest right yeah I don't

25:34.400 --> 25:38.240
need yet another Windows machine yeah okay so anybody else in the mumble room

25:38.240 --> 25:42.760
would you be tempted if maybe work was buying or the even for yourself if you

25:42.760 --> 25:46.000
knew for fairly certainty that's in some way in some form Linux would work

25:46.000 --> 25:57.240
anybody want to bite Sean I'm looking at you I'd bite but only if I could get

25:57.240 --> 26:02.580
Linux running smoothly I won't have that Windows baloney on my system what if it

26:02.580 --> 26:05.880
came down I see here's here's why I'm wondering if this is doable because I

26:05.880 --> 26:10.760
think people make bigger compromises today to run Linux on a MacBook often

26:10.760 --> 26:14.060
you know simple things like your Ethernet port doesn't work unless you

26:14.060 --> 26:17.160
boot the operating system with it connected and that you have to figure out

26:17.160 --> 26:19.920
how to get your webcam to work every time you want it to start and the

26:19.920 --> 26:22.880
thermal controls are just recently been added there's a lot of compromises I

26:22.880 --> 26:26.040
know I always bring this up but there's a lot of compromises people make for

26:26.040 --> 26:30.640
their hipster hardware and Microsoft may have made a device here that may be

26:30.640 --> 26:35.480
easier to run Linux on than the MacBook Pro we will have to see change things

26:35.480 --> 26:39.800
I'm not it's I've still I've got a I've got a five-year-old MacBook Pro here and

26:39.800 --> 26:46.080
they still doesn't run Linux the bar is not that high like they could do it this

26:46.080 --> 26:49.920
to me is the real test of Microsoft by the way one of the things that Satya

26:49.920 --> 26:53.160
set up on stage today is they don't want people to feel like they have to run

26:53.160 --> 26:58.000
Windows they want them to they want to want to run Windows and we'll see if

26:58.000 --> 27:03.960
that's true with this surface Pro or surface book sorry if it if it requires

27:03.960 --> 27:07.480
Windows to make that magic work and it's not done at the hardware level then I

27:07.480 --> 27:10.240
don't know how much I believe them in that statement but if this is something

27:10.240 --> 27:14.640
that developers could buy and load any operating system they want on then I'm

27:14.640 --> 27:18.400
starting to believe them I think this is a real good test because this is the

27:18.400 --> 27:22.200
first time they've ever made a laptop yeah it's interesting in the new Satya

27:22.200 --> 27:26.640
era yeah as they say and and I do I do agree I think the convergence

27:26.640 --> 27:29.440
comparisons are a little are a little weak I've been seeing a lot of that

27:29.440 --> 27:33.160
online it seems a little it's not really convergence the thing that's just a

27:33.160 --> 27:36.640
fancy new connector really yeah tell me it's convergence when you open up

27:36.640 --> 27:42.000
Internet Explorer windows file explorer tell me how converge that is yes it's

27:42.000 --> 27:45.720
not convergence all right so any other thoughts guys on the surface I just

27:45.720 --> 27:48.240
wanted to touch on it because it's like the big topic today everybody's

27:48.240 --> 27:52.120
Microsoft blew it out of the park Microsoft stock went up a whole bunch it

27:52.120 --> 27:56.240
was a pretty good presentation I got to give the guy that he at least had his

27:56.240 --> 28:02.520
own take on it so any last thoughts going once twice all right we'll leave

28:02.520 --> 28:06.160
that if you guys want to read the specs you can find the link in the show notes

28:06.160 --> 28:09.840
I'll take a moment and mention digital ocean I love me some digital ocean

28:09.840 --> 28:12.520
because they're a simple cloud hosting provider that's dedicated to making it

28:12.520 --> 28:15.880
really easy to get your own Linux rig up on a cloud server that's super fast

28:15.880 --> 28:20.520
they got tier one connections all connected to SSD drives and for like

28:20.520 --> 28:23.760
five dollars a month you won't you won't believe how much you're gonna get so

28:23.760 --> 28:27.360
you'll get start five dollars a month five dollars right here that's I less

28:27.360 --> 28:31.480
than a hamburger a month you can get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one

28:31.480 --> 28:37.420
CPU and a terabyte of transfer but if you use our promo code do unplugged do

28:37.420 --> 28:40.440
unplug that's one word lowercase then you're gonna get a $10 credit you can

28:40.440 --> 28:43.480
try the $5 rig out two months for free there's so much you can do with that and

28:43.480 --> 28:46.040
their pricing plans are really straightforward they step right up very

28:46.040 --> 28:48.760
simply they have a whole bunch of distros you can choose from maybe it's a

28:48.760 --> 28:53.020
good opportunity to play with core OS or free BSD hurts me hurts me a little bit

28:53.020 --> 28:56.680
to say it West but they do have free BSL it's gotten to you well you got to

28:56.680 --> 29:00.360
respect how they do it too like they work with the projects to make sure that

29:00.360 --> 29:02.920
it's like totally legit and you're getting updates from the projects and

29:02.920 --> 29:06.000
they're coordinating and then like they roll out a ton of documentation that's

29:06.000 --> 29:09.880
really well written and edited and it's just like it's a full package deal and

29:09.880 --> 29:12.400
ironically you know it's their commitment to using things like full

29:12.400 --> 29:15.320
heart you know KVM virtualization that let them do this kind of thing oh yeah

29:15.320 --> 29:18.600
oh for sure for sure and they just launched a new data center up in Canada

29:18.600 --> 29:23.360
too so if you want to store some data up in Toronto they have tour one one of the

29:23.360 --> 29:26.400
many data centers they have been New York Amsterdam San Francisco Singapore

29:26.400 --> 29:31.480
London Germany and now one in Toronto and you can deploy up there it's they

29:31.480 --> 29:34.440
have one-click application deployments too it's very very nice so just remember

29:34.440 --> 29:38.040
do one plug also if you want to just build something around the digital ocean

29:38.040 --> 29:41.160
infrastructure they have a really nice API that makes it very easy to develop

29:41.160 --> 29:44.800
your own app to do deployments and because they have hourly pricing really

29:44.800 --> 29:47.880
if you want to just be a boss like if you like say you're launching something

29:47.880 --> 29:52.880
or maybe you've got a project and it's day one for very very very little just

29:52.880 --> 29:57.080
like very like cents on the dollar you can run a digital ocean server hourly

29:57.080 --> 30:02.360
just scale up as you need it using their API shut her down when you don't and

30:02.360 --> 30:06.680
it's serious on-demand infrastructure it's really cool so just use our promo

30:06.680 --> 30:09.160
code do unplug to support the show there's lots of different ways from own

30:09.160 --> 30:14.200
cloud sync bit torrent sync sync thing X to go there's a lot of ways people in

30:14.200 --> 30:18.280
our community minecraft mumble in most users our virtual lug is running off a

30:18.280 --> 30:22.040
digital ocean droplet right now it's really cool do unplug is how you can get

30:22.040 --> 30:25.040
started and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged

30:25.040 --> 30:29.960
program okay I I can't believe I'm about to say this because I feel like I'm a

30:29.960 --> 30:32.540
frickin Windows user all of a sudden little embarrassing not to be

30:32.540 --> 30:36.160
derogatory to those of you listening using Windows I shouldn't said that but

30:36.160 --> 30:41.440
I got back from my road trip and I said I mean I'm not even joking when I say

30:41.440 --> 30:45.920
this is I love this machine so much that when I sat down on it for the first time

30:45.920 --> 30:49.600
I got back from the road trip I got a little excited like I like oh I get to

30:49.600 --> 30:53.080
use this computer again I've missed it does anybody if you know what if you

30:53.080 --> 30:56.600
have a computer like that you know what I'm talking about it's your bae your boo

30:56.600 --> 31:01.000
is that what the kids say okay yeah you're very hip I thank you thank you I

31:01.000 --> 31:06.440
try it's I try to be very very hip it's it's my thing and and the value of this

31:06.440 --> 31:09.960
is negative so I sit down to use this computer and something something

31:09.960 --> 31:15.440
something bad happened something real bad happened producer Matt was clipping

31:15.440 --> 31:20.320
shows for on filter like crazy and the Dropbox folder sitting on my home drive

31:20.320 --> 31:26.280
grew to unbelievable sizes and filled up my home drive ouch XFS partition I

31:26.280 --> 31:30.200
thought no big deal I went in uncheck some selective sync stuff deleted a few

31:30.200 --> 31:33.560
dozen ISOs that had been sitting in my download folder for a while good to go

31:33.560 --> 31:36.560
you know just those little things you forget about yeah time to time and I get

31:36.560 --> 31:42.920
back I'm now 70% free on my home drive it's funny of space yeah however however

31:42.920 --> 31:48.720
the machine is running like dog crap like it's taking applications very

31:48.720 --> 31:54.000
noticeable load times I can hear the drive crunching like crazy I my flash

31:54.000 --> 31:58.040
video is like all hyper sped up it's all weird all of a sudden like the machine

31:58.040 --> 32:02.560
is just hurting and I've never really had this problem with Linux but you know

32:02.560 --> 32:07.120
I noticed that the Linux Foundation has launched a Linux performance tuning

32:07.120 --> 32:14.760
course LFS for 26 for the low low price of $2,500 and I change really I thought

32:14.760 --> 32:18.440
I bet I bet here on Linux unplugged we could come up with a few performance

32:18.440 --> 32:22.560
tips for absolutely free that are maybe not 20 maybe but not as good as the

32:22.560 --> 32:26.880
$2,500 ones but I thought maybe with between you and I in the virtual lug we

32:26.880 --> 32:29.700
can come up with a couple of tips to just kind of keep your Linux rig running

32:29.700 --> 32:33.440
a top performance over its lifetime I'm not saying this is like registry

32:33.440 --> 32:37.040
cleaning kind of tools and crap like that but you know just ideas maybe

32:37.040 --> 32:41.800
to just tricks people have picked up along the way yeah and so I don't know

32:41.800 --> 32:44.720
if you guys in the mumble room if you want to think of a couple and if you're

32:44.720 --> 32:47.800
in the chairman you have one and you can join the mumble room feel feel free to

32:47.800 --> 32:51.120
jump in the mumble room and make your suggestion but I'm gonna I'm gonna start

32:51.120 --> 32:53.280
with the elephant in the room the one we're all gonna probably talk about

32:53.280 --> 32:57.440
that's the swap file that seems like the easy one to go to now all of us have

32:57.440 --> 33:02.760
plenty of RAM I'm sure maybe maybe not but I guess if you have to swap the

33:02.760 --> 33:06.720
number one thing that I'm I'm feeling right now is I think my swap partition

33:06.720 --> 33:11.560
is on the same drive as my home drive I think I made that mistake when I set it

33:11.560 --> 33:14.960
up I'm gonna just say right here and right now if you've got an old SSD you

33:14.960 --> 33:19.360
want to burn through really bad or something like that if you can try to

33:19.360 --> 33:24.040
put your swap files on a separate disk I actually I know a lot of you probably

33:24.040 --> 33:26.840
listening just completely disable swap and if anybody wants to make that

33:26.840 --> 33:30.320
argument in the mumble room you're welcome to for me I'm not comfortable

33:30.320 --> 33:33.800
yet I don't know if it's just because I used to I just to me it seems crazy what

33:33.800 --> 33:36.120
if I need to debug a crash I don't know I don't know how this works without my

33:36.120 --> 33:40.480
swap file so I just have to put I just mentioned out there if you need a swap

33:40.480 --> 33:44.000
file try to put it on a separate disk I think that's one of the things that I am

33:44.000 --> 33:48.200
for some reason feeling the pain of right now you can also mess with your

33:48.200 --> 33:53.600
swappiness but I'll leave that to so like heavens in the in the chatroom says

33:53.600 --> 33:57.520
I sweat my I set my swappiness value to one which depending on your swappiness

33:57.520 --> 34:01.200
value is how likely your system's gonna go to use it I'm a con the chatroom says

34:01.200 --> 34:04.120
that he hasn't used a swap file for a few years now I know that's really super

34:04.120 --> 34:07.080
common yeah it is definitely yeah do you have you ran a system without a swap

34:07.080 --> 34:10.320
file yeah I think some of mine do it's kind of hit or miss depending on when I

34:10.320 --> 34:13.280
set them up and how I was feeling that day but what would be like the deciding

34:13.280 --> 34:17.400
factor for you you know if it's if it's something where I'm running a more

34:17.400 --> 34:19.960
defined set of software I'm not worried about crashes I kind of know what

34:19.960 --> 34:23.640
performance I'm expecting yeah then it's fine yeah you have plenty of RAM yeah

34:23.640 --> 34:26.800
and if I have plenty of RAM then it's not a big deal you know some systems you

34:26.800 --> 34:30.640
can always you know is there some on there yeah mumble room anybody in there

34:30.640 --> 34:36.520
going swap free forever oh no on some machines I'm already swapped for a yeah

34:36.520 --> 34:43.720
now why is that would be if it's not a laptop and I don't need it for

34:43.720 --> 34:50.280
suspending and hibernating okay then I just use that RAM instead for a swap

34:50.280 --> 34:54.120
maybe I should maybe I should kill my swap file poppy you were sounded pretty

34:54.120 --> 34:58.960
adamant that you you would always have a swap file yeah I never don't have a swap

34:58.960 --> 35:02.120
file now is that for sleep reasons are you always on laptops or is there

35:02.120 --> 35:07.960
another reason because disk space is cheap and there's no reason not to have

35:07.960 --> 35:11.920
one that's kind of been my approach is it but now I'm wondering if maybe I'm

35:11.920 --> 35:15.680
paying for it by having it on the same drive as my home folder well that's

35:15.680 --> 35:20.240
what's using it it's only a problem if you're you if it's swapping that's why

35:20.240 --> 35:24.000
it's that's why it's not a problem so if you're not using it why do you care

35:24.000 --> 35:27.760
come on in the chat room says what a what is swap so think of swap is like a

35:27.760 --> 35:31.520
space on your disk that's been allocated for the operating system to store stuff

35:31.520 --> 35:34.040
that doesn't necessarily need to be in RAM so that way the stuff that needs to

35:34.040 --> 35:37.680
be in RAM has space extra slow really horrible RAM yeah when your system is

35:37.680 --> 35:42.520
going to swap you're in a usually you know in a bad state so I I might

35:42.520 --> 35:46.320
consider just because you know I could turn it off I could swap off yeah and

35:46.320 --> 35:50.880
just see see how it goes maybe you have some homework for next week yeah I'm

35:50.880 --> 35:54.720
gonna I'm actually gonna write that down yeah go ahead you said that you were

35:54.720 --> 36:00.000
running on XFS yes is that right yeah and you've just deleted and purged a

36:00.000 --> 36:07.120
load of stuff mm-hmm have you checked the defragmentation status of the volume

36:07.120 --> 36:11.160
no I haven't really they actually just did it this morning so I could definitely

36:11.160 --> 36:15.320
do it check the frag check the defrag level like on a good old Windows box

36:15.320 --> 36:22.800
yeah an XFS has got online defragmenting right so the the fragmentation factor

36:22.800 --> 36:28.360
that it reports is between 0 and 100% and the closer to 0 the better so if

36:28.360 --> 36:33.960
your fragmentation factor is up you know in the 70s 80s then time to defrag the

36:33.960 --> 36:39.880
volume and the utilities exist to do that so you've got XFS underscore DB

36:39.880 --> 36:46.160
which is for debugging but that's the tool that you can use to expose the

36:46.160 --> 36:54.080
fragmentation factor and then there's XFS FSR which is the file system

36:54.080 --> 37:00.360
reorganizer and that can actually do the defragmenting I see yeah and I found

37:00.360 --> 37:05.280
that ArchWiki actually has a really nice write-up on it yep naturally and there's

37:05.280 --> 37:12.720
also XFS BMAP and you can use that to defragment individual files hmm so if

37:12.720 --> 37:17.840
you've got a large ISO for example that has been downloaded whilst or many

37:17.840 --> 37:25.920
fragmentation or something I mean I used to use it because I had large data files

37:25.920 --> 37:29.840
from crash recorders or from aircraft hmm and I'd get loads and loads of those

37:29.840 --> 37:34.040
and you'd find that in individually those were then fragmented and I could

37:34.040 --> 37:38.880
defragment those and speed up the analysis time oh interesting made it

37:38.880 --> 37:43.240
that much of a difference huh well oh yeah oh yeah significant it can it can

37:43.240 --> 37:49.080
take your system from being sloppy and slow to being like you've just installed

37:49.080 --> 37:54.200
it now rotten you wanted to make a special mention of but Abel but Abel yeah

37:54.200 --> 37:57.520
I was gonna I would I don't know how to say it either but I would say like

37:57.520 --> 38:04.720
baobab yeah yeah yeah now what is this it's a disk usually disk usage analyzer

38:04.720 --> 38:09.960
mm-hmm oh yes of course yes yes that's a good one also West wanted to give a

38:09.960 --> 38:14.280
plug for ncdu yes that's just you know one of those tools in my toolkit that I

38:14.280 --> 38:19.400
turn to yeah much all the time nice and fast right love curses interfaces yeah

38:19.400 --> 38:24.920
that's a that's also a good one I so I guess I guess I wanted things that so

38:24.920 --> 38:27.280
I'm taking notes I'm gonna I'm gonna do the defrag obviously I'm gonna turn

38:27.280 --> 38:33.600
swap off what are you guys's thoughts on West the the tool that you mentioned to

38:33.600 --> 38:37.720
store your browser profile on RAM tell me about that oh yeah profile sync Damon

38:37.720 --> 38:41.320
there's also anything sink Damon I'm not using them currently but I've used them

38:41.320 --> 38:45.480
in the past and it just it just kind of transparently handles moving all your

38:45.480 --> 38:49.320
browser profiles kind of stuff that can be resource-intensive to grab from the

38:49.320 --> 38:53.360
disk or to frequently update on the disk so it keeps them in rain so this is a

38:53.360 --> 38:56.760
Damon the design so I'm reading from the wiki here designed to manage user

38:56.760 --> 39:01.520
specified directories referred to as sync targets from here on out and temp

39:01.520 --> 39:04.960
FS and periodically sync them back to the physical disk this is accomplished

39:04.960 --> 39:09.800
via sim linking step up and sim linking step and an innovative use of our sync

39:09.800 --> 39:13.000
to maintain a synchronization between temp FS copies and the media bound

39:13.000 --> 39:19.040
backups additionally and with there's a typo with features such as crash

39:19.040 --> 39:26.120
recovery so ASD features okay so this so if I'm understanding West this is a

39:26.120 --> 39:30.360
system sink Damon that sinks between my disk and a RAM disk and then it with the

39:30.360 --> 39:33.360
applications end up using sim links which point to files in a RAM disk

39:33.360 --> 39:37.920
exactly and then and it manages you know copies on the disk periodically so that

39:37.920 --> 39:41.560
you if if your system goes down you won't lose everything that's pretty cool

39:41.560 --> 39:47.040
that is that would I mean a big part of what I do is I'm sitting here doing show

39:47.040 --> 39:51.440
prep or I'm or I'm showing a website on air it'd be really nice to have my web

39:51.440 --> 39:54.520
browser performing really well and one of the things that seems to have taken

39:54.520 --> 39:57.680
the biggest hit is my web browser yeah right and so you know especially if

39:57.680 --> 40:00.840
that's that's the kind of workflow you have you ever used it yeah I've used in

40:00.840 --> 40:05.600
the past I was using Firefox exclusively it was it worked pretty well though I was

40:05.600 --> 40:08.800
happy with so there's two of them anything any anything sink Damon I'll

40:08.800 --> 40:11.080
have a link to that in the show notes and then what was the other one profile

40:11.080 --> 40:14.840
sink Damon which is made I think anything is an extension or outgrowth of

40:14.840 --> 40:19.240
profile sink okay that one's just for browser profiles ah that might be a

40:19.240 --> 40:22.520
little safer yes but this can be useful to if you have other applications that

40:22.520 --> 40:27.000
you would like you know certain things to be in RAM I've played with not using

40:27.000 --> 40:29.680
this but you know played with however having running your all your root system

40:29.680 --> 40:34.600
in RAM people do that this is kind of fun this might turn into this might turn

40:34.600 --> 40:39.280
into an ongoing series of me trying to run more and more crap out of RAM all

40:39.280 --> 40:43.240
right so any other tips before I ask I'm gonna ask the doozy of the question

40:43.240 --> 40:46.720
anybody else in the mumble room have any other performance tips they do on their

40:46.720 --> 40:51.360
rig to keep things running fast anybody still do pre-linking anything like that

40:51.360 --> 40:57.160
well Chris you said that you were running your home directory on SSD and

40:57.160 --> 41:02.880
what I what I concern with is if you're running swap on there wouldn't that be

41:02.880 --> 41:07.600
actually doing way more rights to the system than it should yeah I can if

41:07.600 --> 41:10.740
you're using it yeah I can't remember how often I mean I only now have the

41:10.740 --> 41:13.920
sense that maybe I'm swapping I in the general in the past I don't really ever

41:13.920 --> 41:17.720
have the sense I'm actually using the swap file so that is a good question I

41:17.720 --> 41:21.400
don't know how frequently it's being updated maybe another good reason to

41:21.400 --> 41:26.280
swap off I only have SSDs in the machine and then I have a I have a raid

41:26.280 --> 41:31.800
zero of drives I use for editing or Steam I mean to be clear you should also

41:31.800 --> 41:36.040
know that most people if you have a significant amount of RAM you won't

41:36.040 --> 41:40.200
really touch swap unless you're doing like high computations and stuff or a

41:40.200 --> 41:44.040
bunch of virtual machines it's not a ton of RAM I think it's like 16 gigs it's

41:44.040 --> 41:48.240
not like a ton which is kind of crazy that's that's a ton in consumer level

41:48.240 --> 41:54.200
really is it though yeah yeah I run yes the average like a consumer starting

41:54.200 --> 42:00.840
thing is like four to two to four he's still no XPS 13 with four gigs that's

42:00.840 --> 42:05.360
no they haven't gotten better about that yet now you can get six and eight and

42:05.360 --> 42:09.720
stuff very commonly for about like 350 to 450 I can't even imagine less than

42:09.720 --> 42:14.480
decent price how you gonna run multiple VMs with less than eight how you gonna

42:14.480 --> 42:18.600
VM how you gonna do that come on get out of here get out of here don't you

42:18.600 --> 42:23.520
optimize actually what I think them I can't no I I got actually I actually

42:23.520 --> 42:26.480
could see it working especially with a lean Linux desktop I mean it's

42:26.480 --> 42:29.840
definitely doable and containers will help you there yeah I could honestly see

42:29.840 --> 42:33.280
getting by with less RAM especially if you're using on the server side I kind

42:33.280 --> 42:36.920
of I'm half joking but at the same time I I really am kind of disappointed that

42:36.920 --> 42:39.480
they're not selling it with more RAM these days because I really would like

42:39.480 --> 42:46.040
to I mean I I would like to have like 32 yeah exactly when you go to five 500 or

42:46.040 --> 42:52.680
more you get into like the 8 gig grams yeah okay I I guess for me I I I feel

42:52.680 --> 42:56.920
like boy if I could afford it I'd be up 32 on most of my machines now okay

42:56.920 --> 43:00.480
anybody have a thought because this is a suggestion that's coming to the show a

43:00.480 --> 43:04.360
few times I've never actually I almost pulled the trigger on at once but I

43:04.360 --> 43:08.400
never have actually switched out my IO scheduler now for those of you that

43:08.400 --> 43:12.080
don't know you can get different schedulers in the Linux kernel it just

43:12.080 --> 43:15.440
depends on which one it's built with that support different types of disk

43:15.440 --> 43:19.360
input and output operations you could say so there's the CFQ scheduler the

43:19.360 --> 43:23.320
completely fair queuing scheduler there's the NNOP scheduler and deadline

43:23.320 --> 43:26.400
and then there's the one that probably is that the one that people know what

43:26.400 --> 43:31.360
I'm talking about that the BFQ scheduler the budget fair scheduler and it's

43:31.360 --> 43:34.720
available in some Linux branches right now and a lot of people say the BFQ

43:34.720 --> 43:39.600
scheduler is significantly faster if you have SSD drives I don't actually know if

43:39.600 --> 43:46.880
this is really worth the switch okay heavens heavens you can post the

43:46.880 --> 43:49.520
correction in the chat room but this is my rough I'm giving you a layman's

43:49.520 --> 43:53.680
understanding of how the how the how the BFQ scheduler affects disk IO operation

43:53.680 --> 43:57.400
so essentially there is requests that come into the kernel and the kernel has

43:57.400 --> 43:59.960
to handle a lot of things you know get something off a disk feed something to

43:59.960 --> 44:05.080
somebody else talk to the network and the BFQ scheduler can give say preference

44:05.080 --> 44:09.080
if you have an SSD drive to the disk IO scheduler versus the network controller

44:09.080 --> 44:13.440
things like that right so BFQ is perhaps maybe another way to put it is more

44:13.440 --> 44:17.640
bias towards the disk scheduler in a sense and so if I'm getting it if I'm

44:17.640 --> 44:21.400
understanding correctly you say you have BFQ and as your as your overall queue

44:21.400 --> 44:25.200
scheduler then your disk performance can be much higher instead of waiting to go

44:25.200 --> 44:28.360
to the disk it more often goes to this now this is just based on what I've read

44:28.360 --> 44:31.040
reading on people that have tried it and said that performance is way better

44:31.040 --> 44:34.400
right and people are typically looking for responsiveness on the desktop yeah

44:34.400 --> 44:37.800
and so for example a great example is you know if you have a bunch of GDK

44:37.800 --> 44:40.520
dependencies in the background that are loading instead of just sitting around

44:40.520 --> 44:44.160
there waiting for those GDK dependencies to finish BFQ might go check in with the

44:44.160 --> 44:46.520
disk scheduler and see what it needs and take care of that for a minute and have

44:46.520 --> 44:49.720
the data ready something like that is really layman's understanding but that

44:49.720 --> 44:53.360
seems to be the end result which you see as a user is things open up much faster

44:53.360 --> 44:56.680
you can run multiple applications you can launch multiple applications at the

44:56.680 --> 45:00.040
same time in the launch while the disk is already being heavily accessed seems

45:00.040 --> 45:02.840
to be the general takeaway from BFQ anybody in the mumble room ever played

45:02.840 --> 45:11.280
with anything like this rotten yeah I do maybe yeah I do one I do on not so

45:11.280 --> 45:15.680
powerful equipment I don't bother on more modern systems you do notice a

45:15.680 --> 45:20.480
difference on so for example on the Raspberry Pi I definitely notice the

45:20.480 --> 45:25.240
difference by changing the combination of file systems and IO schedulers and on

45:25.240 --> 45:32.440
older much much older hardware sort of Pentium 4m type devices even retrofitted

45:32.440 --> 45:38.080
with SSDs you can see a measurable improvement in disk performance by

45:38.080 --> 45:43.600
changing my ways is that performance sort of show itself well the most

45:43.600 --> 45:47.280
obvious one is that you can see that the boot speed is dramatically decreased

45:47.280 --> 45:51.400
hmm that's a good time so that's probably launching of simultaneous files

45:51.400 --> 45:58.240
and things like that just as yeah but where you really notice it is if you're

45:58.240 --> 46:04.200
extracting a large archive in one process and browsing the web in the

46:04.200 --> 46:09.400
other you don't get that stop start pausing you know and and stuttering as

46:09.400 --> 46:13.880
you you know launching tabs and switching between tabs it all happens

46:13.880 --> 46:18.640
far more fluidly mmm I like that usually I believe it a cost to the

46:18.640 --> 46:24.800
decompression throughput but but that's fine if you use your desktop yeah right

46:24.800 --> 46:27.960
right right right right and it's interesting because in a server

46:27.960 --> 46:31.240
workload that might not be what you want no probably not but on a desktop work

46:31.240 --> 46:35.480
now that is what you want and unlike I say I only do this on on the older

46:35.480 --> 46:40.360
hardware where you know there's there's clearly measurable benefit on the newer

46:40.360 --> 46:46.920
hardware that the differences are so so small it's not worth the time to tweak

46:46.920 --> 46:51.480
it interesting I that was sort of my takeaway seemed like from the reviews I

46:51.480 --> 46:55.680
was reading it was in some cases so a couple of them that were seemed pretty

46:55.680 --> 46:59.880
obvious were simultaneous application launching like everything just remained

46:59.880 --> 47:03.880
very fluid they all didn't nothing really stuttered it was all very smooth

47:03.880 --> 47:08.160
but outside of that I didn't see huge differences and it seemed like a lot of

47:08.160 --> 47:11.320
work for a minor return so that's why I was kind of putting it out there when

47:11.320 --> 47:14.240
if people have actually experimented with it because every now and then when

47:14.240 --> 47:18.160
I when I I guess what brought it up again is I remember watching that demo

47:18.160 --> 47:22.280
and then today using this machine thinking oh these applications are

47:22.280 --> 47:26.080
launching so slow and like I launched telegram which is not a huge app and

47:26.080 --> 47:30.320
like everything seizes on the machine that was loading and stops loading for a

47:30.320 --> 47:34.120
second like even the terminal window and it's this is performing horrible and I

47:34.120 --> 47:36.520
started thinking I remember the BFQ scheduler was much better about

47:36.520 --> 47:40.240
prioritizing these kinds of things on the desktop I saw I did a little reading

47:40.240 --> 47:45.040
into it read a few reviews and it's I don't know it's something to try anyway

47:45.040 --> 47:49.160
it seems possible and worth trying but I'm a little skeptical since nobody's

47:49.160 --> 47:52.320
really building it in if I would imagine by now if it really made that much of a

47:52.320 --> 47:57.080
difference some distro would be yeah I think one does I think one distro out

47:57.080 --> 48:01.520
there based on arched I ship with it built in but yeah if you guys also does

48:01.520 --> 48:06.600
the BFQ or BF that was the one I was thinking of yeah it's Abbey on and and

48:06.600 --> 48:09.280
have you noticed any difference when you play with her have you played with it

48:09.280 --> 48:14.440
I have played with it I haven't really noticed well from my personal attempts I

48:14.440 --> 48:18.520
haven't really noticed much of a huge increase because I really noticed much of

48:18.520 --> 48:21.200
a difference when I'm compiling and doing a whole bunch of stuff and it's

48:21.200 --> 48:27.080
really stressing like my rig Sabian is built from Gentoo right not arch if I

48:27.080 --> 48:31.880
recall yes yeah and I think one of the reasons I was drawn to try it from a

48:31.880 --> 48:35.200
while ago was because it uses BFQ and I don't remember really noticing any

48:35.200 --> 48:38.320
difference now I think about it but they you know out of the box they're trying

48:38.320 --> 48:41.400
to make it as performant as possible and it's an interesting take on it so I

48:41.400 --> 48:43.580
wonder I don't know we'll see where it goes there are some branches Linux

48:43.580 --> 48:47.440
kernel out there that have it already too if you if you have any suggestions

48:47.440 --> 48:52.520
Linux actually showed at reddit.com and look for a lucky episode 113 of Linux

48:52.520 --> 48:56.400
unplugged and leave a comment in there and I'll try it if it's a reasonable and

48:56.400 --> 48:59.440
quick I don't want to rebuild my kernel necessarily well that's that's what's

48:59.440 --> 49:04.160
nice about the IO scheduler you can change that yeah yeah that was actually

49:04.160 --> 49:06.640
one of the neat things about one of the demos I was watching is he would

49:06.640 --> 49:10.240
literally turn he would switch them and you could watch it you could watch the

49:10.240 --> 49:14.680
difference I think he was using Fedora and that was pretty remarkable so all

49:14.680 --> 49:17.120
right you know another way you could maybe make your sister run a little

49:17.120 --> 49:20.760
better is probably just learn more about it go over to linuxacademy.com slash

49:20.760 --> 49:25.320
unplugged Linux Academy is the sponsor of the Linux unplugged program and man

49:25.320 --> 49:28.880
do they have some really cool stuff coming up so on October 15th they have a

49:28.880 --> 49:32.440
really big live show they're gonna do and they've been working on this thing

49:32.440 --> 49:35.520
that I'm gonna I have the notes here but I can't tell you yet because it's a big

49:35.520 --> 49:39.400
secret but they're working on it for a year and there's a lot of updates coming

49:39.400 --> 49:42.600
not only that but they just rolled out a new HTML 5 player with a new CDN back

49:42.600 --> 49:47.040
end so all of that great content works even better now and you know one of the

49:47.040 --> 49:49.880
things about Linux Academy that really stands out is they allow you to choose

49:49.880 --> 49:53.360
from seven plus distributions the courseware the virtual machines they

49:53.360 --> 49:57.680
match that the other thing though is instructor help is available with that

49:57.680 --> 50:01.960
stuff the stuff that the self-paced courses can still have actual instructor

50:01.960 --> 50:05.480
help that's awesome they have new lab features that are launching later this

50:05.480 --> 50:09.480
month a new practice exam phase one system will be launching this week and a

50:09.480 --> 50:12.000
new community feature we're gonna hear more about very soon there's a lot of

50:12.000 --> 50:16.280
really good stuff coming out also they have the new Linux Foundation certified

50:16.280 --> 50:18.880
system administrators course and the Linux Foundation certified engineer

50:18.880 --> 50:22.160
course have to definitely check that out and they're also proud to announce

50:22.160 --> 50:25.840
they're an open stack corporate partner now so they're officially an open stack

50:25.840 --> 50:28.640
training partner you can check that out too at Linux Academy go to Linux

50:28.640 --> 50:31.880
Academy.com slash unplugged and learn about the whole stack around Linux

50:31.880 --> 50:35.240
everything from small nuggets just deep dive into a single topic like using

50:35.240 --> 50:39.120
tar to back up your system or our sync to the really big stuff that's scenario

50:39.120 --> 50:42.720
based training where you get real hands-on go to Linux Academy.com slash

50:42.720 --> 50:46.720
unplugged to get our discount and you can take the tour it's a really great

50:46.720 --> 50:50.760
service and it's built by people that are crazy passionate about Linux I love

50:50.760 --> 50:55.400
that about them and they're working so hard Linux Academy.com slash unplugged oh

50:55.400 --> 51:00.560
and they just rolled out a new dashboard hey fancy that yeah got a whole new look

51:00.560 --> 51:04.400
check that out as well if you're already a member Linux Academy.com slash unplugged

51:04.400 --> 51:08.000
and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program you

51:08.000 --> 51:12.640
guys are awesome so I don't really know how to cover this next story in fact

51:12.640 --> 51:17.760
it's so I'm dreading it so much that Wes and I were trying to figure out how to

51:17.760 --> 51:22.280
handle this on the show because it's really not our area of expertise and

51:22.280 --> 51:27.200
there is very valid points on all sides but some important things happen this

51:27.200 --> 51:30.040
week I just want to touch on them and I want to keep the conversation as light

51:30.040 --> 51:34.380
as possible but I also don't want to ignore it I think that would be and it's

51:34.380 --> 51:41.240
one way sort of disrespectful so this week Matthew Garrett and another kernel

51:41.240 --> 51:47.440
contributor her name is Sarah Sharp yes thank you both decided to step away from

51:47.440 --> 51:54.240
the Linux kernel community in a sense and in both site essentially the tone

51:54.240 --> 51:59.440
the language and the overall interacting with people on the Linux kernel mailing

51:59.440 --> 52:03.360
list and mostly you could sum up as it's accused of being a toxic environment

52:03.360 --> 52:10.400
and this keeps coming up as a theme over and over again and it may give us some

52:10.400 --> 52:13.600
insight into some of the change that happened earlier this year perhaps when

52:13.600 --> 52:18.960
it comes to the code of conduct that was submitted to the Linux kernel and I'm

52:18.960 --> 52:23.640
trying to wrap my head around why we keep running into this and I simply I

52:23.640 --> 52:30.600
simply wonder now this might sound maybe too simplistic but I definitely noticed

52:30.600 --> 52:33.240
just on this road trip that I just went on and I think I was telling you about

52:33.240 --> 52:38.080
this at lunch too like there is a difference in culture from Washington to

52:38.080 --> 52:42.120
Grand Forks like everywhere I went each location people talked differently

52:42.120 --> 52:45.120
different expectations they behaved differently like I was telling you about

52:45.120 --> 52:48.480
the guy at the whiskey store who gave us the you know the the squinty eye then

52:48.480 --> 52:51.440
you go to another town and it's like they're pouring you free drinks and if

52:51.440 --> 52:54.540
they're embracing you get like everywhere has its own culture and its

52:54.540 --> 52:58.680
own way of doing things and you take that and you blow it up on a global

52:58.680 --> 53:02.120
scale and then we're all working together but then the other thing that

53:02.120 --> 53:08.400
seems to be completely counter to a organic open environment is you have

53:08.400 --> 53:11.800
people that are coming at it from the corporate standpoint where this is their

53:11.800 --> 53:15.360
job and they're here to do a job and then you have people that are doing it

53:15.360 --> 53:18.360
because it's their life's work and their life's passion and they're they would be

53:18.360 --> 53:21.560
doing it whether they're getting paid or not and you have two completely

53:21.560 --> 53:27.020
different types of work mindsets coming together to work on something and they

53:27.020 --> 53:30.760
the two different groups completely behave differently not to mention a lot

53:30.760 --> 53:34.040
of these people may have never met each other face-to-face right right and then

53:34.040 --> 53:37.560
you have people that you know handle different types of language completely

53:37.560 --> 53:41.160
differently trying to work together and I just look at this and think how is it

53:41.160 --> 53:45.640
possible to have any project at this scale and not have this happen I'm not

53:45.640 --> 53:51.520
trying to justify the actions but I'm wondering is it are we are we are we

53:51.520 --> 53:56.000
capable at this stage of our ability to communicate online to really solve this

53:56.000 --> 54:00.640
problem is online communications just still too primitive to truly solve this

54:00.640 --> 54:05.840
problem could it be if Linus is it possible if if Linus just spoke a little

54:05.840 --> 54:11.080
more nicely and treated new people with really you know with a really more

54:11.080 --> 54:16.080
gentle touch would that really change things what do you think Wes does is it

54:16.080 --> 54:21.040
possible you know you know I'm not sure and it's it's a it's it's tough to try

54:21.040 --> 54:26.040
to draw the line between you know making improvements and versus different styles

54:26.040 --> 54:29.720
you know I think Linus has touched on that on the mailing list before you know

54:29.720 --> 54:32.360
different different people have different expectations and take things

54:32.360 --> 54:36.040
different ways which is which is entirely valid but that said it does you

54:36.040 --> 54:39.160
know it gives me pause that you know both of these people are clearly very

54:39.160 --> 54:42.520
talented technically you know and they've contributed a lot to the kernel

54:42.520 --> 54:46.800
and so it is yeah it's at least interesting that they choose to leave

54:46.800 --> 54:49.800
obviously well we're lucky that we still get to enjoy what they do in other

54:49.800 --> 54:53.760
open-source projects mm-hmm but as a Linux user I'd like to you know I'd

54:53.760 --> 54:56.680
like to have an environment where people are excited to join and are not turned

54:56.680 --> 55:00.760
away right yeah that is definitely you don't want to have a reputation for

55:00.760 --> 55:04.640
being I'm a con did bring up in the chat room did bring up a good point though

55:04.640 --> 55:08.760
there is the issue of you know do we want you know is this something where

55:08.760 --> 55:12.200
you need to step away and and this is of course a personal choice but or should

55:12.200 --> 55:15.720
there should there be a stand-up of people who want to change and represent

55:15.720 --> 55:19.960
that change within the kernel community mmm I don't know if people just leave

55:19.960 --> 55:22.880
them there's not representation right does that just leave the people you know

55:22.880 --> 55:27.080
who are interacting in the style that a subset of people don't enjoy yeah this

55:27.080 --> 55:31.240
is a tough this is a challenging one because it's it's it's unfortunately a

55:31.240 --> 55:37.160
topic that it's really it's it's a bad it's a bad image to have it's a really

55:37.160 --> 55:41.440
bad image to have right and it's really at the core of Linux anybody in the

55:41.440 --> 55:44.920
mumble room have a thought on if this is problem is something we're at anywhere

55:44.920 --> 55:48.160
close to solving because I feel like we're so far out from having an answer

55:48.160 --> 55:54.840
here I think one of the first questions you asked was you alluded to the fact

55:54.840 --> 55:59.960
that this keeps happening and that things aren't changing and there's a

55:59.960 --> 56:05.760
good reason for that the same people work in that team you know if if you

56:05.760 --> 56:09.520
don't change anything then nothing is going to change it is as simple as that

56:09.520 --> 56:15.560
if and if the people who are at the top and who control the style of

56:15.560 --> 56:19.880
communication that happens in that team and have other people looking up to them

56:19.880 --> 56:25.000
and take guidance on how to act if those people don't change then nothing will

56:25.000 --> 56:30.760
change and this will carry on and you'll be left with only those people who have

56:30.760 --> 56:37.680
a very strong stomach and a very thick skin and who can cope with the kind of

56:37.680 --> 56:43.800
beatings that that Linus gives out and you won't be able to have the other

56:43.800 --> 56:48.920
talent from the people who don't have a thick skin and and aren't willing to put

56:48.920 --> 56:53.360
up with that crap and so you're you're you're limiting the contributions that

56:53.360 --> 56:57.520
you can possibly get not because of someone's technical ability but because

56:57.520 --> 57:03.360
of their willingness to put up with the crap that they have to in that group

57:03.360 --> 57:10.580
hmm I I just that so your argument which is a good one is sort of assumes the

57:10.580 --> 57:14.520
foregone conclusion that something must change that the way it's being done now

57:14.520 --> 57:19.760
is wrong and I don't necessarily disagree but I guess the thing I don't

57:19.760 --> 57:25.600
like about that is that begins to walk a path that leads to Linus and I don't

57:25.600 --> 57:30.100
really want there to be this sort of Linus must go sentiment-building because

57:30.100 --> 57:34.680
that seems like that could be destructive but he's not a god he's he's

57:34.680 --> 57:41.200
a guy who is an unpleasant person he is he said that himself yeah recent Linus

57:41.200 --> 57:45.540
conference he said I'm not a nice person to deal with you know it that's a kind

57:45.540 --> 57:51.000
of it's one of those phrases that people use that that people say oh well I tell

57:51.000 --> 57:56.960
like it is and what I am and I know that's the way I am and I say what I

57:56.960 --> 58:01.560
like and yeah you know that's that's it well okay that's fair enough but stay

58:01.560 --> 58:05.480
the fuck away from me because you're not a pleasant person to be around I do

58:05.480 --> 58:09.440
follow that logic why you have to be around these well and unfortunately some

58:09.440 --> 58:14.360
of these people have to because it's their job I I just I the the only of

58:14.360 --> 58:18.720
course the counter argument would be the very success of Linux itself right and

58:18.720 --> 58:23.720
so I the when when the line of logic is that Linus is the problem then I say

58:23.720 --> 58:28.360
well then what was everything we've accomplished so far how he has been not

58:28.360 --> 58:32.160
necessarily the person developed it but you do have to wonder if we would really

58:32.160 --> 58:36.520
have the world's best kernel right now if he wasn't extremely critical and I'm

58:36.520 --> 58:39.800
not trying to justify I'm throwing that if that's a possibility it's sort of

58:39.800 --> 58:44.400
like it's sort of like Apple is a nicer softer company without Steve Jobs but

58:44.400 --> 58:49.000
they have also lost something without him correlation is not causation there

58:49.000 --> 58:54.400
isn't you can't just say that because Linus wears glasses everyone who wears

58:54.400 --> 58:58.440
glasses must be a really good kernel hacker you you can't necessarily say that

58:58.440 --> 59:07.400
no no no no no since I've been wearing glasses that's what he's like and Linux

59:07.400 --> 59:12.280
is has been successful doesn't mean it is successful because that's what he's

59:12.280 --> 59:17.280
like right now I agree no I agree with you I agree with you I just I think it

59:17.280 --> 59:20.400
is still is a dangerous line of thinking but it maybe it's I mean maybe it is

59:20.400 --> 59:24.080
time I okay let's let's okay let's put it to you if you were in if you're

59:24.080 --> 59:27.960
working in an office and someone was talking to you the way that Linus talked

59:27.960 --> 59:33.640
to Sarah would you you know if you you would you just shrug that off if it

59:33.640 --> 59:37.520
happened repeatedly and your your main line of work was to interact with that

59:37.520 --> 59:42.400
person would you let that stand I put it to you that most people would probably

59:42.400 --> 59:46.040
take that person to one side and say hey I think you're being unreasonable I

59:46.040 --> 59:49.720
think you're you're acting like a dick I think you're the way you're acting in

59:49.720 --> 59:54.120
front of our peers because this is public it's not like these two people are

59:54.120 --> 59:58.200
sat in a room right and they have a tete-a-tete in the room this is like

59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.800
wider than people sitting in a meeting room this is public on a mailing list

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.760
everyone is seeing him tearing strips off people that's unreasonable and in a

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.960
business place he would be reprimanded why the Linux Foundation not doing

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.360
something about this well I you know I've read the quotes I'm not I can't

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.600
really think of one that is particularly offensive people have gone through no I

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.840
mean people have gone through and collected the quotes that they believe

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.160
are in question here right but you're not on the receiving end of them no I'm

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.760
just saying they're not none of them are none of them are all that particularly

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.480
so the worst one I could find and I know this is just through my reading this

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.200
morning but the worst quote I found was something that implied sucking Microsoft

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.160
off that was thrown at Matthew Garrett wasn't thrown at Sarah was thrown at

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.720
Matthew Garrett that seems to be the worst I could find on the kernel mailing

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:55.640
list and it's okay that's crude but you know I don't know I I the the sometimes

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.520
from the outside the story looks a lot worse to be honest with you poppy to

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.120
answer your question I have worked environments where people yell and

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.840
scream like that and it's not wonderful it's not great but sometimes it just is

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.560
how those people work unfortunately and I don't like it but it's sort of it's

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.400
sort of posted everywhere when you walk in the door what happens I mean

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.760
everybody's not like it's a secret like you said all that stuff is in public so

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.200
right but in a place like that you can you know you can act and effect change

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.960
you know if whether whether you feel it's really unreasonable or not you know

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.040
the person who's the recipient that can effect some kind of change by

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.960
approaching management or approaching the other person's management or the HR

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.040
department or whatever the process is in that company there are processes is the

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.200
point yeah it's very difficult I mean they're already they already they

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.320
already have submitted the code of conduct then the new updated one that

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.440
Craig's image doesn't actually identify anything that you're not supposed to do

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.280
in any way but the problem is there's only one person at the top of this tree

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.080
and that's Linus you can't you can't say our screw this I'll go to that other

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.080
Linux down the road like you would quit a job and go to a different job mm-hmm

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.480
you know if your if your job is to contribute to Linux chances are if it's

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.680
if it's high enough up the up the food chain you're gonna interact with the

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.600
LKML at some point so it's it's it's difficult because there is only one yeah

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.200
there can only be one so heavens you wanted to jump in about Linus being

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.200
blunt and harsh what are your thoughts well he's been this way for quite a long

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.200
while and this problem hasn't popped up until recently mainly with her just

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.080
because everyone else can deal with it and she can maybe she should you step

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.800
down so she's not doing but doesn't that assume doesn't that assume that other

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.680
people that assumes that other people haven't burnt out and left and just

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.840
didn't say anything well possibly more engaged with other

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.200
communities yeah what was that wimpy also what didn't get started in the

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.120
first place right now go ahead BST go ahead heavens ideally of course would be

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.720
a slightly nicer place to be but the Linux kernel yes I do believe he should

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.840
be very blunt and straightforward to be really that's that's your solution if

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.560
you don't like it you should find another project clearly technical as

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:20.360
possible the problem that she was talking about in her blog post was not

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:27.020
about the fact that any technical mistakes that she made was insulting to

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:31.880
her she said that she wanted that if she made a technical mistake that she wanted

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.920
in the color color out on it and that she didn't have a problem with technical

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.880
insults it was the personal insults that they were thrown at her I don't know what

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.880
they were I couldn't I couldn't find any myself but the I didn't look that hard

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:50.880
but the the point is is that if if there are personal insults then what is the

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.360
net what is it necessary to actually insult the person who's providing the

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.280
code if they're genuinely trying to provide good code rather than saying

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.680
here's where you screwed up like this is garbage code here's how to fix it or

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.920
here's a new suggestion or something and when that happens they usually say okay

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.440
yeah you're right I'll take care of it but if it goes to a personal level why

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.080
would you be too busy for a person one he's also wanting to retire you know

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.280
you're you're so setting associating this to Linus it's not necessary yeah I

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.840
guess a lot of the maintainer other maintainers are where so that's a good

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.280
point right she was she was talking about the community as a whole she did

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.600
not specify Linus or anyone at all right right and I think I think that kind of

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.080
when it obviously when it crosses line into personal that's where it gets

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.320
unfortunate and it should that there's no excuse for that really that's just

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.000
being mean it's just that is straight up just being mean North Ranger I wanted

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.480
to give you a chance to jump in yeah I mean rotten corpse makes a great point

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.680
about you know when you cross that line into a personal insult and I'm kind of

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.560
torn because I want to see you know people like Sarah people like Matthew if

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.640
they are being personally insulted to you know to call out those bulliers but

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.800
on the flip side I don't know that they can do that because of you know

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.160
potential backlash they might have for for being tattletales or whatever you

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.760
might want to call it it just I guess going back to the core point it

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.560
frustrates me because here we are in episode 113 I feel like every two months

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.320
we have a story where maybe it's not that frequent but it feels like we've

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.920
done plenty of these stories about people getting hurt upset and it seems

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:35.400
like this just keeps keeps happening in the blog post Sarah did say that things

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.920
are changing and things are right improvements she just doesn't want to

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.200
deal with it having to be involved with it anymore regardless of that there is

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.880
being there are changes being made she just doesn't want to be there in the in

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.160
the midst of them change I think it's I think it's fair to to say that it's very

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.800
unfortunate if this is something that singles out and happens to women but we

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.240
have seen it happen we've seen it happen to blonde white men I mean supposedly

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:05.000
Lenart Pottering had his life threatened over system D so this has been an issue

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.440
where it just goes too far over and over and over again and passionate community

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.080
yeah I just I don't I mean I don't I don't know quite how to make reason out

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.600
of it it doesn't it does seem to be a problem that doesn't just be unique to

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.360
Linux kernel mailing list either although I think you could make an

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.280
argument that's an area where perhaps conduct needs to be above bar as much

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.200
as possible because it's under so much scrutiny and it represents as a core

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.720
part of its business critical now you know yeah it's yeah yeah there's and as

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:38.400
I said there's only one but the business critical thing actually adds more

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:43.720
importance to making sure everything is right yeah yes I think the idea that the

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.000
the way that they handle the technical aspects of it is perfectly fine and even

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.920
if they're yelling at each other and because if someone does something that

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.600
is worthy of being yelled at they should be yelled at because that's the only

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.640
thing that's effective in a even though they're people being paid for and it's

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.040
their job they aren't being paid by the Linux

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.640
foundation for most I think it's worth making the distinction to that what some

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.120
people consider being yelled at other people do not consider yelling too

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.200
because there are cultural differences and there's very large cultural

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.360
differences in some cases right and the main thing is though like these people

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.960
are saying like you know they're being paid to work on it so they don't have a

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:28.440
choice but the people who are yelling at them aren't paying them so how can they

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:34.640
you know convey the message of how the severity of their mistake when they have

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.040
no actual control except for this is not coming in like that's all they can do

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.880
though like here they if they maybe you know in certain cases be severe or not

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:51.760
it depends on if the technical aspect of it isn't merit or not so as in my

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.200
opinion if the technical thing happens and you get yelled at because the code

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.880
is terrible well then the code is terrible whatever fix it so here's the

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.680
as long as it doesn't go personal as Noah would say here's the thing and this

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.600
is sort of my big takeaway is if you have something that's open and you want

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.320
contributions and you want quality contributions it's probably worth the

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.480
project's time and effort to make contributions feel or make contributors

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.360
feel as welcome and invited as possible because that only is going to make your

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.840
project better and so I think it is in the best interest of open source

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.960
projects health to have a good community and part of that is how you interact

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.360
with that community so now the Linux kernel isn't really suffering from this

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.440
particular problem they can afford to be rather aggressive but there are a lot of

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.920
projects out there so many of which we have talked about today that could use

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.080
contributions and for them it's in their best interest to work with the community

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.800
now what I would hate to see is a bunch of middle management PMO types come in

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.840
and try to tell all these projects how to work with their community but that is

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:55.760
a topic for a future show if anybody has any closing thoughts I'll hear it but

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.480
I'll go ahead run well you'll I'll give you the closing word yeah I just wanted

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.960
to play devil's advocate here in the sense of like the way you just said

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.520
about how that they need to you know be more opening to people but there are

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.600
certain cases where there's some people that you you don't want to submit code

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.680
to because it takes more time to weed through their code to see if it's

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.680
actually useful or not that there have been people who have been banned from

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.400
the mailing list because they were submitting code that was complete

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.400
garbage yeah just so that they could get their own for a couple reasons they

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.960
could get their name in the kernel or certain things like that and in certain

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.720
cases they were like actively breaking you know user land and everything and

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:41.560
right like a cardinal sin of a colonel so they were basically doing like they

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:49.120
have to set an environment that is a weird hybrid of community and hostility

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.480
so it's you know how can you really I mean it's it's a situation where I don't

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.480
think anyone could really you know find iron it out it's gonna be hard to find

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.720
the balance that's what I say is it's just gonna be an ongoing problem too but

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.880
I do hope it tends towards making people feel more welcome and getting more

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.520
contributors because that's gonna make the projects better and get new ideas in

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.280
there too so why don't we kind of end it on a positive note right there episode

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.120

here next week.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.120
if I'm being honest my my strong desire was actually to just reload my machine

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.520
with the latest Androgros ISO I already had written to a to a USB thumb drive

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:47.480
like new install I'm like no no I can recover it I can rebuild it I can make

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.240
it stronger and better than before I've seen some people on the arch forums who

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.480
just have it set up every night they just reinstall yeah well you know you

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.920
just pull them especially if you already have like maybe you cash the packages

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.480
locally you know you have a some you know chef for ansible and just build it

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.680
all up again it's ready to go in the morning Androgros is good I'm telling

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.080
you I'm loving the latest Androgros build loving their installer option for

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.240
long-term kernel support is brilliant when you're doing a desktop arch machine

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:17.600
and one checkbox steam installation you know it's also my default for installing

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.440
arch now I don't I don't use their installer but it's such a nice live CD

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.800
to boot into and then you just install arch in a shrew every now and then every

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.400
now and then I swear I get like a bad ISO or something and the installers just

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.440
totally wonky but I either then I just jump either between the daily build or

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.920
the latest stable release and whichever one fails me I just switch switching

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.440
one of those gonna work yeah and I have to say I just recently reloaded a

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.120
machine that we had set aside for Windows 10 testing that I was like no

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.640
more gone with you and I just was like I'm gonna do Androgros again and I got

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.160
their latest their latest build and the fact is is this machine now that I think

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.680
about it I'm giving it to somebody that's gonna be using it that won't be

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.840
doing updates very often and having that LTS kernel I feel a lot better about

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.460
giving them an arch system all of a sudden even though for me I don't do it

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.640
right right but for someone in a different a little different use case

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.440
yeah that's a little more peace of mind installing and and of course anybody

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.320
installing arch could do that but for some reason when I was setting up this

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.280
machine for them it didn't cross my mind I tell you if I had done the arch

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.960
installation myself yeah I probably would have just neglected to think of

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.240
that yep so I was pretty appreciative of that just had the option as the default

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.880
or it really makes arch super approachable yeah you don't have to have

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.200
you know carefully designed your system for a day beforehand you can just

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.360
install it and yeah away you go yeah and the default the default gnome desktop is

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.280
the one I generally go with is pretty nice I change it up pretty quickly but

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:50.000
it's easy enough to do that yeah so yes in fact I think probably the only time

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.280
I'll ever install arch vanilla straight a standard old arch is on a server right

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.120
if I'm for some reason deciding that server should be running arch mm-hmm but

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.320
I don't know how much I'm gonna do that I'm on the fence on that still I do it

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.240
for a for a few machines that I use daily but anything beyond that I wouldn't

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.560
depends on how willing you are and how much time you have and so I think it

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.520
also depends on what's the server doing right exactly so is the server is a

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.160
server hosting web pages over nginx and a pad or Apache and and it has a

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:27.200
database or is it a Plex machine with Dropbox and BitTorrent sync yes exactly

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.120
and I'm more inclined to say Ubuntu is a good is a good solution or CentOS is a

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.800
good solution for the first one yes and arch is a better solution for the Plex

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.240
media server type thing because then you have the AUR and you could just right

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.520
off the top of my head I mean the advantage there is in the AUR you've got

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.560
the Plex and the Plex pass version yep you can also get like the git versions

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.360
or whatever like the beta builds and stuff the nightly's or whatever you need

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:58.880
yeah and so it's a very minimal update and if you so we have two servers the

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:04.040
run arch that hosts Plex one here at the studio and one at my house nice and both

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.240
of them are just really minimal installs with Plex and a couple other things yep

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.320
and then it just keeps the updates fairly small and so I think now we're at

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.520
like two to three months in between updates but it really hasn't been an

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.120
issue yet yes you know that's what I've been doing for the one that runs MB at

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.560
my house and and there are ways to you know you can you can update frequently

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.320
if you need to or you can take snapshots if you know Sousa style if you're

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.820
worried about you know if you need it to be a little more productiony and you

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.920
know ever the the evergreen releases from open Sousa are a good LTS but I

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.760
think maybe for me the the leap stuff might be even better hey so what do you

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.760
think about this user in the chairman says how do you manage your dot files and

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.760
integral so I'm looking for the best way to do it and when he says manage I'm

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.080
thinking maybe keeping them consistent across his machines is that what you

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.080
think he's talking about when he says manage yeah you know yeah it could be

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.280
consistent it could be versioned it could be backed up so I used to try it

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.240
I used to try to do this over Dropbox and that burned me so bad that I never

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.560
bothered again and actually what it what the way it kind of burned me was is one

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.680
machine got updated to a new version of KDE and then the other machine stuff

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.880
synced over and it was just a mess and it's like of course that was gonna

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.680
happen to me I was just kind of trying it and that didn't go well have you ever

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.080
used anything West to like get or anything like that to keep your yeah you

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.320
know and it depends again like so many things on how involved you want to be

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.240
how often you need to touch it how you know like magically behind the scenes it

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:29.280
works yeah but yes I have mine I use a good new stow to create sim links for my

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.560
configuration files in both Etsy and my files the new stow yeah on now hold on

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.320
now hold on that sounds app pick material I gotta take a look tell me

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.000
about good news still I just got a sim link manager GNU oh okay

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.480
STO okay and I'm slightly I learned to use it for a particular project several

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.400
years ago that's why it's on my toolkit okay but it lets you set up it lets you

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.600
easily set up sort of sort of like you would see inside of like an RPM package

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.000
where you have a tree that gets mirrored out to the real file system and so it

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.680
makes it really easy to keep your configuration files okay you know so

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.440
usually when I set things up or if I'm converting a server you can just move a

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.000
file to your to your storage location and then in stow will automatically if

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.180
you set it up create a sim link so you can edit your files just like they

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.680
actually lived in Etsy yeah but they can all be under one folder yeah and then

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.600
that way whenever you have changes you know you can make a new branch on get

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.160
you and then you're backing up that one folder yes exactly so that's just a git

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.200
repo and you're sinking out across your machines yeah well and then and then

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.640
that's you can have you know you can have different branches if you have you

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.280
know different configuration files that need to be in a different syntax that's

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.680
sounding to get a little complicated though yeah and so it depends you know

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.920
most of my machines are similar enough that I can just sync them you know I

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.360
can just pull down the repo you could have a easy little script that would

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.640
keep it in sync if you'd like who it really depends on how you know how

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.240
different your configurations need to be yeah per machine so user links in the

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.880
chat room an actual specific how-to on how to use stow to kind of do exactly

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.880
what we're talking about how to manage your dot files so I will throw a link to

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.560
that in the show notes so here it is using the new stow to manage your dot

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.360
files this might be exactly what you know and this will work well if your

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.880
idea of a file manager is the terminal so it's not for everyone but yeah yeah

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.440
I've had some good use use cases I like that it seems to me like kind of an

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.400
intermediate step you're not ready to go full ansible or chef you know what's

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.160
funny about that statement though is the the command line I laugh at the command

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.880
line being my file manager until I really need to get something done or I

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.000
don't have any damn time to fool around and then all of a sudden but you damn

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.280
right the command line is my file manager that's all I'll you move is move

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.440
and it will always work and LS responds immediately I don't have to wait for

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.080
Nautilus to enumerate icons or whatever no preview files no I just want the file

01:18:45.080 --> 01:19:02.280
list I want to know who owns this file right now
