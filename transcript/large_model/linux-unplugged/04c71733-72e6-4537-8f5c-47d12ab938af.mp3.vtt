00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
Hey, guys, I got into a bit of trouble last night.

00:02.600 --> 00:03.600
Last night, huh?

00:03.600 --> 00:06.520
Well, it started during daylight hours

00:06.520 --> 00:09.240
and then went deep into the night.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.120
And it all started when one of my power supplies

00:12.120 --> 00:15.240
blew up while I was trying to use it.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.480
And you know that electronic smell we've all smelled?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.160
Oh, yes.

00:19.160 --> 00:19.720
Oh, yeah.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.080
You know instantly that something's wrong, right?

00:22.080 --> 00:23.320
And I was like, oh, no.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.480
It lingers for hours as well.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.040
I think Brent's getting a new power supply for the holidays

00:29.040 --> 00:30.360
is what's happening there.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.760
I got a cascade of telegram messages from Brent.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.960
As the evening progressed, they got progressively worse.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.080
Alex may have woke up to some pretty sad Brent.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.000
So I've got some computers to fix over there.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.760
I suppose we should ask if you're OK.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.320
But all we care about is the tech.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.640
I have a few like knuckle scrapes

00:48.640 --> 00:51.640
from like frustrated screwing and unscrewing and screwing

00:51.640 --> 00:52.280
and unscrewing.

00:52.280 --> 00:56.640
But other than that, I think I'm going to get

00:56.640 --> 00:58.200
some new computers this year.

00:58.200 --> 01:06.480
Oh, hey there.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.800
Welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode 334.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.520
My name is Chris.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.240
My name is Wes.

01:11.240 --> 01:11.880
Hello, Wes.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.640
Hello.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.160
How are you feeling about today?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.120
Oh, I'm a little nervous.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.080
I don't think I did so well last year.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.320
I don't think I did very, very well either, Wes.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.760
But you know, there's no shame in learning from our mistakes.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.760
There's a lot of shame.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.480
But we will still learn from our mistakes.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.440
To help keep us on the straight and narrow,

01:28.440 --> 01:32.640
the judge has returned for his annual judging.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.360
Hello, Joe.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.080
Hello.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.360
I'm going to keep you all in check.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.160
That's right, on the straight and narrow.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.800
And then, of course, to help us really kind of pile

01:39.800 --> 01:43.680
onto our mistakes, Alex, Cheese, and Brent are here as well.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.920
And then we need people to roast us.

01:44.920 --> 01:45.560
Hello, gentlemen.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.040
Hello.

01:46.040 --> 01:46.720
Hello there.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.480
Well, hello.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.760
Happy holidays.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.880
Thank you for joining us on this very special episode here

01:51.880 --> 01:53.240
of the old program.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.240
We are doing this one offline to make a special treat

01:56.240 --> 01:59.480
for those listening at home, in the feeds.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.240
You know, Wes brought a piano.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.440
Oh, it's lovely.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.560
God, you got so many talents.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.000
Listen to this.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.240
Good idea putting the mic on that, Wes.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.160
So isn't he talented?

02:10.160 --> 02:12.360
It's so impressive.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.840
So before we get started, it's nice to sit a moment

02:14.840 --> 02:16.000
with friends.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.720
Here we all are at the end of the year,

02:18.720 --> 02:21.320
and we're about to make fools of ourselves.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.760
So why don't we just get a couple of business items out

02:23.760 --> 02:24.240
of the way?

02:24.240 --> 02:26.280
Because there's things we've got to talk about.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
There's always a few things.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.680
There's always a few things.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.560
As we record this here and now, next week

02:31.560 --> 02:34.920
will be our actual predictions for the year of 2020.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.720
We decided to get the reviews out of the way,

02:36.720 --> 02:40.880
own up to our mistakes before the next round of predictions,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.680
in part to incorporate some of that learning

02:43.680 --> 02:45.040
into our next predictions.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.380
Though I don't think it will help.

02:46.380 --> 02:49.520
No, it turns out this is just not really very easy to do,

02:49.520 --> 02:50.000
is it?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.640
This is like my hardest year to make predictions ever.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.760
Despite it being, it's been a great year.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.640
Yeah, oh yeah, no, for sure.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.160
There's just been so much going on.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.080
First of all, I haven't really had my head in the game.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.560
And second of all, after listening

03:01.560 --> 03:04.200
to previous year's prediction episodes,

03:04.200 --> 03:08.320
I mean, it's just such a crapshoot.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.320
You really have no idea.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.800
That's part of why it's fun.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.440
Yeah, yeah, except for every time

03:13.440 --> 03:15.080
you kind of sound like a fool.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.200
So I decided to have a little philosophy change this year

03:18.200 --> 03:20.680
for my predictions.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.580
For this episode, I'm going to go a little more out there.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.040
I might be going for a little more

03:25.040 --> 03:28.040
on the entertainment side than I am the actual prediction side.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.000
This is going to be more like let's go for pie

03:30.000 --> 03:31.240
in the sky kind of stuff.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.080
Are you just saying that so you have something to sort of

03:33.080 --> 03:34.320
soften the blow next year?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.540
No, no, it's because I'm keeping all my serious predictions

03:36.540 --> 03:38.280
for Linux Action News where I'm really

03:38.280 --> 03:39.440
get competitive with Joe.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.720
That's why I'm, that's what's going on there.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.080
I realize it's like, oh, I've got

03:44.080 --> 03:47.200
to keep all the really good ones for Linux Action News,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.320
because Joe's going to get serious about this.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.400
So I got to blow all of my crazy out there wild ones right now.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.480
But I got some ones that I really hope turn out.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.760
But you'll have to wait and see.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.140
The predictions Linux Action News

03:57.140 --> 03:58.880
is coming out soon in the feed.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.720
And our predictions, all of ours,

04:00.720 --> 04:02.080
will be out in the next episode.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.340
But this one, this one we own up.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.200
And before we do that, just a spot of housekeeping,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.140
as our friends across the pond would say.

04:11.140 --> 04:12.760
I'm not positive, but I think that's

04:12.760 --> 04:15.280
how they would say it's a spot of housekeeping this week.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.360
Number one, you may have heard recently about our big news.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.480
We have been acquired by a cloud guru.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.560
And they have big plans to make everything

04:23.560 --> 04:25.240
bigger and better for everyone.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.680
And a Q&A, including their commitment to future Linux

04:28.680 --> 04:30.440
content, has been posted.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.680
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.080
Go read up on that.

04:34.080 --> 04:34.920
It's pretty cool.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.760
Big, exciting news.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.040
The future is going to be very bright and exciting.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.140
Stay tuned.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.320
Now, these programs here, they're not live right now.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.560
We're doing the holiday thing.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.160
So if you want to keep talking to us,

04:45.160 --> 04:47.640
keep the conversation going, you can find us in the Telegram.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.840
jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.440
That's where you get that.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.120
Get on that business.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.680
It's not just the releases.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.760
And then I want to make everyone aware,

04:57.760 --> 05:00.520
because I've gotten several questions, that live stream

05:00.520 --> 05:02.960
I did making Plasma basic to brilliant, where I was really

05:02.960 --> 05:05.080
kind of not sure how that was going to turn out,

05:05.080 --> 05:06.120
turned out great.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
And it's been posted.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.960
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes

05:08.960 --> 05:11.040
if you want to try out Plasma and go through some

05:11.040 --> 05:12.880
of the tips and steps and tricks that I

05:12.880 --> 05:14.640
use to make my workstation pretty usable.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.280
Why not give yourself the gift of a beautiful desktop?

05:17.280 --> 05:19.640
That's right, from basic to brilliant.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.720
Super neat side note about that.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.560
The Plasma team and Jonathan Riddle watched the video.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.960
And so they're going to implement

05:26.960 --> 05:28.640
a couple of those suggestions of mine

05:28.640 --> 05:30.760
as defaults in future releases.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.480
And that some of the things I was tweaking

05:32.480 --> 05:35.880
are already fixed in the next version of Plasma.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.920
How cool is that?

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
What a great desktop.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.640
Yeah, so they took some of that feedback

05:39.640 --> 05:42.360
in, even though I was a little rough on the defaults.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.040
And they took that in, and they're

05:44.040 --> 05:46.520
going to implement some of it, not all of it, but some of it.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.480
That's a pretty great outcome of that live stream.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.240
It really is.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.600
So it's about, it's actually an hour right on the nose.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.960
But at the beginning of the video,

05:53.960 --> 05:55.620
I lay out sort of the format.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.500
So if you just need certain parts of the video,

05:57.500 --> 05:59.100
it's pretty easy to jump around.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.960
So you go get that at the show notes,

06:00.960 --> 06:04.520
linuxunplug.com slash 3, 3, 4.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.640
And that, that's our housekeeping.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.000
Nice, tight, easy, clean.

06:10.000 --> 06:10.560
Very easy.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.680
You guys have been keeping it tidy,

06:11.680 --> 06:13.200
so there's not a real, there's not

06:13.200 --> 06:13.760
a need for a lot of tidying.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.080
Don't make a mess for us now.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.840
We're going to make a mess today.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.080
Oh, Wes.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.080
OK, are you ready for this?

06:22.080 --> 06:23.520
As ready as I'm going to be.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.360
OK, so last year, we made a bunch of bold predictions.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.600
And right now, it's time for us to own up.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.760
And what do you say you and I will go back and forth?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.400
So I'll do one of mine, and we'll do one of yours.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.040
Yeah, that sounds fair.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
And then the judge will tell us if we got it right or not.

06:35.040 --> 06:35.800
Uh-oh.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.720
You ready, judge?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.520
I'm ready.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.600
All right.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.520
Here is my first prediction from last year.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.280
In 2019, Google will announce that you

06:44.280 --> 06:48.360
can start testing your Android applications on Fuchsia

06:48.360 --> 06:50.720
using their handy generic emulator.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.720
I didn't see that announcement, I don't think.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.840
No, no.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.480
I can't believe.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.880
That should have happened, right?

06:55.880 --> 06:56.640
I mean, come on.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.840
That's such an obvious move.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.840
Sort of less Fuchsia news over the year than I expected,

06:59.840 --> 07:00.440
really.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.720
Other than just recently with the Flutter conference stuff.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.320
True.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.200
But yeah.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.400
What's the word, judge?

07:05.400 --> 07:06.800
I'm afraid that is a fail.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.300
Fuchsia.

07:11.240 --> 07:11.840
All right.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.360
That's good.

07:12.360 --> 07:12.840
That's fine.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.480
Do you still think it's going to maybe come around soon?

07:15.480 --> 07:16.000
I do.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.480
Oh, I do.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.440
I totally do.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.240
I don't actually have it down as a 2020 prediction,

07:19.240 --> 07:20.320
but maybe I should.

07:20.320 --> 07:20.840
That's all right.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.360
I'm sure one of these other ones are going to be winners.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.120
So are you ready for yours, Wes?

07:24.120 --> 07:24.960
Yeah, let's have it.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.680
I wish this one would have happened.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.680
In 2019, BcashFS will enter the mainline kernel

07:31.680 --> 07:34.440
and be shipped in a distribution like Arch.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.080
No dice on that one, that's for sure.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.000
It's kind of a shame.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.360
I mean, we've just pivoted back to using Flutter again,

07:39.360 --> 07:40.800
so maybe we don't need it.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.160
But it's a project I like.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.800
I continue to support it, and I hope

07:43.800 --> 07:45.680
to see it in a kernel sometime soon.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.720
But it is pretty easy to get it going on Arch, right?

07:47.720 --> 07:49.280
Yeah, you can just build the module and load it in,

07:49.280 --> 07:50.200
no problem.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.520
It's almost halfway there, but it's not mainstreamed.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.600
No, I'm afraid it's got another fail.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.440
It hurts my soul.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.680
This is going to be rough, I feel like.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.180
And like, that should have happened,

08:03.180 --> 08:04.400
but I think it's just still too early.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.680
We didn't even get Wirecard.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.000
Right.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.520
As we know, it takes a long time to get things there,

08:07.520 --> 08:08.240
and rightfully so.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.880
Once it's in, it will stay there, right?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.480
Forever, yeah.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.720
I'm sure this next one I got right.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.320
Are you ready?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.120
Oh, let's hear it.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.880
In 2019, I thought it was all going

08:15.880 --> 08:19.160
to be about the virtual desktop.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.140
Turned out it's about virtual game streaming.

08:21.140 --> 08:25.760
In 2019, Microsoft Azure or Digital Ocean

08:25.760 --> 08:29.200
launches a Linux-based virtual desktop.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.200
How did that not happen?

08:30.200 --> 08:30.640
I don't know.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.240
I'm actually kind of a little surprised.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.040
Come on, come on.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.840
Somebody come to my defense on this one.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.460
This should have happened.

08:36.460 --> 08:37.920
It's so obvious.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.360
It feels like something so easy for them to do.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.400
Maybe that's because I don't realize what's

08:43.400 --> 08:45.360
going on in the background, but this

08:45.360 --> 08:50.120
would be so amazing to allow so many people to get advantage

08:50.120 --> 08:54.000
of machines that are maybe more powerful than their own,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.260
but you can just use like it's almost like a thin client.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.560
It is, for sure.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.360
I could definitely see it in terms of distance to storage.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.960
That's where I think it gets used a lot on Amazon

09:04.960 --> 09:08.560
is you're doing something that's with a large data set,

09:08.560 --> 09:12.200
and that data set is on S3, or it's on Digital Ocean Spaces,

09:12.200 --> 09:13.560
or whatever it might be.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.640
And so instead of having to download it to a LAN somewhere

09:16.640 --> 09:19.880
and then process it on a desktop PC,

09:19.880 --> 09:22.360
people just get a cheap desktop PC,

09:22.360 --> 09:25.560
and then they remote into the virtual instance on Amazon,

09:25.560 --> 09:28.360
and it's essentially LAN access speeds to the data set

09:28.360 --> 09:32.040
and plus the CPU scalability of AWS.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.680
Well, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head a little

09:34.680 --> 09:36.200
bit, too, with Stadia.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
I mean, it's obvious that Google has the power

09:39.240 --> 09:42.640
to do these types of things, and it's really surprising

09:42.640 --> 09:46.240
that with Chrome OS and the popularity of Chromebooks

09:46.240 --> 09:51.320
that this didn't come true, at least with what Google is now

09:51.320 --> 09:52.480
offering with Stadia.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.320
Right.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.520
They could totally stream a Linux desktop, yeah.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.040
So there is Windows on Azure, a Windows desktop.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.040
Is it just that Linux is command line friendly?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.040
You don't need the GUI in the same sense?

10:02.040 --> 10:04.800
It seems to be a very viable product for Amazon.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.280
Like, it's a thing they're selling,

10:07.280 --> 10:08.880
and that's why I made this prediction,

10:08.880 --> 10:10.760
is I thought they would just sort of get

10:10.760 --> 10:12.320
emulated by other providers.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.160
Does Shadow count?

10:14.160 --> 10:16.160
Linus Tech Tips covered a service

10:16.160 --> 10:18.720
called Shadow that does, I mean, it's aimed at gaming,

10:18.720 --> 10:22.160
but it gives you a fully-fledged Windows desktop.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.840
I guess that's the problem here, isn't it?

10:23.840 --> 10:24.480
Really?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.200
That sounds kind of handy for people

10:26.200 --> 10:29.520
that don't want to bother with VMs or dual booting.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.720
That's kind of neat.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.480
No, no, I was really thinking it would

10:33.480 --> 10:34.680
be one of the major providers.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.600
I'll let the judge decide.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.640
What do you say, Judge?

10:36.640 --> 10:38.480
I'm afraid that it's a fail.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.440
I'll take it.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.280
Yeah, I'll take it.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.240
But why am I not surprised that Alex wants

10:45.240 --> 10:47.000
to self-host his own desktop?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.880
Come on, it's all about the cloud, man.

10:48.880 --> 10:49.600
Yeah, man.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.640
I've done this.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.760
Over the year, I did it.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.720
You know, I really, it was self-serving for me.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.840
I wanted to see it, because then I

10:54.840 --> 10:57.160
could travel with like the thinnest, smallest laptop

10:57.160 --> 11:00.160
possible and do all my work somewhere else.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.480
Aren't you already doing that?

11:02.480 --> 11:05.400
When you're traveling is when you have the worst internet.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.880
Not when I go see you, Alex.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.640
For now, yeah.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.680
Yeah, there's some spots where you can get pretty good

11:12.680 --> 11:15.200
at connectivity, but you would still want some local.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.080
We're just not quite there yet.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.480
How about another Westpane prediction already?

11:19.480 --> 11:25.720
I think this one, you may have had some insider knowledge

11:25.720 --> 11:27.120
on the direction things were going.

11:27.120 --> 11:27.280
Me?

11:27.280 --> 11:27.920
Never.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.680
Westpane makes a prediction about my desktop habits

11:30.680 --> 11:31.980
for 2019.

11:31.980 --> 11:36.120
I predict that in 2019, Chris is using the Gnome desktop

11:36.120 --> 11:40.440
on at least one production machine for 60 days or longer.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.560
I sounded confident.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.680
What do we consider a production machine?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.760
Because I will note, all of the studio machines

11:45.760 --> 11:47.640
are running plasma.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.560
However.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.200
Machines you do work on, not a test machine or a toy machine.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.000
OK.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.320
All right.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.200
That's what I intended.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.040
At 60 days or longer?

11:56.040 --> 11:57.400
Yeah, that definitely happened.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.000
Woo-hoo!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.640
I think that's a pretty easy one, Judge.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.200
Any issues there, Judge?

12:02.200 --> 12:02.720
No.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.040
I think that as long as it was on that office machine upstairs

12:06.040 --> 12:07.640
at least, then it counts.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.760
That's a win.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.600
Yeah, it feels good.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.680
That's probably my only one.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.600
I'm going to savor it.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.640
That's our first win right there.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.160
That's good.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.040
You're right.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.400
Not only did I run it on my workstation up in my office,

12:19.400 --> 12:21.160
which is where I prep many of the shows,

12:21.160 --> 12:24.800
but I ran it until just very recently on my ThinkPad

12:24.800 --> 12:25.920
on Fedora.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.760
And now my ThinkPad is still Fedora,

12:27.760 --> 12:31.440
but it is now Plasma, because that's how I do.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.080
But that was a good prediction, Wes.

12:33.080 --> 12:33.740
All right.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.320
Let's see if I got this one.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.960
I had a sense, and I think maybe I got this one right,

12:39.960 --> 12:43.520
that Clear Linux would become a bigger deal throughout 2019.

12:43.520 --> 12:48.360
2019, we'll see 50 publications about Clear Linux.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.720
The Clear Linux hype will grow, excluding articles

12:51.720 --> 12:55.320
from Ferronix and coverage from Linux Unplugged.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.680
I shouldn't have excluded Ferronix.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.720
I don't know why I did that.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.120
I was just feeling really bold, I guess.

13:00.120 --> 13:05.640
But I, at this time, had no idea that just a couple of months

13:05.640 --> 13:07.680
later, Brent and I would be in Portland.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.160
I was really impressed when we got to go down there

13:10.160 --> 13:13.720
and hear them talk about the product directly.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.760
It was super impressive.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.160
And I think you and I left there with some pretty big smiles

13:17.160 --> 13:17.680
on our faces.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.160
They're doing some pretty impressive stuff.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.760
Remind me what Clear Linux is again.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.720
That's Intel's Linux that has a couple of really unique things,

13:26.720 --> 13:29.760
other than just a whole suite of optimizations

13:29.760 --> 13:31.720
for the Intel platform.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.000
They also have a build system where

13:35.000 --> 13:38.600
you can revert to any build of the OS that's ever existed.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.120
They keep every version of every package, every build,

13:41.120 --> 13:42.640
online available.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.600
It takes terabytes and terabytes and terabytes of space.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.480
And it's extremely fast.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.840
And they have this concept of sort

13:49.840 --> 13:52.520
of creating your own recipe of Clear Linux,

13:52.520 --> 13:58.280
where when you roll it out, it's more bespoke to you

13:58.280 --> 14:00.320
using a central automation system.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.840
Right, it's still tied into the platform.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.600
You just get to have more knobs to turn.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.800
It's like solving the problem that Arch and Gentoo offer,

14:07.800 --> 14:10.280
while still being maintained by A, Intel,

14:10.280 --> 14:13.000
and B, still having a main reference to follow.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.920
It's a pretty unique idea for people

14:14.920 --> 14:17.320
that want super optimized server systems.

14:17.320 --> 14:21.160
And we ended up down there at their Intel campus

14:21.160 --> 14:26.960
at what became their first of a series of tours around the US

14:26.960 --> 14:31.880
to talk to different Linux user groups about Clear Linux.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.280
So I don't know.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.080
This is a tricky one, I think.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.580
There's another key word there that you forgot that they kept

14:37.580 --> 14:39.240
mentioning is statelessness.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.400
That was kind of the big umbrella

14:41.400 --> 14:42.640
that they were presenting.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Right, thank you, Brent.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.740
That was one of the big deals about Clear Linux

14:45.740 --> 14:48.200
is the idea that you could just wipe things out

14:48.200 --> 14:52.280
and it would be stateless from a config standpoint.

14:52.280 --> 14:58.440
And I think it's gotten a lot more recognition,

14:58.440 --> 15:00.800
but has it gotten people outside of Pharaonix writing about it?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.960
That single thing might have been what screwed me on this.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.240
I mean, there are a few here and there,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.320
but any of the searches I did was clearly

15:06.320 --> 15:07.560
dominated by Pharaonix.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.320
Yeah, and I read a lot of headlines every day,

15:09.320 --> 15:10.720
and I've been keeping an eye out.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.720
And apart from Pharaonix, there's

15:12.720 --> 15:14.360
been very little coverage of it.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.520
It feels like Michael Laravel is really ahead of the game

15:17.520 --> 15:18.320
on this.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.400
He's been following Clear Linux for what

15:20.400 --> 15:22.840
feels like two or three years at least.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.920
And every time he does any benchmarks, it always wins.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.200
And it does seem to be like a really solid distro,

15:30.200 --> 15:34.520
but for some reason, it just hasn't gained that popularity.

15:34.520 --> 15:40.520
I did see it mentioned on OMG Ubuntu this week, actually.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.760
Sweet.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.720
There's one.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.880
There's one.

15:43.880 --> 15:49.160
It was in a list of distributions to look for in 2020

15:49.160 --> 15:51.000
as voted by the readership.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.600
And most of the questions were, why is this in this list?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.440
And he defended it by saying, well,

15:56.440 --> 15:57.600
tons of people mentioned it.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.080
So I think maybe the hype is coming.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.320
Maybe.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.960
That was the same formula I was using, though,

16:03.960 --> 16:08.760
at the end of 2018, because when you learn about it,

16:08.760 --> 16:10.720
there are clear unique advantages.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.160
There's also strange things about it from the outside,

16:13.160 --> 16:14.560
controlled by Intel.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.040
Why do we need another distro?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
Why can't I just use X, Y, Z?

16:18.040 --> 16:19.200
Obviously.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.600
That's what's hard to predict, I guess.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.440
There are advantages, but we see that all the time.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.520
That doesn't mean anyone's really going to switch.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.080
And sometimes the advantages just are not enough, perhaps.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.360
But when you learn about it, you learn they are

16:29.360 --> 16:30.480
bringing something unique.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.160
I feel like it should have gotten more attention.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.820
Well, it should have got more attention,

16:36.820 --> 16:38.080
but unfortunately, it didn't.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.920
So this is a fail.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.080
Oh!

16:44.080 --> 16:46.080
I tried to help you, Chris.

16:46.080 --> 16:46.800
Thank you, Brent.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.360
I appreciate it.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.320
It's still a good trip.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.160
I enjoyed our time.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.960
And we got to stay at the Jupiter Hotel, which I get spammed

16:51.960 --> 16:54.200
from almost on a weekly basis.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.080
At least it's targeted.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.680
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.400
And we got a great photo.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.240
All right, well, maybe a Westpane failure

17:01.240 --> 17:03.200
will make me feel better.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.400
This, actually, I thought you were probably

17:06.400 --> 17:07.720
right about this one.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.080
And I really hoped you'd get it wrong.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.640
We just were really still processing

17:12.640 --> 17:16.200
what the IBM acquisition meant for Red Hat.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.240
And you were suspecting it might mean

17:19.240 --> 17:22.720
a fairly important open source project would get dropped.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.240
All right, I predict in 2019, Red Hat

17:25.240 --> 17:28.320
drops support, either just explicitly or key people

17:28.320 --> 17:30.200
leave, for one of these projects.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.520
Network Manager, PipeWire, Stratus, Bolt,

17:34.520 --> 17:37.720
or they just sort of delay any work on GTK4.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.560
It just doesn't ship.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.960
Now, I feel like that last part there is sort of a wild card.

17:43.960 --> 17:44.960
Yeah, true.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.040
Because it definitely did not ship.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.000
But I don't think it's stagnant, right?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.720
Yeah, I don't know if it stopped.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.920
And PipeWire didn't necessarily ship the way we expected.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.800
But they sort of changed course a bit and still are on track

17:57.800 --> 18:00.560
and have a release schedule and seem to be hitting it.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.000
I think the other test here is that none of our coverage

18:04.000 --> 18:05.800
over the year did we ask that question.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.280
We were concerned right after the merger for that, I think.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.080
But I don't remember really being concerned much this year

18:12.080 --> 18:12.960
about it.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.720
I think we need to cut live to our reporter

18:14.720 --> 18:17.400
on the ground in Raleigh.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.440
Alex, is Red Hat still there?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.240
Yes.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.040
Are you there, Alex?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.440
Does Red Hat still exist?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.120
And are the projects still alive?

18:24.120 --> 18:28.240
Well, Chris, I hate to say this, but the winds

18:28.240 --> 18:30.920
are coming in strong and the rain's beating down hard.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.120
But it's looking good over here.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.080
And back to the studio.

18:34.080 --> 18:40.600
I think that's a fail then.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.560
Thank goodness, right?

18:41.560 --> 18:43.440
Yeah, I'm happy on this one.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.680
Yeah, that very much is probably the one

18:45.680 --> 18:47.520
that I'm the most happy about us getting wrong.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.080
You know, the biggest news of this whole IBM Red Hat thing,

18:50.080 --> 18:52.200
and I'm going to be very careful because it obviously

18:52.200 --> 18:57.240
pays my mortgage here, is that nothing's really changed.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.520
They haven't done anything.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.200
The only thing I've seen is more collaboration

19:01.200 --> 19:02.360
between the two companies.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.920
So it's been a net positive so far as I've seen so far.

19:06.920 --> 19:11.240
We might be witnessing, and I'll check back in with me

19:11.240 --> 19:13.080
in about a year, but we might be witnessing

19:13.080 --> 19:17.200
a new era of mergers where not disturbing

19:17.200 --> 19:20.880
the community and the user base and the fans around the product

19:20.880 --> 19:23.400
is priority number one.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.800
And when you merge, you maintain what you've committed,

19:25.800 --> 19:29.120
because keeping your most loyal user base happy

19:29.120 --> 19:31.880
is what keeps value in the product.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.400
And if you start losing customers and users

19:34.400 --> 19:36.680
or listeners or whatever it might be,

19:36.680 --> 19:39.200
you end up devaluing the very thing you just

19:39.200 --> 19:40.600
spent all your money on.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.160
And so I think maybe we are witnessing

19:44.160 --> 19:47.520
a new era of mergers, but probably not.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.400
But it does seem like that's the case, Alex,

19:49.400 --> 19:53.040
from an observer standpoint.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.400
Good, all right.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.600
Are we ready for one of mine?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.120
You ready?

19:56.120 --> 19:56.880
Oh, yeah.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.320
This is the one I have enjoyed all year long.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.640
Hopefully, I didn't mess it up in one of the details,

20:04.640 --> 20:06.560
but I think we've all been watching

20:06.560 --> 20:09.520
this one happen right in front of our very eyes.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.880
2019 will be the year of the web going dark mode,

20:12.880 --> 20:15.720
and a major property like Google.com or the New York

20:15.720 --> 20:19.760
Times will roll out to fanfare a dark mode.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.800
Now, Gmail has gone dark mode.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.640
Several Google products have gone dark mode,

20:23.640 --> 20:26.440
including YouTube now has a dark mode option.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.640
But the big things that I didn't include in there

20:28.640 --> 20:32.360
that I should have, iOS 13, all about dark mode.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.840
Android, all about the dark mode.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.400
Cassidy and his friends at the free desktop

20:38.400 --> 20:42.840
are pushing hard on a dark mode free desktop standard.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.120
In the meantime, every single application, even

20:45.120 --> 20:47.440
electron applications like Slack,

20:47.440 --> 20:50.200
are scrambling to implement dark mode.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.880
Dark mode, dark mode, dark mode.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.520
Web browser extensions have come out

20:53.520 --> 20:56.760
to enable dark mode for websites that don't have dark mode.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.040
Although we had those, we mentioned those last year.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.240
OK, all right.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.600
Very good, I'm sure we did.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.920
It was a thing, for sure.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.480
I think we need the judge on this one,

21:05.480 --> 21:07.520
because you were kind of specific at the end there.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.400
Stupid Chris.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.440
Yeah, I'm just looking at Google.com now,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.760
and it's blinding me with the bright white.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.480
And the New York Times, again, yeah, that's bright white.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.200
Oh, you're not, you are going to rob me of the dark mode.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.000
The way you were specific about it

21:21.000 --> 21:24.080
was that you said it was on the web.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.160
And OK, there are some web properties

21:26.160 --> 21:30.080
that have gone dark, but it's been much more about apps and.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.600
OSs, yeah.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.120
I did say properties like Google,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.600
which I did not specifically mean Google.com.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.560
And I think YouTube and Gmail.

21:38.560 --> 21:42.720
But I did also say something like the New York Times.

21:42.720 --> 21:47.080
I was pretty specific there, but also vague at the same time.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.440
I switched my telegram to dark mode.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.160
Does that count?

21:50.160 --> 21:50.680
Oh, yeah.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.640
Oh, everybody did.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.560
I mean, everybody that doesn't mind dark mode.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.960
There clearly has been people that have come out now

21:55.960 --> 21:57.760
this year that are like anti-dark mode.

21:57.760 --> 21:58.600
More power to them.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.800
Different things work for different people,

21:59.800 --> 22:00.920
so have at it.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.160
But I defer to the judge.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.320
Even though it clearly was the year of dark mode,

22:06.320 --> 22:08.240
I admit I was too specific.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.960
So it's judge discretion.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.120
I think that because he said properties like,

22:13.120 --> 22:15.200
I'm going to allow it, and it is a reluctant win.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.840
No way.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.160
I did not expect that.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.840
No way.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.160
I was totally braced for a total failure.

22:23.160 --> 22:23.760
All right.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.560
OK, I'll take it.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.320
I'll take it.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.160
You know what's funny is when you see a screenshot

22:27.160 --> 22:29.160
from Telegram, and they're not using dark mode,

22:29.160 --> 22:30.280
and you're thinking, what?

22:30.280 --> 22:31.200
What's wrong with you?

22:31.200 --> 22:31.680
I know.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.160
It really is something looking at screenshots just

22:34.160 --> 22:35.440
from a year ago.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.760
How many things have switched to dark mode?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.800
I was silly, but I was looking at screenshots

22:40.800 --> 22:43.120
at GNOME files this morning.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.560
As one does, reminiscent.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.280
I was going all the way back to when

22:47.280 --> 22:49.160
it was Nautilus built by Easel, and I

22:49.160 --> 22:50.800
was looking at the different iterations

22:50.800 --> 22:53.000
to see when things went away via screenshots.

22:53.000 --> 22:53.760
Oh, yeah.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.600
It was actually pretty interesting.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.240
That's great.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.880
And it's clear that in the last year,

22:57.880 --> 23:00.120
screenshots are all like dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.560
Everybody just went dark theme.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.720
It's been pretty intense.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.240
For those that don't like it, it probably

23:05.240 --> 23:06.600
hasn't been a great year.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.440
I feel bad for them.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.040
But thankfully, light themes are right.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.560
And most of the time, you get an option at least.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.640
Also, a lot of different platforms

23:15.640 --> 23:20.560
have introduced a night shift or color change mode

23:20.560 --> 23:24.600
for reducing blue light at night or full-on automatic night

23:24.600 --> 23:25.200
mode switching.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.560
My Vivaldi browser does that.

23:26.560 --> 23:26.840
Right.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.480
I mean, clearly, there's recognized

23:28.480 --> 23:30.920
that we're not going to get off of our devices before bed.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.800
So they're going to help a little bit.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.320
All right, Wes.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.520
Are you ready for your last prediction of the year?

23:35.520 --> 23:36.720
Lay it on me.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.360
I really, really hope this one's true.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.600
But I have a bad feeling.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.440
And we still, we've managed.

23:43.440 --> 23:44.720
We've pushed forward.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.760
In 2019, a Linux distribution older than three years

23:49.760 --> 23:54.040
will ship a pre-compiled ZFS Linux kernel module.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.720
Older than three years, you said?

23:55.720 --> 23:57.360
As in, the distro's been around for longer than three years?

23:57.360 --> 23:57.360
Right.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.200
We were trying to not let it have

23:59.200 --> 24:01.200
to be an established, legitimate distro, not

24:01.200 --> 24:02.760
some tiny new startup.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.000
OK, so?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And obviously, I guess it wasn't captured there.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.720
But having listened to the last year's episode,

24:09.720 --> 24:10.680
I wonder who doesn't care.

24:10.680 --> 24:10.920
Why?

24:10.920 --> 24:11.440
Why?

24:11.440 --> 24:12.760
Because that had already happened.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.960
This is like a new distro.

24:13.960 --> 24:14.720
Had it?

24:14.720 --> 24:15.320
Yeah.

24:15.320 --> 24:15.800
Really?

24:15.800 --> 24:17.120
Mm-hmm.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.040
It was experimental in 1804?

24:19.040 --> 24:19.600
Is that what?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.040
Well, they just had it in the kernel.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.680
It wasn't being used, necessarily.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.720
But you had access to the pre-compiled driver.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.640
I thought you got this.

24:25.640 --> 24:29.840
Because I was thinking 1910 was really Ubuntu ZFS moment.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.600
But you're right.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.280
They shipped the ability to use ZFS in 1804.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.160
They just didn't bake it into the installer.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.640
So I was really hoping that after them not getting sued

24:37.640 --> 24:39.880
this whole time, some other distribution might step up

24:39.880 --> 24:41.600
and also offer a pre-compiled.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.280
What the hell happened?

24:43.280 --> 24:45.840
Is everybody so chicken-ass that they won't do it?

24:45.840 --> 24:47.760
It seems like what everybody wants.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.920
There does seem to be demand.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.240
And BSD, in the meantime, is going

24:50.240 --> 24:51.960
to roll in and just deploy it everywhere.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.880
Yeah.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.440
It also could be, in part, because it

24:56.440 --> 25:02.280
is a legal gray area, A. And B, it's really not that hard.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.280
Yeah.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.920
ZFS on Linux is doing great.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.200
It's easy to get going.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.920
Basically, any distribution, you can get

25:07.920 --> 25:09.400
it going within 15 minutes.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.080
Remind me how long it takes to reboot

25:11.080 --> 25:14.560
that Arch server of yours?

25:14.560 --> 25:16.920
Next episode, we're going to do a live update in the episode

25:16.920 --> 25:17.440
just to see.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.680
So you'll find out.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.040
How long does it take?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.360
Well, the problem is those cards.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.800
The HBA cards take a long time to initialize, don't they?

25:24.800 --> 25:25.280
Yeah.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.560
So just, I'll tell you the answer,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.400
just enough to make you extremely anxious.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.120
That's how long it takes.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.760
That's a good answer.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.160
So, Judge, what do you say?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.480
Did Mr. Payne get this one, or is it a miss?

25:37.480 --> 25:38.800
I'm afraid it's a miss.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.280
So that's only one win each?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.040
It's not good odds.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.080
No shutout, though.

25:45.080 --> 25:45.760
That's true.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.320
I actually was braced for a full fail.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.720
Yeah, and you would have got half a point for clear Linux

25:50.720 --> 25:51.880
if we were counting.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.720
OK, that's all right.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.960
Yeah, half a point.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.600
Yeah, all right.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.720
So I thought what we could also do here

25:56.720 --> 25:59.000
is, since we're doing this as sort of an offline holiday

25:59.000 --> 26:01.400
special, sipping on our hot toddies,

26:01.400 --> 26:02.940
we don't have the Mumble Room with us.

26:02.940 --> 26:05.200
We miss them, big part of the show.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.200
It's just not the same.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.040
So we collected a few predictions

26:09.040 --> 26:12.600
that were kind of a sum of a couple of other,

26:12.600 --> 26:14.040
like a few along the same lines.

26:14.040 --> 26:14.520
You know what I'm saying?

26:14.520 --> 26:16.360
Like people that predicted essentially the same thing.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.760
But you did hire three people from the Mumble Room

26:18.760 --> 26:20.600
this year.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.720
Ha, ha, ha, that's true.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.560
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.480
We're just slowly hiring the Mumble Room.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.200
That way we're here all the time.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.240
It pays to be in the virtual lug.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.320
All right, so speaking of that virtual lug,

26:33.320 --> 26:37.240
Popey made a prediction about MacBooks

26:37.240 --> 26:39.680
that I heard echoed by a few other community members.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.320
Let's give this one a spin.

26:41.320 --> 26:45.240
In 2019, Apple will announce and launch

26:45.240 --> 26:47.680
a line of laptops called MacBook Air, which

26:47.680 --> 26:52.120
will feature ARM-based processors and no x86 processors.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.640
Wow.

26:53.640 --> 26:57.280
Well, as our resident Apple guru there, Chris, did that happen?

26:57.280 --> 27:00.600
Hold on, let me check my backpack of MacBooks here,

27:00.600 --> 27:01.080
Wes.

27:01.080 --> 27:07.560
Let's see, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.960
I got a lot.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.440
Yeah, they're all x86 there, Wes.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.720
It's a very specific prediction, though,

27:12.720 --> 27:15.560
because the MacBook Air is an existing product line.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.920
I think they'd probably, if they're going to switch to ARM,

27:17.920 --> 27:20.840
come up with some new product line.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.040
Yeah, I think what was going on here

27:23.040 --> 27:25.880
was the iPad Pro had just been announced.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.920
And everybody was like, whoa, they really

27:27.920 --> 27:29.640
put a lot of performance into a tablet.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.560
That actually could go into a laptop.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.160
So then the foregone conclusion was

27:34.160 --> 27:37.800
if they were going to move an existing product line to ARM,

27:37.800 --> 27:41.200
they'd probably start at the most portable battery

27:41.200 --> 27:43.640
conscious line, which would be the Air.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.080
And so I think Popeye's line of thinking was just

27:46.080 --> 27:48.860
a whole new generation of Air MacBooks would land,

27:48.860 --> 27:52.480
and they'd feature their in-house ARM processors.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.480
A lot of people were thinking that at the time.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.400
At the end of 2020, what they've ended up doing

27:56.400 --> 28:00.720
is shipping a massive x86 monster called the Mac Pro.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.400
Ironically, it's the exact opposite.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.680
Apple have had a really killer last quarter

28:04.680 --> 28:06.560
to their Pro customers, haven't they?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.320
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Pro.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.400
Yeah, they seem like they're doing a much better

28:11.400 --> 28:14.000
job with the hardware than they were this time a year ago.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.240
It's still very locked down, still extremely expensive,

28:17.240 --> 28:19.080
and I think Mac OS is limiting.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.040
But as far as responding to what Pro users want

28:22.040 --> 28:23.720
from a hardware platform, I think

28:23.720 --> 28:24.680
they're doing a lot better.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.880
Yeah, Pro users definitely want to spend $400

28:26.880 --> 28:27.880
for a set of whales.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.240
Yeah, no doubt.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.560
And don't forget $1,000 on a monitor stand.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.200
Yeah.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.960
I think it was right, though, for them

28:33.960 --> 28:38.360
to announce a new Mac Pro just because there

28:38.360 --> 28:41.800
was such a demand for it after the trash can failure

28:41.800 --> 28:43.120
that they had.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.700
They had to reinvent themselves and provide something

28:45.700 --> 28:48.680
that Pro-level users would want to use.

28:48.680 --> 28:55.120
But yeah, at $1,000 stand for a display and $400 wheels,

28:55.120 --> 28:58.320
I could literally buy four tires for my small pickup

28:58.320 --> 29:01.120
truck for the price of the wheels of the MacBook Pro

29:01.120 --> 29:02.140
or the Mac Pro.

29:02.140 --> 29:02.760
No kidding.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.600
I went out Christmas shopping, and I

29:04.600 --> 29:08.080
was looking at artisan furniture just

29:08.080 --> 29:09.520
because there's this great store in a local town

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
where this guy, his whole life is making

29:11.520 --> 29:13.520
this beautiful wood furniture.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.000
And so we just go in there to gawk at it

29:15.000 --> 29:16.440
because it's so gorgeous.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.920
Handcrafted furniture for less money

29:18.920 --> 29:20.000
than one of these Mac Pros.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.360
I'm going to need the address of that after the show.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.200
Now, let me tell you something.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.200
We make fun of it, but I actually

29:26.200 --> 29:28.760
think it's a pretty decent value when

29:28.760 --> 29:31.560
you get towards the higher end of the configuration,

29:31.560 --> 29:34.840
excluding the monitor, excluding the wheels, obviously.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.600
But a couple of things Apple has done here

29:37.600 --> 29:41.320
is they've shipped a machine with a metric ton

29:41.320 --> 29:42.940
of open RAM slots.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.360
You can actually put third party GPUs.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.780
They even included the power headers

29:46.780 --> 29:49.040
so you can properly power them.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.120
I mean, they've really made something

29:51.120 --> 29:53.560
that is a decent product.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.800
It's built well.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.320
It's specced well.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.480
It's extremely expensive.

29:57.480 --> 29:57.960
But let's say.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.080
If you're in the market for a computer that

30:00.080 --> 30:03.080
costs as much as a car and is that powerful, you're right.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.280
I mean, it delivers on that.

30:04.280 --> 30:09.080
iFixit rated it as their most repairable computer in years.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.840
Yeah, and it's silent.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.280
Even under massive load, it's silent.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.840
Have you been watching all the YouTubers that got sent them,

30:16.840 --> 30:21.620
like Justine and Linus Tech Tips just bought one, apparently.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.920
But also, Jonathan Morrison, he has

30:23.920 --> 30:27.120
been doing a lot of tests with the afterburner stuff.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.720
He's done a bunch of really cool videos

30:28.720 --> 30:31.080
around audio editing, which I know you've watched.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.720
I haven't seen anyone try and install Linux on it yet, though.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.400
So this is where I was going to go with this.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.160
That's why we're talking about this.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.800
Let's just accept a couple of premises.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.080
Number one, let's just say whatever employer you have,

30:43.080 --> 30:45.920
whatever work, quote unquote, is paying for this machine.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.240
So it's not coming out of your personal pocket.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.040
And work, quote unquote, comes to you and says,

30:51.040 --> 30:55.760
all right, Westpain, you can have a Thalia workstation

30:55.760 --> 30:57.560
or a Mac Pro workstation.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.520
And also, as part of this conversation,

31:00.520 --> 31:05.640
let's just say Linux is running on the Mac Pro at this point.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.640
Which would you choose?

31:06.640 --> 31:08.320
That would be a tough call.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.160
I mean, I'd have to go spend some time sort of playing

31:10.160 --> 31:11.000
with the configurations.

31:11.000 --> 31:11.700
But you're right.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.280
I mean, if it ran Linux well, I don't

31:14.280 --> 31:17.040
see why I wouldn't have the Mac Pro as a contender.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.680
Yeah, I think that's it.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.520
What about you, Alex?

31:20.520 --> 31:22.440
Red Hat comes to you and they say,

31:22.440 --> 31:23.840
we're going to buy you a workstation.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.720
You can have this configuration of Thalia.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.680
You can have this configuration of Mac Pro.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.880
They're both pretty nice.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.400
They're both going to run Linux equally well,

31:30.400 --> 31:31.740
which obviously is not the case.

31:31.740 --> 31:34.920
But just for the sake of this conversation.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.560
I don't know.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.060
I mean.

31:36.060 --> 31:36.900
Can it dual boot?

31:36.900 --> 31:38.080
That's your question.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.040
Well, see, I try to look at things

31:40.040 --> 31:41.760
from a pragmatic standpoint.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.800
Can it run the Adobe Suite for all my personal photography,

31:45.800 --> 31:47.800
drone footage editing needs?

31:47.800 --> 31:51.280
Can it do pass-through of a graphics card

31:51.280 --> 31:52.920
and that kind of stuff?

31:52.920 --> 31:58.280
I settle on a nice system at the moment that can do pass-through.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.360
A Linux system that can do pass-through, I don't know.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.680
Mac OS is kind of close, but there's

32:05.680 --> 32:07.440
no one operating system that fulfills

32:07.440 --> 32:09.000
every single one of my use cases.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.120
So I've just accepted long ago that I have to triple boot.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.480
What about you, Brent?

32:13.480 --> 32:16.720
If quote unquote, which is kind of funny situation for you,

32:16.720 --> 32:17.840
work came to you.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.560
That's me.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.280
I know that's why it's funny.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.400
But for the sake of argument, somebody came to you

32:21.400 --> 32:23.680
and said, we're going to get you a computer.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.780
I think that choice actually is really easy for me.

32:26.780 --> 32:30.680
I would choose Thalio 100 times out of 100.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.240
Really?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.240
Yeah.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.040
And the reason is that I'm totally

32:36.040 --> 32:41.520
OK to have slight performance hits or whatever

32:41.520 --> 32:44.760
if it means that I'm supporting a project or a business that

32:44.760 --> 32:47.560
is based on Linux.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.600
The stuff System76 is doing for Linux and the open source

32:51.600 --> 32:54.920
community is massive compared to what

32:54.920 --> 32:56.800
Apple has done recently, right?

32:56.800 --> 33:00.800
So I feel like those would be dollars that I would

33:00.800 --> 33:02.920
be happy to put their way.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.000
They're different.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.880
WebKit, Swift.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.120
I would say the scale, right?

33:06.120 --> 33:07.960
The proportion is better for System76.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.080
The area we're interested in too.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.320
All right, Joe, what about you?

33:11.320 --> 33:14.360
Audio production might be really nice on a Mac Pro.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.620
I think I would go for the Mac Pro just to check it out,

33:16.620 --> 33:18.040
just because I'm genuinely curious.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.680
I've seen a Thalio in the flesh, but I

33:20.680 --> 33:21.720
haven't seen the Mac Pro.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.640
So just out of curiosity, I'd go for that.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.320
Fair enough.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.280
Yeah, I think that would be an interesting experience,

33:26.280 --> 33:28.120
especially all the things you'd have to buy,

33:28.120 --> 33:29.640
different cables and whatnot.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.020
All right, Cheezy, you and me are the last here,

33:32.020 --> 33:34.640
because I feel like you and I have a similar conflict.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.280
Every now and then, it's nice to get After Effects or Photoshop

33:38.280 --> 33:39.640
for some work.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.320
You can get 95% of the work done on the Linux platform,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.320
but every now and then, there's somebody on the wider team

33:46.320 --> 33:49.000
that needs support, and that's an After Effects file.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.320
So what would you pick?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.160
And here's what's even harder for you,

33:52.160 --> 33:53.800
is you've been to System76.

33:53.800 --> 33:54.680
You've got a Thalio.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.880
You know how great it is.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.400
But somebody comes to you, and they say,

33:57.400 --> 33:59.520
you're going to have to tell Emma that you got the Mac Pro.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.200
Yeah, and Emma finds out, whatever your choice is,

34:01.200 --> 34:02.000
she finds out.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.080
What would you choose?

34:03.080 --> 34:05.320
You know, that's a really tough one.

34:05.320 --> 34:08.960
The reality, though, is as much as we talk about the repairability

34:08.960 --> 34:12.360
and the expandability of the new Mac Pro, which is,

34:12.360 --> 34:15.840
like Alex stated, probably the best when

34:15.840 --> 34:17.800
it comes to adding additional drives,

34:17.800 --> 34:22.160
adding additional graphics, card power, and things like that,

34:22.160 --> 34:24.080
the one thing that it doesn't have going for it

34:24.080 --> 34:25.840
that the Thalio does, in my opinion,

34:25.840 --> 34:28.360
is the Thalio is actually fully open.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.560
So all of the CAD files are there.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.640
If you wanted to make your own and you owned a laser cutter,

34:34.640 --> 34:35.200
you could.

34:35.200 --> 34:39.520
So as far as repairability, expandability,

34:39.520 --> 34:41.200
you're not going to get that from Apple.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.520
Ain't got nothing on the Thalio.

34:42.520 --> 34:43.480
Absolutely not.

34:43.480 --> 34:49.400
And not that I would necessarily want to with my Thalio,

34:49.400 --> 34:53.840
but if I did need access to the Adobe Suite,

34:53.840 --> 34:55.920
I could always dual boot the Thalio,

34:55.920 --> 34:58.640
though I feel that would just taint the Thalio

34:58.640 --> 35:00.000
and make it a little dirty.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.460
Your buddy Alex would probably help

35:01.460 --> 35:03.960
you set up some pass-through VM action if you ever needed it.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.760
Absolutely.

35:04.760 --> 35:10.040
But you know, that being said, I'm fine working on a MacBook.

35:10.040 --> 35:14.520
I don't produce 8K movies.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.680
So I don't need this ridiculous display.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.640
I don't need the power that one might

35:20.640 --> 35:22.840
need for rendering out video like that

35:22.840 --> 35:24.520
or doing anything like that.

35:24.520 --> 35:29.280
So to me, the MacBook still works fine for my needs.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.840
Maybe in the future, if they drive down

35:31.840 --> 35:35.080
the price from the maxed out Mac Pro, which I think

35:35.080 --> 35:39.800
was like $56,000, $57,000, I might consider it.

35:39.800 --> 35:45.080
But for me, and along the same lines with Brent,

35:45.080 --> 35:47.600
I'm happy to support System76.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.060
They do good work, and all the work they do,

35:50.060 --> 35:52.880
they throw it out there for everyone to grab onto

35:52.880 --> 35:55.120
and improve and make it better.

35:55.120 --> 36:00.280
So I think going forward, we'll see new Thalios, better Thalios,

36:00.280 --> 36:02.840
and I'm anxious to see what the community ends up

36:02.840 --> 36:04.100
coming up with too.

36:04.100 --> 36:07.200
I kind of see it a similar way.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.440
The power of that Mac Pro is clearly

36:10.440 --> 36:12.440
for people that are in the industry of creating

36:12.440 --> 36:15.680
very high resolution video, not an area I'm into.

36:15.680 --> 36:18.160
Even if I was making 1080p videos for YouTube,

36:18.160 --> 36:19.280
it'd be too much.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.520
It would be way too much.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.880
And I've got a really nice system upstairs

36:22.880 --> 36:25.280
that I barely even take full advantage of today.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.720
I'm just not there.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.400
And I noticed now in comparison, the Thalio

36:29.400 --> 36:31.280
looks like a fantastic deal.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.480
I spec'd out a Thalio last night.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.040
Not that I've been comparing them,

36:35.040 --> 36:39.100
but I spec'd out one last night, and it was like $4,300.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.280
And it was like multiple drives, nice GPU,

36:42.280 --> 36:46.520
upgraded CPU, and that's cheap.

36:46.520 --> 36:50.480
That's cheaper than the starting price of the cheapest Mac Pro.

36:50.480 --> 36:54.000
But the reason why I wanted to have this conversation

36:54.000 --> 36:57.560
is as they continue to improve their hardware,

36:57.560 --> 36:59.960
I think more people will be asking themselves

36:59.960 --> 37:03.500
that question as they get around to buying their next computer.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.560
If Apple is able to maintain decent hardware,

37:06.560 --> 37:08.840
even if it's a few select models in the line,

37:08.840 --> 37:12.720
the rest are all kind of sleepers, stinkers, I guess.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.200
If Apple is able to maintain this Pro line, the iMac Pro,

37:15.200 --> 37:19.080
the MacBook Pro 16-inch, maybe a Mac Mini Pro,

37:19.080 --> 37:22.360
I think it will cause more consternation in the community

37:22.360 --> 37:23.040
trying to decide.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.920
Because right now, you kind of just

37:24.920 --> 37:26.460
were tapped out with their hardware.

37:26.460 --> 37:29.520
If you wanted a Mac that could run Mac OS

37:29.520 --> 37:31.880
and it was an official Apple box, it wasn't a Hackintosh,

37:31.880 --> 37:33.600
you just didn't have a lot of options in terms of anything

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
that was all that good.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.660
Easy answer now.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.000
You have the FIO.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.200
You buy the Dune Pro case off of IndieGoGo,

37:40.200 --> 37:42.820
the clone case that the Verge covered.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.520
And then just whack a couple of Xeons in there

37:44.520 --> 37:45.400
and you're good to go.

37:45.400 --> 37:45.900
Boom.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.000
I like it.

37:47.000 --> 37:47.860
OK.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.680
How about we get to another kind of common prediction

37:50.680 --> 37:54.560
from the community that Drifter put into terms.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.680
Everybody thought something would happen with SUSE.

37:58.680 --> 38:03.480
I think that in 2019, SUSE and TPG in specific

38:03.480 --> 38:05.240
will be in discussion with Microsoft

38:05.240 --> 38:06.720
in the purchase of SUSE.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.960
Microsoft purchasing SUSE.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.260
Now, SUSE may have gotten passed around again.

38:10.260 --> 38:11.460
I can't keep track anymore.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.460
I don't think anyone can.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.400
No, but I know it didn't get bought by Microsoft.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.560
What do you say, Judge?

38:16.560 --> 38:19.120
No, I'm afraid this is a fail.

38:23.120 --> 38:27.480
The Microsoft buys X, though, is like in the back

38:27.480 --> 38:28.560
of everyone's mind.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.640
It came up a lot last year.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.360
I mean, they're doing a lot with Linux.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.680
Might be handy to have a provider of it.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.240
Kind of along that same line, another one

38:36.240 --> 38:38.640
that was on people's minds a lot was something happening

38:38.640 --> 38:41.360
with Canonical, either a purchase or,

38:41.360 --> 38:43.440
bit and thought, perhaps, an IPO.

38:43.440 --> 38:48.520
So my prediction for 2019 is that Canonical will get IPO'd.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.360
Never happened.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.040
It did not.

38:50.040 --> 38:54.680
Canonical did kind of reform into a meaner, leaner beast

38:54.680 --> 39:04.960
and evolved that over 2019, but no IPO, no purchase.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.520
This might be our worst batting average ever.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.960
Is it because I made you all be so specific last time?

39:11.960 --> 39:13.280
Well, that doesn't help.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.800
You know, I mean, maybe it just means we got up our game

39:15.800 --> 39:16.480
a little bit.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.480
But Chris talked himself out of the dark mode one.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.800
You didn't make him do that.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.280
I feel like I did over-specify with that one.

39:23.280 --> 39:23.920
I really did.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.200
There's a couple.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.960
It's a trick to getting the level right there.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.640
Got to get the balance right.

39:27.640 --> 39:31.960
It really shows you how hard it is to nail down this community.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.920
I predict on the third Tuesday of April

39:33.920 --> 39:35.680
that Canonical will be acquired.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.920
Yeah, right.

39:36.920 --> 39:37.440
Very good.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.840
Well, you got to save that for next episode.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.360
Oh, yeah.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.640
We'll do our.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.120
Do you think that Seuss wasn't acquired

39:44.120 --> 39:47.520
because they were kind of passed around this last year?

39:47.520 --> 39:49.360
They weren't acquired by someone like Dell

39:49.360 --> 39:51.600
or some larger company similar?

39:51.600 --> 39:57.440
Because they're just not maybe as stable as Red Hat or Canonical?

39:57.440 --> 40:00.040
They just don't have a container play, I think.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.720
They're not sexy at the moment.

40:01.720 --> 40:02.640
Yeah, they've tried.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.000
They've definitely tried to make noise about their Kubernetes

40:05.000 --> 40:06.240
distribution.

40:06.240 --> 40:10.920
They've given it a real go, but it's not gaining any traction.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.280
It seems like it's a steady approach.

40:13.280 --> 40:17.320
The users that have a need to run Seuss are sticking around

40:17.320 --> 40:20.680
with it, but I don't really see them growing.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.800
You don't really see very many cloud providers that make it.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.160
There's more now.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.120
There are, yeah.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.920
There are more, but not many.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.600
And when they do offer it, it's usually

40:31.600 --> 40:35.920
not exactly the version of Seuss that you want.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.720
It's kind of a funny, like I've noticed it's

40:38.720 --> 40:43.520
a kind of mix of implementations.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.160
And I think that hasn't helped.

40:45.160 --> 40:48.200
It seems like it would turn off larger companies like Dell

40:48.200 --> 40:52.480
if this one company that they're potentially looking at acquiring

40:52.480 --> 40:55.680
has been bought and sold and invested in

40:55.680 --> 40:58.160
and different things have gone on throughout the year

40:58.160 --> 41:00.400
that they might take a step back from that

41:00.400 --> 41:02.560
and pause from making an acquisition like that

41:02.560 --> 41:05.880
just because, if it's been bought and sold

41:05.880 --> 41:09.320
and passed around, then something isn't working, right?

41:09.320 --> 41:12.880
Well, and isn't the reality, unfortunately, a little bit

41:12.880 --> 41:17.280
that the world really does kind of settle into Coke and Pepsi?

41:17.280 --> 41:20.840
iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Red Hat, Ubuntu.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.640
It's just easier, and it seems to naturally

41:22.640 --> 41:23.640
gravitate to those two.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.880
And then when you have markets that are outside the US

41:26.880 --> 41:29.400
and other areas, it can vary, obviously, a bit,

41:29.400 --> 41:31.360
but those areas aren't large enough

41:31.360 --> 41:32.780
where it really makes a big impact

41:32.780 --> 41:35.140
on the overall global conversation.

41:35.140 --> 41:37.480
Maybe we'll see something change in 2020,

41:37.480 --> 41:41.080
but that was devastating, guys.

41:41.080 --> 41:41.720
Let's pick it up.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.760
Let's do a bonus round of picks to make us feel better here

41:43.760 --> 41:44.720
because these are fun.

41:44.720 --> 41:53.400
Two really, really fun picks to impress the neighbors,

41:53.400 --> 41:57.520
your friends at work, and I don't know, maybe your spouse,

41:57.520 --> 42:00.600
with your Linux terminal, two really great picks.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.480
You found No More Secrets, Mr. Bacon.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.600
Tell me about this.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.880
You know, I'm a huge fan of these older hacker movies

42:06.880 --> 42:10.240
and even Mr. Robot that's out there today.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.560
But in 92, the Sneakers movie was released,

42:13.560 --> 42:15.140
which some of you may remember.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.600
Some of the young listeners out there

42:16.600 --> 42:19.880
may have no idea what I'm talking about.

42:19.880 --> 42:24.160
So No More Secrets, or NMS, is a command line tool

42:24.160 --> 42:28.720
that recreates the famous decryption effect that was

42:28.720 --> 42:30.760
used in the movie Sneakers.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.480
So if you just want to impress your fam,

42:33.480 --> 42:38.040
yeah, you could definitely throw this on and pipe NMS out

42:38.040 --> 42:41.800
to basically anything, an LS or anything else,

42:41.800 --> 42:45.120
and really look like a legitimate hacker,

42:45.120 --> 42:45.960
impress the fam.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.040
So do that.

42:47.040 --> 42:47.840
Check it out.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.960
Jeez, for those of us who may not

42:49.960 --> 42:52.080
know what you're talking about, could you give us

42:52.080 --> 42:54.440
a description of what's going on?

42:54.440 --> 42:56.240
What, you don't know, Brent?

42:56.240 --> 42:59.160
Brent, have you seen The Matrix?

42:59.160 --> 43:01.280
Alex and I watched it this month, actually.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.480
Yes, we did, Brent.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.600
And it was glorious.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.640
You two are so freaking cute.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.960
We watched it together.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.880
Have you seen the screensaver for Linux

43:11.880 --> 43:15.060
that is the Matrix-inspired screensaver?

43:15.060 --> 43:17.000
Yeah, that was real hot, like 10 years ago, right?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.560
Well, that's kind of where this is from.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.220
This is from the 90s, yeah.

43:20.220 --> 43:25.120
Imagine all of the text on the screen slowly decoding.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.960
It starts out as a total jumble of characters

43:27.960 --> 43:29.000
and weird symbols.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.040
And then over time, it all kind of

43:31.040 --> 43:32.600
renders into text on your screen.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.240
It's like a super cool, nerdy, as

43:35.240 --> 43:37.840
if this is how decoding worked, when really it's just happening

43:37.840 --> 43:39.280
in the background and then outputs.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.600
But in Hollywood, it happens in real time,

43:41.600 --> 43:43.480
and it all kind of comes in on the screen.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.360
That's what this does.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.560
I just fired it up right now.

43:45.560 --> 43:49.200
My CPUs jumped to 75%.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.880
Well, it's a lot of work to decrypt it.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.480
It is actually encrypting a little bit.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.960
There's actual encrypting happening.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.960
It's just doing it in a quick little buffer.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.320
Please tell me someone's tried to pipe in this into the old

43:58.320 --> 44:00.280
cat.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.920
I tried to run HTOP through it.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.360
Yeah, how did HTOP look?

44:03.360 --> 44:04.240
It just sat there.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.040
I think the interactive application's weirded out.

44:06.040 --> 44:09.040
It has to be something that's giving standard output.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.760
So you could make it work, but it was really cool.

44:11.760 --> 44:16.200
Now, there's another command line application

44:16.200 --> 44:17.240
along these lines.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.440
It's a little more effort to get going,

44:19.440 --> 44:21.600
although it's probably in the AR.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.300
And it's called Hollywood.

44:23.300 --> 44:26.080
This is made by Dustin Kirkland, formerly of Canonical.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.460
He made this back when he was at Canonical.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.600
And it actually has starred in television programs

44:31.600 --> 44:33.720
like NCIS and others.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.160
And there's a snap of it, too, a Hollywood snap.

44:36.160 --> 44:36.920
I don't know if it works anymore.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.560
It appears to be in the Ubuntu repos as well.

44:38.560 --> 44:39.760
Yeah, oh, really?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.020
Oh, that's so great.

44:42.020 --> 44:45.960
And this just sets up a totally fake,

44:45.960 --> 44:48.840
like you would see on television, terminal screen

44:48.840 --> 44:50.520
that makes it look like your computer is

44:50.520 --> 44:53.440
doing all kinds of cool stuff.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.720
So cool, in fact, that, like I mentioned, it ended up on TV.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.480
Because it does what it says.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.080
It's that good.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.040
Have you installed it?

45:00.040 --> 45:02.000
You should totally install it, Wes.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.600
I kind of want to install it, too,

45:03.600 --> 45:06.360
and just have it up on the screen so then when our,

45:06.360 --> 45:07.600
you know, like, uh.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.000
If anyone stops by the studio.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.560
Yeah, when any of our visitors stop by,

45:10.560 --> 45:12.480
we'll have this up on all of our studio screens.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.800
They'll be like, wow, that's a high-tech studio.

45:14.800 --> 45:15.920
So it's called Hollywood.

45:15.920 --> 45:16.760
Oh, yep, here we go.

45:16.760 --> 45:17.840
Got it going.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.360
Look at that.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.440
That is legitimately frickin' awesome.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.680
Look at how busy I am.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.640
You are doing so much stuff right now.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.360
You're a real multitasker, Wes Payne.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.240
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

45:29.240 --> 45:34.320
Linuxunplugged.com slash lucky334.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.480
Those are, you know, that's what Linux is for right there.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.600
Right there.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.080
Not all this other stuff.

45:40.080 --> 45:45.280
You know, I love that we still really love having fun.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.320
That's the spirit of Linux that I really appreciate.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.400
It's like we can get all this work done, obviously,

45:49.400 --> 45:51.040
and do some impressive stuff.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.080
But there's always a little hint of some fun in there.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.120
So I love it.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.640
It's kind of one of the first things you find, right,

45:56.640 --> 45:58.280
when you come to Linux, like, oh, look at all this weird

45:58.280 --> 46:00.120
stuff and all these repos I can find.

46:00.120 --> 46:00.960
It never stops.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.680
Can I give you a tip to zhuzh it up a little bit?

46:03.680 --> 46:07.800
Run those, those two picks, under cool retro term.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.640
Oh, yeah.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.760
Cool retro term and those picks together,

46:11.760 --> 46:13.560
full screen, you're welcome.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.760
That's all I have to say on that.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.520
And gentlemen, with that, it brings us

46:18.520 --> 46:21.240
to the end of this special holiday edition

46:21.240 --> 46:24.000
where we all walk away as sore losers.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.280
I guess we both got one right, Wes.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.920
We better practice our skills before we

46:27.920 --> 46:29.640
have to make the next set of predictions.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.920
Well, OK, better get practicing because that's

46:32.920 --> 46:34.480
coming up next, Wes.

46:34.480 --> 46:36.160
Thank you, everyone, so much for tuning in.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.480
Hope you had a great 2019.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.600
This show will continue on.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.120
We're not live, but there's still new episodes

46:42.120 --> 46:45.440
in the feeds at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

46:45.440 --> 46:46.640
Thanks so much for joining us.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.600
Check Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

46:48.600 --> 46:49.960
for when we are back.

46:49.960 --> 46:52.760
Why don't you make it a 2020 goal to join us?

46:52.760 --> 47:20.040
We'll see you in the future.

47:22.760 --> 47:33.520
Well, that stings a little bit.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.880
That's a humbling experience.

47:36.880 --> 47:37.880
You know what I really hope, man?

47:37.880 --> 47:41.640
I really hope that somebody takes this NMS and this Hollywood

47:41.640 --> 47:45.400
script and is working in IT and they run it

47:45.400 --> 47:48.760
and across the room, one of their co-workers notices

47:48.760 --> 47:51.320
and is like, what in the hell are they doing?

47:51.320 --> 47:53.880
Man, if I were in IT, I'd put this up on a virtual desktop,

47:53.880 --> 47:57.720
and whenever the old Bosque use one, I'd swap it.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.440
Do you remember an MSN messenger back in the day?

47:59.440 --> 48:01.320
Control space to hide all your windows.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.400
Boss mode's still a thing in a few apps, yeah.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.560
It still exists out there.

48:04.560 --> 48:08.000
I mean, how many different ways can you browse Reddit?

48:08.000 --> 48:25.320
Boss mode or parent mode, take your pick.
