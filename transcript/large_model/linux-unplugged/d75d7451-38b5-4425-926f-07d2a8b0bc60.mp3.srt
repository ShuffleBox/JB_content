1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Well, it's taken nearly 25 years,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,660
but the mainline Linux kernel this year

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,940
will finally be able to boot the Nintendo 64 game console.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,840
I know you've been waiting.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,680
It's about time.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm switching everything over.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,440
Yeah, I know you've been talking about building clusters

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,220
of N64 consoles.

9
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,040
I know how much you want to rock that 93 megahertz processor.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm just not sure what you're using it for.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,360
You'll be surprised when you find out.

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:32,720
Hello there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,480
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,280
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello, Wes.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Did you know that this episode's brought to you by a Cloud

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,600
Guru, the leader in hands-on learning?

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
That's why ECG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers,

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
and much more.

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,240
This is episode 390, which gave me a huge realization

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,160
that we are not that far away from 400

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,200
when we got started today.

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
It's a little scary.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,520
Threw me off my game a little bit.

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,240
But we have a lot to get to today.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,240
We're going to celebrate the anniversary of lwn.net,

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,600
a fantastic community resource.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,760
The founder will be joining us a little bit in the show

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
to talk about LWN, talk about the Linux kernel,

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
talk about development in the Linux kernel, and a lot more.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,800
But before we get there, we have a couple

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,040
of special items on the agenda.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,280
So to help us address those, I want to first introduce

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,480
and welcome back to the show someone brand new,

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,520
new kid on the street, never heard of him before.

38
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,160
His name's Drew.

39
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,920
Hello, Drew.

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
New kid on the street.

41
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,560
I've been here for years, sir.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,280
Welcome back.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,880
Welcome back.

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,800
It's good to have you.

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Doesn't show at all on your face.

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,720
And I know that you're in the middle of moving, too.

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
So I appreciate you taking a few minutes,

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,800
because moving life is worst life.

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Yeah, it just doesn't get worse.

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Maybe we can be a little bit of an escape for a bit from that.

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
Yeah, it's only 1,600 miles away.

52
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,960
So you know, I mean.

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Although I do dream at the end of it of Wes and I

54
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,640
coming out there and us doing a Linux

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,840
unplugged together in person.

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,360
Yes.

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,800
Oh, we got it.

58
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,840
That could be at the other end.

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,520
Let's do it.

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,240
Yeah.

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,120
Also, to help us dig through the community news, of course,

62
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,720
we have our virtual lug.

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Hello, hello.

65
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
Hello, everyone.

66
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,120
Hello.

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
Bienvenido.

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
Happy Sunday.

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
Yeah, this is a Sunday edition of the show,

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,280
just kind of unannounced.

71
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,600
We decided to record a little bit early this week.

72
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,920
And because it's a Sunday and Wes and I will be here all day

73
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,520
long, there may have been some gin snuck into our drinks.

74
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,520
And we don't normally drink during a show.

75
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,400
No, we don't.

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
But we also snuck some nachos in, so it's a special occasion.

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,320
It's like we've made a whole day out of it.

78
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,720
So we're sitting here on a Sunday.

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,080
We're hanging out with the virtual lug who

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,680
has their normal up lug session.

81
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,720
And we just kind of came in there at the end.

82
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
We'll talk more about that in housekeeping.

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
But first, I just want to get a couple of PSAs done,

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
because these are kind of important.

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,480
Number one, because I've talked about it a lot on this show,

86
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,320
of course, we address this in detail on Self-Hosted,

87
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,020
is Home Assistant has a second security vulnerability

88
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,520
that they've identified that needs patched and needs

89
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,740
to be patched pretty quickly.

90
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,040
And they're really trying to get the word out about this.

91
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,140
It's an issue that impacts third party custom integrations.

92
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,280
And it's a significant vulnerability.

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
And if you've already patched, this is a second wave.

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,680
I do some analysis in Self-Hosted,

95
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,560
but I thought probably should let people know.

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Yeah, allowed an attacker to steal any file

97
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,200
without logging in doesn't sound great.

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
Probably want to patch.

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,320
And the thing is, is they had some mitigations,

100
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,560
but the mitigation didn't go quite far enough.

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
And so this is supposed to address that.

102
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't have a lot more to add.

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,560
But this is, I think, to be expected.

104
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Home Assistant is a very large platform.

105
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
With a lot of integrations.

106
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,480
Yeah.

107
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,820
And that's what makes it so great at the same time.

108
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,900
Well, and it's worth mentioning that one

109
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,080
of the things affected by this is the Home Assistant

110
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,760
Community Store hacks.

111
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,400
So make sure you get that updated too.

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
Which I love.

113
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,760
And then there's another one.

114
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,720
We covered the initial development of this story

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,360
on Linux Action News.

116
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
And that was the Google announced

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,760
they were disabling Chromium Sync for Chromium

118
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,520
and Chromium-based browsers.

119
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,280
The typical Google Sync back end is going away.

120
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,920
And now what we are witnessing, since we

121
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,240
covered that on Linux Action News,

122
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,160
is the distributions and how they're all reacting

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
and what they're processing.

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,600
Do you leave it in even though you

125
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,900
know it's just going to end up being broken pretty soon?

126
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,080
Or do you take it out even though for the moment

127
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,200
it's still working?

128
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,280
That's a tough call.

129
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
Yeah, because end users are going

130
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,480
to think maybe something broke in the distro.

131
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,560
They're not going to know why.

132
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,960
It's not like they're following Google's Chromium development

133
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,520
blog.

134
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah, and the error message, I'm sure, will not explain.

135
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,960
Yeah, and this seems a little sticky.

136
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,520
I've been following the developments on this.

137
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
And one that's been really fascinating

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
is watching the Chromium maintainer for Fedora

139
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
kind of chew on this, going back and forth.

140
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Should we even bother with the effort

141
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,280
now of packaging this bastard of a browser

142
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,900
when they're doing this to us?

143
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,940
So if you're not familiar with the whole story,

144
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,280
like I mentioned, Google has announced

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,060
they're cutting off that sync access.

146
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,860
And that's what we're trying to react to now as a community.

147
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,440
Now, the thing that's kind of odd here

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,240
is that Google gave the builders of the Chromium distribution

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,520
packages access rights to this API back in 2013,

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,200
specifically so that they could have

151
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,560
open source builds of Chromium with near feature

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,700
parity of Chrome.

153
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,080
And now they're just taking it away for reasons.

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Tom Callaway did give a lot of thought

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,040
about whether it was even worth the effort

156
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,240
to continue maintaining the Chromium package in Fedora.

157
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,160
And that kind of says it right there, right?

158
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,720
I mean, it just doesn't feel second class

159
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,880
or even first class, second class.

160
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,840
Maybe it's a third class citizen at this point.

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
But it's almost not a proper browser,

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,200
despite all of the great browsing functionality

163
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,040
that's built into Chromium and how useful it has been to folks.

164
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,080
I feel like we could have a website that just did nothing

165
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,160
but track when the deal gets changed on us,

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,040
like an initial deal, how the deal is then further altered

167
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
and you will not complain.

168
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,880
That's all we need is how the deal was changed on us.

169
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,980
And to his credit, he's going to continue to package it

170
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,480
because some users won't even mind

171
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,240
that sync has been disabled.

172
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,280
And then in the short term, he'll just have to take the knock.

173
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,760
The people will assume it's because of something he did.

174
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,180
It's interesting, too, to watch Arch and Debian

175
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,680
have the same conversation and try

176
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,180
to decide what they're going to do.

177
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,280
Each distribution is really looking at it.

178
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
Some have already solved for this.

179
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,360
There's also kind of the universal package option here.

180
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,280
That's kind of the elephant in the room.

181
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,000
Perhaps, in the case of Fedora, perhaps Thomas

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,880
doesn't have to continue to package it

183
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
if eventually we got to the point

184
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,080
where Flat Hub was just turned on by default.

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
And when you searched in software,

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
software that's packaged like Chromium on Flat Hub

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,840
would just come up.

188
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,960
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

189
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,000
Colonel in our IRC asks, maybe this

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,200
is an opportunity for a syncing service back end

191
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
third party integration.

192
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Because if you think about it, you've just

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
been relying on Google for that.

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Maybe you wouldn't choose that.

195
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
It'd be neat if you could maybe use Microsoft or some even more

196
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
trusted third party.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,400
I agree.

198
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
And Josh, what do you think?

199
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
Is this essentially Google killing another product?

200
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Or is this because it's just shutting off like an API key,

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
is this not quite that equivalent?

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,120
It seems to be the way that all the other services go.

203
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,720
There's a little bit here, and then this little bit there,

204
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
and then you get the shutdown notice.

205
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Yeah.

206
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, it's a little bit of deal alteration.

207
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
It should be tracked.

208
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,960
I feel like this should be logged and tracked.

209
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
And then how the distributions have to deal with it.

210
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,680
That's an interesting aspect of open source.

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,520
Well, I'm just waiting for somebody to reboot XMarks.

212
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, yeah, XMarks, the original bookmark sync.

213
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
Oh, wow, that makes me nostalgic.

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,760
You were an XMarks user with Firefox

215
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
back in the day, I take it?

216
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, yeah, way back in the day, but absolutely.

217
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,640
Yeah.

218
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,800
OK, so let's talk about another deal that's getting changed.

219
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,520
And this time it's Elastic that's

220
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,480
making the changes to the licensing around Elastic search

221
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,840
and its dashboard product.

222
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,960
And they're changing it from essentially,

223
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,000
I think it was Apache version 2, to the server public license

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,320
and the Elastic server license, or just Elastic license.

225
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
And Amazon has reacted pretty significantly

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
with a really strongly worded blog

227
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
post, which we dissect in this week's Linux action news,

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
announcing that they are forking Elastic search.

229
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,880
And they have this whole rationale, of course.

230
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,560
And I kind of wanted to try to process this in a way that

231
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,000
was useful for the audience, even if they're not

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
a corporate enterprise user that needs Elastic search.

233
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,560
And I thought maybe we'd get a little bit of Drew's opinion

234
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,680
on this, because he's using it every day.

235
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,440
He's been deep diving at actually recently

236
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,000
at the day job.

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,160
And maybe we could start with an explanation

238
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,600
of what Elastic search is.

239
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Yeah, absolutely, because it's not

240
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,400
something that just totally makes sense

241
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,240
until you really get into it.

242
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
It is essentially, it's a database search tool

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,320
that's built upon Apache Lucene.

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,760
So it's similar in a lot of ways to Apache Solar, S-O-L-R.

245
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,440
But it is a product that allows you to ingest data,

246
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,400
sort it, and search it.

247
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,880
And where the Elastic part comes in

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,480
is that it scales both horizontally and vertically.

249
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,120
So you can either add more servers to it,

250
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,880
or you can add a bunch more storage on a particular node.

251
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,720
Whatever your use case is, whether you're

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
read-heavy or write-heavy, you have

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,680
options for how you want to build out the infrastructure.

254
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,000
And you can have clusters.

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
You can have distributed clusters.

256
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,400
You can have clusters that talk to other clusters.

257
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,640
Basically, it is extremely flexible ability to search.

258
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,880
And so what we're using it for is monitoring and log

259
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
aggregation.

260
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,000
More on the log aggregation than the monitoring right now,

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,040
because we have other monitoring solutions.

262
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,960
But what we can do is we can deploy these really lightweight

263
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,480
agents that just pull in all of the logs.

264
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,760
Sometimes I have to write custom parsers for them

265
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,760
if they're not in the standard format.

266
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,800
And then we get it all into Elastic.

267
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,240
And then I can use their dashboard software, Cabana,

268
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,880
which is actually what Grafana was originally forked from.

269
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,880
In order to visualize this data, create dashboards from it,

270
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,120
and really get it in a way that we can have,

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
like, say, a particular service that we can then

272
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,480
monitor the logs for in almost real time.

273
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,200
And so the deal that's been changed recently really

274
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,960
doesn't affect a deployment like yours, right, Drew?

275
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,480
Your use case isn't really impacted by the changes

276
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,840
Elastic has made here.

277
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,240
It's more directed at big shops like AWS.

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
Yeah, exactly.

279
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,200
It's directed at people who are taking the product

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,080
and then building out additional services on top of it,

281
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,600
repackaging it, and selling it as their own product,

282
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,360
like AWS Elasticsearch has been doing for years.

283
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
It's the same kind of thing that we've

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
seen companies like Redis really struggle with,

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,480
and then they try to relicense to avoid having somebody just

286
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,120
take their work and port it into something new

287
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,000
and start charging for it without giving anything back.

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,240
Now, AWS is saying, well, hold on.

289
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,920
We've been pushing code changes up and really contributing

290
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,320
to the project, and now we're being punished for it.

291
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,800
So why not just fork it and release our own product built

292
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
off of the latest version of Elastic,

293
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,600
which was still open source, and just have an open source fork?

294
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,240
Yeah, how do you feel about that, though?

295
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
Because it seems like it's going to perhaps,

296
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,480
because you're going to be using the original,

297
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
and then there'll be this other thing out there

298
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,720
in the industry that may over time change

299
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
from what you're using.

300
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
Yeah, I don't know.

301
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,600
I mean, time will tell.

302
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,920
It's a bit of a gamble either way, I think.

303
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,160
Will Elastic continue to really dominate the market?

304
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,360
All signs point to yes, because they're really deeply embedded

305
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,640
in enterprise, and so is Amazon's version.

306
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,760
So who knows which one's really going to come out on top.

307
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,280
Right.

308
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,320
I know a lot of places that essentially use it

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,420
for their user-facing website, too, to surface search results

310
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,720
and sort their content libraries and whatnot.

311
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,400
Absolutely.

312
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,720
You can't overstate how significantly popular

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
it's become.

314
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,020
Wes and I were looking at data for our Linux Action News

315
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,520
reporting, and you can just see explosive growth around 2018,

316
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,960
where it just kind of gets next level crazy.

317
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,240
Everyone's got an Elastic Stack cluster somewhere

318
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,040
on their premises.

319
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,800
I mean, that's too.

320
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,860
It's a $15 billion business for Elastic,

321
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,000
and that's not even counting all of the people who

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
are using it from other services that are hosting it.

323
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,680
I wonder, too, if that's part of all of this.

324
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,120
Obviously, the fact that Amazon is giant and sort of the default

325
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,660
makes things more complicated, because it's not sort of just

326
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,800
Elastic competing against a similar company.

327
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
They're competing against this behemoth.

328
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,720
And I don't know.

329
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
That's just a tough environment to exist in,

330
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,480
but maybe it doesn't make sense for a company who's

331
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,500
trying to operate on an open source basis

332
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,800
to necessarily be that large.

333
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,560
Like, is the value they're providing,

334
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,960
does that valuation make sense?

335
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,640
Or does it make sense to be a smaller, more steady state

336
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,520
sort of operation?

337
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
But in these days, everyone's trying to be the big unicorn

338
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
and make a whole bunch of money for your investors, right?

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,480
Right.

340
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,360
Everybody's got to make that VC money back.

341
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,960
And yeah, that's part of what's the pressure here,

342
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,160
is there's a lot of investors that put a lot of money

343
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,960
into these kinds of things, and they expect results.

344
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,440
But Neil, I think fundamentally, one of the issues

345
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,120
that Wes and I were struggling with is this license

346
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
looks a little concerning.

347
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,720
Yeah, so one of the bigger problems with this thing

348
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
is that the server-side public license, which if y'all

349
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
remember from a couple of years back,

350
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,000
this was actually created by the MongoDB folks

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,920
when they relicensed from the new Afero GPL version 3

352
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,180
as part of trying to drive more growth into their enterprise

353
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,500
commercial product.

354
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,720
The problem with the SSPL is, well,

355
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
aside from it not being classified

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,380
as an open source license, the open source initiative

357
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,040
has not deemed it as such.

358
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,240
Fedora particularly has a decent analysis

359
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,540
of why they consider it not an open source license,

360
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,160
particularly around it's hard to discern what the bounds are,

361
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,880
and it seems to be punishing towards certain field of use

362
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
and endeavors.

363
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,240
The issue is that for a lot of organizations,

364
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,800
they rely on fundamental assumptions

365
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,960
about how software consumption works for compliance

366
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,360
and making sure that to de-risk their usage of solutions

367
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
and infrastructure.

368
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,960
For example, anyone who's running GitLab Enterprise

369
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,320
is probably running an Elasticsearch system connected

370
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,160
to it.

371
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,080
And there's open questions about that combination

372
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,840
if you use Elasticsearch's version of Elasticsearch

373
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,440
with this license change.

374
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,200
And those are the sorts of things

375
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
where it becomes extremely difficult to say,

376
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,040
we can do this.

377
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,600
It becomes a very uncomfortable question

378
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,760
because Elastic is able to do this because they've become

379
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,600
so dominant in this particular space.

380
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,960
They essentially forked away from the Apache multi-vendor

381
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,280
approach for a single-vendor, very opinionated variant

382
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,040
of Lucene.

383
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,040
And in some ways, because of some sort of like,

384
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,120
what's it called?

385
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
Precedent setting.

386
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah, yeah, trend setting and that sort of thing.

387
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
And this is the negative impact of that.

388
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,560
It's very easy for something to turn dominant,

389
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,040
and then everyone is screwed.

390
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,400
And people have gotten very comfortable with doing this

391
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,920
because with open-source software,

392
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,240
when you change the deal, you have another option out.

393
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,960
With the MongoDB thing, nobody felt

394
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,800
that it was worth exercising that option,

395
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,240
so it just kind of rotted and died out.

396
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,720
But with Elasticsearch, because it's so hugely dominant,

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
AWS basically had no choice.

398
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
They had to fork the whole project

399
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,080
because they have a product that they

400
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
have to serve to their customers, lots of people

401
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,480
relied on it, and it's going to be

402
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,320
painful for everything that was relying on Elasticsearch's

403
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
proprietary API, because that's what it is.

404
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,200
It's a proprietary solution now, to move to an open platform

405
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
such as Apache Solar.

406
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,920
Really honest to God, I really hope what this does

407
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
is it causes the industry to re-examine their assumptions

408
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,120
and start moving towards true open-source solutions

409
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,880
like Apache Solar.

410
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,320
But I am not confident that that will happen.

411
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,800
And in the meantime, Amazon Web Services has stepped up,

412
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,640
and they're planning on setting up a proper open-source project

413
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,720
with real governance and that sort of thing.

414
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,520
And they have customers that are going

415
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
to continue to require this.

416
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,600
And this is kind of the meta story, isn't it, Drew?

417
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,680
Is that you have these enterprise-type open-source

418
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,720
projects, and then they get to this massive size,

419
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,400
and they run into this iceberg, essentially.

420
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,080
I mean, what we're kind of seeing between them, Redis,

422
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,000
MongoDB, and anybody else who's kind of hit this critical mass

423
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
and realized that another company is just

424
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,800
eating their lunch, is that we're

425
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,880
going to see how this all shakes out over the next few years.

426
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,880
And if this becomes a tenable business model for companies

427
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
that started as very open-source and moved

428
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,800
to kind of half open, half proprietary, something

429
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,680
nebulous in the middle, will that allow them to survive?

430
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,520
Or will other open-source solutions

431
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,280
come in and take their place?

432
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,840
Or will they move even further towards being

433
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
completely proprietary?

434
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,080
I don't know.

435
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,000
And I don't know that there's one good answer here.

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,040
But I think in a lot of ways, this

437
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,520
is going to be a trial balloon for the shape of things

438
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,000
to come.

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,840
Linoad.com slash unplugged.

440
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
Go there and receive a $100 60-day credit

441
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,160
towards your new account.

442
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,000
Linoad is the largest independent cloud

443
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,160
for developers.

444
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Simplify your infrastructure.

445
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Go check out Linoad.

446
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,800
And with that $100 credit, you can make some distance.

447
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,280
It's pretty significant.

448
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,520
They have native SSD storage, 40-gigabit connections,

449
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,760
and a new revamped, easy-to-use cloud manager.

450
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Linoad has really done a good job here

451
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,280
of making it easy to use but not too many clicks away

452
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,840
to get to the real power user features.

453
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,240
And Linoad costs 30% to 50% less than major cloud providers

454
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,760
like AWS.

455
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,480
You receive a balance of technology and performance

456
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,280
in a package that's really straightforward.

457
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
They have 11 data centers worldwide

458
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,480
so you can get close to your clients

459
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
or your customer or yourself.

460
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,520
And they have built-in monitoring tools

461
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
that give you an idea of what your rig's doing.

462
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
I knew probably time to up the RAM in our matrix server.

463
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
It's just by watching my Linoad charts.

464
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,200
And it made it really, really simple to do that.

465
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,400
And tons of flexibility in the post-server-already-setup

466
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,880
upgrade options.

467
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
I was really impressed with that.

468
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
I also was able to make an image from one of my disks

469
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
and then move that between my systems

470
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,640
to make setting up some things really simple.

471
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Also, see if they're hiring.

472
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
They often have job openings.

473
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,280
You go to linoad.com slash careers

474
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,160
because if you're listening to this show,

475
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
you might be a good fit for Linoad.

476
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
They love Linux.

477
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,480
And knowing that you listen to a Linux podcast,

478
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,720
probably going to make you an appealing candidate.

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
Linoad is our cloud hosting provider.

480
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,040
It hosts all of our new infrastructure

481
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
that we've built for JB 3.0.

482
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,960
Recently set up some PeerTube instances.

483
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,680
And it's like having our own Jupiter broadcasting YouTube

484
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,720
in a box.

485
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,200
I love it.

486
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,120
You should try it out.

487
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,760
linoad.com slash unplug.

488
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,040
You support the show and you get a $100 60-day credit.

489
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm serious.

490
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,520
Isn't that great?

491
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,680
linoad.com slash unplugged.

492
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,800
Moving right along.

493
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,320
In fact, we just stormed in in the middle of a Luplug.

494
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,040
So why don't we do a little housekeeping?

495
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,120
And Minimac, what do you think?

496
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,160
Successful Luplug this Sunday?

497
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,000
Very, very, very successful Luplug.

498
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,120
I want to thank Justin that had the idea for our accessibility

499
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,320
talk, and also Daniel Ferre who came there here.

500
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,400
And we had a good talk over an hour.

501
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,440
And we also had Sean, another user that contributed a long

502
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,520
time and shared his experiences.

503
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,200
It was a really good talk, and I hope

504
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,960
you can listen to it at the end of the month.

505
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,240
Yeah, in the near future, the audio should be available.

506
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,400
We'll try to do an update here in housekeeping.

507
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,040
Also, check out the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed.

508
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah, we got one feed to rule them all.

509
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,400
Things are in the works.

510
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,040
You never know.

511
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,160
You don't want to miss something new.

512
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
So go get our all shows feed right there

513
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

514
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Westpane, do you have anything to throw in the housekeeping

515
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,920
before we go?

516
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
It's your last chance for some big moment.

517
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,040
Oh, sounds like there's an upcoming Jellyfin release

518
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
we should be aware of.

519
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,240
Look at you.

520
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,720
Look at you.

521
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
You got something.

522
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,280
Yeah, that's right.

523
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
I guess there's a release candidate out there,

524
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
eh, Colonel?

525
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,040
Yeah, so the Jellyfin release candidate three is out.

526
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,680
And they've made it much easier for people on RPM distros

527
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,120
to get that installed.

528
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,920
They've clarified and restructured their repositories

529
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,480
to allow for that.

530
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,400
In addition, they've switched from the standard.NET

531
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,040
over to.NET Core, which standardizes the.NET

532
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,280
implementation across all the platforms.

533
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,800
That is fantastic.

534
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,480
Some big news.

535
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,280
So if you're interested, maybe go give that a try,

536
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,240
see if you find any bugs, and get them reported.

537
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,720
Earlier, I had a chance to sit down

538
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,240
with the executive editor of lwn.net, which

539
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,280
has been a fantastic resource for as long

540
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,600
as I've been using Linux.

541
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
And they're hitting a major milestone.

542
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,360
So Jonathan Corbett came on the show,

543
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,960
and we talked about that and a lot more.

544
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
I want to welcome Jonathan to the show.

545
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,160
I think lwn.net is known by our audience

546
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,240
as one of the most trusted news outlets in open source.

547
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,800
So it's a treat to talk to you.

548
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,320
Well, thank you.

549
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,520
It's a pleasure to be here.

550
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,840
And kind of the pretense or excuse to get you on the show

551
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,160
was that there's an anniversary coming up for LWN.

552
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,880
So how many years will that make it?

553
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,520
That will make it 23 years.

554
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,080
We first published in January of 1998.

555
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Congratulations.

556
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,520
Wow.

557
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,920
And so Jupiter Broadcasting is about 12 years old.

558
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,440
And I was kind of going over the history of LWN

559
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,480
before the show started.

560
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,880
And I noticed, and I don't really know the back story

561
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,720
much, but I think we have a similar kind of back story

562
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,960
where you were independent for many years, I think,

563
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,920
then acquired, and then deacquired,

564
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
and now independent again.

565
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
Can you tell me the history of that?

566
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Yeah.

567
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
We were independent just for a few years.

568
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,600
We were actually acquired right at the very end of the.com

569
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,400
boom, which was an interesting story in its own right,

570
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
actually.

571
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,760
It was easy to be acquired in those days

572
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,240
if you had Linux in your name or your activity anywhere.

573
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,640
But then, of course, the.com crash happened, and that ended.

574
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,040
And the folks who acquired us, a company called Two Cows,

575
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,120
found that they didn't have a way to make money from us

576
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,840
anymore, if they ever did.

577
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,240
And so they basically just gave it back to us

578
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,760
and let us continue on where we were before.

579
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,160
If I'm right, but please correct me if I'm wrong,

580
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,000
when you came back initially, you came back

581
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,480
as advertiser-based, but then eventually transitioned

582
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,600
to member-only after your readers said, do it, we'll pay.

583
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, I mean, advertising had been the intended model

584
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,160
sort of since the beginning, ever since we decided we could

585
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,520
maybe try to make a living with this newsletter we created.

586
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:54,240
And that, of course, also fell to pieces after the.com crash.

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,960
And it didn't take us all that long

588
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,840
after we were newly independent to realize that we just weren't

589
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,760
going to make that work at all.

590
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And we tried donations for a little bit,

591
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,920
and that brought in a few thousand dollars,

592
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,640
which isn't really enough to keep

593
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,720
a staff of several people going, trying to write this thing.

594
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,280
So we actually announced that we were shutting down,

595
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,000
at which point some of our readers said, well, you

596
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,560
idiots, why don't you try running a subscription model

597
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,120
before you do that, and we'll subscribe and keep you going.

598
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,800
So we made a try at that, and it has been

599
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,600
what has sustained us ever since.

600
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
That's remarkable, because I think

601
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,920
there's something kind of special about the type

602
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,640
of journalism you do.

603
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,040
Well, I want to ask you about this,

604
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,680
because the way LWN bills itself as news

605
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,280
from the source, which is just a brilliant tagline,

606
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,000
because you are getting it directly from the source,

607
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,880
but also you can read source code and get the news.

608
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,840
It feels like what LWN pioneered is,

609
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,160
I don't know if it's journalism or if it's

610
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,480
a contribution of some form.

611
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
What are your thoughts?

612
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,520
You know, we never really thought of it as journalism.

613
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,760
I never thought of it as that.

614
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,520
I thought of it as, initially, we

615
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,240
were spending a lot of time trying

616
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,000
to keep up with the kernel mailing list and all that,

617
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,520
because it was a whole hundred messages a day or something

618
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,680
in those days, and nobody could keep up with that.

619
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,880
And we were staying on top of it.

620
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,000
We were trying to launch a consulting company

621
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,960
and show the world how smart we were.

622
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,800
So we figured we could just sort of share

623
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,840
what we were learning as we kept up with the world

624
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,760
and attract attention and help the community in that way.

625
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,760
And it's always sort of been a community effort to us.

626
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,920
It's something that we've done from within the community

627
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,200
as a part of it, as opposed to coming in from the outside

628
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,040
and watching it.

629
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Right.

630
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,360
It feels to me like it may be, in a way,

631
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,400
I think I consume it as a form of journalism,

632
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,720
but it feels like, to me, in a way, it's also,

633
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,200
it's helping inform a community that has to make decisions.

634
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,680
So it is a contribution in that sense.

635
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,160
And the other thing that I think that really makes it special

636
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,080
is you yourself contribute to the kernel.

637
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,800
I believe you're the maintainer of documentation, right?

638
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
The document maintainer.

639
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
And also, I heard a rumor, maybe some drivers, too.

640
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,880
I've done various driver work.

641
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,680
I wrote the camera drivers for the One Laptop

642
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,480
per Child systems, among other things,

643
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,000
and various other bits and pieces over the years.

644
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,720
That's kind of special in a way, too,

645
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,040
to have somebody who can contribute in that way

646
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,440
and participate at events, but then also communicate it

647
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
to people who can consume the information

648
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,080
and then participate in the community.

649
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,520
And I know that also means that you've

650
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,640
done things in the past, like the kernel report,

651
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,120
and you've brought up concerns about maintainers not really

652
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,960
scaling with the number of just developers

653
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
that are contributing to Linux down,

654
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,280
the amount of contributions.

655
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,320
And you, being a maintainer yourself,

656
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,120
I was wondering if you see that, I mean, since last time I

657
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,160
saw you speak to that was probably 2018,

658
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm wondering if that situation has improved at all.

659
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,040
I think that's hard to say.

660
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,320
It varies depending on where you look within the kernel.

661
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,640
There's an increasing effort among maintainers

662
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,040
to delegate maintenance to a group

663
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,560
and to bring in backups and that sort of thing

664
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,760
and to try to spread that load out a little bit.

665
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,800
There is also some work going on to try

666
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,320
to separate the maintainer and the reviewer roles, where

667
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
maintainers really just become the people who herd the patches

668
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,400
and get them upstream, but aren't necessarily

669
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,680
the decision makers or the people who have to actually

670
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,480
review all those patches.

671
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
And by splitting those responsibilities,

672
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,560
it's hoped that we can bring more people in and spread

673
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,360
the work out a bit.

674
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,000
And I think that has worked fairly well

675
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,240
in some subsystems, less well in some others.

676
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,680
But things are being done in this regard,

677
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,600
and we haven't collapsed yet.

678
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,480
So there is hope there.

679
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,680
That is good to hear.

680
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,200
I would imagine it must be some of the more popular subsystems

681
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,680
more easily attract maintainers, and some

682
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,520
of the less popular or just well-known systems

683
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,760
probably lack them.

684
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Popularity in some sense, yeah.

685
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
It's a bit harder than that.

686
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,920
It's more a matter of where people

687
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,960
and where sponsoring companies see it as being their problem.

688
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,040
So I stepped up for documentation

689
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,800
because it's an area of interest to me.

690
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,880
But it has also languished for years

691
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200
because there's no company out there

692
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
that is making a living off of kernel documentation.

693
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,400
There's no company that really saw it

694
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,200
as being something that they needed to support to further

695
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,760
their own business goals.

696
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
So there are a lot of areas like that in the kernel

697
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
that kind of languish a bit, some of them

698
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,280
being fairly important areas.

699
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,920
A lot of hardware support, for example,

700
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,080
is very well-maintained because the company selling

701
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
that hardware wanted to be.

702
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Sure, that makes sense.

703
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,000
A lot of core kernel areas often tend

704
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,680
to hurt for maintainer effort, even though they're

705
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,560
some of the most important parts of the kernel.

706
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,080
I guess when you put it in that framework,

707
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,280
it totally makes sense to me.

708
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,840
So I wanted to ask you just about development in general.

709
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,200
You have followed this for a very long time.

710
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
We have a lot of some of the people

711
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,040
that started in the very early days still involved.

712
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,840
But is development shifting for the Linux kernel

713
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,800
in any significant way?

714
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
Or is it still kind of the standard way

715
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,640
it's been made over the years?

716
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,680
I saw I think you predicted that in the near-term future,

717
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
someone will be able to submit a patch to the kernel

718
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
without ever having to touch email.

719
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
Well, the way that we have done development, of course,

720
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,280
has changed quite a bit from really the first decade, where

721
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,520
it was just a matter of sending patches to Linux

722
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,600
and hoping that he did something with them

723
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,080
before deleting them from his inbox.

724
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,400
So we have changed quite a bit.

725
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,200
And that's continuing.

726
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,160
The kernel project can be said to lag

727
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,480
behind a lot of other projects in terms of the tools

728
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,600
that it uses, until it gets around to pioneering tools

729
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,200
that work on the scale of the kernel project, where

730
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,880
we have over 4,000 developers contributing something

731
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,520
on the order of 80,000, 90,000 patches every year.

732
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
You can't do that on GitHub, for example.

733
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,760
It won't scale to that at this point.

734
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,680
So we don't use tools like that.

735
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,960
We had the same problem with source code management systems

736
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,680
until BitKeeper showed how the source code could

737
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,080
be distributed amongst a whole lot of maintainers

738
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,160
and then get made that into free software

739
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,840
and truly available to the world.

740
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,800
And then not only did the kernel catch up

741
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,720
to other projects using source code management,

742
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,520
but we ended up actually leading the way for a while

743
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,720
and bringing out the source code management system

744
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,600
that now everybody else uses as well.

745
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,160
So I think that may well happen again with development models

746
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,040
that get away from the send your patches by email approach.

747
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,440
But there is really nothing else that scales

748
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,800
to what we need at this point.

749
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,360
There are people working on ideas,

750
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
and we'll see what happens.

751
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,880
It's going to be interesting to watch.

752
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,080
But for now, we're still sending patches by email.

753
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah, that definitely will be a fascinating development.

754
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,840
What would you guess is a timeline

755
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
for something like that?

756
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,600
Do you have any foggy guesses?

757
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,240
Well, I did predict that we might

758
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,320
see some sort of proof of concept stuff out there

759
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
this year.

760
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,440
And we've seen some increase in the development of tools

761
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,880
around patch submission and all that now that have already

762
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,400
helped quite a bit.

763
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,240
But within the next few years, I don't

764
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
see things changing a whole lot.

765
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,480
But with luck, we'll see the tools start to take shape.

766
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Yeah, well, while we're looking ahead,

767
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
I wouldn't mind shifting back to LWN a bit.

768
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,240
And who cares what you see the next couple of years?

769
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,040
Nothing dramatic, but just the semi-near-term future for LWN.

770
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,840
Do you see anything shifting or anything new coming down

771
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,480
the horizon or thoughts in that regard?

772
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,160
To a great extent, we'll keep on doing what we do, I suppose.

773
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,480
And I'm forever trying to bring in more staff

774
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,280
to do writing for us.

775
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,800
So if there are any listeners out there

776
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,720
who are looking to do our style of writing,

777
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,440
please do contact us.

778
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,000
And with that, I would like to perhaps expand our content

779
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,600
range and perhaps add more features to the site, which

780
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,840
is kind of languished for a bit and so on.

781
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,560
But in terms of the core of what we do,

782
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,840
which is reporting on the development community

783
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,480
for the development community, I don't really

784
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,720
see that changing much.

785
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,220
I think a lot of people will actually

786
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,640
be very glad to hear that.

787
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,360
I hope you guys can continue to publish for a very long time.

788
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm sure the audience would be interested in getting

789
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,200
in touch with you.

790
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,860
There's probably a few people motivated.

791
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,080
What's the best way for them to do that?

792
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,880
If you go to the LWN.net page, there's

793
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,080
a link right there that says write for us.

794
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,400
And it talks a bit about how we work

795
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,720
and what we're looking for and how to proceed.

796
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,680
Nice and simple, I suppose.

797
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,280
Well, I absolutely appreciate, Jonathan,

798
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,200
just all of the work you and the staff

799
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,520
have done at LWN over the years.

800
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,800
I've been a longtime member, a longtime reader.

801
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,120
And I think it's such a needed resource.

802
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,600
And over the years, since you started,

803
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,200
you've watched blogs take off like crazy, podcasts,

804
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,840
and YouTube.

805
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,880
And LWN feels like it's stayed true to itself

806
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
through all of that.

807
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,080
Were you ever pulled at all to try

808
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,000
to get in on any of these new kind of media thing

809
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,240
platforms that were going crazy at a particular time

810
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
or another?

811
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Oh, people suggest it, and we think about it.

812
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,520
And we've occasionally talked about maybe trying

813
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,760
to do a podcast or something like that.

814
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,920
But it's enough work just to do what we're doing now.

815
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,400
And we just haven't felt that we had the bandwidth

816
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
to try to take that on, too.

817
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,240
If we were to find somebody that we

818
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
can bring into staff who wanted to pursue such a thing,

819
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,480
we could consider it.

820
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,560
Yeah, I think there is a real needed place, too,

821
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,080
for really well-done, written material

822
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,320
that you can trust the source and the publication behind it.

823
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,520
I think since you've started until where we are now,

824
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,160
it's become more and more of a precious commodity.

825
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,760
So I salute you.

826
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,640
And of course, if you ever did want to get into podcasting,

827
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,520
your friends here at Jupiter Broadcasting

828
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,120
would be more than happy to help make that happen.

829
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,320
OK, that's good to know.

830
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,360
I will definitely keep that in mind.

831
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,160
Well, Jonathan, thanks for coming on the show.

832
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,840
All right, well, thank you very much.

833
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
It's been a pleasure.

834
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,880
It was a treat to chat with Jonathan.

835
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,840
LWN.net is a favorite resource of mine,

836
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,040
and I just wanted to help celebrate

837
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,200
their upcoming anniversary.

838
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
And you can check them out at LWN.net

839
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,320
if you haven't read it before.

840
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Go over there.

841
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Give them a read.

842
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,640
I think they have a really cool model where you can subscribe

843
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,200
and get the content right away, or you wait a little bit,

844
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,680
like a week, and then the content is available for free.

845
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,560
Yeah, it's really just a fantastic resource.

846
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,400
And if you love the nerdy stuff we're

847
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,240
talking about on this show, it's the next level.

848
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,920
odir.app, complete website monitoring from multiple locations.

849
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,840
They have broken link detection, mixed content as well,

850
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,800
advanced SSL certificate reporting, and more.

851
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,080
So visit odir.app and use promo code LINUX for a $10 discount on any plan.

852
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,160
Don't find out something's down by your users telling you it's down.

853
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,040
Be the first to know when your site is unavailable.

854
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,120
Odir has global uptime checking with servers worldwide

855
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,200
that will report on any problem as soon as it happens.

856
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,000
And they can go deep into your site.

857
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,640
They crawl and index your entire website,

858
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,960
and they'll detect a broken link and then intelligently notify you.

859
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,240
You can also monitor scheduled tasks and cron jobs

860
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,360
and find out if they haven't run at their scheduled time.

861
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,960
And odir is always monitoring the performance and speed

862
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,280
of your website over time.

863
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,760
They detect if something is suddenly slow

864
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,080
or watch if there's been a change in performance

865
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,040
over a period of time.

866
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,860
But one of the things that I think really makes odir stand out

867
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,400
is their API.

868
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,760
You can configure everything about the application

869
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,680
through their API.

870
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
Everything you see in the dashboard

871
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,640
can be controlled with their easy-to-use RESTful API.

872
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,640
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API,

873
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,880
immediately available in the dashboard.

874
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
odir is a monitoring solution that embraces automation.

875
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,000
It gives you the tools to build your infrastructure by code.

876
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,040
And its comprehensive API means integrations

877
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,340
are simple and straightforward.

878
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,680
There's already a ton you can take advantage of just out of the box.

879
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,000
It's monitoring that's done right.

880
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,600
It's a modern solution, and it has a comprehensive API

881
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,560
with kick-ass documentation.

882
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,480
So right now, head over to odir.app

883
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,960
and start your 10-day, no-strings-attached trial.

884
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,320
No credit card required.

885
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,000
You can get set up in less than a minute.

886
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,640
And when you do sign up for a plan,

887
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,600
use the promo code LINUX for a $10 discount.

888
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,440
And if they ask, tell them Linux Unplug sent you.

889
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,120
odir.app.

890
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,560
It's monitoring with a comprehensive API

891
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,720
for today's automation.

892
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,120
odir.app.

893
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,360
I feel like it's time we get into some picks, you know?

894
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,360
We've had some good picks in the past.

895
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
We've had some contenders.

896
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,740
But this week, we have something real special, Wes.

897
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,240
This is one that both you and I came across.

898
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,720
We followed the back streets of Linux applications

899
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,000
and see what everybody's talking about.

900
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,160
And every now and then, we stumble across a new contender,

901
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,680
one that seems to be growing in popularity.

902
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,640
And this week, it's Polybar,

903
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,040
which aims to be a beautiful and highly customizable status

904
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,280
bar, I think that gin's kicking in,

905
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,520
without the need of being a black belt in bash scripting.

906
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,440
Have you seen this there, Drew, the P-Polybar?

907
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,960
It's not like the kind of Polybar

908
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,920
that lives with multiple other bars,

909
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,080
and then they all tell themselves they're OK with it.

910
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,560
It's a status bar for multiple kinds of desktops.

911
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,440
Yes, I've used Polybar.

912
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,040
It's not exactly new, though.

913
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
I used it years ago.

914
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,320
Hey, now, I didn't say it was new.

915
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,360
I said it's been getting a lot of attention recently.

916
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,920
Fair enough.

917
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,400
Fair enough.

918
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,280
Yeah, as far as an X11 bar for i3, it's my favorite.

919
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,240
It's the go-to.

920
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,420
And if you want something that is

921
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,520
Wayland compatible, that's very similar to Polybar,

922
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,920
I would recommend Waybar.

923
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,720
One question, Drew.

924
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,400
Is Waybar written in Rust?

925
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,360
I don't believe so, no.

926
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,680
Move on, next pick.

927
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,800
That's good to know, though.

928
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,160
Waybar is good to know.

929
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,820
It's good to know.

930
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,600
It's just that we do have a second pick.

931
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,000
And yes, as you may have guessed,

932
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,560
it's another open source project rewritten in Rust,

933
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,240
which we have to follow because these are special.

934
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,080
And it's called Dust.

935
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,980
It's a more intuitive version of DU, and it's written in Rust.

936
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,600
So this one looks pretty special, Wes.

937
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,520
Yeah, it's nice.

938
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
I don't know that it's going to replace

939
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,480
NC DU for me because that's just so handy because I can also delete stuff

940
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,360
while I'm viewing, but it runs really fast

941
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,280
and gives you a really nice little column chart here

942
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,880
of where all your space is going.

943
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,160
It's got a little index tree.

944
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,880
It's got nice command line options, just how deep

945
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,440
you might want to go in your file system, stuff like that.

946
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
And because it's Rust, well, it's just a binary,

947
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,800
you can download right off the GitHub releases,

948
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,840
run it on your system, and see where your space is going.

949
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,620
Yeah, I mean, are you tired of having to type TACD, TACA, or TACH flags

950
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,480
when you're launching DU like an animal?

951
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,680
Yeah, remember which one is which?

952
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,760
I can't keep it straight.

953
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,120
That's why I use Dust, the Rust alternative to DU.

954
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:34,360
While we're talking about things that are epic,

955
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,840
I want to say a big thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors,

956
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,960
unpluggedcore.com if you'd like to become a member of the show.

957
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,400
Keep the show independent and help reduce the ad load needed.

958
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,920
Let us be picky and say, no, thank you.

959
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,160
And as a thank you to you, you get some perks.

960
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,800
Did you know this, Wes?

961
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,600
I mean, FYI, Wes, did you know there's two options for our members?

962
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
What two options?

963
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,960
That sounds like one too many.

964
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,280
I know.

965
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
We should throw them all out.

966
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,720
But no, we like to have them all.

967
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,800
You can get a limited ad version of the show, nice, tight, well-produced,

968
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,440
same full production, just limited ads.

969
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,160
Or go the absolute opposite route.

970
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,600
Get way more show, extra run length, the full live stream,

971
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,120
all of our screw-ups, of which there are plenty,

972
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,160
and stuff that never makes it into the show.

973
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
And really shouldn't.

974
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,240
For good reason, you can get all of it.

975
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,120
It's like the extra show that we use our better judgment

976
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,520
and don't release to the public.

977
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,320
We make that available as a feed.

978
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,360
To our contributors, you support us, so that way

979
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,920
we show you what we really made of, and then you probably stop supporting us.

980
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
Yeah, that's a lot of trust.

981
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,480
Why don't we do it?

982
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,040
I don't know.

983
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,280
Unpluggedcore.com, go get yourself a little bit of that.

984
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,080
Also, don't forget, you can find our sponsor, Cloud Guru,

985
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,520
on social media, like Twitter, YouTube, or the Facebooks.

986
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,440
You got all of them.

987
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,080
It's real easy.

988
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,000
You just go to slash a Cloud Guru, and you find them.

989
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,240
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show,

990
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,400
at Linux Unplugged.

991
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,360
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

992
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,320
And the entire Jupyter Broadcasting network of fantastic podcasts

993
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
can be found at JupyterBroadcasting.com.

994
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,720
I don't think we say that enough.

995
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Yeah, there's one page, all the shows, links to everything,

996
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,480
all the places.

997
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,560
Can you believe that?

998
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,960
There's more than just this show?

999
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,640
Jeez, what's the matter with us?

1000
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,100
Drew, thank you for making it, man.

1001
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
It was good having you on the podcast this week.

1002
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,940
Yeah, absolutely.

1003
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,800
Anytime I can, I try to.

1004
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,640
I imagine a far distant future where we're all together,

1005
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,240
hanging out in Denver, doing a little pod action.

1006
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,920
Could be happening very soon.

1007
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,880
But in the meantime, you can find the show generally live on Tuesdays,

1008
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,040
with the exception of the occasional Sunday sneaky show.

1009
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,280
We do it at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

1010
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,200
Links to everything we talked about today, how to contact us,

1011
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,120
the mumble info, the matrix server info, and even ways

1012
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,240
to subscribe to this show are available at linuxunplugged.com.

1013
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,520
See you next week.

1014
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,040
Same bad time, same bad station.

1015
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,120
So thanks so much for tuning into this episode of the Unplugged program.

1016
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,280
Thank you to our mumble room, who takes the extra step

1017
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,900
to show up and contribute and make the show even better.

1018
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,360
Thank you to our IRC room, who chats along and fact checks us,

1019
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,880
fact check falses us as we go.

1020
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,560
Gives us the links we just can't find.

1021
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,320
That's right.

1022
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,020
And helps make the show notes even better.

1023
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,640
There's also just people watching.

1024
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,440
We appreciate that.

1025
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,600
And more than ever, we appreciate those of you

1026
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,160
who download the podcast and share it with friends.

1027
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,720
Nothing helps a podcast grow like word of mouth.

1028
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,560
So if you think this show might be interesting, share it with them.

1029
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,440
Helps the show a lot.

1030
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,000
We appreciate that too.

1031
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,180
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1032
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:32,800
And we'll see you right back here, not tomorrow, but next Tuesday.

1033
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,300
Hey.

1034
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,800
Hey.

1035
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,300
Hey.

1036
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,800
Hey.

1037
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,300
Hey.

1038
00:42:35,300 --> 00:43:05,280
Hey.

1039
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
All right.

1040
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,000
JBtitles.com.

1041
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,360
Let's go vote.

1042
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,700
Did anybody have something that didn't make it in the main show

1043
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,560
that they wanted to pick up in the post-show?

1044
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,480
Now's the time.

1045
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,200
Yeah.

1046
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,680
JBtitles.com.

1047
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,960
That was amazing.

1048
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,160
Should really get a sound water clip of that for later.

1049
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,720
Yeah.

1050
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,120
Record that locally so I can fire that off, would you?

1051
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
That'd be great.

1052
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Hooked on dust.

1053
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,280
That's amazing.

1054
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,080
Wow.

1055
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,480
Eating the license cake.

1056
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,980
Wow.

1057
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,920
Everybody's on fire.

1058
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,760
Read-only licenses.

1059
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,800
That's good because in my head right now, I have no idea what to call that show.

Never.

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,160
When we rewrite it for Matrix, perhaps?

1065
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,720
In Rust.

1066
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,360
Yeah.

1067
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm sorry.

1068
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,440
What was that?

1069
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,760
I'm sorry.

1070
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,440
