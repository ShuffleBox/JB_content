1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Everybody loves ProtonMail and everybody loves WireGuard.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,840
Well ProtonMail figured that out themselves

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,880
and they're launching a cool way to help

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,000
not only fund WireGuard, but potentially win

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800
a year of service with ProtonVPN.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,640
You like this?

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,460
I like this.

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,300
You like?

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,120
I like.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,480
It sounds like they'll eventually add WireGuard support

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,060
for their own ProtonVPN.

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,640
Not yet, no promises on exactly when,

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,520
but for now you can still show your support

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,240
and get one of them lifetime memberships, huh?

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,800
I think it's super exciting to watch new technologies

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
like this develop, and I think they deserve more attention

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,200
than they get because these are infrastructure things.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,960
WireGuard is going to securely connect

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,520
data centers and workers, and it's just

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,200
going to go as an implementation detail for products

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,120
in the future.

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,440
But it's one of these fundamental enabling

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,560
technologies that we just get for free as Linux users.

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 280 for December 18, 2018.

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
It's just got a few more episodes

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
before it's time to live up to those predictions.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,040
My name is Chris.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,880
My name is Wes.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,800
Hello, Wes.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,960
I was looking through our list, and I'm really

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
bringing my A game.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040
I've got to make up for a few bad ones.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
I've got to own them.

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,460
But that's not what today's episode's about.

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,720
No, Wes and I are fresh off the plane,

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
just got back from Denver, Colorado

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
to tour the System76 factories and meet Thaleo,

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,440
their new line of desktop PCs, born to run Linux.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,320
We had a chance to go there.

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,820
I'll save it, but I got some things to say.

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,240
I got some stuff to share.

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
We had some experiences.

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,560
It was not what we were expecting.

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,080
You agree?

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
I think that's safe to say.

47
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah, I think that's safe to say.

48
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,000
But before we get there, we'll go through some community news

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,480
this week, cover a few housekeeping items,

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,000
and towards the end of the show, we'll answer some emails,

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,160
follow up on a few projects that people have sent our way,

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,680
and give you a few of our own, a few picks that are really

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,720
killer, including one by somebody a little surprising

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,320
that's impressive as heck.

55
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
That's a little tease.

56
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,640
Don't look.

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,400
Don't look in the show notes.

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Don't spoil it for yourself.

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
Just wait and see.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,600
It's pretty cool.

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,800
But before we go any further, we have

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,000
to bring in that virtual lug time appropriate greetings

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,680
mumble room.

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,400
Good morning.

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Hey there.

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello.

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,200
Hello, Brandon, and Bruce, and Fundatils, and KP, MiniMech,

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Scott, Sean, Simi, and Xanthrux336.

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
Very specific there, that one.

70
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,480
Not 386.

71
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,360
336, buddy.

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
Get it right, Chris.

73
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,200
Come on.

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,920
OK, Wes.

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
Well, I wish we had a, you know, we

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,880
need to have a voiceover person do this part for us.

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
So I'm just going to do it my best, OK?

78
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,840
Previously, on Lunix Unplugged, Wes Payne

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,360
attempts to get the keyboardio on fire.

80
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,600
So before we go any further, Wes,

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,240
let's open this challenge back up.

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,440
This is the episode we have to wrap it up.

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,520
Wes Payne, how are you feeling about lighting the keyboardio

84
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,280
on fire?

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
Well, it's not quite on fire.

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,280
It's got some other effects, I think, loaded.

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,520
We've just flashed the latest firmware.

88
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,960
So we're up to snuff in that department.

89
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Now to enable some plugins.

90
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
All right, I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Keyboardio, of course, is a split keyboard running Linux.

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,760
It's got some Arduinos in there connected back

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,880
to Wes Payne's ThinkPad running Ubuntu.

94
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,920
And the idea is to install some software on the keyboard that

95
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,880
creates a fire-like effect on the keyboard

96
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
to help us celebrate the holidays.

97
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,240
That's the plan, at least.

98
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
We'll see if that actually works out.

99
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
In fact, why don't we begin our community news

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,880
this week with a hell of a story about keyboardio?

101
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,680
I am shocked.

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
I have this keyboardio because I was

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,560
one of the very, very, very early backers

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,520
because I met the couple behind the project very early

105
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,480
on at OSCON years ago when they were

106
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,320
on one of their many prototypes.

107
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,560
And they had an update today, day 1,278, words

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
that they never wanted to hear.

109
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,560
Quote, I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer present.

110
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Things went.

111
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,320
That's never good.

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
They've had delays.

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,280
They've had challenges.

114
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
And they figured out the common theme.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,760
They were getting scammed badly.

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,240
There's basically no situation which

117
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
they wished they never had to say these words they write.

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,640
These words are what someone says

119
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,000
after they've gotten caught.

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,840
These are the words that our account manager

121
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,760
from the factory that makes the Model 1

122
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,880
said about 6 PM on Tuesday, November 27,

123
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,360
after we'd finally figured out how much she had stolen.

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,080
This is a story that, well, I'll just leave it

125
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
to you to read, but here's a couple of details.

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,200
They had gotten scammed by an account manager that

127
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
was working for a Chinese factory that was lying to them.

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,600
She had lied to them about having a family.

129
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,960
She even sent pictures of a fake son.

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,920
She was no longer an employee at this factory,

131
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,080
but she'd convinced the factory to let her stay on and work

132
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,680
this client.

133
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,840
Just multiple levels of bad relationships and bad deals.

134
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,520
And some of these things that happened

135
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,480
are not totally out of the ordinary over there.

136
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,440
So they didn't set off any alarm bells immediately.

137
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,320
And she was doing this tricky thing

138
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,640
where she would eventually release just enough money.

139
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
She'd set up a separate bank account

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,440
and gotten the Keyboardio folks to wire their money

141
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,680
to that bank account.

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,080
And then when the factory would really start to get upset,

143
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,440
and Keyboardio really needed their key caps

144
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,180
or their keyboards or whatever it was,

145
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,280
she'd put a little money from her bank account

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,680
into the factory's bank account.

147
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Right.

148
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,760
So she's sitting there in the middle telling the factory,

149
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,680
oh, we can't pay yet.

150
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
We can't pay yet.

151
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,120
Taking this money, hoarding it.

152
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Yeah, and then occasionally paying a little bit out

153
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,760
so that a few people got some keyboards

154
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,360
and it looked like progress was happening.

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,860
Yeah.

156
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,840
And then there was instance where maybe 5,000 sets were

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
ordered by Keyboardio, but she'd put an order in for 2,700

158
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,760
and then skim off the top and take the rest.

159
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
So the factory just wouldn't have the parts.

160
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,080
And then when it came time to actually go over there

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
on November 27th and start talking to people,

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,440
it was super awkward because the factory owner and workers,

163
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,920
first of all, didn't speak English.

164
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,800
Second of all, were trying to negotiate with her in a way

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
where they were playing along with her lives

166
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
because they felt like that was the best way to get

167
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,600
the money out of her.

168
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
At a certain point, that just stopped working.

169
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,860
Wow.

170
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,940
That's when the lawyers had to get involved.

171
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,440
But they learned that she was no longer

172
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,920
an employee of the factory.

173
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,720
They learned that she had actually quit 18 months prior

174
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,140
to when they discovered all of this.

175
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,640
Wow.

176
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
But the factory allowed her to keep the project

177
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
as an independent sales agent.

178
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,160
Again, that's not too unusual.

179
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,800
And then the account manager had negotiated aggressive discounts

180
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
and price breaks on their behalf,

181
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,080
but hadn't actually passed them on.

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,520
When they asked if their account manager had done this

183
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,160
to try with any of her other clients,

184
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
like she'd scammed anybody else, the factory owner

185
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
told Keyboardio that Keyboardio was the only customer

186
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,720
that she'd had before she'd quit.

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,920
Their one and only customer.

188
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,480
In August, they sent back 20 defective circuit boards

189
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,920
to have them troubleshoot and figure out what was wrong.

190
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,480
They never received them.

191
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,200
They never got the boards.

192
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
So they never were doing the troubleshooting

193
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,080
why the account manager told them they were.

194
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
It's pretty bad news.

195
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
It's not catastrophic.

196
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,520
On one hand, it's a lot of money missing.

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,980
And they think there's a decent chance that that money's just

198
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,800
gone and never going to be seen again.

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,360
But some products, they did manage to ship them.

200
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
And they think after this, they're

201
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
going to have a better relationship with the factory.

202
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,780
Yeah, they've been over there now.

203
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,620
They've established some new relationships.

204
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,400
It sounds like, at least so far, things

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
are still going to move forward.

206
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,440
And even if not, the company's in a healthy enough place

207
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
that they can continue just probably a little slower

208
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,040
than we would all have liked.

209
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,880
They got some nice perks for patrons.

210
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,920
No, Kickstarter.

211
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
What are you, a kickster?

212
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
What do you when you back a project?

213
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,600
A backer.

214
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,280
A backer.

215
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,040
Kickstarter backer.

216
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,720
I like kickster.

217
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,240
That's much better.

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
A kickster.

219
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,880
If you're a kickster of this project

220
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,460
and you fill out their survey, they got some perks

221
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,580
they're giving out too.

222
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,920
It's a long story.

223
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,080
We just skimmed 10% of it.

224
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,200
But I suggest that you go read the rest.

225
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,080
But kind of crazy that this is happening when we just

226
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
started randomly talking about the keyboardio on the show.

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,920
It was sitting here in the studio,

228
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
and we're like, let's do something with that.

229
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,540
That's a keyboard that runs Linux.

230
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,520
Let's do something with it.

231
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,600
Yeah, it really sucks too, because this

232
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,320
isn't one of those, at least it hasn't ever

233
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
seemed to be one of those shadier Kickstarter

234
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
sort of things.

235
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,120
They've delivered.

236
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
They made a very quality product.

237
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
So just unfortunate all around.

238
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,960
Yeah, it's interesting how she was eking out just enough

239
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,580
of their money to convince the factory.

240
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,480
She would tell the factory things like, well,

241
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,160
they have to make the shipment in order

242
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,720
to pay you what they owe, even though they had paid.

243
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,640
So oh, man, it's such a shame to see a cool project.

244
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Because the couple behind it that started originally

245
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,340
just didn't have a passion making the best

246
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,560
keyboard possible.

247
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
And there are projects that have been,

248
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
they've forked what these people have built

249
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,280
and made their own projects.

250
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,840
It's become a bit of a platform too.

251
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,000
So good luck there on that lightning on fire, Wes.

252
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
We'll check back in towards the end of the show

253
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
and see how you do.

254
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,240
You have one episode of Linux Unplugged remaining.

255
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
All right, now on to the rest of the community news.

256
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,040
Didn't think I'd be saying this one anytime soon.

257
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,720
But it looks like you're going to be using the NVIDIA binary

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,040
driver with Wayland sooner than you expected, thanks to Mir.

259
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,800
Yeah, Mir 1.1 has been released with EGL streams, KMS support,

260
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,320
and it works with NVIDIA's binary driver.

261
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,400
The canonical developers maintaining the Mir display

262
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,400
server with its modern focus on being a Wayland compositor

263
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,440
have just issued Mir 1.1.

264
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,480
The primary edition of Mir 1.1 is the introduction

265
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,400
of NVIDIA's primary driver support

266
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,360
by means of adding EGL streams, which I barely even understand

267
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,160
what those are.

268
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,840
And this KMS backend that is compatible with the NVIDIA

269
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,360
Linux driver architecture that already exists by NVIDIA.

270
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,860
So it's just working with what they already plug into.

271
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah, basically there's like two different buffer APIs,

272
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,580
one that all the open source drivers use

273
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,880
and is already implemented in all the Wayland compositors

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,760
that you use today, and EGL streams,

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,200
which is what NVIDIA's driver uses.

276
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,720
And Gnome had already grown some support for this,

277
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
and work is in progress for KDE as well.

278
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,680
But that kind of left everyone else out in the cold

279
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,020
unless you were going to implement

280
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,480
this for your custom compositor.

281
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
What was it, three months ago, we

282
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,880
were seeing stories about canonical working

283
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,480
to upstream some sort of EGL?

284
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,980
I mean, I just remember seeing that,

285
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,600
and I just went by the writer, and I went, well, who cares?

286
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
What does that mean?

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
But now you see the other shoe drop,

288
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,920
and you're like, oh, this is going

289
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,760
to tie all the way from Wayland, Amir, to Gnome Shell.

290
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,920
There's a whole channel here where you could potentially

291
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
get a Gnome Shell environment using Amir Shim talking

292
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
to Wayland, talking Wayland, not talking to, but talking

293
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Wayland, with actual NVIDIA binary accelerated graphics.

294
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
And I know so many people listening to this show

295
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,740
are going, who the hell wants NVIDIA binary graphics

296
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,560
on their Linux box?

297
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,800
I am there with you.

298
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,920
My utopia, my Lenovo T480 utopia, I feel like,

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,500
has been shattered with the introduction

300
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,940
of the NVIDIA binary driver.

301
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,600
Not only have I had that obnoxious system

302
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,560
to UDEV issue, which is being managed at this point,

303
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,680
but there's just other weird things,

304
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,880
like now my displays don't properly line up correctly.

305
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,440
I'd never had some of these issues

306
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,400
that I've had, like stuttering windows,

307
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
and having my display not line up correctly

308
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,720
when I'm using the Intel driver.

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
But I switch over to the NVIDIA binary driver,

310
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,680
and Bob's your uncle, and now I'm having problems.

311
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,360
Don't like it.

312
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,480
No, I mean, that's rough.

313
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,080
But if you do pay a lot for one of those nice NVIDIA cards,

314
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,640
and you want to push a lot of frames,

315
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,000
hopefully better support in the future.

316
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

317
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,440
You're buying a machine that's got a video card in it,

318
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
and you're not going to just waste that $300, $400

319
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,980
component.

320
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,640
And we're trying to get to the world of Wayland.

321
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,240
This is one more step.

322
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,800
It's amazing that Mir can do this,

323
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,360
and it's incredible they got there this fast.

324
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,720
I imagine we'll see even more alternative desktops embedding

325
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,280
Mir just for the support, and make it easy to have something

326
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,920
of your own compositor without having to do all the work.

327
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Asus has begun digging their own grave

328
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,800
by releasing encrypted kernel sources for the Zenfone Max

329
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Pro, Max Pro 2, and M2, and M Max 2, whatever the hell.

330
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,520
Who cares?

331
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,000
It appears that Asus has been releasing

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,220
encrypting kernel sources for their Zenfone series.

333
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,480
That's what I'm trying to say.

334
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
The encryption apparently came into play

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,240
since the last two code releases.

336
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
And of course, the real issue here

337
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,760
is this is likely a GPL violation.

338
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,240
Yeah, right.

339
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,160
I mean, if you release an encrypted file,

340
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,560
and no means for anyone to decrypt it, what is the point?

341
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,200
You haven't released anything.

342
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,440
No, it's just dumb.

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,100
You know that anyone who wants to buy these phones

344
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
because they might be interested in,

345
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
they're probably enthusiasts.

346
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Yeah.

347
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,720
And GPL violations are never good.

348
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,640
That's just bad press.

349
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,760
It seems like Asus has got to recognize

350
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,160
that people that are buying their phones are geeks.

351
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
You know, like it's a-

352
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,800
How many Asus phone users do you know there?

353
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,320
Yeah.

354
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,600
So I don't know what they're doing with this.

355
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
I do have some conspiracy bacon that

356
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
sort of ties it all together.

357
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,160
And what the hell do I know?

358
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,360
And I'm just becoming a paranoid old man, apparently.

359
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
But if I was going to fry any bacon about what's

360
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,760
going on here, I wonder, Wes, if they're not

361
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,360
trying to get us all nice and ready for a Fuchsia future

362
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,320
where you're not going to be able to get out.

363
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
And so they're just, they're taking away

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,880
some of the legacy things about how Android phones worked

365
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,440
and getting us ready for a life of Fuchsia.

366
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,200
And I think this is perhaps the first step in getting us all

367
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
to eat that shit sandwich.

368
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,640
Is you first get them to take these first few bites.

369
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,800
You haven't had kernel sources in so long anyway.

370
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,480
Who cares?

371
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
That's exactly what I'm saying.

372
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,480
That is exactly-

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,120
You don't get them on the iPhone.

374
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,800
Right.

375
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,160
We haven't shipped a device, even

376
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,000
when we've been using Android for the last two years.

377
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,560
I mean, let's say it's two years in the future, right?

378
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
Why would you expect us to do a Fuchsia?

379
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,680
Of course not.

380
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
So when Fuchsia devices ship, it's just the norm.

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
And this is something that I'm sure Google's-

382
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
I mean, you look at across the line,

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
it's just happening more and more.

384
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
But this is a next level.

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
Like locking on the bootloader is one thing,

386
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
but the encrypted kernel sources-

387
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,320
And just why publish them at all?

388
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
It's so weird.

389
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,280
Yeah, so it just seems like Asus is off the mark here.

390
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,740
I don't know what's going on, but it

391
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,320
seemed like maybe it was worth talking about,

392
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,800
because you have to be able to make the right choice when

393
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
you're purchasing this hardware.

394
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,720
And so it's something to think about.

395
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,880
Factor it in.

396
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
Unless you're Westpain.

397
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,920
Unless you're Westpain, then you're probably not

398
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,880
buying an Asus phone, unless you're Westpain.

399
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Well, Westpain has two of them.

400
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,640
Oh, it's more than that now.

401
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,120
That's six.

402
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,440
I keep them one in every pocket.

403
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,640
Ha, ha, ha.

404
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,000
I kid, I kid.

405
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,520
All right, well, I really want to talk about our System76

406
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,040
factory tour, but why don't we start

407
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
with a little bit of housekeeping?

408
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah, whoa, boy, whoa.

409
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,040
I just got to mention the user air show.

410
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
It's doing so good.

411
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Air.show slash subscribe.

412
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,800
Go subscribe to it, because the boys

413
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,120
have got a new episode coming out this week.

414
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
And it is really meshed into a great show.

415
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,800
Popey, Daniel Foray, and Joe Resington on that show

416
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,760
make it so great.

417
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,460
Occasional guests.

418
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,960
I was on there once telling them about my near-death story.

419
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,880
And they come up with really anything about life

420
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,040
and the universe.

421
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,800
They answer questions, hashtag ask air.

422
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
You can just do a hashtag ask air.

423
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,880
E-R-R-O. I say air.

424
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,920
It's error.

425
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
Hashtag ask error on Twitter, and they'll

426
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,160
answer the questions about Linux or life in general.

427
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
It's become that kind of show where

428
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,400
the moment it's released, I listen to it.

429
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,880
It's the first podcast I play as soon as it's released.

430
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,920
It's never too heavy.

431
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,800
You get some good serious topics in there,

432
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
but with some laughs in between.

433
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,640
The guys are clicking really good.

434
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,520
It's just a good show.

435
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,960
Air.show slash subscribe, because they'll

436
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
have a new one out this week.

437
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,760
So jump in on that stuff.

438
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,440
And then, also worth noting for you students out there

439
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,800
of Linux Academy, this is kind of a cool time

440
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
if you've got some downtime in the holiday

441
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,440
or if you want to sneak away from family.

442
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,360
For each learning activity that you complete,

443
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,020
between the 16th of December, so that's a couple days ago,

444
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,160
and the 26th, the day after Christmas,

445
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,600
Linux Academy will donate $1 to St. Jude Children's Research

446
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Hospital for every learning activity that you complete.

447
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,640
So far, and we're just getting into this,

448
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,520
they've raised $3,535.

449
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,080
Nice.

450
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Which means people have completed

451
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,400
3,535 learning activities too, which is kind of great,

452
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,560
because while you're learning, you can also give.

453
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,360
So there's more information on the Linux Academy blog,

454
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,860
but all you have to do to participate

455
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,640
is you just log in and take one of the 20,000 learning

456
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
activities that's available.

457
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,360
And once you complete it, it'll donate a buck.

458
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
That's pretty nice.

459
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,120
And then, last bit of housekeeping before we move on,

460
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Linux Fest Northwest.

461
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,720
April 26 and 28, we just locked in,

462
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,240
while we were down at System 76, the barbecue.

463
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
So the barbecue is going to be on, the great barbecue.

464
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
It's on.

465
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,120
I think Saturday night is the night we're doing it.

466
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,680
It's when we did it last year.

467
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,720
And it's outside of Lady Joop's.

468
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Everybody is welcome to come hang out.

469
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,000
BYOD and BYOF, which would be food and drinks.

470
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
We'll have some, too.

471
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,400
You want it, bring it.

472
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,280
There'll be some there.

473
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
We'll have a bit of a budget for it.

474
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
System 76 will have a bit of a budget for it.

475
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,680
So if you can't bring anything, too,

476
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
if you've been traveling, you can't bring anything,

477
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,080
still show up, because we'll be able to accommodate.

478
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,960
Also, we've got a drone.

479
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,120
I want to do a drone thing.

480
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm going to see if I can't bring two of my drones.

481
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Two grills and two drones.

482
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,760
Have the TV going if we want.

483
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,280
Have some music going.

484
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,440
Bring out the HomePods.

485
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,280
I think you have enough at this point, don't you?

486
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,680
I had to ruin it with something.

487
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,920
Anyways, Linux Fest, its 20th anniversary.

488
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
We're going to be there.

489
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,440
We'll be doing live shows.

490
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,160
Joe's flying in.

491
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,080
We're going to do a live.

492
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,960
It'll be the first live Linux action news.

493
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,360
We've never done one.

494
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,000
It might be terrible.

495
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,640
Who knows?

496
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
That's breaking down all the rules.

497
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,440
We'll see.

498
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,600
I feel like we got it in us.

499
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,320
Oh, it'll be great.

500
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
I feel like we got it in us.

501
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,320
So that's going to be really cool.

502
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,200
We've been saving doing a live Linux action

503
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,840
news for a special occasion.

504
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
And I think this is going to be it.

505
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,520
LinuxFestNorthwest.org, their 20th anniversary,

506
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,600
past, present, and future, is the theme this year.

507
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
And we're going to have some huge announcements.

508
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,360
You know it's big when we're already planning it,

509
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
and it's months out.

510
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,040
So come out.

511
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,480
Check it out.

512
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,080
We'd love to see you there.

513
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
LinuxFestNorthwest.org.

514
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
OK, I'm done.

515
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,600
Housekeeping is complete.

516
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,120
Had to mention that.

517
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,280
And I really do hope Linux Fest is a big party,

518
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,240
because I think it's just going to be our best one so far.

519
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
So I really do hope it all works out.

520
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,880
It's just the best.

521
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,800
I mean, it's the best opportunity

522
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
to celebrate all the things we love.

523
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,260
It's a culmination of stuff between the huge announcements

524
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,480
and all the great people that you love.

525
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,440
What could be better?

526
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,080
OK, let's talk about our trip to Denver, Mr. Payne.

527
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,080
So System76 contacted me around the time of about a week

528
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,840
before the Thaleo was officially announced.

529
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
They started emailing me back and forth saying, hey,

530
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,120
we've got something coming.

531
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,080
We want to show it to you, because it's kind of a big deal.

532
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,160
And I think a lot of us will remember the initial messaging

533
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,040
was about open hardware.

534
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,960
Open hardware, I think, was the big part of the initial messaging.

535
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,000
And of course, that means I immediately

536
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,080
put my skeptical hat on.

537
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,120
Boom, first thing I do.

538
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,480
It's a big claim, right?

539
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,700
And especially in our terrible world,

540
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,160
we often have pretty high standards

541
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,760
for what open hardware means.

542
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, and this is something that we

543
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
got into in a few conversations, is there's not

544
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,280
like one accepted definition of open hardware.

545
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Open hardware, I think, in the audience's mind

546
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,000
is the Intel blobs on the board.

547
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,280
But open hardware, in the industry's mind,

548
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,760
is your plans, your diagrams.

549
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
The idea, essentially, is could you

550
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,360
take the plans from System76's GitHub page,

551
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
go to a metal fab shop, and have them build you out a case?

552
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,720
And the answer is, in this case, is yes.

553
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,600
But that's not, I don't think, a definition

554
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,440
that System76 is necessarily satisfied with.

555
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,560
I think they are trying to push that forward further.

556
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,900
We'll get into that a little bit.

557
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,480
But I thought maybe we'd start with the essentials.

558
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,520
So they contacted us and said, something's coming.

559
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,880
And I said, well, I want to see it.

560
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,320
If I'm going to believe this, if you're going to go build,

561
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,040
I just have been extremely skeptical

562
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,560
about the entire transition to a factory.

563
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,880
Because they're a bunch of lovable hipster geeks

564
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,640
that know how to use Linux.

565
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,120
They can manage an ordering pipeline.

566
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,620
They can work with outside vendors,

567
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,440
assemble a few custom systems, and so on.

568
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,680
We already know how hard, like other things like the Librem.

569
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,360
It's just difficult, especially with laptops and other things,

570
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,400
to get all that stuff open as much as you can.

571
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,840
And it was a new building.

572
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,320
A factory is very different than customizing

573
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,400
some hardware someone else builds for you.

574
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,120
It's a totally different business.

575
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,680
It's a totally different business.

576
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,400
It really is, right?

577
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah.

578
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,200
And it's not like they have a bunch of warehouse experts

579
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,680
and people that know how to manage this huge equipment

580
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,180
on staff.

581
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,720
They're pretty lean operation already.

582
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,520
So it would mean learning those things.

583
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,520
And that just, to me, seems nearly impossible

584
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,520
when you're also trying to launch an operating system

585
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,120
and manage an existing business, support

586
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
your existing customers.

587
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,840
I was very skeptical.

588
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,240
So I was like, I got to see this.

589
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
You got to show it to me.

590
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,360
I got to see it.

591
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,300
And they said, OK, good enough.

592
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,400
When the factory is ready, we'll fly you guys out.

593
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,840
And you can see it with your own eyes.

594
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,160
That was back in October or so.

595
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,880
I don't remember.

596
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,040
And sure enough, they made good on that deal.

597
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,840
And they flew Wes and I out as well

598
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,680
as six or seven other journalists, I guess,

599
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,480
five or six other journalists, and gave us the full tour.

600
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
And prove me wrong.

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,360
Prove me wrong.

602
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,840
They're not, I'm not going to sit here and tell you

603
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,940
that they've mastered how to run a factory

604
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,400
and that they're cranking out systems

605
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
at an unbelievable volume.

606
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,600
They're still in that learning curve, hockey puck curve

607
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,100
right now.

608
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,920
They're still stuck in that learning curve.

609
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,840
And they're still figuring out how to build these faster.

610
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,540
They're still figuring out the best way

611
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,160
to even lay out the warehouse.

612
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,760
But they are, to be honest, three years ahead of where

613
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,800
I thought they would be.

614
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,960
I mean, I know that was pretty harsh on my part.

615
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
But they are cranking out systems.

616
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,200
They are building them.

617
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,000
And they are not sacrificing attention to detail

618
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,720
in the process.

619
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,800
That's the big part right there.

620
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
They're not just cranking out any old thing.

621
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,480
They're doing so with a high degree of quality.

622
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,640
So the real reason we came down there

623
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,120
was to see this factory and see Thaleo

624
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,800
and see what it was all about.

625
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,120
And to that end, they really went all out.

626
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
So they flew us in.

627
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,240
They set us up in hotels.

628
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,400
Then they brought us in for a Friday tour.

629
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,240
It starts with a back story where

630
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,080
we learn that it's been three years in the making.

631
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,300
And the different industrial design iterations

632
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,640
they went through to get where they're at,

633
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,940
the incorporation of the wood, the look of it.

634
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,240
And they demonstrated how, at the same time,

635
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,360
they had another team running simultaneously,

636
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,160
figuring out the internal components, the arrangement.

637
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,400
But the practical matters.

638
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
How do we actually put this together?

639
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,800
Mm-hmm.

640
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,100
And so the way they did this over the last three years

641
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,800
was have these two different tracks of development

642
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,480
running simultaneously and build out a lot of this

643
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,560
at the same time and then come together.

644
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,840
And it really seems to have resulted

645
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
in a very high quality PC.

646
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,040
I wrote up a blog, and I have some pictures,

647
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,620
over at linuxunplug.com slash articles.

648
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
You can look at the System76 tour,

649
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,400
including a video of them dipping the machines in acid.

650
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,080
The thing that jumped out at me was the clear amount

651
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
of enthusiasm about being able to apply all of these lessons

652
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,480
that they were probably very frustrated

653
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,880
by working with other OEMs over the years.

654
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,160
So many of the components that they talked about

655
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,640
were things that had been inspired

656
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,400
by solving problems of past machines that they've shipped.

657
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
You can really tell, right?

658
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,240
They've dealt with this.

659
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
They haven't been happy.

660
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,880
But there's no solution except if you

661
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,240
can manufacture it yourself.

662
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,280
And sometimes it's small things, like a custom-built,

663
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,840
custom-printed bracket to hold the GPU in place.

664
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,840
And other times, it's just having motherboard standoffs

665
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,480
at a certain height because they know that this is the height

666
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,120
they prefer for their motherboard standoffs.

667
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,540
Thinking about it's easier to service.

668
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,040
It'll be cleaner to get connections.

669
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,560
Mm-hmm.

670
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,160
And they really agonized over every little detail

671
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,840
about the airflow and all of this.

672
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,000
And that was very, very impressive.

673
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,400
But the bigger thing for me that I walked away

674
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,560
from this thinking about was a lot of the same people

675
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,640
that were working there the last time I visited back in 2015

676
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,020
are still working there.

677
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,200
And they have sort of risen to the challenge.

678
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,800
They've all taken on a project that

679
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,820
is bigger than just themselves and kind of pulled together

680
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,360
as a whole company.

681
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,160
And everybody has sort of leveled up in what they're doing

682
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,520
and what they know and what their understanding is.

683
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,320
And in a way, just about every person

684
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
has had their hands on these first batch of machines

685
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,320
that have gone out as they've learned this process.

686
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,800
And so this small team was able to really play

687
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,240
to their strengths and raise the bar

688
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
and rise to the challenge, I think.

689
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
Was that your assessment of it?

690
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,080
Yeah, you can really tell.

691
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,320
I mean, half the tour was kind of Karl's excited kind

692
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,480
of impromptu lecture on how modern manufacturing

693
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,680
at a small scale might work, you know?

694
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,280
Just kind of going through all the pieces that you have to do.

695
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,800
There's some fun pictures out there of you

696
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,360
bending some metal as well, right?

697
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
So all kinds of stuff.

698
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,640
But you could just tell he'd put in the time.

699
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,960
And it is as hard as it sounds.

700
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,920
I would be a little daunted by that challenge.

701
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,840
OK, I'll learn all these different components

702
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,960
that you need.

703
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,720
But they've done it.

704
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,120
I mean, yeah, there's still a lot of efficiencies

705
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,840
to be gained figuring things out.

706
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,520
The other part that struck me was they're so excited about it,

707
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
it seems like this is what they wanted

708
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,920
to do the whole darn time.

709
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,760
And they haven't gotten there everywhere, right?

710
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,280
There's no custom-built laptop yet.

711
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,080
But you can tell that's what they're

712
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,000
trying to achieve.

713
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,600
Yeah.

714
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,160
So before they get to the laptops,

715
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,680
they have to nail the desktops.

716
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,160
And here's Karl talking a little bit about that process.

717
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,240
We had two directions going at some time.

718
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,960
We had kind of intentionally did them separate

719
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
so that one wouldn't hold back the other.

720
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,840
So while Kate was working on design,

721
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,720
R&D was working on mechanical engineering.

722
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
The idea was for them to get to a certain point

723
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,680
and then merge the two together.

724
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,200
And this is the beginnings of mechanical design.

725
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
You see how different it is when you

726
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
think from a mechanical design standpoint

727
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,280
and when you think from a mechanical engineering

728
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,360
to design.

729
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,480
The margins you would imagine are better on desktops.

730
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,160
And I asked Karl, do you sell more laptops

731
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,280
or do you sell more desktops?

732
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,480
And it was a clear, we sell more laptops.

733
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,240
So I said, how then are you making this work?

734
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,360
You set up this whole factory to build desktops

735
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,400
and you sell more laptops than you sell desktops.

736
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,160
He said, yes, but the thing is the sale of the desktops

737
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,360
has financed this entire operation.

738
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,080
And think about what that means for a moment.

739
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,720
It means that a company that sells Linux-only desktops

740
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,480
has been able to successfully finance a company now

741
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,800
for many years, more than 12 years,

742
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,400
and build out a factory, including all of the things

743
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,440
that it means moving staff.

744
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,520
It means building office spaces.

745
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,560
It means setting up factory equipment

746
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,540
that is of an unbelievable industrial scale.

747
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,720
It means learning to work with acid.

748
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,080
All of these things have been financed and lessons learned

749
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,240
by the sale of Linux-running desktop computers.

750
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,120
They haven't taken outside lending.

751
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,720
They've done it with the sale of the desktops.

752
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,560
That's a big achievement right there.

753
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
I think that's really nice.

754
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,360
And I think one of the things that really stood out to me

755
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,880
is what a unique individual Carl is.

756
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,600
I mean, I've always felt this way.

757
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,740
But watching him, one of the things

758
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,320
that's interesting about Carl is he gets everyone's attention

759
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,760
by being a soft talker.

760
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,240
So he manages to sort of get the whole room to take it down.

761
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,720
Everybody has to be quiet to listen to Carl speak,

762
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,400
which is an interesting technique.

763
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,640
It would have been real easy to come off like you're bragging,

764
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,760
showing people around the cool new factory you built,

765
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,000
but not at all.

766
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,520
No, there's a humbleness and like a kid in a candy factory

767
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,000
aspect to Carl.

768
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
He floats around.

769
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
Guys, look at all these cool things.

770
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,320
Aren't you interested?

771
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,280
Yeah, he floats from station to station.

772
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,640
And when we took a break to do some,

773
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,800
we got unrestricted access to the staff.

774
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,440
When we took a break to chat with the staff,

775
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,020
Carl took that opportunity to then start

776
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,600
going around from station to station,

777
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
just kind of like a quality check-in.

778
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,920
And you could see him sort of relay what he's

779
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,020
looking for to the staff so they learn what to do

780
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,840
as they're building the systems.

781
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,080
And I think it's been an obsession for him

782
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,640
for the last few months.

783
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,840
They started opening these pre-orders

784
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,180
on the beginning of November, and they were just

785
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,960
shipping them as we were arriving that day.

786
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,680
They were beginning to ship them.

787
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,040
Yeah, some of the first went out then.

788
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
But maybe we should talk about the Thaleo hardware

789
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,000
for a moment.

790
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,120
Probably, yeah, that's kind of a big piece.

791
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
They're using, I think, any parts you'd be happy to buy

792
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,200
yourself if you're building your own PC,

793
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,640
good off-the-shelf motherboard.

794
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
They've gone through and they've battle tested

795
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,440
a few different systems.

796
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,120
But it's nothing you couldn't replace yourself.

797
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,200
It's a standard PSU.

798
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
It's just a really good one.

799
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,320
It's a standard motherboard.

800
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,200
It's just a great one.

801
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,800
It has standard CPUs, GPUs, all of that.

802
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,880
The value really is in the whole complete package.

803
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,720
Thaleo's process of being built is mind-numbingly

804
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,600
detail-oriented.

805
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,140
They really focus on every little aspect of the machine,

806
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,720
the feel of the screw holes, the way the case slides down

807
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
from the cooling system.

808
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,320
They spent a special, special care trying

809
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,720
to get the power button just right.

810
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,840
Yeah, and they did a great job.

811
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,800
Yeah.

812
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,000
And so there's a process that goes

813
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,600
into building these systems that any geek would be proud of.

814
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,820
And of course, they're great parts,

815
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,120
depending on how you spec them.

816
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,360
They're very fast.

817
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
And Wes and I were having this conversation.

818
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,200
It seems like they're doing this huge commitment.

819
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,840
And Linux geeks are often enthusiasts.

820
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,040
They might just want to build their own PC.

821
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,800
I mean, we certainly both have, right?

822
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,160
All the machines in this room have been self-built.

823
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,280
What do you think about that?

824
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,040
Do you think that they're taking a risk here

825
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,040
by this huge investment into this desktop line

826
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
when they're trying to sell to a bunch of users

827
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,640
who are just going to go build their own?

828
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,320
It's interesting.

829
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,840
You definitely can go build your own.

830
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,720
And these days, I think of that almost more as something

831
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,400
to do because you want to learn.

832
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,960
You're curious how to put together.

833
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,680
And maybe sometimes because you can't get something

834
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,880
on the market of the quality that you want.

835
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
You know, like you want that you're going to have price

836
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,160
or quality.

837
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,600
You're worried just like, well, I could buy that.

838
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
But it's not going to come with a great motherboard.

839
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Or I'm going to have to replace that PSU once I

840
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,560
get my graphics card.

841
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,880
I would be hard pressed without turning it

842
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,000
into a really big project to make you a computer as nice.

843
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,720
Oh, for sure, yeah, especially with the wood casing and stuff.

844
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
It really is a showpiece.

845
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,160
So I think that has to be the market they're aiming for.

846
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,400
It's to put it up on your desk.

847
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,000
It's for someone who's either an enthusiast or a professional

848
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,520
as well.

849
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
I think that could be a big market for them

850
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,360
because it's going to be powerful.

851
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,000
It's quiet.

852
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
It has an eye for being servants.

853
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,680
There was some talk about producing some service videos.

854
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
It's been built for serviceability

855
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,240
by customer upgradability and serviceability.

856
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,680
It's a big focus of theirs.

857
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
Like you said, with the screw holes,

858
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
they focus there that using extra durable ones

859
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,200
so that they won't strip.

860
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Yeah, they give you extra parts even

861
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,760
so you can add more components after the fact on your own.

862
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
So I think they could make a pretty reasonable play

863
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,840
for just a responsible desktop that you know will

864
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
be a five, seven-year machine.

865
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,680
Well, it's kind of like I was saying to you

866
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,120
on the pre-show before we even turn on the mics.

867
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,280
It's like, I'm just kind of feeling like maybe I'm

868
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,480
done distro hopping and desktop hopping.

869
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,800
Like I just I'm ready to move on to a different phase

870
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,480
and just work.

871
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,920
And I feel the same way about my desktops.

872
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I have been building my desktops since the 90s.

873
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,680
And now I'm kind of done doing that.

874
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,480
Like I've done it.

875
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,400
And now I just want to use the computer.

876
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,560
I don't want a project.

877
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,320
I want to just get to work on my other work

878
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,560
that I have, my other projects.

879
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,120
I don't want another one.

880
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,240
So I was really impressed by this machine

881
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,760
when I started thinking about it for my use cases.

882
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,600
I think the other part you have to consider, too,

883
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
is so there's the model that we mostly saw.

884
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,640
But there's bigger models of the same form factor, right?

885
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,120
That was the other thing that struck me

886
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,920
is how small the standard Thalia was.

887
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,360
Oh, it's a very compact.

888
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,960
Yeah.

889
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,280
It's like a mini ITX size.

890
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,880
But I don't know if it's actually mini ITX.

891
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,420
But then they have minor and major.

892
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,880
They have different models they're going to be rolling out.

893
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
Major and massive?

894
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,240
Yes.

895
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
And then there will be a minor.

896
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,360
Minor, which will be more like a NUC, which

897
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,560
is going to be really cool.

898
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,320
That's fascinating.

899
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,720
But they have these really big, beefy machines

900
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,160
with multiple GPUs and tons of fast drives.

901
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,720
So you know that's going for some professional use cases,

902
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:28,920
right?

903
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,360
So those are going to be people who maybe are doing machine

904
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
learning or are managing big arrays of storage.

905
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,140
I can see it playing well there, too,

906
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,880
because you also get that nice wood veneer.

907
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,180
So they've moved into a factory.

908
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,880
They've been developing this thing for three years.

909
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,040
And they're a small business.

910
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,000
Just think about the investment that is.

911
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,920
They have reshaped the company in order to build this thing.

912
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,080
As a business, this may be the biggest risk.

913
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,320
It must be the biggest risk he's ever taken.

914
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,960
It's got to be.

915
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,720
I mean, the whole, I mean, now even their physical layout,

916
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,240
right?

917
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,520
There's a couple of small offices and then

918
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
a big old factory building.

919
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,040
And it's also been an ask.

920
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Some of the staff have moved or are moving to get closer now

921
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,040
because there's a different location.

922
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,600
So I said to Carl, is this something

923
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,280
that's going to be around for a while?

924
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,840
Is this the future line of desktop?

925
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,360
So that's exactly what it is.

926
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
This is our next decade of machines.

927
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,960
We'll iterate the parts.

928
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,920
They already have ideas for cool thermal, even cooler

929
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,560
thermal designs.

930
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
They have ideas for future machines.

931
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,760
But right now, they're just trying

932
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,600
to get this first one out, get it built.

933
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,520
This will be the base platform that they're

934
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,920
going to build on top of for the next 10 years.

935
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,680
And they'll own it.

936
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,360
They own the whole line now.

937
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,620
And they even have their own operating system

938
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,360
that runs on it.

939
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,040
They sure do.

940
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,520
You can start to see where Pop!

941
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,880
OS has a bigger part in the picture here now.

942
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,160
And then, of course, that daughter board.

943
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,280
Yeah, the Thaleo IO board, which is a SAS backplane

944
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,640
and also a controller for the thermal system.

945
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,920
And the thing they're doing that's pretty neat about it

946
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,840
is it can do thermals kind of like the way a Mac does

947
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,700
thermals.

948
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,200
So on Macs, they have the SMC controller

949
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,680
that Apple doesn't release drivers for.

950
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,480
You know, you guys know I hate this.

951
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
This is one of the things I caution people.

952
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,680
One of those magic chips.

953
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,600
When they're putting Linux on a MacBook,

954
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,360
you don't get full thermal management.

955
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,160
What you get is the Intel baseline emergency management.

956
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Just to make sure that it doesn't melt in here.

957
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,200
Yeah, because the SMC controller is communicating with Mac OS.

958
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,360
Now, the way System76 has done it is so much better.

959
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,480
So the way System76 has done it is by using open standards.

960
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,040
And it's on this open board that you

961
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,560
can go get all the specs for.

962
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,840
And we have information.

963
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,240
I should put a picture in the blog of it if I haven't.

964
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,640
That's a pretty important component.

965
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,560
You're right, yeah it is.

966
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,800
And it is a SAS backplane.

967
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,160
And they can put multiple cards in if you have multiple drives.

968
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,120
It's pretty cool.

969
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,440
But the best thing it does is it combines data

970
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,480
from the standard Linux temperature interfaces

971
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,760
and the motherboard sensor inputs that are built into the motherboard.

972
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
And it can aggregate all of the information.

973
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
So the motherboard, for example, it

974
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,680
doesn't know what the utilization of the GPU core is.

975
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,080
And it doesn't know what the GPU core temperature is.

976
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,040
But this little card does because the operating system does.

977
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,560
So it can combine the sensors from the motherboard

978
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,600
and the temperature data from the operating system

979
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,880
and then intelligently drive the fans.

980
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,440
So a basic motherboard controlled system

981
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,640
will rev the fans if your CPU is under load.

982
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,720
But your GPU, screw that, that's on its own.

983
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,680
It's got its own fan, I don't give a crap.

984
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,720
But with this system, without you having to do a damn thing,

985
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,040
it will manage all of it.

986
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,400
It will preemptively turn on the case fans up higher

987
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
if the GPU is under a massive load.

988
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,280
It's really cool.

989
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,640
And the other thing that they've done is they've made it really clean

990
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
to run all the SATA wires using this thing.

991
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,840
So you plug everything into that and it's just nice and clean,

992
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,800
minimal wires.

993
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Because they designed the whole thing,

994
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,520
the wiring in there is really well thought out.

995
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,160
So it's all exposed and accessible.

996
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,520
You can change it if you need to.

997
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,400
But it's also not in the way you don't have this big cluster of wires

998
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,520
in the middle of a case that you often find.

999
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,160
Yeah.

1000
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,440
So the performance, I think, is going to be great.

1001
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,520
And the design is literally the best built PC

1002
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
I've ever seen in my life.

1003
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,720
It's just, I mean, I just can't even believe the things

1004
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,600
that they are caring to worry themselves about.

1005
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,520
That's what I come back to.

1006
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,440
This is obviously now their moment.

1007
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,360
In the blog post, I put it this way, it's

1008
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,080
like letting a dog that just desperately wants to run around and play

1009
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,520
finally off the leash.

1010
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,200
And that's what System76 is like now with this.

1011
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,920
They're just doing all the things they've never been able to do.

1012
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,800
And they still have a long journey ahead of them.

1013
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,360
They still have much to learn.

1014
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,800
They still have to figure out how to build laptops.

1015
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,560
And even if this space will work out for them long term or not,

1016
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,640
all of these things are still up in the air.

1017
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,000
But I walked away from that with a confidence

1018
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,960
that they're actually going to pull it off.

1019
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,680
Yeah, I'm betting on that group again.

1020
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,240
That was how I walked away from that.

1021
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,360
OK.

1022
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,000
I may even eventually in 2019 be a Thaleo desktop owner.

1023
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,840
I could really see myself getting one of these for a workstation.

1024
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,960
If they can't, maybe no one can.

1025
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,720
Yeah, that too.

1026
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
That too, I suppose.

1027
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,560
I think still they have a lot on their plate.

1028
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,800
Pulling off Pop OS and building up the factory

1029
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,480
and keeping everybody happy is going to be really tricky.

1030
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,640
And the customer demand will be off the hook

1031
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,160
if they can get laptops working.

1032
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,240
That's going to be.

1033
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, scaling those laptops is obviously

1034
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,800
a whole other world of existence with different criteria.

1035
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,840
Denver itself is a unique place.

1036
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,400
And that plays into a little bit of System76's culture.

1037
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,280
I think the other thing that's happening here

1038
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,320
is the company is owning its identity a little more.

1039
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,080
You see it.

1040
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,520
They have the robot artwork now.

1041
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,240
They have the sort of the sci-fi theme.

1042
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,360
They've brought on Kate, their industrial designer.

1043
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,240
And she's really kind of gotten that whole messaging.

1044
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,200
Nailed it, I think.

1045
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
She's really gotten that all together.

1046
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,080
One thing I heard them say was lean into the weird.

1047
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,000
They're proud of it.

1048
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,840
They are who they are.

1049
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,600
They're proud of their kind of geeky, nerdy culture.

1050
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
And they just embrace it.

1051
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,080
They just embraced it with failure.

1052
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,500
They put the Rocky Mountains on the side of the case.

1053
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,240
They put the Unix Epoch solar system time on the exhaust fan.

1054
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,360
There's all kinds of little small Easter eggs

1055
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,600
throughout everything.

1056
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,640
Even, well, I don't want to spoil it for you,

1057
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,440
but there's Easter eggs throughout a lot of the stuff

1058
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,640
that they've built into this.

1059
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,200
There's just things that a company only

1060
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,560
does when they're really enjoying what they're doing.

1061
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,840
And each person really owns their part of the process.

1062
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,360
They own it in a way where they want

1063
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,860
to bring something unique to it that represents them.

1064
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,880
And it creates a very compelling product.

1065
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
And I hope there's a market for it.

1066
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,400
I hope they sell a whole bunch of Linux running desktops.

1067
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,240
I don't even care what version or desktop.

1068
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,720
I just hope it's a whole bunch of them.

1069
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,040
Because it was pretty neat.

1070
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,160
So I guess we should also maybe revisit some

1071
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,880
of that open hardware stuff, right?

1072
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,480
So some things you can go check out now.

1073
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,560
You have a GitHub repo for the whole thing.

1074
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,520
It's got things like their bill of materials

1075
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,360
and a whole bunch of drawing files

1076
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
that you could go send to get some of the parts made.

1077
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,800
I mean, I think pretty much everything they've got now.

1078
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
I don't know if it's 100% complete,

1079
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,560
but that's what they're working on.

1080
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,440
Yeah, and they will iterate, they say,

1081
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,200
as they learn through the manufacturing process.

1082
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,440
They'll start iterating on those documents.

1083
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,200
So the bill of materials and the technical drawings

1084
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,320
and all of that is what qualifies them for,

1085
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,680
and the daughter board is what qualifies them for,

1086
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,360
is it, I can't remember the acronym,

1087
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,800
but it's an association.

1088
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
OSHW.

1089
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,320
Thank you.

1090
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,840
I was hoping you'd have that.

1091
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,680
The Open Source Hardware Association.

1092
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,840
Yeah, it's an association that seems reputable.

1093
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,600
We did some asking around about people that

1094
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,400
are familiar with the matter.

1095
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,760
And it actually seems like it's a pretty legit organization.

1096
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,960
And you can go reproduce one of these machines.

1097
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,520
You'd have to put your own components in it, your own

1098
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,680
motherboard and stuff.

1099
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,320
But you could.

1100
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,760
You'd have to go get your own wood and do all of that.

1101
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,000
But if you wanted somebody to chair it,

1102
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
it was like, I want one that's all white.

1103
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm like, you could.

1104
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,160
Yeah, I mean, more so than in almost any other case.

1105
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,520
It's a fascinating world we live in,

1106
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,720
where you can go take these plans to a metal shop

1107
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,000
and have them build it for you.

1108
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,920
Who knows if they would be able to do it to the Precision

1109
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,560
System 76 wheel, because this is what they do.

1110
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,160
One of the things they were talking about,

1111
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,320
the usefulness of that, too, is like, OK,

1112
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,960
with the, Carl, what's going on about the unfortunate nature

1113
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,840
of the PCI spec and how not everyone really cleanly

1114
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,000
super follows all exactly the mounting.

1115
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,520
So now there are some open examples of just how

1116
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,960
to go build a computer case and know that components will

1117
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,920
actually fit and that the tolerances are right

1118
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,800
and that you will have built something that's not useless.

1119
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,360
Yeah, listening to them describe the lessons learned there

1120
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,760
was fascinating.

1121
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,320
This, I think, is a bit of a manufacturing success story.

1122
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,040
If this could get more traction, I

1123
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
think there could be some trade magazines that

1124
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,640
could tell a fascinating story here, because System 76 has

1125
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,200
built a modern factory using industrial 3D printers,

1126
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,320
huge, massive laser printers, or, I mean,

1127
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,880
laser cutters that draw more power than my entire RV draws.

1128
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,200
They have ginormous acid baths and huge baking ovens.

1129
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,360
And what they've been able to do is kind of pick and choose

1130
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,700
a more modern build workflow.

1131
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,720
They don't have like a 30-year factory.

1132
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,960
There's not a lot of legacy here.

1133
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,640
No legacy.

1134
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,440
This is brand new.

1135
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,800
So if 3D printing is the best way to build this component,

1136
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,760
we'll 3D print it.

1137
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,000
And if a laser cutter is the best way to do this,

1138
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,560
we'll use this laser cutter.

1139
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,560
And I think, including other more modern materials that

1140
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,080
are going into the build process,

1141
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,760
I think that is, in a way, been their advantage,

1142
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,960
because they were able to go with just stuff that's

1143
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,580
approachable and runs Linux, too, which is also really cool.

1144
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,160
I think there's more to this story

1145
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,600
than what our trade covers.

1146
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,440
I think there's other trade coverage out there

1147
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,640
that could tell a very fascinating story of how

1148
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,560
this, essentially, a startup in Denver.

1149
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,520
It's a very agile move for their business,

1150
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,640
that kind of repositioning.

1151
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,600
Now building computers in the United States, too,

1152
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,640
which is really neat.

1153
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,720
I was really happy to see it's working out for them.

1154
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,320
And I hope they can pull it off.

1155
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,280
And I think if I was going to make a guess,

1156
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,120
they're about a year and a half, two years off

1157
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
from building laptops.

1158
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,560
So I'd say set your expectations accordingly for that one.

1159
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
That's going to be a little while.

1160
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,300
Yeah, just satisfy yourself with a shiny new desktop

1161
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,200
you can show off to your friends.

1162
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,000
It's better anyways.

1163
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,440
It is better anyways.

1164
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,440
You guys know what my biggest thing was, is I was happy to report

1165
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,520
that even under heavy, heavy load, it was not very loud.

1166
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,840
It was very quiet.

1167
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,320
It would make a lovely studio machine, wouldn't it?

1168
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,680
Gosh, I know.

1169
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,600
Get some big, big hard drives in there, too,

1170
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,040
so we no longer run out of space when we're recording.

1171
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,120
Nice and super fast, so it renders in seconds.

1172
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,680
Oh, it'd be great.

1173
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,040
Maybe, maybe one day.

1174
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,120
They're back on my potential buy list.

1175
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,080
I'm back on board.

1176
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,400
I think they're doing great.

1177
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,680
We have a couple of emails that came into the show, Mr. Payne.

1178
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,920
And Mummaroom, feel free to help us answer these

1179
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
as we go through them.

1180
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,720
But we got an XRender tip that came in from Duncan.

1181
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,040
And he says, a couple of episodes back,

1182
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,180
there was some talk on how to automatically handle

1183
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,160
switching between various monitors and dock setups

1184
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,320
and the use of XRender scripts to do that.

1185
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,920
He said, I got this down, and I think

1186
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,640
I found a nicer alternative.

1187
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,320
Take a look at Auto Render.

1188
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,600
In fact, the man page subs it up pretty nicely.

1189
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,160
It basically allows you to plug in monitors, docks,

1190
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,200
configure XRenders required using whatever tool you prefer,

1191
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,920
then use Auto Render to save that config.

1192
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,680
And then next time these specific monitors

1193
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,840
are plugged in, Auto Render sets them up automatically,

1194
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,360
exactly how you had it.

1195
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,080
Take a look at it.

1196
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,040
Thanks, Duncan.

1197
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,880
That's pretty cool.

1198
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
Check out Auto Render.

1199
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,080
And that's Render with just an R at the end, no ER, of course.

1200
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,760
The other one came in, another email

1201
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,440
that came in that is following up on MB going proprietary

1202
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,240
is MiniDLNA.

1203
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,280
This is so cool.

1204
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,240
I didn't grab their name on this one.

1205
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,720
Did you see?

1206
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,600
You might have seen it, Wes.

1207
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,140
If you see it earlier on, let me know.

1208
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,580
But they write, have you ever covered MiniDLNA, guys?

1209
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,740
It's great.

1210
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,360
It's a simple streamer that I've used on Linux and FreeNAS.

1211
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,060
My son has a player on his iPad, and it plays back just fine.

1212
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,640
I use a VPN connection to home, and I stream over Plex.

1213
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,840
And it's actually now known as ReadyMedia.

1214
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,160
MiniDLNA is its old name.

1215
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,240
ReadyMedia is a very simple DLNA universal plug-and-play

1216
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,760
streamer that was originally developed actually

1217
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,600
for ReadyNAS appliances by, I think a, who makes ReadyNAS?

1218
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,720
Netgear employee.

1219
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,680
I believe a Netgear employee originally wrote this

1220
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,480
for ReadyNAS streaming.

1221
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,480
And it's a very minimal DLNA streaming server

1222
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,160
that you can throw on any Linux box.

1223
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,440
And then if you have a television that has DLNA client

1224
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
or a PlayStation or Kodi, you can just stream right to it.

1225
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,800
No Plex, no MB required.

1226
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,080
Very, very nice and simple.

1227
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,520
It's called ReadyMedia, previously MiniDLNA,

1228
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,680
and it's almost guaranteed already in your repo

1229
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,360
as MiniDLNA.

1230
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,560
It wasn't mine.

1231
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,320
Thank you, Eric, for that email.

1232
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,120
Ah, thank you, Eric.

1233
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,440
And then last but not least, a streaming solution

1234
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,400
submitted by our very own Mr. Wes Payne

1235
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,320
has potentially changed travel for the rest of my life.

1236
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,440
This is so cool.

1237
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,380
Longtime listeners of this show have heard Wes and I

1238
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,160
complaining that there's no really good solution for people

1239
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,000
in two remote locations to watch the same video

1240
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,560
file with synchronized play and pause.

1241
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,640
So that way, you can watch together even when you're not

1242
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,520
in the same room.

1243
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,240
Maybe you and friends want to marathon some Star Trek.

1244
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,760
Maybe you and the significant other

1245
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,560
are trying to watch a series while you're traveling.

1246
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
Streama could be just that.

1247
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,140
It's a self-hosted streaming media server.

1248
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,280
And apparently, it has the ability

1249
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
to do live sync watching.

1250
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,680
And we play around with it a bit.

1251
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,760
Yes.

1252
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,640
Now, it is not as full featured.

1253
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,360
One thing MB did a pretty good job of

1254
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,280
is it grew a lot of the features that Plex has.

1255
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,980
Not everything, they weren't one for one,

1256
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,640
and it has some of its own features.

1257
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,880
But it had all that metadata, media information.

1258
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,720
Streama's a bit more limited.

1259
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,560
You won't find all the support for things like Chromecast

1260
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,760
or the popular TV app.

1261
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,040
So for right now, it might not be the solution for everything.

1262
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
Hopefully, there's coming, there's

1263
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,280
pull requests for lots of things.

1264
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,200
They have issues, so obviously, this is known.

1265
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,000
But if you're just watching in the browser,

1266
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
it was very smooth.

1267
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,840
There was a little hiccup here and there,

1268
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,800
but with very little effort, you and I were totally synced up.

1269
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,240
I could pause, you could pause.

1270
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,280
We could scrub, and it would move right along with us.

1271
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,040
It would move the other person's playhead.

1272
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,920
It was so great.

1273
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Setup is really simple.

1274
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,640
It's a Java app, so you drop the Java app

1275
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,320
in a directory with the videos, and it just

1276
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,560
indexes the videos in that directory,

1277
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,280
or do you point it at it?

1278
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,000
You can just point it at it.

1279
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,640
OK.

1280
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,120
It's got a YAML configuration.

1281
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,360
It's not the simplest thing, but it's also not that complex.

1282
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,160
And you just download one file, and it's

1283
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,600
got some decent documentation.

1284
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,480
It could use more fleshing out in some areas,

1285
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,240
but it'll get you up and running.

1286
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,680
And it indexes the videos, so it gives you a web UI

1287
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,800
to choose from to which video to watch.

1288
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,880
Yes, you can manually upload.

1289
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,400
You can also configure it to tell it which directory you're

1290
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,480
trying to store all the stuff.

1291
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:02,880
Yeah, that's right.

1292
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,520
You can drag and drop upload video files.

1293
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,760
That is really cool.

1294
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,880
So it's not going to be probably your one thing.

1295
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,560
It probably won't replace Plex if you're a heavy Plex user,

1296
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,520
but it might be just another handy little tool

1297
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,120
you have out there.

1298
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,400
You've got a few videos, something like that.

1299
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,200
You're watching the season of a show, something like that.

1300
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,880
And the other thing that's really nice

1301
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,600
is you can start it up, you can select it,

1302
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,480
and then you can just generate a share URL.

1303
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,920
And it's a session URL.

1304
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,400
You can send that to people over whatever message.

1305
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
It also supports anonymous access,

1306
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,760
so you could even set it up that way.

1307
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,160
That's pretty cool.

1308
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,480
So that's Streamya, Streama, which is S-T-R-E-A-M-A.

1309
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,920
And of course, we will have a link to that in the show notes.

1310
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,560
And yes, before you even ask, of course, it's open source.

1311
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,200
It's licensed under the MIT license.

1312
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,160
Good find, Wes.

1313
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,520
That is going to change the game for us.

1314
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,960
I'm very excited about that.

1315
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,400
Well, I'll read this next email.

1316
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,680
You work on setting your keyboard on fire, OK?

1317
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,760
Oh, I'm hard at work over here.

1318
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,240
You are.

1319
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,120
I should not drop the keyboard on the ground.

1320
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,320
You're going to.

1321
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,480
It's actually, in some ways, a little more

1322
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,600
tricky that it's two pieces.

1323
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,440
It really is.

1324
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,200
This is not helpful, although it is a neat design.

1325
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,680
It is.

1326
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,760
It looks really cool.

1327
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,080
And the wood is really nice.

1328
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,400
You know what it would go really nice with is a Thalia.

1329
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,880
It sure.

1330
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,560
Oh, man.

1331
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,160
Oh, geez.

1332
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,800
And then there must be wood mice out there, too.

1333
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,760
All right, well, Codyjustcody writes in.

1334
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,920
And he says, if systemd was giving me

1335
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,720
as many damn problems as it's giving you, Chris,

1336
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,960
with that Udev stuff, I would go straight up no systemd,

1337
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,640
and I would ban it from my box.

1338
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,680
Serious question.

1339
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,960
How do you remain patient when stuff like that goes so bad?

1340
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,200
How can you tolerate systemd, Codyjustcody asks?

1341
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,080
Quick recap.

1342
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,760
Previously, on Linux Unplugged, I

1343
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,000
have an issue where when I disconnect my eGPU

1344
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,360
dock, that's a word for you, my eGPU Thunderbolt 3 dock,

1345
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,640
and I boot up my ThinkPad with the dock disconnected,

1346
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,120
systemd Udev goes crazy trying to load

1347
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,040
the drivers for an NVIDIA card that no longer exists,

1348
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,400
because then at that point, I'm on Intel graphics.

1349
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,920
And we came up with a quick workaround,

1350
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,720
but a couple of people wrote in and have been really

1351
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,080
just jumping on the opportunity to abuse systemd here.

1352
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,680
And I kind of want to turn this around

1353
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,720
to the mumble room for a moment.

1354
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,080
Do you guys think that I am just sort of taking the abuse?

1355
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,340
Have I just become complacent with systemd

1356
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,640
and just rolled over and said there's no getting away

1357
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
from it?

1358
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,140
It didn't even cross my mind to go on a systemd rant

1359
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,240
when systemd Udev was eating up all of my CPU.

1360
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,920
Or would it just be junk anywhere?

1361
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,680
I'd like to know what the mumble room thinks.

1362
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,440
Brandon, I don't know.

1363
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
You're a systemd guy.

1364
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,520
What do you think?

1365
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,900
I mean, this is a difficult case that you have a plug-in GPU.

1366
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,720
That is not a normal case.

1367
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,520
Otherwise, I'm so used to systemd now

1368
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,120
that I can't even imagine living without.

1369
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Yeah, that in part might be it.

1370
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,680
Yeah, OK.

1371
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,080
I mean, I think the way it works for me

1372
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,440
is this isn't an issue with systemd so much as it is a,

1373
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,640
yeah, it's a strange setup.

1374
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,180
I think that's a good way to put it.

1375
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,240
And I'm testing an edge case here.

1376
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
That's why I got this eGPU dock.

1377
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,740
I agree.

1378
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,240
It's a complete edge case.

1379
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,200
It's not something that is going to be

1380
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,640
on every system out there.

1381
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,440
You're going to have very few systems that

1382
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,080
are going to have what you've got.

1383
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,820
Yeah.

1384
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,480
And I think that's also why I'm having such performance issues

1385
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,180
with my two external monitors.

1386
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,440
I have two ASUS 2K monitors that are turned counterclockwise

1387
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,960
90 degrees.

1388
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,400
So they're vertical.

1389
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,360
And then in the middle, I have a 1080P built-in laptop display.

1390
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,800
And any time I'm using applications

1391
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
on the vertically turned monitors, they're really laggy.

1392
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,960
Like dragging them around and resizing,

1393
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,200
it's like old Mac OS laggy where the whole, it's like jerk,

1394
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,960
jerk, jerk, jerk as I resize the window.

1395
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,040
It's bad.

1396
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,440
And I think part of it is because of this strange setup.

1397
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,080
I have them rotated.

1398
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,040
They're 2K while the main display is 1080P.

1399
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,360
They're going off of the NVIDIA card.

1400
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,200
This whole setup is odd.

1401
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,360
And it's probably not one that many Plasma developers or KWin

1402
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,960
developers have.

1403
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,960
And I wonder if this isn't an area where, as Linux users,

1404
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,880
we've just kind of come to accept it a little bit.

1405
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,260
Oh, you know, it's not a very common setup.

1406
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,440
It's an edge case.

1407
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,280
But you know, that's not something Mac or Windows users

1408
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,720
have to say as much.

1409
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,280
Yeah, I was about to say, on the other hand,

1410
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,800
there's no reason why you shouldn't

1411
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,720
be able to rotate a monitor and have it just work.

1412
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,200
It should just work.

1413
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,520
But the functional issue is that simply not enough people

1414
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,800
in the community that write software are using that setup.

1415
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,920
But a commercial company would hire somebody,

1416
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,000
would pay somebody to grind that work out.

1417
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,920
Unity 7 is famous for having great multi-monitor support.

1418
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,640
Like, up to six monitors, it could be rock solid.

1419
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,240
And so finally, we asked, why is it?

1420
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,780
Why is it that Unity is able to handle fractional scaling

1421
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,840
high DPI before any desktop did?

1422
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,200
Why does it have great multi-monitor support, even up

1423
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,320
to six monitors, even when you're

1424
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,440
using proprietary graphics?

1425
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,760
Why is it that it's better than everybody else's support?

1426
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
And they looked at us, and I won't say who,

1427
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,180
but they looked at us, and they chuckled a little bit.

1428
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,960
And they said, because Mark paid them to do that work,

1429
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,080
and he bought them a GPU, and he bought them six monitors,

1430
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,040
and he bought them a monitor mount.

1431
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,360
And they set up and connected six monitors to their computer,

1432
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,520
and then they developed software to support it.

1433
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,120
And that's why it was so good.

1434
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,640
So we better hope that IBM is providing Red Hat employees

1435
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,400
with a whole bunch of Thunderbolt trucks

1436
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,000
and vertical monitors.

1437
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,640
Please, please, some vertical monitors.

1438
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,280
They're great.

1439
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,680
If you haven't tried vertical monitors,

1440
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,920
they're the best thing ever.

1441
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,080
As long as you have landscape, too.

1442
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,240
I mean, how many sysadmins do they have?

1443
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
You'd think they would want that for their log files.

1444
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,760
Yeah.

1445
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,720
And this may not be an issue under NomeShell.

1446
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,400
I don't actually know.

1447
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,240
I've never tried it.

1448
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,040
Well, and by the same token, there's

1449
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,160
no reason why Blue Systems shouldn't be helping develop

1450
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,040
Kawin and Plasma to that extent.

1451
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,560
Yeah, and maybe that will happen.

1452
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,240
You're right.

1453
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,980
That could happen.

1454
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,200
But I feel like, really, this is one

1455
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,040
of the greater unspoken challenges of using

1456
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,920
an open source desktop, is there are sometimes deficiencies

1457
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,200
in areas that are not very common configurations that

1458
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,000
bite people that are maybe trying to sustain

1459
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
a certain level of work.

1460
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,680
I'm getting kind of grumpy having

1461
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,920
my computer be really slow.

1462
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,400
And the other thing is it's kicking up my CPU fan now,

1463
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,040
which normally that never happened on this laptop.

1464
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,460
It's not the same machine anymore

1465
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,660
with these external monitors.

1466
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,800
I unplug these monitors and it's fine, but I'm less effective.

1467
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,120
So do I compromise my workflow and become less effective?

1468
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,880
Do I struggle through these issues,

1469
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,000
or do I start desktop hopping again?

1470
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,560
Just not.

1471
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,520
None of those are great options.

1472
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,020
Not ideal.

1473
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,920
Not ideal.

1474
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,920
So Kodi, just Kodi, it's not that I'm taking system D abuse.

1475
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,400
It's that it seems like whenever it comes to desktop computing,

1476
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,120
especially on a laptop, there is just some series

1477
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,940
of compromises you make.

1478
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,160
And you could look at it the other way.

1479
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,520
It's kind of great that I can plug a cable in and have

1480
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,880
a dedicated GPU.

1481
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,640
That's pretty cool.

1482
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,720
And then unplug that cable, and all I have to do

1483
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,560
is run one command, and now I'm rocking an internal GPU that

1484
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,520
has great battery life.

1485
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,640
Like, I get the best of both worlds.

1486
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,160
I just have to make a couple of compromises.

1487
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,960
Yeah, I think that's just the way it goes, Kodi, just Kodi.

1488
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,640
And Chris, there's no reason why you can't keep desktop hopping.

1489
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,440
I mean, me, I have a reason to.

1490
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,040
That's because I want to bring Ubuntu Studio to all desktops.

1491
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,520
OK, fair enough.

1492
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,120
Yeah, your reason is that you need

1493
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,000
to find out what's the best experience for you.

1494
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,080
Yeah, I'm just exhausted by it.

1495
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,080
I'm done with it.

1496
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,360
That's time you could be getting the other work done.

1497
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,200
Yeah, I've got to reload, or I've got to reset a batch.

1498
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,000
Make sure you budget 10% of your year for desktop hopping

1499
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,880
and trying new file systems.

1500
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,720
Yeah, at least you get paid to do it, right?

1501
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,240
That's true, although I also get paid to do other things

1502
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,640
that I'm not doing when I'm reloading distros.

1503
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,680
That's a tough call.

1504
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,560
It's a tough call.

1505
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,540
It's first Linux world problems, first open source world

1506
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,720
problems.

1507
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,400
The reality is, too, once I'm about midday and I'm done,

1508
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,600
I get to a point in my workflow where I'm not really

1509
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,280
rearranging Windows anymore.

1510
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,200
Telegram, Slack, Terminal is going here.

1511
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,160
Firefox is here.

1512
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,000
Chrome is here.

1513
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,640
VLC is here.

1514
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,680
You get to that steady state of, I've

1515
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,800
done all the things I do in a day, and now I'm just operating.

1516
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,000
It's fine, and then I'm not moving stuff around,

1517
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,960
and it's just great.

1518
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,920
Plasma is rock solid that way.

1519
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,640
But in the meantime, getting there

1520
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,360
is a bit of a challenge, so I like to tinker around

1521
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,640
and play with a few different apps on the command line

1522
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,040
to remind me why the hell I love Linux so much.

1523
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,680
So let's do a couple of app picks before we get out of here.

1524
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,960
Our first one comes from a company

1525
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,240
that seems to be releasing a lot of open source software

1526
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,800
these days, right?

1527
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,960
This is a Microsoft project.

1528
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,800
Microsoft.

1529
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,680
It's called Ether, E-T-H-R, and it's a cross-platform network

1530
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,680
performance measurement tool written in Go.

1531
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,480
It's either Rust or Go these days.

1532
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,200
Wait a minute.

1533
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Let's just pause for a second.

1534
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,720
Microsoft is releasing a network performance measurement

1535
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,640
tool for Linux that's open source and written in Go.

1536
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,080
Isn't Go the Google language?

1537
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,520
It sure is, buddy.

1538
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,240
OK, all right.

1539
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,320
I just wanted to make sure I was following this.

1540
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,320
The goal of the project is to provide a native tool

1541
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,560
for network performance measurements of bandwidth,

1542
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,920
connections, packets, latency, loss, and jitter

1543
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,240
across multiple protocols.

1544
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,600
So you can look at TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS,

1545
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,040
and it also works on Windows as well.

1546
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,620
This, though, is pretty neat, because Wes,

1547
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,160
you were showing me a demonstration of throughput

1548
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,880
on HTTP versus TCP.

1549
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,520
Yeah, I mean, it's handy that it has that.

1550
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,420
Now, it doesn't have support for bandwidth measuring

1551
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,600
across everything, like UDP isn't implemented.

1552
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,360
So clearly, they're refining some of their capabilities.

1553
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,760
But it's very much inspired and feels like Iperf 3,

1554
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,600
but with more protocol support.

1555
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,440
And simpler, too.

1556
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,880
You just grabbed the binary and ran it, right?

1557
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,920
Yep.

1558
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,600
The other thing that really shocked me

1559
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,880
is we all know that an HTTP connection has less throughput

1560
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,920
than, say, just a raw TCP connection,

1561
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,720
because you've got all the overhead of the HTTP headers

1562
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,760
and all that.

1563
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,760
But when you ran this tool and you did a test,

1564
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,480
it was like a difference of you could get a sustained 1.5

1565
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,920
megabits over HTTP, and you could get 11 over TCP.

1566
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,720
That's a 10 difference.

1567
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,640
It's neat to see that kind of stuff broken out.

1568
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,560
And you can also see how damn fast UDP is and all that.

1569
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,000
I would actually, I'm thinking that if we still

1570
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,840
have that problem back at the LA office,

1571
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,520
this would be a handy tool for troubleshooting.

1572
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,440
Yeah, the Wi-Fi LAN issue that we were having,

1573
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,600
this would be pretty great.

1574
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,840
So Ether, a cross-platform by your buddies

1575
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,880
now over in Redmond.

1576
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,160
What will they think of next?

1577
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,880
I don't know, man.

1578
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,800
I don't know.

1579
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,500
Now, this next one isn't really an open source project.

1580
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,440
I don't think it might be.

1581
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,160
It's free, though.

1582
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,720
It's the coolest, coolest thing.

1583
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,360
I saw it going around on the web today,

1584
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,840
and I didn't know a super easy way to do this in Linux,

1585
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,280
so I thought this could be a handy tool for people.

1586
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,760
It's called remove.bg.

1587
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,920
And it automatically removes backgrounds

1588
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,560
in five seconds from an image.

1589
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,840
And it looks like it's really good.

1590
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,920
It looks like it's super, super good, actually.

1591
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,880
Like, if you spent hours in GIMP,

1592
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,000
you would probably not do this good.

1593
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,960
It's pretty handy.

1594
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,200
It's not perfect.

1595
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,480
I tested it with some of our System76 photos,

1596
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,180
and it does a decent job.

1597
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,520
If you've got something that's kind of light or like holding

1598
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,360
a glass, well, it does a bad job with that,

1599
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,880
or often hats can throw it off.

1600
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,060
But yeah, it's going to do a better job mostly,

1601
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,880
especially on things like hair, than I'm ever

1602
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,880
going to do in GIMP.

1603
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,280
The hair is the hardest part, yep.

1604
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,720
Yeah, if you have really what I think

1605
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,400
it's looking at contrast and things like that.

1606
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,160
So there has to be some clear differentiators

1607
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,640
between foreground and background for it to work great.

1608
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,460
But this would be a cool way to like meme up

1609
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,360
some of the folks from System76 and put them

1610
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
like in weird spots.

1611
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,760
I'm getting some ideas with.

1612
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,720
I'm getting some great ideas.

1613
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,960
So that is over at remove.bg, and we'll

1614
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,300
have a link in the show notes.

1615
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,000
If you want to get those picks this week,

1616
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,620
and if you've got a pick you'd like to send our way,

1617
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,880
please send it in.

1618
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,120
linuxunplug.com slash contact, or linuxunplug.reddit.com.

1619
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,120
We're monitoring those locations,

1620
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,120
and really kind of want to maybe open up the field.

1621
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,520
We kind of have our grooves, but we'd

1622
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,840
love to get your app picks out there.

1623
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,880
Maybe you're looking at stuff we don't even think about.

1624
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,200
There's just so many, and honestly, it's

1625
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,680
a lot of fun on our side to go just

1626
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,560
evaluate these random things, because very surprisingly often

1627
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,120
you find a diamond in the rough.

1628
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,280
You know, like that mini DLNA that's now ready deal,

1629
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,040
ready whatever.

1630
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,800
Ready media.

1631
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,200
Ready media, thank you.

1632
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,400
That's been in my repository this entire time.

1633
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,780
I just didn't know it was there.

1634
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,480
That's a really good one.

1635
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,240
If you've got stuff that supports DLNA,

1636
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,640
it's not quite as robust as some of the richer programs

1637
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,800
for things like transcoding.

1638
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,200
But if you just already have files,

1639
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,520
and you want to serve them, boom.

1640
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,640
There is a fork of it that will do transcoding.

1641
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,280
Oh, nice.

1642
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,760
Yeah.

1643
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,360
But so what Wes is talking about there

1644
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,960
is one limitation of that mini DLNA pick

1645
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,560
is that it will only play back on the devices that

1646
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,040
support the videos you're put out.

1647
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,520
How to say this?

1648
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,920
It relies on client-side decoding.

1649
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,600
In other words, the TV or the set-top box

1650
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,040
has to have that specific codec and support

1651
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,000
that particular container.

1652
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,720
So if you've got a bunch of weird MKV files,

1653
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,800
it may or may not work.

1654
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,320
The other problem is DLNA is just kind of a finicky thing,

1655
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,800
and a lot of the client implementations

1656
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,000
kind of vary in quality depending on the firmware

1657
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,880
running on your television, for instance.

1658
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,720
But when it works, it works nicely.

1659
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,160
All right, Mr. Payne.

1660
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,840
Here we go.

1661
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,760
Now, two-episode journey in.

1662
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,560
First, bringing it up from its baby firmware,

1663
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,840
an early build of the firmware.

1664
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,320
Flashing it, connecting it from your ThinkPad,

1665
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,480
getting on there over the USB-C connection,

1666
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,080
then loading in the LED control plugins.

1667
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,920
And now, Wes Payne, have you successfully

1668
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,680
lit your keyboardio on fire?

1669
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,280
Look at that.

1670
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:44,960
I sure have.

1671
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,680
Look at that.

1672
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,520
Now, OK, Chris, you're probably wondering,

1673
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,560
it's only half on fire.

1674
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,160
Now, there's actually a bug in the current version

1675
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,360
of the firmware and one of the default plugins for it

1676
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,640
on the very handy Board Manager API

1677
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,120
that they provide to integrate with the Arduino IDE.

1678
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,840
So that's nice if you go get the latest one from Git,

1679
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,480
that's fixed.

1680
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,320
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to do it.

1681
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,040
But half of it's on fire.

1682
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:06,840
That'll spread.

1683
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,400
That'll spread.

1684
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,120
You know, the GIF that I'm playing on the screen

1685
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,680
does not do it justice.

1686
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,040
It's way smoother and nicer.

1687
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,760
It's way nicer.

1688
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,040
It actually kind of looks like fires.

1689
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,920
It changes hues, and it's one color at the base,

1690
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,120
and it flickers and goes up.

1691
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,120
You can imagine it's like a really small window

1692
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,840
on a bigger fire.

1693
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,520
I actually legitimately, when I'm not using my computer,

1694
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,600
would love to have that.

1695
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,880
That'd be fun, wouldn't it, just sitting at your desk?

1696
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,600
Man, that is so cool.

1697
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,160
Well done, Wes.

1698
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,240
That is a big win for you on the old challenge

1699
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,480
you managed to rebuild that thing, basically,

1700
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,640
while also doing a live show.

1701
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,240
So I'm going to say that is a big congratulations.

1702
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:53,680
Way to get our Linux running keyboard back in action.

1703
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,560
That's pretty cool.

1704
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,560
And now we have a new reason to follow Keyboardia.

1705
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,880
We sure do.

1706
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,840
In the meantime, I had no idea that Wes was a pyromaniac.

1707
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,080
Yeah, he sure is over there.

1708
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,840
He's fighting it on fire.

1709
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,320
That's so nice.

1710
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,160
That's totally lit.

1711
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,360
No, it's only half lit.

1712
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,480
Oh, that's horrible.

1713
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,600
That's no good at all.

1714
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,240
All right.

1715
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:12,920
Well, let's see.

1716
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,200
On that particular bombshell, on that particular one,

1717
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,840
let's get the heck out of here.

1718
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,640
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1719
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,400
of the Unplugged program.

1720
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,040
We have a lot in store for the holiday episodes coming up.

1721
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,400
On the 26th, we're going to be doing our predictions

1722
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,960
and answering our previous predictions,

1723
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,880
try to get those in before the new year comes.

1724
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,680
And then on January 2nd, we'll do our reflection,

1725
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,880
our look back on the biggest stories, the biggest

1726
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,040
things that happened to Linux.

1727
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,920
I love these.

1728
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,720
We've got a great list this year.

1729
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,200
And then we'll wrap it up with our magic wand wishes.

1730
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,680
If we could make anything happen in the open source world,

1731
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,280
what would those be?

1732
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,240
And I'd love to hear your thoughts.

1733
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,080
So join us.

1734
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,080
They'll be on the 26th and then on the 2nd.

1735
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,920
But thanks so much for being here this week.

1736
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,320
See you back here soon.

1737
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:57,800
Tuesday?

1738
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,280
I don't know.

1739
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,000
Sometime.

1740
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,800
And the holidays.

1741
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,600
They ruin everything.

1742
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,600
Bahambe!

1743
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:32,480
Yeah, it is.

1744
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,800
This is the last episode before the holidays.

1745
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,360
Happy fricking holidays, everybody.

1746
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,120
What?

1747
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,680
Yeah, the next episode we'll be back, we'll be after.

1748
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,160
Yeah, we should marry Christmas, too.

1749
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,840
That's pretty good.

1750
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,680
That's crazy.

1751
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,240
Man, that is really something.

1752
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,520
Well, we had a week to go.

1753
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,520
Yeah, I guess that's good.

1754
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,080
I think I'm done shopping.

1755
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,040
I never am, though, because I'm so bad.

1756
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,240
Can't be.

1757
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,440
There's always somebodies I forget.

1758
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,440
I always forget somebodies, because I don't want anybody

1759
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,440
to get me anything, really.

1760
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,800
Because all the stuff I want is really expensive anyways.

1761
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,280
And then I live in a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny home.

1762
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,840
You don't need extra stuff that you didn't really want anyway.

1763
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,280
I don't mean to be so.

1764
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,000
The things that I want are, you know.

1765
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,960
I mean, I don't know.

1766
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,160
I always say that, and then people

1767
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,920
think of stuff to give me that's so thoughtful that I don't know.

1768
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
I'm always really like, aw.

1769
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,420
That's probably a short list, though.

1770
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,280
And what it is is I'm just a jerk.

1771
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,400
That's what it is, I guess.

1772
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,720
Mr. Bain, we've got to pick a title.

1773
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,640
Oh, guys, come on.

1774
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,320
We need your help.

1775
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:26,800
Yeah, we do.

1776
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,160
I'm plumb out of ideas.

1777
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,240
Oh, it was fun going to System 76, seeing everybody again.

1778
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,440
Making plans for our big barbecue at Linux Fest.

1779
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,720
That's what I'm looking forward to.

1780
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,760
It's just going to be, I bet you they're going

1781
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,720
to bring some Thalios to Linux Fest.

1782
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,600
They probably should.

1783
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,320
Why would they not?

1784
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:40,960
Oh, man.

1785
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,460
Yeah, Eric, you're coming, aren't you?

1786
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,400
Dude, now that I no longer have a job,

1787
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,240
I can definitely be there.

1788
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,200
Oh, well, it was on the weekend, man.

1789
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,680
Oh, yeah, well, the thing is I worked on the weekends.

1790
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,800
Oh.

1791
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,080
Well, that's worth it right there, then.

1792
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,920
Yeah, well, to be fair, I quit.

1793
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,900
I did not, I was not fired.

1794
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,680
I quit.

1795
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,760
You make sure that's clear.

1796
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,920
That's on the record.

1797
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,760
That's on the record.

1798
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,720
Totally on the record.

1799
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,000
Ben got a good one in there, the keyboard drama.

1800
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,820
If we're making this one about the keyboard,

1801
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,840
that'd be a good one.

1802
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,440
I don't know what I'm going to do about this desktop situation.

1803
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,360
Part of me really thinks I should just use a desktop.

1804
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,640
You might just use a desktop.

1805
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,320
And just keep the laptop for laptop things.

1806
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,760
That seems like a good idea.

1807
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,360
Why didn't I think that?

1808
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,120
That is simpler.

1809
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,880
That works if you have an office to go to,

1810
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,320
but like myself who lives in a trailer, much like Chris

1811
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,960
living in an RV, a moto home.

1812
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,960
Yeah, yeah, for home.

1813
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,800
For home, yeah, you definitely need the laptop.

1814
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,760
But for work, you know, that's so backwards, too.

1815
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,920
It used to be you need the laptop for work

1816
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,680
and then the desktop for home.

1817
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,200
Yeah.

1818
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,240
Now it's the other way around.

1819
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,960
It is totally.

1820
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,360
It is totally the other way around.

1821
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,360
That's, hey, you know, I don't need all the horsepower

1822
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,560
at home because I'm not trying to do as much stuff.

1823
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,760
When I'm in the office, I'm at work,

1824
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,240
I'm trying to get a million things done

1825
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,880
and trying to get it done as fast as possible.

1826
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,160
Yeah, I have a relatively powerful laptop, though,

1827
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,520
so that way, because I need the horses in order

1828
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,600
to do audio processing, clearly.

1829
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,720
I have a rack that's like 10 years old

1830
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,800
I bought for less than $200 that it does great.

1831
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,920
And I just use a laptop that's pretty cheap as basically

1832
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,480
a satellite most of the time.

1833
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,840
And yeah, there you go.

1834
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,800
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking.

1835
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,720
That's exactly what I'm, that is exactly the setup.

1836
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,260
I mean, you could even use a Chromebook

1837
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,360
for what I'm thinking about.

1838
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,560
Exactly.

1839
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,120
Chris, I meant to jump in.

1840
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,800
I'm sorry, Synergy crashed.

1841
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Oh, that's so funny.

1842
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,240
Wait a minute.

1843
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,060
I thought we were supposed to be using

1844
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,920
barrier or whatever it is now.

1845
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,600
I'm still using Synergy One, but.

1846
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,040
All the feels, all the feels.

1847
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,360
Do you have thoughts?

1848
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,200
Do you have thoughts?

1849
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,340
Yeah, so I use.

1850
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,320
By the way, for people listening,

1851
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,640
I asked him if, Brandon, I asked Brandon

1852
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,480
if he thought I was just taking the system to the abuse

1853
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,640
and living with it.

1854
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,220
Yeah, I don't think so.

1855
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,720
But one, I think the, I think most of it is actually.

1856
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,200
Now, Thunderbolt docs for Linux users are pretty new.

1857
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,560
Like I kind of like, you know, for the most part, it's not.

1858
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,400
It is.

1859
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,480
Like it hasn't been mainstream in the Linux world.

1860
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,920
So I think it's more so drive, more problem,

1861
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,120
not necessarily at system D.

1862
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,760
I think it's more driver level.

1863
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,240
Well, so I think so.

1864
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,880
And I am like Nvidia and also Nvidia graphics

1865
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,800
for hot plug from my experiences is terrible.

1866
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,880
Just asking for trouble.

1867
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,660
Well, who expects the GPU to be removed, right?

1868
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,120
But also to dovetail on that,

1869
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,840
because the best Thunderbolt support right now is in GNOME.

1870
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,480
It's not in Plasma.

1871
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,640
It's not in any other desktop.

1872
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,400
It's in GNOME, unfortunately.

1873
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,320
Yeah, that's true too.

1874
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,400
All right, let's do one bonus little quiz game

1875
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,240
before we go for the day.

1876
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,440
All right, chat room, mumble room,

1877
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,640
without looking, don't cheat.

1878
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,960
What do you guess is the third most popular distribution

1879
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,220
on DistroWatch right now?

1880
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,520
Number one is Manjaro.

1881
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,960
Number two is Linux Mint.

1882
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,440
What, without looking,

1883
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,720
is the third most popular Linux distribution

1884
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,360
as ranked by the totally arbitrary DistroWatch?

1885
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,720
I'm just going to plug a boot in his studio.

1886
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,180
Yeah, well done, sir, they're getting their value there.

1887
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,360
Anybody have any guesses?

1888
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,800
Anybody, anybody?

1889
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,760
Yeah, I'll tell you what, I was shocked.

1890
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,160
I was shocked when I saw this.

1891
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,680
Iana Gross is coming in from Bitten.

1892
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,960
A solid guess there, Bitten.

1893
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,680
That is a solid guess.

1894
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,400
Architect comes in with the answer.

1895
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,240
Let's go for it, everybody.

1896
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:46,800
MX Linux, MX Linux, the number three Linux on DistroWatch.

1897
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,920
MX Linux is a desktop-oriented Linux distribution

1898
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,640
based on Debian's Stables branch,

1899
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,520
and it's a comprehensive venture between AntX

1900
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,960
and the former Mepps Linux communities,

1901
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,080
or Meeps, how do you say, what?

1902
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,200
You're laughing at me over there.

1903
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,380
I know I've got it wrong when Louis starts laughing.

1904
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,300
And I didn't plan on reading this.

1905
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,680
It uses XFCE for the default desktop.

1906
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,820
So there you go, Joe.

1907
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,320
You've got a new desktop.
