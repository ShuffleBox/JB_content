WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:09.040
So there's someone in the staging area, Marks, he's from Ubuntu

00:09.040 --> 00:15.140
podcast, he's also a prior OggCamp organizer and he's the guy that has a Steam

00:15.140 --> 00:21.180
controller and did our review and everything. Will you pull him in there

00:21.180 --> 00:26.520
Wes? I assume he probably has a working mic. I assume he probably does. Oh I

00:26.520 --> 00:31.120
should start the show. He has an SM58 and a mixer, yeah. Chat room, please bang

00:31.120 --> 00:36.640
suggest our show underscored. Okay I should probably... Hello Mark. Hello Mark.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.920
Hello Mark, hello Mark. So Mark you had a chance sounds like to try the Steam

00:40.920 --> 00:44.200
controller out, what do you think? Did better than we did. Yeah he got farther

00:44.200 --> 00:47.920
than I did, what do you think of it? I'm really enjoying it, I've tried it with

00:47.920 --> 00:52.960
with games with quite a few different controller schemes and I found yeah it's

00:52.960 --> 00:57.400
generally really successful. Have you tried it with Alien Isolation? No I've

00:57.400 --> 01:01.400
not got that yet, I'm scared to buy it because I'm with games like that I tend

01:01.400 --> 01:03.880
to waste my money because I play for about an hour and then I'm just too

01:03.880 --> 01:06.840
scared to carry on. Yeah that's probably my, I bought, I literally bought it

01:06.840 --> 01:09.400
because I've heard from a few people that it works out of the box with the

01:09.400 --> 01:11.960
Steam controller so I thought okay this is the one to try it on, it looks really

01:11.960 --> 01:15.800
visually impressive. It does look very impressive. But no I tried, I just tried it a few

01:15.800 --> 01:21.040
minutes ago and no dice. So okay so what's the experience like? You get a

01:21.040 --> 01:24.160
game and it has controller support and if it just has controller support you

01:24.160 --> 01:29.040
just start playing immediately? Well if it's got Xbox controller support yeah

01:29.040 --> 01:33.040
you just tell it to emulate a gamepad and it works as an Xbox controller would.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.960
Yeah if it's got Steam controller support like Portal 2 does then it's

01:37.960 --> 01:41.480
even better because actually in-game it tells you to press the Steam controller

01:41.480 --> 01:46.320
buttons rather than the Xbox controller buttons and that's really nice.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.080
I wonder if that would have worked for this one. It seems like for me it's like in a

01:52.080 --> 01:55.640
matter of months like a lot of little issues I ran into are just going to be

01:55.640 --> 01:58.240
totally solved because there probably just be just a couple of updates to some

01:58.240 --> 02:01.760
of these games. Like take Race the Sun for example it seems crazy that doesn't

02:01.760 --> 02:04.880
have a controller support yet. Yep. But you give it a couple of weeks. I was playing

02:04.880 --> 02:09.760
that at Mark's house yesterday, it works fine. Well okay good. So when I went in

02:09.760 --> 02:12.560
there it says it says it doesn't have controller support in the big picture

02:12.560 --> 02:16.120
mode and that you have to you know that that's that's the kind of support I'm

02:16.120 --> 02:19.720
talking about. Not that it doesn't work I just mean that you have to more

02:19.720 --> 02:23.520
integration. Yeah it doesn't seem. I've played a ton of Race the Sun with the

02:23.520 --> 02:26.880
Steam controller but I had to use a community config. And that's not such a

02:26.880 --> 02:31.520
bad solution. It's kind of nice that Valve set it up but it can especially be

02:31.520 --> 02:34.360
maybe be a good first wave to you and tell them. How do you know what's up but

02:34.360 --> 02:37.600
how do you know it's a good scheme? You just sit there and try like four or five of them?

02:37.600 --> 02:42.120
Yeah that's my criticism they need a like rating system so the best ones

02:42.120 --> 02:45.960
propagate to the top. But yeah well you can tell like how many people are

02:45.960 --> 02:50.600
using it but just because it's popular doesn't know. That's not a horrible

02:50.600 --> 02:56.040
indication, at least something though. Yeah go for the second most popular. I

02:56.040 --> 02:59.640
would like somebody that needs to upgrade controller schemes for players

02:59.640 --> 03:08.000
that have actually beat the game. So you just want the macro that will walk you through the game?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.200
You know I don't know why I even bother with this controller stuff because the

03:11.200 --> 03:13.720
mouse and keyboard can't be beat anyways and I shouldn't I shouldn't

03:13.720 --> 03:17.880
bother. Because you can hook up a mouse and keyboard to a Steam machine too.

03:17.880 --> 03:24.920
So challenge accepted. For what? You play you use a keyboard and a mouse and I'll use

03:24.920 --> 03:31.640
the controller and see who wins. Have I tried? No I haven't tried replacing the battery so I should try that huh?

03:31.640 --> 03:34.920
See that's the thing you guys is that the Steam controller is working in big

03:34.920 --> 03:38.760
picture mode and like in the Steam overlay and it does work in games when I

03:38.760 --> 03:42.400
go in there and manually map the buttons. It doesn't, what doesn't seem to be

03:42.400 --> 03:47.680
happening is if I select a controller config it doesn't, the game doesn't seem

03:47.680 --> 03:50.480
to be aware of any controller config or button layout that I've selected and

03:50.480 --> 03:53.960
most games are telling me I don't have a controller connected even though I'm

03:53.960 --> 03:58.920
navigating the picture mode and the rest of the UI with the controller.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.440
Are you on the Steam beta? I don't know what I'm on actually I could check but I

04:02.440 --> 04:06.000
don't, I could be. That does sound like something I would do. It does sound like it.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.480
Yeah I've noticed in the beta updates are coming almost daily on the Steam

04:10.480 --> 04:15.080
client lately and the release notes almost always have you know fix this to

04:15.080 --> 04:19.000
Steam controller, add this to Steam big picture mode. So they're

04:19.000 --> 04:22.200
iterating very quickly right now. Yeah I you know I you know what that is

04:22.200 --> 04:26.200
actually a good point is I should check for updates. That is probably something I

04:26.200 --> 04:30.040
haven't done for a few days on this, for more than a few days on this machine.

04:30.040 --> 04:34.640
Yeah the beta checkbox is really easy to find in the account settings and I

04:34.640 --> 04:38.320
haven't really haven't had any. I'm not currently participating but I don't

04:38.320 --> 04:44.920
think I've really done updates either so. Well you'll probably find when you're

04:44.920 --> 04:49.960
when a controller recognizes your you've got buttons but not the actual controller

04:49.960 --> 04:54.160
mapping I found before I had the Steam overlay turned on it just uses the

04:54.160 --> 04:58.600
mapping that the Steam interface uses which is completely useless for any game.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.920
So yeah there is something going on there where it's it's picking up that

05:01.920 --> 05:05.520
you've got the controller in Steam but it's not applying it in the game. Yeah

05:05.520 --> 05:16.560
okay well. This is Linux Unplugged episode 117 for November 3rd 2015.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that just threw out it's

05:28.600 --> 05:31.640
no beer rule that it just made ten minutes ago right before the show

05:31.640 --> 05:36.400
started. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes you know it is a tasty

05:36.400 --> 05:39.320
beer too thank you for bringing these in. That's my job tempt you to break your

05:39.320 --> 05:42.880
rules. You're a good man I appreciate that. Well it's a good show to break the

05:42.880 --> 05:46.440
rules on coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged show. I tried

05:46.440 --> 05:50.200
out Ubuntu Mate 1510 over the weekend gonna give you my follow-up on that.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.040
We're also gonna hopefully hear a little bit of how odd camp went and then we're

05:54.040 --> 05:57.760
gonna get into some new desktop updates and some really great follow-up

05:57.760 --> 06:00.960
especially for those of you that are looking to do some notes in plain text

06:00.960 --> 06:03.920
and have a nice way to organize them. We're gonna talk a little about the

06:03.920 --> 06:07.720
Cinnamon desktop as well and then we're gonna look at the Volkswagen situation

06:07.720 --> 06:13.000
one more time because there is another big update there and it has caused a

06:13.000 --> 06:17.040
whole new round of mainstream press to say this is why proprietary software is

06:17.040 --> 06:21.120
bad it's amazing. It's hard to believe but. We have a showcase in the show notes

06:21.120 --> 06:25.640
and we'll talk a little bit about that later in the show and then last but not

06:25.640 --> 06:30.680
least today as we're recording this very show Fedora 23 hit the internet's

06:30.680 --> 06:35.240
the new Fedora is out we're gonna have our review on Sunday's Linux action show

06:35.240 --> 06:39.320
live on Friday but we're gonna cover what's new how you can get it and some

06:39.320 --> 06:44.360
of the things that we as a group are looking forward to for Fedora 23 big

06:44.360 --> 06:50.480
release with gnome 3.18 in it. Oh yes very fancy very fancy so we have some

06:50.480 --> 06:54.100
follow-up and some things to get into but before we go any further I got to

06:54.100 --> 07:03.120
bring in our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

07:03.120 --> 07:07.560
hey there it's a big turnout today too so that's really cool that's great to

07:07.560 --> 07:11.120
have you now I hope I hope some of you are also breaking the no beer rule that

07:11.120 --> 07:15.520
was implemented ten minutes ago and then then also shattered shattered two

07:15.520 --> 07:20.440
minutes ago I hope you're breaking that right now with me so I have a I have one

07:20.440 --> 07:25.120
bullet point in the show notes for this very very important bit of follow-up

07:25.120 --> 07:30.160
this week we have assembled a crack team of on the scene reporters from odd camp

07:30.160 --> 07:36.800
2015 and I'm hoping that I know Pope is here I believe mark is here from from

07:36.800 --> 07:42.920
the by some some other podcast I'm told and some actually all these guys from

07:42.920 --> 07:46.200
some other podcast I'm told although those are probably rumors they're

07:46.200 --> 07:49.360
probably not even in the u.s. and they're gonna they're gonna give us a

07:49.360 --> 07:53.400
round of what happened at odd camp so who should I give the floor to first I

07:53.400 --> 07:57.520
think you should hand on to mark first because I understand Pope is having

07:57.520 --> 08:01.080
difficulty with his PC well you know he you know what that's so funny since he

08:01.080 --> 08:03.440
was giving me a hard time running arch before the show started isn't that

08:03.440 --> 08:09.800
appropriate I actually think we should give it to mark to those since mark made

08:09.800 --> 08:13.000
the special trip here it's his first time here so why not throw him under the

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
bus right away that only seems fair that's our policy yeah that's that's

08:16.000 --> 08:20.120
though we like nice of you yeah yeah so mark welcome to Linux unplugged and tell

08:20.120 --> 08:23.440
us a little bit for those who didn't listen listen last week what is odd camp

08:23.440 --> 08:28.080
and how the heck did it go well camp is we call it a free culture on conference

08:28.080 --> 08:33.120
so it's an event that's been running for the past six or seven years I've lost

08:33.120 --> 08:37.280
count now but basically we we hire out of venue and then we convince a bunch

08:37.280 --> 08:41.320
of people to somehow turn up and come up with a schedule and give a load of

08:41.320 --> 08:45.920
talks about anything from well anything kind of community driven really so we

08:45.920 --> 08:50.280
have people talking about Raspberry Pi's we have people talking about running in

08:50.280 --> 08:55.600
parks at the weekend we had panel discussions we had some live podcast

08:55.600 --> 09:02.160
recordings hardware hacking all sorts wow that is like a pick your choice

09:02.160 --> 09:04.800
there's gonna be something there to delight any geek that would listen to

09:04.800 --> 09:07.840
this show I think I love the generality you know like it's not it's not so

09:07.840 --> 09:10.200
constrained you can kind of just come and share the cool thing you're doing

09:10.200 --> 09:14.540
yeah and so I bet there's a lot of Linux that works up in that crowd that comes

09:14.540 --> 09:17.760
up so how did it go it was a good event it was a good turnout did you enjoy

09:17.760 --> 09:23.720
yourself I heard rumors of shouting etc. mainly in the evenings we went to some

09:23.720 --> 09:27.960
really cool venues in Liverpool which were converted warehouses and being a

09:27.960 --> 09:30.800
bunch of geeks relving getting up and dancing of course we wanted to stand

09:30.800 --> 09:34.120
around and talk about geeky things all evening and they kept on turning the

09:34.120 --> 09:38.920
music up so by by the mornings we were a little bit horse that's hard still

09:38.920 --> 09:47.120
recovering the reason I think system D is actually a good idea I could see what

09:47.120 --> 09:53.600
it was like interspersed with I'd like another beer so how does it compare to

09:53.600 --> 09:59.920
last year's I like odd camp 14 and 13 oh that's a good question so I'll camp 13

09:59.920 --> 10:05.440
was at the same venue it was mmm probably comparable actually I mean we

10:05.440 --> 10:09.560
had some different things going on in terms of exhibitors but we had you know

10:09.560 --> 10:15.200
a similar sort of variety of talks last year's was in a different venue and had

10:15.200 --> 10:21.560
probably more of a focus on the the sort of exhibition space as well there was

10:21.560 --> 10:25.240
some really cool like we had a load of hack spaces there last year this year we

10:25.240 --> 10:30.440
had we had a few sort of hardware things and we had the Ubuntu stall and the

10:30.440 --> 10:34.080
fedora stall across from each other in the in the exhibition space but we also

10:34.080 --> 10:36.880
had we also had an intro where exhibiting which was really cool with

10:36.880 --> 10:40.000
their Ubuntu laptops that they're selling now yeah I saw a few pictures

10:40.000 --> 10:46.800
online of those and I did I also see a fedora laptop there too you might have

10:46.800 --> 10:51.520
done we didn't have anything to do yeah right yeah yeah I made peace with my

10:51.520 --> 10:59.280
fedora brethren and they were running fedora 23 and gnome 3 on a large a large

10:59.280 --> 11:04.560
panel and then on a laptop they were running fedora demonstrating their

11:04.560 --> 11:10.080
alternate spins and they had the Marte desktop running there so I decided to

11:10.080 --> 11:13.680
to make my peace with fedora and introduce myself to John Archer and he's

11:13.680 --> 11:19.940
a lovely bloke the ability to stand immediately opposite fedora Stan and

11:19.940 --> 11:25.640
power through the day we we exchanged merchandise stickers and pens and badges

11:25.640 --> 11:32.280
and things and made up a football in no man's land nice very good so I so it

11:32.280 --> 11:35.600
sounds like an event that was a well-attended poppy how did the live

11:35.600 --> 11:38.120
tracker end up working out I checked in at one point but I couldn't tell if it

11:38.120 --> 11:43.200
was working or not yeah it was kind of hit and miss we had an Ubuntu phone

11:43.200 --> 11:47.720
polling our position to the website and various people would tell us every so

11:47.720 --> 11:52.920
often when it was broken which was usually because I'd poorly written the

11:52.920 --> 11:57.240
code on the phone and it would run out of memory as it was logging far too

11:57.240 --> 12:00.600
excessively that was my fault that's actually pretty still neat still though

12:00.600 --> 12:08.840
but this is not indicative of other apps performance right yeah exactly a little

12:08.840 --> 12:14.140
disclaimer that's still a neat thing though I like that I think I think we

12:14.140 --> 12:19.000
should seriously come up with a legitimate live tracker app for Ubuntu

12:19.000 --> 12:22.760
phone and then in a future road trip when I go somewhere I'll use that to

12:22.760 --> 12:26.280
track where I'm going because I have this silver cloud thing for now but I

12:26.280 --> 12:31.240
could swap that out anytime anytime all right so I wimpy and poppy or mark

12:31.240 --> 12:34.800
anything else from odd cam it sounds like it was a pretty fun event I kind of

12:34.800 --> 12:39.080
want to go there yeah me too yeah one of the one of the cooler hardware hacks

12:39.080 --> 12:43.080
that I saw was a nerf gun range which someone had set up there was a few years

12:43.080 --> 12:48.000
ago someone had built a minecraft crane which picked up boxes and made them into

12:48.000 --> 12:51.760
sort of minecraft style objects and the same guy had brought the boxes along

12:51.760 --> 12:55.800
made these these sensors which he put inside so if you shot them with a nerf

12:55.800 --> 13:00.400
gun it activated the sensor and then he had that hooked up to this RFID tag

13:00.400 --> 13:04.240
system to identify who you were and it tracked your score and tweeted you wow

13:04.240 --> 13:09.120
and there was a prize for the three top scores the prizes were won by these

13:09.120 --> 13:13.900
three kids who discovered an exploit in the system and and managed to get them

13:13.900 --> 13:17.200
skilled score so themselves scores of about half a billion compared to my

13:17.200 --> 13:22.760
sixteen is there a you know a lot of times when I attend a conference like

13:22.760 --> 13:26.280
this even when there's like you know everything from software to hardware and

13:26.280 --> 13:30.360
community and and just the open culture itself is really the highlight a lot of

13:30.360 --> 13:32.840
times though you can't help but walk away and go boy I kind of feel like

13:32.840 --> 13:37.800
there was a overarching theme or an elephant in the room and is there one

13:37.800 --> 13:41.480
like that at odd camp is there like a something is really kind of the buzz

13:41.480 --> 13:45.400
this year or there's a there's like it feels like a bubble or a trend that you

13:45.400 --> 13:50.800
observed or is it really pretty dispersed there was one there was one

13:50.800 --> 13:56.480
emerged as a theme it wasn't planned but there was a lot of discussion about

13:56.480 --> 14:01.280
online privacy yeah I was wondering they were that was that was the topic for the

14:01.280 --> 14:07.660
panel discussion and Linux voice also recorded a live podcast on the second

14:07.660 --> 14:12.320
day and that was also their discussion piece very interesting audience yeah

14:12.320 --> 14:16.160
that makes sense I was that's actually that was when I asked the question that

14:16.160 --> 14:19.120
was in the back of in the back of my mind mark were you gonna chime in with

14:19.120 --> 14:25.040
something too I was going to say exactly what Martin just said actually privacy

14:25.040 --> 14:31.520
and online and is it is it like from is it from the state or is it just privacy

14:31.520 --> 14:34.760
in general is it is it if you abstract it out from there is it is it like

14:34.760 --> 14:39.400
Snowden type stuff or what is it the overall theme that was that was kind of

14:39.400 --> 14:42.560
what what it came out it was we were talking about whether the cloud is a

14:42.560 --> 14:46.920
good thing or a bad thing basically and then we moved on to basically do people

14:46.920 --> 14:50.760
care about what happens to their data online and should they care and can we

14:50.760 --> 14:54.720
make them that was the where it all really went but it does seem like we

14:54.720 --> 14:58.680
care as a community the people that Linux that the average Linux user does

14:58.680 --> 15:03.360
care and and also the average Linux user seems to be better positioned than most

15:03.360 --> 15:07.920
users to do something about it either from a technical knowledge set or by the

15:07.920 --> 15:12.640
very fact they're using an open system and so it does seem to be coming up

15:12.640 --> 15:15.960
more and more of these conferences because we're the type of user to think

15:15.960 --> 15:19.080
about this kind of thing we're also the kind of user that is willing to live

15:19.080 --> 15:22.920
with password managers and dual you know a factor two-factor authentication and

15:22.920 --> 15:27.280
and and we're also the kind of user that cares about these kinds of things so

15:27.280 --> 15:30.640
it's a really interesting cross-section that I find when I go to these kinds of

15:30.640 --> 15:35.280
conferences so that's interesting up there so yeah one of the talks that is

15:35.280 --> 15:39.680
typical for talks to get composed as a result of a conversation the night

15:39.680 --> 15:45.000
before and that was you know typical of our camp this year and John Spriggs did

15:45.000 --> 15:49.920
a piece about squirrel SQL which is a two-factor authentication Gibson's thing

15:49.920 --> 16:00.520
right yeah is that yes really yeah I know which is why I was surprised John

16:00.520 --> 16:06.200
did specifically say the focus on the protocol and not who came up with it yeah

16:06.200 --> 16:09.720
well that mean that is very true right I mean if the code is good code then

16:09.720 --> 16:13.040
that's and if it's it's if it's a good protocol then that's and it's open and

16:13.040 --> 16:20.360
we can take it to you know so is this so okay be honest with me now be be honest

16:20.360 --> 16:22.800
with me is this something that I should try to make it to next year because

16:22.800 --> 16:27.240
that's a big commitment I would have to fly out there lots of money etc etc does

16:27.240 --> 16:30.760
that seem like I mean how many I mean really come on yeah how many people are

16:30.760 --> 16:36.480
we talking well the first thing I'll say 400 oh that's a really nice sweet spot I

16:36.480 --> 16:40.360
like that size that's you get you know you get more than 2,000 it's just crazy

16:40.360 --> 16:44.840
you're looking enjoy it oh that oh that's all I'll say regardless of how

16:44.840 --> 16:50.880
big the audience is you would definitely enjoy it yeah yeah and although it's a

16:50.880 --> 16:54.880
two-day event so there's the the Saturday and the Sunday this time there's

16:54.880 --> 16:58.360
actually like four days packed into that because there's the main events that

16:58.360 --> 17:02.600
happen during the day and then there's the evening events that start at about

17:02.600 --> 17:06.400
six o'clock in the evening and go on to about midnight or two o'clock in the

17:06.400 --> 17:11.260
morning so there's sort of like four events over those two days oh that is

17:11.260 --> 17:15.120
fun I like that now there's not I can rank is as good as the sort of the event

17:15.120 --> 17:19.400
itself now you know that is always so true especially when it's around three

17:19.400 --> 17:23.440
four hundred people because when you get bigger than that it's just it's too much

17:23.440 --> 17:28.200
white noise literally huh now is there a Spartacus there is there a spot I can

17:28.200 --> 17:32.720
park the rover cuz UK yeah I'm gonna yeah yeah well I know I mean a UK

17:32.720 --> 17:38.360
dedicated UK right right oh that's interesting roads are quite narrow okay

17:38.360 --> 17:40.960
and you might have heard that we actually drive on the correct side of

17:40.960 --> 17:45.280
the road oh yeah I am worried about that yeah that is gonna change my that's

17:45.280 --> 17:49.200
gonna change my world if I have to go over there well I I thank you guys for

17:49.200 --> 17:52.280
coming in here give me the update that is really cool any other things you want

17:52.280 --> 17:59.240
to mention about the about our camp 15 before we soldier on I know I think it's

17:59.240 --> 18:02.680
it's one of those things that at the end of the at the end of the Sunday we all

18:02.680 --> 18:06.080
get together as there's a guy said there's like the end there's multiple

18:06.080 --> 18:10.480
things to get involved with and the very final thing on the Sunday is a few

18:10.480 --> 18:14.160
relaxing beers where we discuss what we're gonna do next year and so we'll

18:14.160 --> 18:17.640
keep you informed about what's gonna happen next year and when it will be and

18:17.640 --> 18:20.880
where it'll be so you can you know you can plan your flight and everything yeah

18:20.880 --> 18:24.200
do let me know and you know it's funny and and I I know I make this point too

18:24.200 --> 18:29.640
often but and even as we sit here with a virtual log which is pretty awesome

18:29.640 --> 18:34.040
like the mumble and Google Hangouts and all this stuff are pretty damn good

18:34.040 --> 18:39.080
tools to connect with people and we can have really great conversations but

18:39.080 --> 18:43.720
there is just there is something about when you go to an event like this and

18:43.720 --> 18:49.640
everybody there speaks your language they know like what a colonel is they

18:49.640 --> 18:53.480
know what you know a cloud what a cloud computer really is when I'm talking

18:53.480 --> 18:56.440
about the cloud they know I'm really talking about somebody else's server at

18:56.440 --> 19:03.200
a data center and you all are on on the same page and is if you walk around in

19:03.200 --> 19:05.840
your life and you're like kind of the technical person in your family like

19:05.840 --> 19:08.680
you're the you're the person that fixes things in your family or you're in the

19:08.680 --> 19:14.800
tech department at your work you kind of you almost lose touch with how amazing

19:14.800 --> 19:18.720
it is to be around other people that value the same things you value and

19:18.720 --> 19:24.200
appreciate the same things that you appreciate and and also want to want to

19:24.200 --> 19:27.760
maybe even debate the nuance with you and to do that in person mumble really

19:27.760 --> 19:32.120
does a great job of this you know IRC and Hangouts do a great job of this but

19:32.120 --> 19:36.760
nothing nothing does it like in person and like you increase the social stuff

19:36.760 --> 19:41.480
yeah yeah it is it's a huge increase in bandwidth between two people or a whole

19:41.480 --> 19:46.120
group of people and it is really exciting and what you realize is we're

19:46.120 --> 19:51.760
not as bad as that BSD community makes us look exactly right we're nice people

19:51.760 --> 19:58.160
yeah we are so that's what I take away every time all right so I just wanted to

19:58.160 --> 20:01.280
really quickly do a little follow-up from Sunday's Linux action show we got

20:01.280 --> 20:05.480
an email in asking how Noah and I manage our notes and I said well I always do

20:05.480 --> 20:08.880
plain text files and I try to write them in markdown and that's kind of my base

20:08.880 --> 20:13.900
requirements well we got a great recommendation and I I'm sorry I did not

20:13.900 --> 20:18.680
grab the name of the reddit user who submitted it but it is a Q own notes

20:18.680 --> 20:22.600
it's an open source notepad for Linux and those other desktops that works

20:22.600 --> 20:26.920
together with the notes application of own cloud it's a desktop app though so

20:26.920 --> 20:31.840
this is what's really cool is it's a desktop application that it's a GTK app

20:31.840 --> 20:37.280
from what I can tell that has markdown support and it has a change tracking use

20:37.280 --> 20:41.080
your own notes you can sync them over to other devices you can then log into your

20:41.080 --> 20:44.440
own cloud instance and edit them with a local own cloud app but even if you're

20:44.440 --> 20:50.600
on like an iOS device you can if you have own cloud and access like to the

20:50.600 --> 20:53.880
file system you can just edit it with any markdown editor like it is not

20:53.880 --> 20:58.240
lost to own cloud so this is really really cool and I've made a big stink

20:58.240 --> 21:02.080
about own cloud before I have you caught that just a little bit yeah I basically

21:02.080 --> 21:08.600
bailed on own cloud you certainly text a few months ago yeah basically I just

21:08.600 --> 21:13.280
pushed it to the limits with way too much data and I bailed but I only bailed

21:13.280 --> 21:17.760
and I don't think I made this point very clear I only bailed for file sync I'm

21:17.760 --> 21:20.880
still using own cloud and that's one area where it has the most competition I

21:20.880 --> 21:26.640
would say right I'm yeah yeah I would agree and and honestly I think same

21:26.640 --> 21:31.280
thing that's a better job I would agree with that yeah so but I'm still using it

21:31.280 --> 21:35.920
for car DAV and Kel DAV what do you what do you see you have a Nexus 5 are you

21:35.920 --> 21:40.520
are you all in on the Google at the moment my main counter is I do have an

21:40.520 --> 21:44.280
own count own cloud instance that needs to be updated and yeah but I've been

21:44.280 --> 21:47.200
pressed with it in the past have you considered trying to transition from

21:47.200 --> 21:50.720
Google services to own cloud or is it just not worth it no I think it's

21:50.720 --> 21:54.960
totally worth it I need to move email emails of the one thing and then I think

21:54.960 --> 21:58.640
I would consider moving yeah moving the rest of my investment so I did you know

21:58.640 --> 22:02.360
it's funny you say that because I went the opposite route I moved my calendar

22:02.360 --> 22:07.320
and my and my access my calendar and my my address book and I haven't moved

22:07.320 --> 22:11.240
email yet and so this is why for me I kind of like this QO notes because I

22:11.240 --> 22:15.200
still have it on cloud instance sitting around that I could use to sync my notes

22:15.200 --> 22:19.040
but on the back end it's all just text files to markdown files which are text

22:19.040 --> 22:21.600
files exactly so yeah I love the text files this is a really cool

22:21.600 --> 22:26.540
recommendation yeah QO notes and it's a it is a as you probably guessed it is an

22:26.540 --> 22:31.680
own cloud app but it really is just a matter of syncing with text files and

22:31.680 --> 22:35.520
also with text to do was another recommendation that came in a lot and if

22:35.520 --> 22:38.020
you haven't caught this Sunday's Linux action show the question was is how do

22:38.020 --> 22:43.720
we manage our to dues and I said text files how do you manage your to-do list

22:43.720 --> 22:48.680
text files and I use task warrior for a lot of my work stuff what yes task

22:48.680 --> 22:53.200
warrior mm-hmm is this a desktop Android app command line I believe they have

22:53.200 --> 22:58.960
some I believe they have some hold on a second did you just did you just change

22:58.960 --> 23:04.400
my life mom or anybody the mom reviews task warrior task warrior hold on hold

23:04.400 --> 23:10.000
on yeah obviously this is a command line to do this sounds like Linux action show

23:10.000 --> 23:15.520
app pick material to me you jerk West how have you been sitting on this and

23:15.520 --> 23:18.680
not telling me that there is a to-do app for the command line wait till you find

23:18.680 --> 23:22.440
out that you can run your own server sync server on a digital ocean droplet

23:22.440 --> 23:31.760
oh I'm very excited all right so this is how you do it yeah okay okay now for

23:31.760 --> 23:35.200
everybody naturally hold on before West goes any further everybody listening

23:35.200 --> 23:39.020
we're gonna play a little game where if Chris makes this is epic on Linux action

23:39.020 --> 23:41.720
show we're all gonna pretend like we didn't already hear about this all right

23:41.720 --> 23:47.640
so tell me about this cuz I'm very excited so you use task warrior with a

23:47.640 --> 23:51.600
digital ocean droplet and you go to the command line to set your to dues yeah

23:51.600 --> 23:55.560
yeah and it really is just like a CLI interface you know like task add and

23:55.560 --> 24:00.440
then you can specify like project you know project at work or your home life

24:00.440 --> 24:03.800
or whatever and then an arbitrary string and they have you know you can set

24:03.800 --> 24:08.160
priorities you can set due dates and then I just task sync and it syncs up

24:08.160 --> 24:12.080
that even there's a Android app called Miracle which does task but it

24:12.080 --> 24:16.400
integrates with the task warrior server oh okay okay you can have the same thing

24:16.400 --> 24:20.240
on your phone okay but without the command line okay all right so now

24:20.240 --> 24:26.320
what's the server setup like is it like so on the scale of a Quasal client to I

24:26.320 --> 24:32.120
don't know smoke ping how difficult is it to set up I would say similar to

24:32.120 --> 24:37.200
Quasal you don't need a database back or quality area right yeah no database so

24:37.200 --> 24:40.360
you don't have a database or anything like that you do have to set up some

24:40.360 --> 24:45.400
primary error private key infrastructure okay but it's really not that bad it's

24:45.400 --> 24:48.200
mostly you know you pretty much just assemble you have to set up a few

24:48.200 --> 24:52.720
configs and set the right config file so that it allows the Miracle app from

24:52.720 --> 24:55.720
your Android phone but once you've got that in place it really just works oh

24:55.720 --> 25:00.720
that's funny so here's another option there's a basically there's a command

25:00.720 --> 25:07.680
line tool called to do to do text yeah yeah right and it's it's a bash script

25:07.680 --> 25:11.360
so it's essentially this it does the same stuff that task warrior does but

25:11.360 --> 25:18.000
task warrior is a lot more like robust and features so if you've ever used to

25:18.000 --> 25:20.760
do that text it's very similar in the way that I mean the main thing about to

25:20.760 --> 25:25.240
do that text is you got to provide your own sync mechanism all right right so

25:25.240 --> 25:28.040
you have to do same thing or really Dropbox is what I think it if you're

25:28.040 --> 25:30.600
gonna use well no if you do the same thing that task warrior does where you

25:30.600 --> 25:33.120
put it on a server you can do the same thing with to do that text put it on a

25:33.120 --> 25:36.720
server and then just oh see so what I'm thinking about so I mean when I say that

25:36.720 --> 25:39.840
what I'm talking about is from the perspective of mobile applications the

25:39.840 --> 25:44.200
mobile apps that use to do that text have always they always want Dropbox

25:44.200 --> 25:50.040
right except actually there's this awesome app I found because I built my

25:50.040 --> 25:54.480
own to do that text app like structure because I don't like the basic structure

25:54.480 --> 25:58.640
I wanted to have a massive customization where one to do that text file is not

25:58.640 --> 26:05.160
enough for me so I currently have like 30 damn dude that's impressive yeah I

26:05.160 --> 26:09.200
have I built my own bash script to to cut to manage all of them too so it has

26:09.200 --> 26:15.200
like automatic archiving from like a huge list of things anyway I'm actually

26:15.200 --> 26:21.720
gonna be releasing it at some point probably well I made it for myself and

26:21.720 --> 26:24.680
then I told people about it and they're like oh wow that's cool we should give

26:24.680 --> 26:29.760
it to me like I didn't it kid for everybody so it's complicated that's

26:29.760 --> 26:35.920
what Linus said about Linux what's he said about getting it still true well

26:35.920 --> 26:39.040
there's the the other thing is that the reason about that I was because there's

26:39.040 --> 26:42.800
a fact because I did this I wanted to find a mobile version and there's this

26:42.800 --> 26:50.240
there's a it's called simple tasks and it has it's simple task wire of cloud

26:50.240 --> 26:54.960
and they're simple tasks cloudless so if someone doesn't want a cloud storage

26:54.960 --> 27:00.140
they can use any sync they want and sync it to their phone directly so I have

27:00.140 --> 27:06.080
like a custom sync thing set up for that but there's also the cloud version you

27:06.080 --> 27:09.440
can choose whatever cloud you want you don't actually have to be stuck to drop

27:09.440 --> 27:15.000
box okay yeah huh so so there's to do that text and task warrior as two

27:15.000 --> 27:20.080
follow-ups to the email we got in the Linux action show on Sunday and the task

27:20.080 --> 27:23.280
warrior thing is really that's fascinating to me I'm gonna check that

27:23.280 --> 27:28.440
out I like that a lot now no yeah go ahead yeah yeah the the to do not text

27:28.440 --> 27:35.560
thing if someone wants a GUI that go for it app that was a epic a couple weeks

27:35.560 --> 27:40.400
ago or a few weeks ago that one is compatible with to got text so you could

27:40.400 --> 27:44.440
have command line and you can also have a nice giveaway if you want it I I don't

27:44.440 --> 27:49.480
make I don't mean to make a popiar token Ubuntu phone guy but I was just gonna

27:49.480 --> 27:53.280
throw this your way poppy because when I when whenever we're talking about like a

27:53.280 --> 27:57.180
task management app or a calendar management app I always think well what

27:57.180 --> 28:00.480
if I want to bail from Android what if I want to bail from iOS what are you

28:00.480 --> 28:03.800
using poppy when you are when you're using your Ubuntu phone what are you

28:03.800 --> 28:09.240
using in that environment for task management to do or he doesn't have to

28:09.240 --> 28:12.480
be like to-do list even just like setting reminders and things like that

28:12.480 --> 28:18.520
what are you using so that's a great question and the reason I use the app I

28:18.520 --> 28:23.120
use is because I always used Evernote in the past so I use Evernote on the

28:23.120 --> 28:29.320
desktop and Evernote on the web and we have a notes client that can optionally

28:29.320 --> 28:33.040
sync to Evernote so I just synchronize all my notes with Evernote and then I've

28:33.040 --> 28:40.000
got those local but yeah there's at least three task managers in the Ubuntu

28:40.000 --> 28:43.120
store so you know if you don't want to use that one there are lightweight ones

28:43.120 --> 28:48.640
it's HTML 5 ones or you could just go and get the task binary stick it on your

28:48.640 --> 28:52.000
phone and open that in a terminal if you really wanted to yeah you know that's

28:52.000 --> 28:55.120
but I want to talk about that that's the elephant the room for me for all of this

28:55.120 --> 28:58.560
and this is something I don't say usually well I've mentioned it before

28:58.560 --> 29:03.600
but for me if I want to if I want something and I don't want to forget it

29:03.600 --> 29:09.760
for a really long time and I'll give you an example like when I know I'm I'm

29:09.760 --> 29:14.000
gonna need to know the VIN number of my truck yes for probably about eight nine

29:14.000 --> 29:17.240
years that's probably how long I'll own that truck and that's how long I own my

29:17.240 --> 29:21.400
last truck and so there are many times when you're getting insurance or you're

29:21.400 --> 29:24.360
setting things up that you need to recall the VIN number of your vehicle

29:24.360 --> 29:28.840
you want it easily accessible so for that kind of info like that really long-term

29:28.840 --> 29:33.680
for remember forever kind of stuff I am still today using Evernote and I'm just

29:33.680 --> 29:38.520
choosing to yeah from a smart device although to be fair the kind of stuff

29:38.520 --> 29:43.720
like that which I would I would think is slightly private like I don't know VIN

29:43.720 --> 29:47.840
number of vehicles probably not that bad because it's probably like that I have

29:47.840 --> 29:51.680
like I have all the other information in there that is like kind of I'm not super

29:51.680 --> 29:55.960
comfortable with it being with a third party right so for those I have a GPG

29:55.960 --> 30:00.920
encrypted text file on my local machine which is backed up in various places but

30:00.920 --> 30:06.020
no you know it's GPG encrypted so I feel okay about that and obviously the phone

30:06.020 --> 30:10.800
you can use GPG on that yeah right I was gonna say I keep a lot of stuff in text

30:10.800 --> 30:14.480
files with syncing as it is now so yep yep and using I've been ever since I

30:14.480 --> 30:17.360
started playing with pass I started realizing why don't I just do this more

30:17.360 --> 30:20.480
often just encrypt this stuff and then sync it everywhere and I don't care

30:20.480 --> 30:24.320
because I'm using GPG and I trust GPG and syncing has encryption as well in

30:24.320 --> 30:28.960
transit yeah yeah I but I fundamentally trust GPG yes I did as well same thing

30:28.960 --> 30:32.960
I their encryption I'm sure is great it's just like that yeah yeah good at

30:32.960 --> 30:37.200
least it's not plain text exactly so you get me you get me I remember many other

30:37.200 --> 30:43.040
thoughts on that topic before we move on yes I do on the subject of notes I've

30:43.040 --> 30:47.280
actually been looking and I don't even know if this exists for an application

30:47.280 --> 30:52.760
that you type everything and mark down for the notes and everything and it

30:52.760 --> 30:58.120
looks like G note or Xim and has support the sync to like a Google Drive or

30:58.120 --> 31:03.720
Dropbox so that you know you know maybe late it's later at some point you can

31:03.720 --> 31:08.680
access those notes on your Android device yeah you can basically accomplish

31:08.680 --> 31:14.440
that today just using G editor Kate or whatever K right or whatever and just

31:14.440 --> 31:18.120
saving it to a Dropbox or sync thing or bit torrent sync folder and then pulling

31:18.120 --> 31:22.360
that up on your mobile device is there a good mobile markdown editor oh yeah a

31:22.360 --> 31:26.080
lot I assume there must be yeah lots I can't remember off the top my head for

31:26.080 --> 31:29.400
Android because I haven't been using it for a while but yeah there are a lot

31:29.400 --> 31:34.680
there are amazing editors for markdown on Android but no the reason that I'd

31:34.680 --> 31:40.000
like something like Xim or G note is because of how the notebooks and whatnot

31:40.000 --> 31:46.840
are organized it's yes yeah yeah having that having that sort of meta

31:46.840 --> 31:51.440
organization with tags and and categories and subcategories this is

31:51.440 --> 31:55.800
really nice and that's you know whatever note provides and it kills me it

31:55.800 --> 32:00.760
freaking kills me just like and I don't want to I don't want to go on anymore on

32:00.760 --> 32:05.240
this but just like we're seeing more and more open source projects take on slack

32:05.240 --> 32:10.520
and use slack yeah anter gross is my favorite or enter gross how do I say it

32:10.520 --> 32:16.280
and Tegra winter got wimpy can you enter to go and Turgos enter goes is

32:16.280 --> 32:22.640
switching from IRC to slack oh really and there was just a sort of well okay

32:22.640 --> 32:28.440
all right well go ahead correct me I'm okay they it's not switching it's both

32:28.440 --> 32:34.420
have using both I'm the split before it's splitting I'm the lead up for the

32:34.420 --> 32:41.920
IRC for enter goes and the developers prefer to use slack so there's a weird

32:41.920 --> 32:48.080
split right now but yeah they it is a slack thing that they prefer slack yeah

32:48.080 --> 32:51.840
so it has become they then they they listed some really good reasons on their

32:51.840 --> 32:56.560
Google Plus page and also you know what I'm gonna say it Jupiter broadcasting

32:56.560 --> 33:02.200
has started using slack but there is a blog post at drew dev vault comm same

33:02.200 --> 33:07.480
you know please don't use slack FOSS projects and I want to dig into that

33:07.480 --> 33:11.920
because I'm gonna be honest we have started using slack here at Jupiter

33:11.920 --> 33:16.400
broadcasting and I have felt like a bastard for the last two weeks we've

33:16.400 --> 33:19.120
been using it it has been driving me absolutely crazy I'm gonna talk about

33:19.120 --> 33:23.120
that with you guys first though I want to mention Linux Academy go to Linux

33:23.120 --> 33:26.560
Academy comm slash unplug to get the Linux unplug discount and support the

33:26.560 --> 33:30.040
show even if you're just checking them out I want to browse around Linux

33:30.040 --> 33:34.080
Academy comm slash unplug supports this show go there and try them out and then

33:34.080 --> 33:40.180
while you're there do the tour take the tour I invite you because I think it's

33:40.180 --> 33:45.240
gonna blow your mind it's kind of amazing actually finally an educational

33:45.240 --> 33:48.760
resource that is really actually focused and dedicated to Linux and open source

33:48.760 --> 33:52.880
and all the technology around that included even like AWS and all of the

33:52.880 --> 33:58.320
major technology stacks like Red Hat open stack yeah it is really fantastic

33:58.320 --> 34:03.000
they have step-by-step video courses and they are really good with instructor

34:03.000 --> 34:06.400
help available when you need it you can download the study guides they're

34:06.400 --> 34:09.640
comprehensive you can listen to them in the shower like listener Seth if you

34:09.640 --> 34:15.260
want and they come with their own servers which is not just nice but the

34:15.260 --> 34:19.000
way they have done it it's like oh yeah they realize you're a Linux user the way

34:19.000 --> 34:22.880
they set up the SSH the way you can get into it and control the system the way

34:22.880 --> 34:28.500
you get complete control over it and seven plus distros to choose from and you

34:28.500 --> 34:31.880
choose the distro the courseware and the virtual servers they spin up on-demand

34:31.880 --> 34:36.600
automatically mass match that choice you get to keep track of your progress as

34:36.600 --> 34:39.640
you go along and they're rolling out new features you know rather than just like

34:39.640 --> 34:43.240
checking how you did after you're all done and waiting for the feedback after

34:43.240 --> 34:46.560
you do something they're now allowing you to perform exercises and give you

34:46.560 --> 34:49.240
immediate real-time feedback you could have done it this way you could have

34:49.240 --> 34:53.920
answered it this way you could have used this command they have scenario based

34:53.920 --> 34:57.160
courses that way you actually deploy and work with the technology in real-time in

34:57.160 --> 35:01.520
production so when you go to actually do it in production in your production when

35:01.520 --> 35:04.680
you're getting paid for it it's not the first time you've worked with it that is

35:04.680 --> 35:07.960
serious peace of mind and they also now have a new professional development

35:07.960 --> 35:11.520
certification platform I invite you to go check out if you've decided the route

35:11.520 --> 35:16.320
for you is to expand your skill set to make you more employable to make you a

35:16.320 --> 35:20.600
little more competitive if you just want to challenge yourself these are all good

35:20.600 --> 35:23.320
reasons to go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and by the way they

35:23.320 --> 35:26.520
also have time availability planners you can tell how much time you have if

35:26.520 --> 35:31.360
you're busy and as a father of three and somebody who hosts 12 shows a week trust

35:31.360 --> 35:35.360
me oh actually this week I'm not hosting 12 shows I take that back but I'm still

35:35.360 --> 35:39.080
hosting like seven shows a week scrupulously honest hosting seven shows

35:39.080 --> 35:42.400
a week right right it's six shows maybe I don't know who knows maybe I'll just

35:42.400 --> 35:46.480
cancel one of them randomly but still trust me I know what it's like to feel

35:46.480 --> 35:50.960
very busy I really do and that's why their availability planner is freaking

35:50.960 --> 35:54.520
awesome I love it plus they have live sessions you can attend they have a

35:54.520 --> 35:57.880
community that is stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members to help you

35:57.880 --> 36:01.680
when you need a little bit of boost and they have live sessions with those Q&A I

36:01.680 --> 36:05.360
really think that's a valuable thing graded server exercises are really great

36:05.360 --> 36:08.960
and then last but not least I gotta say I think those nuggets the name is funny

36:08.960 --> 36:13.280
it's a nugget tasting you put that in some honey mustard West and I'm good to

36:13.280 --> 36:17.840
go good to go honey mustard with I don't care about pink slime um you know what

36:17.840 --> 36:21.320
I'm still here after years and years of pink slime I'm still here but let me

36:21.320 --> 36:24.720
tell you something that's not what nuggets are about Linux Academy kind of

36:24.720 --> 36:28.000
wish they were but are they what no no in fact it's just like you go deep dive

36:28.000 --> 36:32.560
into a particular topic something like you know I don't know an SSH tunnel for

36:32.560 --> 36:36.480
like a few minutes or something really massive for like 60 minutes but it's a

36:36.480 --> 36:39.980
deep dive into a singular topic Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go check it

36:39.980 --> 36:45.240
out it's really great Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thank you

36:45.240 --> 36:50.900
Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program okay now feel free to

36:50.900 --> 36:55.640
let me hear it but yeah am I a am I the biggest hypocrite in the world by

36:55.640 --> 37:00.400
hosting two Linux podcasts a week and then planning for them in slack and I'll

37:00.400 --> 37:04.000
tell you I've gotten a lot of emails because I haven't really talked about it

37:04.000 --> 37:08.200
in Linux action show or Linux unplugged but I have talked about it in kota radio

37:08.200 --> 37:12.480
and in kota radio I've been getting consistent emails about matter most and

37:12.480 --> 37:17.800
other and other alternatives to slack and I I find it interesting that I am

37:17.800 --> 37:23.600
I'm thinking about this at the same time I'm also seeing you know a post from a

37:23.600 --> 37:28.560
lot of different people about slack including this one over at drew dev

37:28.560 --> 37:33.120
vault comm where he says don't use slack it's closed source has only one client

37:33.120 --> 37:36.360
well not really that's not true it's a walled garden requires users to have

37:36.360 --> 37:40.160
different tabs open for each project and requires hacks to do open registration

37:40.160 --> 37:47.060
he says go with IRC which I say IRC is not an open source product it is a

37:47.060 --> 37:51.240
protocol it does not compete with slack or things like matter most but let me

37:51.240 --> 37:55.360
have it am I a huge hypocrite am I a jerk for hosting the Linux action show

37:55.360 --> 38:00.520
and then using slack to planet I wish I could comment but since I'm helping

38:00.520 --> 38:06.720
plan on slack and you use slack for work I do use like for work yeah we I'm torn

38:06.720 --> 38:14.400
yeah part of me part of me says yes you gigantic hypocrite you you should be

38:14.400 --> 38:18.240
using other things but the fact is you're using the best tool for the job

38:18.240 --> 38:26.800
and for you that tool is the best tool for the job and IRC works and is is

38:26.800 --> 38:33.240
relatively robust you know if you we we often have problems can we use IRC a lot

38:33.240 --> 38:37.360
in canonical and we use free node and we have our own internal private IRC server

38:37.360 --> 38:44.880
and when one goes down we switch to the other and and then when slack goes down

38:44.880 --> 38:48.340
what do you do you know you'll probably switch to something else will it be IRC

38:48.340 --> 38:54.760
or telegram or something else right so I I don't know I I'm torn because I also

38:54.760 --> 38:59.320
use non free stuff I use telegram which open source client but closed back end

38:59.320 --> 39:04.680
so you know I'm in the same position I am pragmatic about these things yeah I

39:04.680 --> 39:08.120
find this to be an interesting trend this developing and I think you could

39:08.120 --> 39:13.080
also say the same thing would apply to Google Docs or office 365 or base camp

39:13.080 --> 39:18.880
or Wunderlist or anything really Debbie and shouldn't use Wunderlist to plan

39:18.880 --> 39:22.900
their tasks right anyways it is something this well that's because it's

39:22.900 --> 39:26.920
owned by Microsoft yeah there's that it is and the reason why I brought it up on

39:26.920 --> 39:29.800
Linux unplugged is because it is something that seems to be brewing on

39:29.800 --> 39:34.520
going on in the background and so for my 50 foot view or 500 foot view or

39:34.520 --> 39:42.720
whatever you want to call it my my my intention here is sort of like looking

39:42.720 --> 39:48.840
at the landscape looking at slack and saying does this idea of a way for for

39:48.840 --> 39:52.040
group collaboration because we're trying to solve something where you have people

39:52.040 --> 39:58.360
all over the world and and the things we work on they absolutely without a doubt

39:58.360 --> 40:02.960
take a week you know every single show from the moment we go off the air

40:02.960 --> 40:07.280
everybody that walks away from the show starts thinking about this next show as

40:07.280 --> 40:10.560
soon as you're done you go oh geez well wow I'm done with I'm done with 117 but

40:10.560 --> 40:13.800
oh my god now I have to do 118 yeah you open the net for the next one right so

40:13.800 --> 40:19.200
slack gives us a place for all of us who are doing that to dump those things when

40:19.200 --> 40:22.680
they come up and plan for the next thing and then we start and we pick up

40:22.680 --> 40:27.520
momentum as that show gets closer and the the the and the reason why it's a

40:27.520 --> 40:31.800
little better than IRC is it allows for additional functionality that's kind of

40:31.800 --> 40:36.760
nice to have and it also gives you something that is very very valuable a

40:36.760 --> 40:40.840
it's set up ready to go right now I just want to start I just want to do a brain

40:40.840 --> 40:44.480
dump I do not want to start setting up software I want to do a brain dump it

40:44.480 --> 40:48.560
gives me that immediately and I think that's important be or to whatever it

40:48.560 --> 40:52.120
has large user adoption kind of like Skype or Google Docs West already had an

40:52.120 --> 40:55.460
account you know rotten corpse already had an account right I don't have a new

40:55.460 --> 40:59.360
client yeah yeah so we have people in the you know we have people are ready to

40:59.360 --> 41:04.240
start right already can just get going without that quote-unquote friction that

41:04.240 --> 41:08.240
was a nice thing to have and then and then you know number three or see

41:08.240 --> 41:14.080
whatever that was really kind of great about slack is it just isolates it it's

41:14.080 --> 41:18.200
it's all of that stuff in one space where IRC now can be dedicated to other

41:18.200 --> 41:25.080
things this is dedicated to those things and if I do not as as a person who

41:25.080 --> 41:29.920
sometimes has to be able to step away and have for God's sakes two hours that

41:29.920 --> 41:34.840
don't involve work it is so nice to know that I could open up telegram or I can

41:34.840 --> 41:39.600
open up my IRC client and there will not be 35 questions about work you know if

41:39.600 --> 41:43.840
that if I want to find that I go into slack and so it also gives separation

41:43.840 --> 41:48.040
in space and and the thing is a slack just gives that immediately so the idea

41:48.040 --> 41:54.040
was does this concept actually add value as you know as an organizational tool I

41:54.040 --> 41:58.120
think the answer to that is yes slack does seem to demonstrate there's value

41:58.120 --> 42:01.860
there so now my as somebody who is an open source advocate my question is well

42:01.860 --> 42:05.320
now can I replace that functionality with matter most and it can I convince

42:05.320 --> 42:10.360
the team to switch it's not really my job though to make matter most more

42:10.360 --> 42:14.800
competitive now the Jupiter broadcasting team is pretty much ready to switch to

42:14.800 --> 42:17.760
something that is more open than the alternative like we were all using

42:17.760 --> 42:21.520
Viber for a while to do team messaging and as soon as I said you know what

42:21.520 --> 42:25.600
telegram looks like a way better solution and you know the protocols open

42:25.600 --> 42:29.360
the clients open I'm using I'm using you know it totally open the client right

42:29.360 --> 42:33.320
now let's go to telegram everybody switches to telegram immediately even if

42:33.320 --> 42:36.640
it didn't do absolutely everything Viber did like you didn't do stickers all that

42:36.640 --> 42:40.560
stupid crap at the time and added that stuff later and everybody switched so

42:40.560 --> 42:43.160
the Jupiter broadcasting team and probably a lot of open source project

42:43.160 --> 42:47.540
teams are a little more willing to switch before others would so I can

42:47.540 --> 42:52.600
probably get matter most set up in a droplet up on digital ocean ready to go

42:52.600 --> 42:56.160
and get say yeah it doesn't do everything slack does yeah sorry it

42:56.160 --> 42:59.520
won't quite integrate with Dropbox yeah you can't write the bot that we wanted

42:59.520 --> 43:03.240
to write but you can move over to matter most and it's gonna be a pretty solid

43:03.240 --> 43:07.320
collaboration tool because we've we bored the idea out without having to spend two

43:07.320 --> 43:11.400
days setting up the server first that's true you've you've said you've already

43:11.400 --> 43:16.520
said that you've switched from IRC to Viber and from Viber to telegram and

43:16.520 --> 43:22.240
now from telegram to slack I wouldn't say switched because they're all with

43:22.240 --> 43:26.040
exception of Viber we did totally replace telegram invite like Viber was

43:26.040 --> 43:31.440
totally replaced by telegram but IRC is still used as a secondary tool like

43:31.440 --> 43:34.520
you're right I doubt you'll make that go away because there's loads of us out

43:34.520 --> 43:37.600
here lurking in the IRC channel unless you know I mean even from like a

43:37.600 --> 43:40.760
production standpoint like we have back we have back-end channels that aren't

43:40.760 --> 43:45.120
public that we're still using right and that's what I mean the kind of people

43:45.120 --> 43:47.800
who sit in those channels are the kind of people who will continue to sit in

43:47.800 --> 43:53.160
those channels but I don't know it seems like you don't have that much of a

43:53.160 --> 43:59.280
problem switching from one system to another and when you said that yeah I

43:59.280 --> 44:03.600
would like was easy because other people were already on it that's just first

44:03.600 --> 44:08.760
mover advantage and the network effect because they were the right yes not IRC

44:08.760 --> 44:13.360
but you know something like IRC communication method matter most is the

44:13.360 --> 44:17.640
free software option so when in the same way that Windows has got first mover

44:17.640 --> 44:21.720
advantage against Linux and then this is the free software advantage you you

44:21.720 --> 44:25.560
should be choosing Linux over Windows in the same way you should choose matter

44:25.560 --> 44:31.560
most over slack I I suppose I see your point there and it means that when

44:31.560 --> 44:34.360
matter most is ready or we're ready wouldn't be it wouldn't be a hard

44:34.360 --> 44:37.800
transition to switch yeah we do have that advantage yeah not everybody does

44:37.800 --> 44:42.760
though right yeah I think the the main to pick away from this is that with

44:42.760 --> 44:46.920
matter most there's a lot more setup issues that you deal with so if you're

44:46.920 --> 44:51.200
just trying to test to see if the the concept of slack or matter most will

44:51.200 --> 44:55.160
work they would make more sense to try out slack first just because it's it's

44:55.160 --> 45:01.000
a lot easier barrier to entry if if you re-listen to exactly what rotten just

45:01.000 --> 45:06.120
said and replace what he said about slack and matter most with Windows and

45:06.120 --> 45:11.120
Linux where he said you're right yeah said yeah then this is harder to set up

45:11.120 --> 45:16.960
and that's why yeah you're right using slack and and what I think there is

45:16.960 --> 45:22.800
those see myself out now no no I think what the what the answer there is is and

45:22.800 --> 45:26.800
I in Kota radio this week I linked to and it talked a little bit about there

45:26.800 --> 45:32.840
is a guide now that makes setting up a docker container with matter most on a

45:32.840 --> 45:36.480
digital ocean droplet a pretty straightforward process so it's not

45:36.480 --> 45:39.960
it's getting to the point now where if you are a little technically inclined

45:39.960 --> 45:44.600
and you are you are okay spending a few minutes doing stuff you can deploy

45:44.600 --> 45:51.280
matter most now and that's up I would bet you five dollars that if you told

45:51.280 --> 45:55.600
one of your minions you wanted to switch to matter most by the time you wake up

45:55.600 --> 45:59.600
and have done your hair in the morning someone will have it running sir how

45:59.600 --> 46:07.280
long do you think it takes me to do my hair you know it's funny actually it's

46:07.280 --> 46:11.040
it's funny you say that because so I have a girlfriend and I had to meet her

46:11.040 --> 46:15.040
family right because that's the thing you do and I met her sister and her

46:15.040 --> 46:19.080
sister's like I really like your hair I don't like okay that's awkward but thank

46:19.080 --> 46:21.840
you yeah and she's like does it how long does it take you in the morning I'm

46:21.840 --> 46:25.840
like what and I never stopped and thought about it like do people actually

46:25.840 --> 46:30.280
think it takes me a while to do this look as a guy it does look high

46:30.280 --> 46:35.760
maintenance I really does now poppy what I what I have to assure you is what I

46:35.760 --> 46:40.680
have done is I have routinated and I have I have I have laser factored as any

46:40.680 --> 46:45.880
male would his hair this hairstyle I it is the laziest approach possible it is

46:45.880 --> 46:50.000
so funny like okay here's another story no shit and then we'll move on I the

46:50.000 --> 46:52.960
first like one of the one of the first times I ever like worked with Noah on

46:52.960 --> 46:57.400
location we go to a Denny's and we sit down his wife is there and we're having

46:57.400 --> 47:01.300
dinner and he goes okay so tell me how you do your hair I'm like what tell me

47:01.300 --> 47:04.960
how you do your hair I'm like what are you talking about like I get out of the

47:04.960 --> 47:09.360
shower and then I grab the comb and I like comb it the way I wanted to comb it

47:09.360 --> 47:13.880
and every now and then every now and then I'll put like I have like this this

47:13.880 --> 47:16.960
coconut stuff I'll put in there and that's it that's it I get it from the

47:16.960 --> 47:22.280
grocery store you've completely left out what time you get out of the shower what

47:22.280 --> 47:26.800
time you get out of the bathroom after you've done your hair fantasy aside it

47:26.800 --> 47:33.060
is it is literally here's here's here is literally the trick you just do it you

47:33.060 --> 47:38.880
do it before it dries so no actually puppy what he left out is that he

47:38.880 --> 47:42.240
conjures black magic yeah right okay all right fine I'll tell you about some

47:42.240 --> 47:47.320
black magic that is a cinnamon 2.8 which was released today and of course you're

47:47.320 --> 47:51.680
gonna see it soon in Linux Mint 17.3 Rosa planned for release at the end of

47:51.680 --> 47:56.560
November it has better sound applets and man I gotta tell you I've been using a

47:56.560 --> 48:01.480
boon to matei this weekend it's nice but that looks way better yeah that's

48:01.480 --> 48:06.640
pretty slick I love you would be but it does look really good all right all

48:06.640 --> 48:12.160
right I've got my rhino hijacked so the a lot of nice improvements to this to

48:12.160 --> 48:15.880
version of cinnamon the new workspace switcher is super super slick and it

48:15.880 --> 48:20.400
harkens back to basically what you get from gnome to or a desktop Matei now the

48:20.400 --> 48:23.240
system tray has got a lot of improvements the window list is really

48:23.240 --> 48:27.160
slick with a really nice tightened window thumbnails visual improvements

48:27.160 --> 48:30.760
all throughout including better support for high DPI and they did a little magic

48:30.760 --> 48:35.440
to make sure that if you hook up a 4k television which are notoriously

48:35.440 --> 48:40.080
horrible at telling the operating system what they do much much improved a

48:40.080 --> 48:44.280
support for that including high DPI which is I mean I got to say it again

48:44.280 --> 48:48.280
including high DPI I mean I got to say it again including high DPI I got to say

48:48.280 --> 48:53.880
it one more time high DPI as I have one machine with high DPI and I feel like

48:53.880 --> 48:59.200
I'm constantly suffering a couple other things were true to change sorry cinnamon

48:59.200 --> 49:02.200
now supports a microphone mute buttons the cinnamon settings Damon is more

49:02.200 --> 49:05.840
robust than before and x ran or support was significantly improved many bug

49:05.840 --> 49:10.280
fixes were ported from no shell as a matter of fact also speaking of

49:10.280 --> 49:15.400
interesting things imported into the project cinnamon 2.8 also supports qt5

49:15.400 --> 49:19.320
applications which now look more native and use the GTK theme that you've

49:19.320 --> 49:23.360
selected I don't know exactly how that's pulled off but I find it to be fascinating

49:23.360 --> 49:27.600
I'm curious to see what that looks like also performance improvements throughout

49:27.600 --> 49:31.960
now you use mint don't you I'm still using I'm still using mint at work with

49:31.960 --> 49:36.280
the cinnamon desktop and and how many times does the cinnamon desktop crash

49:36.280 --> 49:40.560
mmm very rarely really good good cuz last time I tried it it was and the only

49:40.560 --> 49:43.920
time I've actually had a crash in the past six months was due to a AMD

49:43.920 --> 49:46.920
graphics card issue are you gonna go to the next mint or what are you gonna do

49:46.920 --> 49:49.680
you know I haven't decided that yet I'm kind of looking to see how the next

49:49.680 --> 49:54.880
fedora release comes out oh find out yeah all right so one last desktop

49:54.880 --> 50:00.040
release while on the other end of the low resources desktop LXDE has a big

50:00.040 --> 50:05.800
update LXDE 0.10 is out this release they say they focused on cleanup and

50:05.800 --> 50:08.840
polishing and quality of life improvements with over 400 issues fixed

50:08.840 --> 50:13.840
and dozens dozens of new translations and also gained two new framework solid

50:13.840 --> 50:19.760
which replaces lib xqt mount and some custom power management code and lib K

50:19.760 --> 50:25.320
screen which replaces the X render calls and is Wayland forward compatible that's

50:25.320 --> 50:27.640
nice to hear actually I don't know why they didn't put this front and center

50:27.640 --> 50:32.560
because the issue the number one update that I like is their new LXQT pseudo

50:32.560 --> 50:35.560
which makes that like when you launch something and it needs to your your

50:35.560 --> 50:39.560
pseudo password it's much nicer dialogue in this release that would have been in

50:39.560 --> 50:44.520
one of my front center features but yeah that is in this new release as well also

50:44.520 --> 50:48.320
new file manager improvements better support for the trashcan whatever the

50:48.320 --> 50:53.920
hell that is and you get ready for this West search functionality oh good old

50:53.920 --> 50:57.560
search functionality functional geez that one thing that one beer that turned

50:57.560 --> 51:01.900
into two beers has made me all kinds of sloppy but congratulations to LXDE the

51:01.900 --> 51:08.800
oh oh this was also this was also really good some other really important new

51:08.800 --> 51:13.280
updates to the new release version 0.10.0 features are ready for this West

51:13.280 --> 51:20.240
replaces all instances of LX lowercase X lowercase T so it's L lowercase X

51:20.240 --> 51:25.320
lowercase T but upper L and Q now everything is uppercase they've replaced

51:25.320 --> 51:29.320
all instances with that with LXQ and then a lowercase T that's important for

51:29.320 --> 51:32.480
consistency so so from right so I'm gonna write this down right now so that

51:32.480 --> 51:38.440
way I remember it right now so it's uppercase LX okay Q and then a

51:38.440 --> 51:44.600
lowercase T perfect excellent work at it as of 0.10.0 that is officially the

51:44.600 --> 51:48.680
way you are supposed to say that I don't I don't even know West I don't even know

51:48.680 --> 51:51.680
but I just want to make sure we get there in fact wasn't there also speaking

51:51.680 --> 51:54.720
of feedback before we wrap up feedback there was feedback on how to pronounce

51:54.720 --> 52:01.920
Mate speaking of our slack chat and I wimpy can you tell me apparently I've

52:01.920 --> 52:07.240
been saying it wrong again do you know about this wimpy am I am I a jackass no

52:07.240 --> 52:13.600
you're very close this time thank you thank you thank you no I I pronounce it

52:13.600 --> 52:21.640
Marte Marte so I don't know that I've I don't know I've got the correct sort of

52:21.640 --> 52:32.360
Spanish you know m-a-h-t-a-y yeah I was told the easiest way to remember is it's

52:32.360 --> 52:37.320
Marte like latte yeah I was told that too but that didn't seem to stick for

52:37.320 --> 52:40.640
some reason damn it I hate that that it's maybe it's

52:40.640 --> 52:46.000
like a used technically you can say it because people pronounce not yerba mate

52:46.000 --> 52:52.840
with a yerba mate as well but Marta is the nor also also I also while I'm

52:52.840 --> 53:01.800
while I'm doing pronunciations yeah may actually pronounced Xiaomi Xiaomi Xiaomi

53:01.800 --> 53:15.280
Xiaomi I believe you know what you know what I hate I hate all of you what's

53:15.280 --> 53:19.360
your addict what about Huawei well what about Huawei is pronounced pronounced

53:19.360 --> 53:24.960
like her next Huawei Huawei yeah it's it's Huawei is how you pronounce it but

53:24.960 --> 53:29.920
this feedback right here says Huawei look right there on the screen see this

53:29.920 --> 53:35.080
is part of the problem before you hate me and judge me for how I do understand

53:35.080 --> 53:37.960
I have I have hundreds of different versions look right there that says

53:37.960 --> 53:43.720
Huawei now you're adding something it's Huawei embrace it it's your quirk Chris

53:43.720 --> 53:48.800
people will love it I bet you don't know they don't love it that that finish

53:48.800 --> 53:53.120
phone manufacturer the correct way that a Finnish person would say you know the

53:53.120 --> 54:08.320

54:36.160 --> 54:42.120
see here uh oh geez come on Robin that's designed that's designed to fail right

Right there.

54:43.120 --> 54:44.120
That is...

54:44.120 --> 54:45.120
Exactly.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
Wow.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
That is...

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
Oh, wow.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.120
Okay.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
So thank you, everybody.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120

54:52.120 --> 54:53.120
I'll tell you what I can pronounce.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.800
And I can pronounce it real good.

54:54.800 --> 54:55.800
You know what that is?

55:29.360 --> 55:30.360

Yeah.

55:36.840 --> 55:37.840
Or you know what?

55:37.840 --> 55:38.840
Like less than...

55:38.840 --> 55:40.400
It's actually even less than a burger from Wendy's.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.400
Yep.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.400
That is something.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.400
of transfer.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.400
Yeah.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400

55:50.400 --> 55:51.400

55:54.080 --> 55:55.480
won't even have to put in a credit card.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.920
They have a very, very solid interface.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.120
It's really intuitive and easy to use, and you can replicate it on a larger scale with

56:01.120 --> 56:03.280
their straightforward API.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.840
Very intuitive control panel.

56:04.840 --> 56:05.840
I love it.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.920
They've got a brand new data center in Toronto, and they've also just rolled out floating

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
IPs.

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
Yeah.

56:10.920 --> 56:13.320
I think this is going to take it up to the next level for them.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.040
This is really going to bring you up to the...

56:15.040 --> 56:20.200
Because if you grow, if you're going to need to move things around, this is a no-brainer.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.840
Floating IPs, you can read about it over at DigitalOcean.com.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.280
Plus, I think it's a great strategy.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.840
I mean, I don't really need everything in my life to be high availability, but now that

56:26.840 --> 56:32.600
I can, that's going to probably pick up a few more droplets just to have them on standby.

56:32.600 --> 56:37.400
If I was doing VC talk and I was down, yeah, we have an on-demand Linux infrastructure

56:37.400 --> 56:40.360
that we just deploy, it servers on demand.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.360
Oh, yeah?

56:41.360 --> 56:42.360
What's your cost on that?

56:42.360 --> 56:43.360
It's pretty low.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.360
It's like $5 a machine.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.360
No!

56:45.360 --> 56:49.800
Yeah, it's like $5 a machine, and then it just goes up to like $10 from there, and sometimes

56:49.800 --> 56:50.800
we even...

56:50.800 --> 56:51.800
You know what?

56:51.800 --> 56:54.720
I've even figured out a way to deploy the machine two months for free.

56:54.720 --> 56:55.720
No!

56:55.720 --> 56:56.920
Yeah, two months for free.

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
No!

56:57.920 --> 56:59.320
Yes, I use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

56:59.320 --> 57:02.000
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Go try them out.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.320
They got CoreOS, they got Padora, they got Ubuntu.

57:05.320 --> 57:06.760
They even got FreeBizzle.

57:06.760 --> 57:11.320
I don't know why you'd want to use it as a server, because everybody knows FreeBSD makes

57:11.320 --> 57:14.780
the best desktop out there, so you could try that.

57:14.780 --> 57:22.040
But use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and really, what I would do, screw that CentOS and screw

57:22.040 --> 57:25.760
that Ubuntu, it's between you and me, Wes.

57:25.760 --> 57:26.760
Yep.

57:26.760 --> 57:27.760
CoreOS.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.760
Yep.

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
CoreOS.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.760
Seriously.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.760
CoreOS.

57:31.760 --> 57:32.760
I'm putting my...

57:32.760 --> 57:35.480
If there was CoreOS stock, I would be buying it right now.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
I'm just saying.

57:36.480 --> 57:37.480
But you could do whatever.

57:37.480 --> 57:42.040
If you want to do Ubuntu LTS and have five years of patches and have tons of easy access

57:42.040 --> 57:44.480
to tutorials and community, that's fine.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.120
That'd be fine.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.600
You could try that too, DOUNPLUGGED.

57:47.600 --> 57:51.400
But I'm just saying, they also have a lot of really good community tutorials.

57:51.400 --> 57:57.540
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

57:57.540 --> 57:58.800
the Unplugged program.

57:58.800 --> 58:01.200
All right, Wes, now, you know me.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.960
I'm not like some hardcore advocate about free software.

58:04.960 --> 58:09.320
I don't sit here and tell you that everything must be free and that if you don't make free

58:09.320 --> 58:10.320
software...

58:10.320 --> 58:13.720
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.600
But I'll tell you, something's got me fired up, real fired up recently.

58:17.600 --> 58:21.760
And I'm not even a driver or an owner of a Volkswagen, but this whole Volkswagen scandal

58:21.760 --> 58:22.760
is ridiculous.

58:22.760 --> 58:27.080
And I want to talk about proprietary software in devices that not only our lives depend

58:27.080 --> 58:29.560
on but are just really integrated in our day-to-day lives.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.320
But first, if you're not familiar with the Volkswagen stuff because all you care about

58:32.320 --> 58:37.440
is technology and you're not actually following the news, no judgment, this story, this clip

58:37.440 --> 59:00.520
will bring you up to speed.

59:00.520 --> 59:04.800
So this software, I'm going to stop it right there, this software is specifically designed

59:04.800 --> 59:10.760
by Volkswagen that when it is in test mode, it alters the way the engine performs.

59:10.760 --> 59:15.400
And when you're not in test mode, nine times of some of the most poisonous types of gases

59:15.400 --> 59:17.760
come out of the tailpipe of these diesel vehicles.

59:17.760 --> 59:20.440
Which causes respiratory problems.

59:20.440 --> 59:25.760
In September, emissions cheating was exposed in 11 million other VW cars worldwide.

59:25.760 --> 59:30.840
None of the cars have been recalled in the US and are still safe to drive.

59:30.840 --> 59:36.160
The company could owe the EPA billions of dollars in fines, including nearly $400 million

59:36.160 --> 59:40.400
associated with the latest batch of cars.

59:40.400 --> 59:47.680
The latest batch of cars includes Porsches, Audis, we're talking high-end vehicles.

59:47.680 --> 59:55.320
And this has caused the mainstream press like Cars.com and the New York Times and a bunch

59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.320
of others that are running pieces that are basically saying that proprietary software

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320
is the blame.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.560
They say outright fraud is possible because of proprietary software.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.680
And I think this is remarkable.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.200
They say it's a bad situation, they get far, far worse.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.840
You throw a perfectly good phone away after two or three years because components goes

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840
bad.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.520
But because the manufacturer refuses to provide parts and code updates, really, as the driver

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:26.000
of an old but beloved car that owns its latest 50,000 miles to the abilities of mechanics

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.040
who understand the engine's technology, which is a huge, great point, by the way, they go

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.520
on to point out that a day is coming when great cars get scrapped because the automaker

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.040
decided it was time to force me to buy a new one.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.480
This is Andy Inocco writing for Cars.com.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.640
In that same report, you know, he touches on the same thing we were talking about the

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.980
other week, you know, with Apple users not owning their software, only licensing it.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.960
Here we see that more and more corporate companies, in this case, General Motors, employers have

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.480
defended the practice that you don't own the General Motors software in your car.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.480
They do.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.680
You have no right to play with it or tinker it or make sure that it's not polluting more

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.680
than you think.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680
Right.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.120
Nine times more than they say it is.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.080
You go in to get it tested, and it's then polluting nine times more than you thought

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080
it was.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080
You go in to get it tested.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080
Yep.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.120
I hope they're revising the tests here as well.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.840
Maybe something you stick in the tailpipe while it drives around.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
Pronoun.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.920
You had a comment about proprietary software by law.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920
Go ahead.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920
Yes.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:31.160
I think some law entity in Europe actually had a law that you have to put proprietary

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.400
software on cars so they can't be hacked.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.800
Huh.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.560
That is horrible, and obviously this would be an underscoring reason why that would be

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560
a bad idea.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.120
Wimpy, what do you have here from the podcast on season eight, episode 34 of the Ubuntu

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.120
podcast?

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.120
Sorry.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120
That was the wrong link.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.160
That's the one after that about the Librarian of Congress.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.160
Oh, yes.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160
Yeah, from the EFF.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160
Yes.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.160
Actually, this is kind of where it's going.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.360
We kind of touched on this last week.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360
Yeah.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360
Good point.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.440
But there's a particular point in there about how this affects car security, research, repair,

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440
and modification.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.880
What did you catch?

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.520
That they've recognized the need for vehicle owners to circumvent access restrictions in

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.320
order to repair the fine tinker.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320
Yeah.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.280
And one of the things in this VW case is that you're not able to actually determine what

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:27.040
the proprietary software is doing or not doing with regard to these test emission levels

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.480
and how the car is being tuned is because it's DRM protected.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.320
And because of the DMCA, you're not allowed to hack it.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.760
But under this provision, you now are.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760
This is a big deal.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760
Yeah.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.760
This is a really big deal.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.880
The Library of Congress has extended this DMCA, I guess, exemption to also phones and tablets

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880
too.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.840
And I wonder if this whole Volkswagen catastrophe is partly responsible for this.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.120
It seems to be turning the tide in at least some of the public perception.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.000
So here is now, I don't want to be like this guy.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.480
But I just want to put this out there.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.740
So let's be realistic.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.640
The industry is what it is.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.480
It's not going to be Kumbaya, open source, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.880
It's going to be, at best, people reverse engineering and figuring things out.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.120
This software, this stuff is literally going to affect our lives.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.560
It is the stuff that runs our cars, the stuff that runs the trains, the stuff that runs

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.400
the drones, the stuff that runs all of this.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:35.960
Chris, just imagine for a second if SIZA or TTPIP or the TTP was in full effect.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:41.800
The person that would have found this bug in the Volkswagen software would be going

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800
to jail.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800
Right.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.680
And, North Ranger, you also kind of wanted to play on the DMCA laws.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680
Well, yeah.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:55.880
I mean, what Wimpy pointed out with the exemption granted by the US Library of Congress still

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.720
doesn't fix, I wouldn't call it a loophole.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.680
It's a big catch with the DMCA is that the Library of Congress exemption only allows

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:15.020
individuals to bypass circumvention and things like cars and video games with servers.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.920
It's still a criminal act to distribute tools to break those.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Right.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920
That's a good point.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.320
Wimpy actually has a really good point about how this could be a great opportunity to explain

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.640
it to regular users about why DRM and DMCA stuff is so bad.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.120
Go ahead, Wimpy.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.400
Well, you know, normally we associate DRM with content, and if you try and explain why DRM

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.280
is bad because it protects video or music content to, you know, your friends and family

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.960
outside of the open source world, that's a difficult sell.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:52.000
But if you explain this story that the software, automated software, is DRM protected and may

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.800
be tuning the car differently for its test cycle than when it's on the road, but nobody

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.400
can prove that because it's DRM protected, it's a better way to explain why DRM is a

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.200
bad thing and we shouldn't have it.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.520
Yeah, boy, isn't that a good point?

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.880
And why not having insight into the software is not a good thing.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880
And I think that is...

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880
Exactly.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.600
Yeah, and I think we are seeing so much, and we have some links in the show notes, we're

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.120
seeing a lot of people report on this.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.080
It's kind of encouraging in a way.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.480
I wonder...

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.500
So here's my question, Wes.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500
And is this crazy?

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.000
I have a feeling I'm going to say yes.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
All right.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000
As I wait for this stuff to shake out, is it that unreasonable for me to just avoid

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.200
all of these things, avoid the automated cars, avoid all of this stuff, and just say, as

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.900
a person who is a privacy advocate, as somebody who wants to know how my stuff works, as somebody

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.120
who wants to have control and oversight, is it reasonable for me to say, I am just not

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.400
going to participate for the next few years in this next way?

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.520
Is that actually seriously reasonable?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.800
What that would mean would be, I can't buy a car after a certain amount of time.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.320
I was going to say, how are you going to manage this?

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.200
So you're going to be stuck with outdated products?

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.760
So here's why this question fascinates me.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:16.360
It seems like people who are extremely interested in the cutting edge, what's really going to

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:23.000
happen next, but very informed on it, are going to have to face the question if they

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.300
want to participate.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.360
If you know how unreliable software and technology is, you're going to be pretty uncomfortable

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.520
with the direction things are going.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.120
And you have to ask yourself, am I going to be one of the first in this first generation

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.480
who buys into this?

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.600
Or am I going to let a generation of products pass me by?

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.920
Because this is finally getting to the point where now your life is on the line.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.820
I feel like at the end of the day, I'm probably somebody who wants to just take that risk,

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:55.480
but is it unreasonable to say, I'm going to let it just pass?

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.000
Is that just get off my lawn?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.880
No, I don't think it's unreasonable.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.920
I think it depends on your priorities.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.120
You're in a little bit of a tighter spot in that you report on the tech news.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.500
But for someone who's not that involved, who doesn't need to have an understanding of the

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.200
latest and greatest, and maybe doesn't have a lot of workflows they're looking to change,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.000
I think that maybe for the next five, 10 years, you can get away with it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.440
We'll see what it looks like at that point.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440
Yeah.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440
Let it play out for a bit.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.520
I feel like you can kind of, I mean, I don't know.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.240
Boy, it is, for me, it seems like it's-

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.240
We're definitely coming to that crossroads, though.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.040
Yeah, and it seems like if you're an advocate of open source and open standards, this is

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.360
not a great time that we're going into for you.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.680
But I hate that to be a downer, so let me tell you about something that makes me feel

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.680
really good.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680
That's my mobile service provider, Ting.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.720
I mean it, too, because Ting is great.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.600
It's mobile that finally puts you in the position of power.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.100
If you're so sick and tired of all these different companies running you over and taking advantage

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.580
of you and milking you, check out Ting.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.840
Go to linux.ting.com.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840
You know what I mean, right?

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840
I sure do.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840
Yeah.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:04.800
Like all of the mobile companies out there, and I have to be honest with you, I am getting

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.480
so freaking burned by some of them.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.700
Even the ones that, I'm the un-carrier, and then let me completely screw up net neutrality

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.700
for you.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:20.280
Let me be the un-carrier and completely usher in the era of where pro services pay to be

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.280
completely unrated.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.280
They're selling the public on it, and then the tech savvy of us are screwed.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.560
I hate that.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.800
And then on the other end, you have the duopoly, right?

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.040
On the other end, you have the duopoly, and it is just the worst.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.600
Ting is mobile, it makes sense.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.600
Here's why it's great.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.820
Flat $6 a month, and then you just pay for what you use.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.900
You want three phones?

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.300
It's $6 for each phone.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.640
It's not a complicated thing.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640
And here's the nice thing, too.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.400
Like, if a couple of those phones aren't gonna get a lot of usage, then they don't cost you

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400
very much.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.180
And if you're even, like, I don't know, a tiny bit WiFi savvy, you can really go nuts

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.180
with the savings.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.160
Three lines, $40 a month.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160
That's what I'm paying.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.600
Linux.ting.com, it'll take $25 off your first device, or it'll give you a $25 service credit.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.840
I want you to try them out and click that savings calculator.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.000
They got a lot of stuff over at Ting.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Try them out.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.240
They got a GSM and CDMA network.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.020
I think this is a ridiculous deal, though.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.320
The LG G Flex 2, it's got that curve to it, you know?

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.600
I like some curves, Wes.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600
Yeah, I do, too.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:22.280
Yeah, LG Flex 2's got the curves for $237, ships tomorrow, no contract, no early termination

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.280
fee.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.280
You own that phone.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.240
$6 a month for what you use.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.480
And then just your usage on it.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480
$237!

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.260
And it's like, that's not for, like, a two-year contract.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.920
That's just an unlocked phone that you own, and you pay for what you use.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.960
They have CDMA and GSM, too, so if you've got a GSM device or a CDMA device, you might

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.080
be able to bring it over to the Ting network, and they have a whole range of devices that'll

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.080
work.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.080
This is one suggestion.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:54.120
I'm putting this out there because the LG G Flex 2 is a really nice phone, and for $237

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120
on the Ting network...

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120
It's a great value.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120
That's a great...

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.120
That's just exactly it.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120
That's just a really great value.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.080
Also, I would say go check out the Ting blog.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.800
If you've been kind of pondering the idea of what you can get by, do you need a good...

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.440
You want, like, that sweet spot, an Android device that gets updates, decent performance,

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.240
that doesn't cost $600?

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.240
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.880
Well, they've got a Ting blog by Andrew over there.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880
Go to...

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.840
Well, no, go to linux.ting.com and click on the blog.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.080
That way, we get credit.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.560
He's been trying out the Moto E 2nd Gen for a month and writing about it.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.840
He's looking for, basically, a sub-$200 perfect Android phone, and he's been blogging about

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.840
his experience.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.840
Linux.ting.com.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.960
Go try him out.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
It's mobile.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960
It really does make sense.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:41.440
Linux.ting.com also supports the Unplugged show and keeps us going.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.360
So a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged, linux.ting.com.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360
Go try them out.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.880
They are on a mission to make mobile make sense.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Linux.ting.com.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
Thanks, Ting.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.400
All right.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400
So today...

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400
Do you feel it?

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.400
Do you smell it?

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.400
It's...

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.880
Well, that might be something else.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.320
No, the other thing you smell is Fedora 23 released today.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.120
Anybody in the Mumble Room actually have it installed as we speak?

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.520
Is that actually a thing?

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520
Don't let us down.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
Come on.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.520
Anybody?

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520
Anybody?

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.520
Anybody?

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.520
Just one.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
No.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
No.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520
No.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520
Okay.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520
Maybe we just aren't the right crowd.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.520
No.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520
We're not the...

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.520
And we're not talking to the right people.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.520
These guys in here, they don't like to mess with computers.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.520
But they don't care about that in the Mumble Room.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.520
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.520
Oh, okay.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520
Tyler's...

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520
Yeah, go ahead.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.160
If it's any consolation, I actually was going to be running it, but I woke up late this

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160
morning.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160
Well, that's fair.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160
Tyler in the chat room says he's...

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160
You know what?

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160
Fedora, he's...

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160
Nah.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.160
That's not his thing.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160
He's going for OpenSUSE Leap tomorrow.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160
Yeah.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.720
I can understand that.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.240
I actually have it downloaded upstairs.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.280
I was like, well, I'll do the torrent.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.320
I'm going to help contribute to seeding the Fedora 23 download.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.400
It downloaded in like, I don't know, 45 seconds.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.840
It was ridiculously fast.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.840
I've been also following the RPM Fusion drama.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.320
Supposedly, RPM Fusion repos are good to go, but the website hasn't been updated, so people

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.440
are super confused at this point.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.840
And also, Fedly isn't updated for Fedora 23, so people are super hurt about that.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.320
People really depend on those extras.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320
Yeah.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.840
But I'm looking at Fedora 23 Workstation.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.480
I think the thing that jumps out about, to me, is GNOME 3.18.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.760
I kind of ding some of the other distros, like Leap's coming out tomorrow, shipping

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.980
with GNOME 3.16.

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.740
That was interesting six months ago.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.160
But in today's time, 3.18 is much more interesting.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160
And guess what?

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.520
Fedora 23 ships with that.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.780
You see, that's the difference.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.520
You see how they do that?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.080
That's the difference, you guys.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.080
That's the difference.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080
They've actually got the current GNOME.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
I know.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080
It's crazy.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.000
So they've also got, along with that, that means they've got Google Drive support baked

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
into the new files manager.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.640
Also, the new copy dialog box, which is a total ripoff of the plasma copy dialog box,

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.080
just saying, is also included now in files.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.600
LibreOffice 5 is shipping with Fedora Workstation 23, which is great.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.320
The new Calendar application, which has been getting worked on for a long time, used to

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.440
be called California.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.800
But now it's just called Calendar because California didn't make any sense.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.760
And it is now shipping in Fedora Workstation as default.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.640
The Builder ID also shipping with code autocompletion for Python.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.640
That's exciting.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.640
I've been thinking about giving that guy a try.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640
It is very nice.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.200
Also, their markdown support is very nice.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.600
And the biggest feature, which I don't know if I'll be able to try between now and Friday,

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.460
but I'll give it a go, is firmware updates via GNOME software.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.920
Which device are you going to try to brick?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.240
Yeah, right?

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240
I think this one.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240
The one you're sitting at.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
Oh, yeah.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240
Why not?

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.240
Right?

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.240
Yeah.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.960
Then also, Wayland is rocking in Fedora 23.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.160
Oh, that sounds really fun to try.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.800
It's funny because people are like, oh, Fedora 23, hmm, hmm, hmm, online.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.720
And I'm looking at it going, whatever.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.080
It's shipping with GNOME 3.18.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.240
It's got the best Wayland support out of the box of any distro.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.000
And it's looking really tight.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.040
So I'm looking forward to really giving it a go.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.480
They produce very nice images, I must say.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.680
Like their ISOs, they've got the multi-boot all set up very nicely.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.960
Whenever I get a Fedora ISO, I frequently use it as a kind of a helper toolkit because

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.480
I just know it's going to load on a number of systems.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.960
And it always looks nice and comes up with a beautiful GNOME desktop.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.040
I agree with you there.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040
I do.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.040
I do.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040
All right.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.080
So before we go on, anybody in the Mumba Room, any thoughts on Fedora 23 before we wrap up

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080
the show today?

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.080
Going once.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.280
I'm going to go twice on that.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.200
Hey, by the way, also, just as a point of reference, in the show notes, there's been

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.680
I've noticing in different forms, message threads, things like that.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.300
And in our IRC room, depending on how you upgrade to Fedora 23 from Fedora 22, you're

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.280
having different levels of success.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.600
So I've got the official best methods to upgrade from Fedora 22 to 23 in the show notes.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.800
Oh, look at how much brighter, prettier 23 looks in that picture.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800
Yeah.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.840
You see what they did is they took 22, they took the same exact thing, but they made it

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.840
darker.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840
Yeah.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840
You don't want to be on the dark one.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.120
No, I want to be on the one that they turned the exposure brightness up.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120
23.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120
That's the good one.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.680
That's the one that's got the higher exposure setting.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.360
Wes, you have astutely noticed exactly the same exact thing that I noticed when I linked

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
to this thing.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.080
It's like, oh, they're obviously like, this is the dim one.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080
It's no good.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080
No good.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.080
No good.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.080
It's old and busted.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.440
But what if we are creatures of darkness?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.960
Ooh, in the night we lurk.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.040
Many Linux users are also creatures of darkness.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040
Yes, this is true.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040
That's true.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.520
Well, hang out in Fedora 22 land for a while.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520
All right.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.040
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.440
Thank you for tuning in on a Tuesday.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.920
Did you know we did this show on a Tuesday?

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.520
You might be listening on demand.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.880
You might not have any idea.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.080
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.400
That frickin' daylight savings.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.640
Ugh, it's the worst.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640
Hate it, Wes.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.040
We should just make the calendar UTC only.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.920
Well, we just automatically adjust to your-

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.920
Okay, well that works too.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.680
Contrived time zone, you hairless monkey.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.560

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
Right?

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
It's a ton of fun.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.240
Every week.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.680
How many other podcasts out there are like, yeah, if your mic checks out, you can join

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.680

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680
You know what?

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.440
Yell at us, tell us we're wrong, don't know what we're talking about.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.600
Well, I don't love-

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600
Or come and give us compliments.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600
That'd be good too.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600
That's what we prefer.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.600
That'd be good too.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.600
Whatever.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.600
We're open.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.920

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.920

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.920
Thanks for joining us.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.920
See you back here next Tuesday, everybody.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920
Bye, Zeze.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920
Bye Zeze.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920
Bye Zeze.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920
Bye Zeze.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920
Bye Zeze.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
Bye Zeze.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:14.060
Man, that was a lot of show, and Wes will attest.

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.060
What's the appropriate term?

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.060
Because I don't want to say balls deep.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.700
I was deep into something before the show started.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah, you were taking care of business.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.440
You might say life changing business.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.280
Yes.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.100
Before the show started.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.020
You nailed it, you buttoned it right up,

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:29.860
transitioned right into a perfect show.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.460
And you know what, it's funny because I showed up, Wes,

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.480
and I literally today, minutes before we go on air,

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.860
my life is changing.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.500
And I show up, we do a show.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.460
Same old, same old.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.860
Mark shows up, Mark's never been here before.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.940
Mark shows up, he does a show, right?

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.660
And then I go to JBtitles.com

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.100
and you know what I see, Wes?

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.520
14 titles.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.220
I showed up, you showed up, Mark showed up.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.100
Where's the chat room at?

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.220
Where are the titles?

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.600
Where's the titles at?

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.020
Absolutely unbelievable.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:00.860
Unbelievable.

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.860
Maybe slacking off is the appropriate title.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.140
Or at least the meta title.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:05.980
Wow.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.380
For the chat room, because everybody else showed up,

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.680
everybody else showed up.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.680
You know what, I'm gonna go get a beer.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.200
I'm gonna grab a beer.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200
There goes the no beer rule.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.500
I'm throwing it out and grabbing a beer.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.040
That was a stupid rule.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:22.880
Ouch.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.920
Oh wait, he can still hear that.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.040
Wes, I left one beer for you.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.080
Well, I added some more.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.320
I saw that.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.160
You're a good man, Wes.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.440
You come bearing gifts.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.140
You gotta grease the JB wheels.

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:35.980
That's true, all right.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.560
How's our join queue doing?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.100
Boy, still.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.120
All right, okay, I think Ron's on top of it.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.320
Awesome, awesome.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.040
Well, I'm looking forward to chatting with you guys

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:45.880
about Ogg Camp.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.440
Okay, so let me open up this beer.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.720
Never did ask Chris which of the Minnesota brews

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.960
he liked most.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.760
Huh, you know, now that I'm looking back at it,

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.040
I don't know if I can pull them all out

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.160
individually anymore.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.800
I don't know if I recall.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.000
Actually, they were all really good.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.440
Yeah, some of them were pretty strong.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.000
Volkswagen GT9 emissions.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Curious.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.320
Sorry about that.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.400
It's okay, I don't think the mobile room

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.560
could even hear it.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.640
So, yeah, we did.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.600
Oh, you did hear that?

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.480
I forget that radio's auto-play

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.000
in the horrible world we live in.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.460
We can hear everything.

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.160
It's too late, we can hear everything.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.720
Oh, okay, all right, well that's fine.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.480
What you got there, Porter Stout IPA?

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.360
I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.600
Actually, it is a Imperial IPA.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:39.600
It's a Pyramid Outburst, a dry-hopped Indian pale ale.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.240
The Pyramid Brewing Company is,

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.720
I believe, in our neck of the woods,

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.160
isn't that correct, Wes, aren't they?

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.460
Yeah, they're from Portland, Oregon, as a matter of fact.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.280
So this is a beer right out of Portland, Oregon,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.340
a local beer for us, and I've seen the Pyramid Brewery

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.180
before.

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.000
Oh, very nice.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.840
Yeah, I haven't gone in, but I've seen it before.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.040
So I'll give it a, and you've already been drinking this.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:57.880
I have been.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.040
It's all about the Oregon beers.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.720
We make the best beers down here.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.040
Well, I don't know if that's necessarily true.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.360
You're implying that Washington

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.400
would not make a better beer.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.520
I happen to disagree, but I think we can be beer brethren.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.360
We can be beer buddies.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.600
It's brothers in beer.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.640
Yeah, but you can't beat Washington beer.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.240
Come on, let's be honest.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.680
I think Washington beer is some of the best in the nation.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.880
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.720
You know what?

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.960
I'll take you up on that challenge.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.320
Give me a beer and I'll go find it for you.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.760
Well, no, hold on now.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.840
I would have to defer to your local expertise.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.680
Yeah, true.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.760
That's the only way to make it fair.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah, and I feel like, here's the problem is,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.440
I feel like that question

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.000
literally changes season to season.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So I would have to go on a all-star brewery tour

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.640
to entertain the current best beer to get it to you.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.960
So you would be asking me

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.200
to basically go drink a lot of beer.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.480
This sounds like a whole new show.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.840
A lot of tasty beer.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.040
And yeah, so yeah, well, okay, all right.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.800
Well, we'll see about that.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.120
That doesn't sound like a problem, Chris.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:33.120
Yeah.
