WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Brent, you're eating breakfast in the hot tub?

00:03.040 --> 00:03.880
Oh yeah.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.120
What?

00:05.120 --> 00:07.040
Okay, I have so many questions about this.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.080
There's a bit of a story.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.280
Why do we need to clear this up?

00:09.280 --> 00:10.120
I'm curious.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.960
Well, because it's too distracting to do the show.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.440
So you're in a hot tub eating breakfast

00:15.440 --> 00:16.880
with your dad and brother.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.460
And I just, okay, are you dressed?

00:19.460 --> 00:20.560
Are you wearing anything?

00:20.560 --> 00:22.960
Oh, just, yeah, you know, a bathing suit or whatever.

00:22.960 --> 00:23.940
Okay, all right.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.680
So my father is visiting from, you know, Ontario.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.320
He's been here for, I don't know, three months.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.680
He won't leave.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.720
So the one request that he had

00:31.720 --> 00:33.360
was that we get a hot tub for him

00:33.360 --> 00:35.220
so he could watch the mountains in the morning,

00:35.220 --> 00:36.240
which is hilarious.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.660
So anyways, his routine now has either been spend time

00:40.660 --> 00:42.520
in the evening in it or in the morning,

00:42.520 --> 00:44.040
you know, having his breakfast, so.

00:44.040 --> 00:44.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.800
So your dad's eating breakfast in the hot tub

00:46.800 --> 00:49.240
on an on regular basis, on an ongoing regular basis?

00:49.240 --> 00:50.080
Oh yeah.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.960
You know, kids, I'd love to visit,

00:51.960 --> 00:55.040
but I just can't be bothered unless you get a hot tub

00:55.040 --> 00:55.880
and then yeah, okay, I'm there.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.720
You know what?

00:56.720 --> 00:59.220
The only thing grosser than eating breakfast in a bathtub

00:59.220 --> 01:01.240
is eating breakfast in the same bathwater

01:01.240 --> 01:02.480
over and over and over again,

01:02.480 --> 01:04.400
which sounds effectively like what he's doing here.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.240
Oh, interesting.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.280
But now I'm picturing three of you eating breakfast

01:07.280 --> 01:08.480
in this hot tub.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.280
It's just one big bowl of oatmeal, I think.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.420
Yeah, I'm just like, what happens when you drop food?

01:14.420 --> 01:16.560
Like, this is horrible.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.560
Hello friends, and welcome back

01:26.200 --> 01:27.780
to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:27.780 --> 01:28.620
My name is Chris.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.680
My name is Wes.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.920
And my name is Brent.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.220
Hello, gentlemen.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.200
Well, we really screwed up this week.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.360
This is a horrible show.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.840
Don't listen to this week's episode.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.220
I'd probably turn it off right now

01:39.220 --> 01:41.660
because about 10 minutes before we started,

01:41.660 --> 01:46.320
we deleted nearly 11, what was it, 10,000 lines?

01:46.320 --> 01:47.160
I don't know.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.000
We basically destroyed our entire show, doc.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.120
Thousands of characters.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.520
And decided to throw the topic out.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.580
We had gathered together today to talk about IPFS.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.440
We spent the week going deep into IPFS,

01:56.440 --> 01:59.480
watching YouTube videos, reading articles,

01:59.480 --> 02:01.680
trying out different applications,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.320
hosting websites, deploying on different machines.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.600
And we decided to throw all of that away

02:07.600 --> 02:08.800
and not do it this week.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.140
We're gonna do it in the future.

02:11.140 --> 02:13.560
But we realized that the topic was deep enough.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.680
It was like asking us to explain HTTP

02:16.680 --> 02:19.600
and distributed network storage in one episode.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.680
And then going into the things that are good about it

02:21.680 --> 02:23.160
and the things that are bad about it,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.920
which there are plenty on both sides.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.800
So we decided to instead to break that off

02:27.800 --> 02:29.080
into its own thing in the future.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.560
We'll give you an update on that soon.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.080
And instead, we just have a ton of stuff

02:33.080 --> 02:34.840
that we wanna cover this week anyways.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.640
We were looking at it and realized we had two shows in one.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.640
And so we decided we just weren't really gonna give you

02:40.640 --> 02:42.840
the best show on IPFS today.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.760
But we can give you a good episode

02:44.760 --> 02:46.240
if we focus on the other stuff.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.160
Hey, that means there's still time to send us feedback.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.040
If you have thoughts on how we should talk about IPFS

02:51.040 --> 02:53.440
or if you got some tips for us.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.920
Yeah, maybe before we get into the remainder

02:56.920 --> 02:58.960
of the Zombie Doc this week,

02:58.960 --> 03:02.480
I wanna mention the Jupiter Broadcasting East Coast Meetup.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.480
I think it's been since like 2014

03:04.480 --> 03:06.320
since we've made it out there.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.360
And it's on, it's happening Saturday, April 9th, 2022

03:10.360 --> 03:13.060
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.120
We're gonna meet up at a park.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.160
I think it's just outside of Raleigh.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.460
You know, I'm not a location expert,

03:18.460 --> 03:20.840
but you generally, if it's right next to a big city,

03:20.840 --> 03:22.960
you say the big city's name, you know.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.440
But we got the address, 403 Nightdale Station Run.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.280
There you go.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.700
So it's Nightdale, North Carolina.

03:29.700 --> 03:30.540
Who even heard of that?

03:30.540 --> 03:31.360
See, nobody.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.200
Or Kingdale?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.040
What is that, Wes?

03:33.040 --> 03:33.880
Get in there, is that Nightdale?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.320
I can't read, I got bad eyes now, I'm 40.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.320
Either way, you go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.420
I don't even know why you're listening to me.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.800
You're not gonna remember it anyways.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.240
So we have all the details up there.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.360
Yeah, there's a button you can click.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.020
You commit to going right there.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.080
Let us know.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.960
You think it's gonna be a banger, as they say.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.580
Wes Payne's gonna be there.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.280
Everybody knows Wes Payne, right?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.120
Yeah.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.360
Yeah, you take a deep breath with a pause

03:57.360 --> 03:58.800
because he's like, I haven't booked the flight yet.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.680
I have not, but I'm gonna go.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.200
Alex does have a couch for you though.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.020
Oh, that's amazing.

04:03.020 --> 04:04.720
So you can save a little money there.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.240
Brent's gonna be there on one of those couches too.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.640
So Brent'll be there.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.240
And our buddy, Michael Dominic,

04:10.240 --> 04:11.760
from the Kota Radio program's gonna be there.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.240
What?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.320
Yep, yep.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.960
Of course, Alex from Self Hosted will be there.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.800
Of course.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.200
So it's really coming together.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.400
Looks like we're gonna have, so far,

04:19.400 --> 04:20.900
about 50 people have said they're coming

04:20.900 --> 04:22.880
from the community, but I'm starting to suspect

04:22.880 --> 04:23.780
it's gonna be more than that,

04:23.780 --> 04:26.240
since we saw about a month before it kicks off.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.280
So join us in North Carolina on April 9th.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.120
We wanna see you.

04:31.120 --> 04:35.000
And I am trying to mention this ahead of time

04:35.000 --> 04:36.800
because I want you guys to understand

04:36.800 --> 04:38.200
my motivation for kind of mentioning this

04:38.200 --> 04:41.280
every episode for a bit is we have people

04:41.280 --> 04:43.580
who sometimes are a month or two behind.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.280
And so they hear about a meetup that's in their area

04:47.280 --> 04:48.480
a month after it's happened.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.280
So I try to get ahead of it as much as I can

04:50.280 --> 04:53.040
when we can and let you know it's coming.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.840
So now with the standard meetup announcement

04:54.840 --> 04:58.440
out of the way, I wanna start today's episode

04:58.440 --> 05:01.120
by talking about our each individual thoughts

05:01.120 --> 05:04.200
on how to engage with an open source developer

05:04.200 --> 05:05.860
to give them some sort of feedback

05:05.860 --> 05:08.560
or to ask for a bug fix in a project

05:08.560 --> 05:09.780
that you're working on.

05:09.780 --> 05:14.120
All three of us have recently had an experience with this.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.280
Wes, I think, really got us thinking about this last week

05:17.280 --> 05:19.280
when he mentioned his experience.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.480
I also recently had an experience asking for something.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.920
I asked for a developer who had created a hosted bot

05:25.920 --> 05:27.840
that runs on his server.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.760
I asked him to dockerize that up

05:29.760 --> 05:32.280
and make a few modifications to make that

05:32.280 --> 05:34.160
possible to self-host.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.680
And it's kind of a big ask, right?

05:35.680 --> 05:36.880
I'm going in there and I'm asking,

05:36.880 --> 05:38.680
hey, I know this isn't really adding a feature

05:38.680 --> 05:41.400
and you have a whole strategy here,

05:41.400 --> 05:43.800
but I'd sure use and trust your application a lot more

05:43.800 --> 05:45.200
if I could self-host it.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.780
Yeah, I have no interest in all the stuff

05:46.780 --> 05:47.920
that you're setting up over there,

05:47.920 --> 05:50.680
but can I just copy it and run it myself?

05:50.680 --> 05:55.280
And I felt a little apprehensive about asking for that.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.640
It felt a little selfish.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.680
Like, you know, who am I, right?

05:57.680 --> 06:00.200
Just asking this developer to divert their time.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.220
So I'll tell you how I handled that

06:02.220 --> 06:03.760
and kind of how I made that happen.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.320
And it worked out for the best.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.440
But I thought maybe we'd start with Brent this week.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.640
And Brent, I wanted to start,

06:09.640 --> 06:11.900
how would you ask an open source developer for a fix?

06:11.900 --> 06:13.400
And then could you tell us about your recent

06:13.400 --> 06:15.000
bug squashing adventures that you've been on

06:15.000 --> 06:15.840
for the last week?

06:15.840 --> 06:18.520
Sure, yeah, I have a little story, actually,

06:18.520 --> 06:21.680
that happened in the Telegram chat this week.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.900
Stay a while and listen.

06:23.900 --> 06:28.240
I was really diving into trying to do some bug testing.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.740
Ubuntu, we mentioned, was having their bug testing week.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.580
And I thought, jeez, I've been trying to do that

06:32.580 --> 06:34.860
for a few years and I'm really gonna dive in this week.

06:34.860 --> 06:35.700
Nice.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.560
In the process, I ran into what I feel

06:38.560 --> 06:40.800
is a little speed bump for myself.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.480
I was using Wimpy's lovely Quick EMU

06:43.480 --> 06:45.280
to try to get some VMs up and running

06:45.280 --> 06:47.760
to run these daily images.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.800
And I had an issue with copy and pasting

06:49.800 --> 06:52.880
despite following all of the suggestions

06:52.880 --> 06:54.280
on how to get that up and going.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.600
Copy and pasting between the VM and my native machine.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.000
You had read the docs.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.400
Oh, many times over the last few months.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.980
And so I thought, jeez, maybe this is something

07:04.980 --> 07:06.840
people struggle with in our community.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.200
And I wonder, I'd like to hear what you guys think.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.400
But I feel like I'm not the most technical person

07:12.400 --> 07:13.640
in our community.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.540
And outside of our community, that says a lot

07:15.540 --> 07:16.840
because typically I am.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.840
But I often struggle with, you know, it's a Wimpy's app.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.440
He's a friend of ours.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.740
And so I could just like message him and say,

07:23.740 --> 07:25.500
hey, Wimpy, I'm struggling with this thing.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.240
Can you help me out?

07:27.240 --> 07:30.120
But philosophically, I felt like, well, I don't,

07:30.120 --> 07:33.360
Wimpy probably doesn't want everyone to go and, you know,

07:33.360 --> 07:35.620
DM him about a little problem they're having

07:35.620 --> 07:37.480
with an app that he's worked on.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.080
So I thought, okay, well, how else would I do this

07:40.080 --> 07:41.240
if I didn't know Wimpy?

07:41.240 --> 07:43.060
And so I went into our community and I said,

07:43.060 --> 07:45.920
hey, I know there's people who use this app,

07:45.920 --> 07:46.840
you know, Quick EMU.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.720
It's, you know, a little outside my pay grade

07:49.720 --> 07:51.640
as far as what it's doing under the hood.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.120
And I'm having this really simple issue.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.000
And I wondered if anyone could help me.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.560
And it actually began this really fascinating discussion.

07:58.560 --> 08:03.020
Lucifer in the chat room helped me like wrap some ideas

08:03.020 --> 08:06.920
around why it was okay to just like DM Wimpy directly

08:06.920 --> 08:09.760
in our telegram group, for instance, and say,

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
hey, I'm having this small little issue.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.920
And so I thought if I was the developer,

08:13.920 --> 08:16.640
I wouldn't want to be bombarded with all these like,

08:16.640 --> 08:20.320
you know, single people trying to make me solve

08:20.320 --> 08:22.900
the smallest little issues with the software,

08:22.900 --> 08:25.400
either because it is a bug or because it's just like

08:25.400 --> 08:28.520
a use case that me as the user, I'm not,

08:28.520 --> 08:29.400
I haven't figured out yet.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.360
You know, there's a learning curve

08:30.360 --> 08:31.840
to every single application.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.520
I'd be curious to hear what the rationale was.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.920
Cause I also think I would be hesitant.

08:36.920 --> 08:40.880
I am every time I reach out to a developer, I am hesitant.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.080
So here's my thought on this too, is with free software,

08:45.080 --> 08:47.360
you have the opportunity to experience

08:47.360 --> 08:50.620
one of the greatest things in software development.

08:50.620 --> 08:53.840
And that is you can interact with the developer directly

08:53.840 --> 08:56.000
in the right situation and in the right scenario,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.280
in the right context, engage with them,

09:00.180 --> 09:03.120
and they will actually fix the thing

09:03.120 --> 09:03.960
that you're asking about.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.480
Like it's such an incredible experience

09:05.480 --> 09:09.120
when you are so familiar with the commercial

09:09.120 --> 09:11.160
customer experience where you buy a product,

09:11.160 --> 09:12.320
maybe they offer support,

09:12.320 --> 09:14.480
but you could never ask them to change anything.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.900
You could never actually talk to the person creating it.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.680
And it's such an amazing experience

09:18.680 --> 09:20.460
when you have that kind of interaction.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.080
Yeah, I mean, right in the commercial world,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.600
maybe you have like a rep that you talk to

09:24.600 --> 09:25.840
and you're sort of like kind of pushing,

09:25.840 --> 09:27.240
being like, look, this really causes this problem,

09:27.240 --> 09:29.760
but you have no insight into what happens upstream.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.120
How does that get prioritized?

09:31.120 --> 09:32.840
Are you just a small little fish?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.080
Right, cause along with doing this process,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.640
there's generally a public bug tracker.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.880
So you can watch the status of your thing.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.160
And that's, even if it's not going anywhere,

09:42.160 --> 09:43.900
it's at least more access than you normally get.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.460
But to properly navigate this,

09:46.460 --> 09:48.320
I think Brent, you do have to go in

09:48.320 --> 09:49.980
with a little bit of caution like you did.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.960
I think you have to kind of suss out

09:52.960 --> 09:55.800
how does this developer prefer to be approached?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.480
And I may actually start,

09:57.480 --> 09:59.120
if I figure out how to contact them in a way

09:59.120 --> 10:01.800
that feels like it's appropriate,

10:01.800 --> 10:04.100
I may actually start with the question of,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.120
what is your preferred way for me to ask for help

10:06.120 --> 10:06.960
or file a bug?

10:06.960 --> 10:10.520
Not here's my problem, but hey, I know you're busy.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.440
So I need to, I'd like to file this issue

10:12.440 --> 10:14.520
because I'd like to help you fix it,

10:14.520 --> 10:16.580
but what's the best way for me to do that?

10:16.580 --> 10:18.640
And not actually starting with the problem,

10:18.640 --> 10:19.640
but starting with the question of,

10:19.640 --> 10:21.780
how do I go about asking the problem?

10:21.780 --> 10:22.620
Yeah, I hadn't considered that

10:22.620 --> 10:25.920
because I figured giving a small synopsis

10:25.920 --> 10:27.300
of what was going on would be helpful,

10:27.300 --> 10:28.680
but I think you're right.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.440
Every project seems to have a different preference

10:31.440 --> 10:33.640
on where to solve various problems.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.680
You know, a bug tracker is not the right place

10:35.680 --> 10:38.680
to ask a very simple usage question.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.200
Some projects have IRCs for that or discords

10:41.200 --> 10:44.160
and other technologies to just get people connected

10:44.160 --> 10:45.360
for really simple questions.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.260
And so I think actually that's very simple

10:48.260 --> 10:50.720
and yet really good advice, so thank you.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.920
Yeah, I think it's like sort of an empathy thing

10:52.920 --> 10:54.160
of trying to understand.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.600
Some projects will have that spelled out.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.440
Other times you might need to explicitly ask

10:57.440 --> 10:59.600
because they don't yet have documentation established

10:59.600 --> 11:01.560
that might tell you where to go with that.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.040
You know, which communities or forums

11:03.040 --> 11:06.400
or methods they prefer for what types of communication.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.680
The other thing is sometimes projects

11:07.680 --> 11:10.000
have been around a while and they just have a legacy

11:10.000 --> 11:12.960
of different trackers or different places

11:12.960 --> 11:14.060
for community online.

11:14.060 --> 11:17.200
And so it's like, okay, which one do I actually engage with?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.840
That can sometimes be a problem for podcasts too.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.320
So how did the whole bug squashing thing go

11:22.320 --> 11:23.320
and how did it go with Wimpy?

11:23.320 --> 11:24.160
Tell us more.

11:24.160 --> 11:24.980
Did you squash any bugs?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.000
I feel like there is a conclusion to this story.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, I think it's an adventure

11:28.000 --> 11:29.200
and I don't think it ever concludes.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.880
So for the small story with Wimpy,

11:31.880 --> 11:36.880
I actually had this discussion after bedtime where he's at

11:37.440 --> 11:39.000
and he never got back to me.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.260
I think because probably it went into

11:42.260 --> 11:43.400
a totally different place.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.320
You know, my original question actually evolved

11:45.320 --> 11:47.000
into a discussion about something else,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.420
which he may have been interested in.

11:48.420 --> 11:51.000
Maybe he didn't even see it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.640
And I just got around the copy and pasting problem

11:52.640 --> 11:54.480
because I wanted to keep going on the project.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.440
So that's where that landed.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.920
So if anyone has any ideas on how to help me with that,

11:58.920 --> 11:59.760
I'd love to hear.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.080
So now he's turning to the audience.

12:01.080 --> 12:01.920
Right?

12:01.920 --> 12:05.000
It's interesting because that was my original approach

12:05.000 --> 12:05.920
in the Telegram group.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.360
And there was some great suggestions there.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.120
There was a good point that was made during that discussion,

12:11.120 --> 12:14.240
which was sometimes reaching to the community

12:14.240 --> 12:18.460
for some help on a project is sometimes detrimental

12:18.460 --> 12:22.540
because you can get information that leads you

12:22.540 --> 12:25.120
to a workaround that maybe the project

12:25.120 --> 12:27.640
doesn't necessarily think is the best solution

12:27.640 --> 12:28.460
to your problem.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.740
And that is kind of what I ended up finding,

12:30.740 --> 12:32.540
you know, on the stack exchanges and stuff like that.

12:32.540 --> 12:35.140
You end up with these potential solutions to your problem,

12:35.140 --> 12:36.820
but they're kind of hacky sometimes

12:36.820 --> 12:39.780
and getting the answer from the project itself

12:39.780 --> 12:41.940
is probably far better.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.140
You know, there's a very interesting thing happening

12:44.140 --> 12:46.660
right now in the Home Assistant community

12:46.660 --> 12:48.260
where the project is recommending,

12:48.260 --> 12:49.100
you're laughing at me, Wes,

12:49.100 --> 12:51.260
but the project is recommending that people migrate

12:51.260 --> 12:53.500
from the old Z-Wave implementation,

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
integration, to Z-Wave GIS.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.100
And they've even created a wizard

12:57.100 --> 12:58.820
and they've been pretty clear about it

12:58.820 --> 12:59.660
for the last six months.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.180
And then they made an implicit recommendation

13:02.180 --> 13:04.020
in the last Home Assistant release.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.020
And in the next Home Assistant release,

13:06.020 --> 13:07.740
they're gonna break the old Z-Wave integration.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.220
So you really gotta migrate.

13:09.220 --> 13:12.660
And when you go look up how to do this migration,

13:12.660 --> 13:15.020
what you'll find, especially on Reddit,

13:15.020 --> 13:16.900
is a bunch of people telling you to do something

13:16.900 --> 13:19.340
completely different than what the project recommends.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.300
A lot more complicated, requires a lot more skill sets,

13:22.300 --> 13:24.140
it requires understanding MQTT

13:24.140 --> 13:27.060
and it's a whole different world.

13:27.060 --> 13:30.300
And there's no like really simple migration wizard

13:30.300 --> 13:31.820
that they've set up.

13:31.820 --> 13:36.100
And it's just, it's like because things become

13:36.100 --> 13:39.500
tribal knowledge, like this is how you do something.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.060
And so when new people come along,

13:41.060 --> 13:42.820
like there's almost just like so much momentum

13:42.820 --> 13:44.700
behind recommending something.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.460
And sometimes what happens is the project changes, right?

13:48.460 --> 13:51.460
They pivot, they choose a new direction

13:51.460 --> 13:54.700
and the community doesn't necessarily change with them.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.340
It could be saying something as well

13:56.340 --> 13:59.340
about really great project documentation.

13:59.340 --> 14:02.260
I feel like some projects have such great documentation

14:02.260 --> 14:06.100
that's so up to date that that tends to be the go-to

14:06.100 --> 14:07.660
for this kind of knowledge.

14:07.660 --> 14:11.300
But I've often ran into projects who maybe have

14:11.300 --> 14:16.060
some stale documentation or it's not clear

14:16.060 --> 14:17.100
in its descriptions.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.700
And so often the community has to kind of use

14:19.700 --> 14:21.860
these other strategies to suggest fixes

14:21.860 --> 14:24.180
where the project isn't kind of giving the information

14:24.180 --> 14:25.020
that's required.

14:25.020 --> 14:29.020
So I wonder if as a project that might be a place

14:29.020 --> 14:32.220
to put energy where it makes it far easier for end users

14:32.220 --> 14:34.460
to accomplish the things the project,

14:34.460 --> 14:37.020
the direction the project wants to take them in.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.820
It seems like sometimes there's also a sort of dichotomy

14:38.820 --> 14:42.100
between what's happening in the pure upstream development

14:42.100 --> 14:44.020
and the various use cases downstream.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.660
It just makes me think of GNOME and plugins.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.140
Like there may be something that the upstream

14:48.140 --> 14:50.540
is not really interested in continuing development work on,

14:50.540 --> 14:52.780
but the community continues to rely on

14:52.780 --> 14:55.220
or thinks is worth continued support.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.420
That's a tricky relationship.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.620
Turns out, yeah, when you think about it,

14:57.620 --> 15:00.260
it probably happens a lot in free software, humans.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.500
I mean, this is one of the benefits.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.740
It's just, as we know, software comes with maintenance,

15:03.740 --> 15:05.100
burdens and expectations.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.020
Yeah, I follow what you're saying,

15:06.020 --> 15:10.220
but some of that also just puts more work on the project.

15:10.220 --> 15:13.860
That's why I kind of feel like in free software specifically,

15:13.860 --> 15:16.540
maybe some of that work should be taken on by the community.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.100
Like I am, when I really want a developer

15:19.100 --> 15:20.420
to fix something for me,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.140
I feel like the onus is on me to come to them,

15:23.140 --> 15:24.980
find them in the most appropriate way possible.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.100
And, you know, documentation would be great.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.860
Right, if the developer shares a tip

15:28.860 --> 15:30.260
on how you might address something,

15:30.260 --> 15:32.540
that may be an area where the community can say like,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.660
oh, look, yeah, okay, I can add that to the Wiki.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.900
Yeah, speaking of which, it's been making me think recently

15:36.900 --> 15:40.420
that we need to like open up a bug tracker for JB,

15:40.420 --> 15:42.700
just in general, for feature requests and things like that.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.460
So that's something I think we want to talk about.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.180
So, you know, just to kind of summarize our thoughts

15:46.180 --> 15:47.900
on the topic of this,

15:47.900 --> 15:49.940
when I decided to engage with a developer

15:49.940 --> 15:52.780
and ask them to dockerize this stuff,

15:52.780 --> 15:56.180
I also offered to throw them 20 bucks as a thank you,

15:56.180 --> 16:00.620
just because I felt like, it felt awkward at first,

16:00.620 --> 16:03.180
like, hey, you know, I'll give you, I'll throw money at you.

16:03.180 --> 16:05.340
But then I thought, I can say thank you,

16:05.340 --> 16:08.940
but there really is value for them in their time

16:08.940 --> 16:09.820
for doing that work.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.620
And I'm gonna get value out of having that software

16:11.620 --> 16:13.700
run on my land indefinitely now.

16:13.700 --> 16:17.100
Like it's, then all of a sudden, like 20, 30, 40 bucks

16:17.100 --> 16:18.340
felt like hardly anything.

16:18.340 --> 16:21.500
I was extremely appreciative because I started thinking of,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.420
like, well, how valuable is this to me?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.060
And I actually ended up sending them 100 bucks

16:25.060 --> 16:27.460
as a thank you for getting that work done.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.740
And the other reason why I kind of kicked it up a little bit

16:30.740 --> 16:33.220
is because after they did the work,

16:33.220 --> 16:34.860
other people came and piled on

16:34.860 --> 16:37.100
and started having other issues with it

16:37.100 --> 16:40.820
that I felt like we created more work for them.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.300
So that was the other reason I kicked it up a little bit.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.500
It's just a way to say thank you.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.940
But I wanna, while we're talking about value,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.700
I wanna talk about a really neat experience

16:49.700 --> 16:51.460
that I had this weekend.

16:51.460 --> 16:55.820
So yesterday, listener Cole came up to Lady Joob's, my RV,

16:55.820 --> 16:59.020
to see Joob's, to meet me in person and the family.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.860
And Cole's been a listener for over a decade,

17:01.860 --> 17:03.420
perhaps even longer since perhaps maybe

17:03.420 --> 17:05.140
before Dylan was even born.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.020
He's now a commercial electrician by trade.

17:07.020 --> 17:09.540
He's done the sys admin thing and still a big geek,

17:09.540 --> 17:11.180
loves that stuff.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.500
And our recent conversations about value for value

17:13.500 --> 17:14.700
have sort of really resonated with him.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.460
He's never really participated in any online community,

17:17.460 --> 17:19.540
so he's never been in Mumble or Telegram.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.060
He's never emailed into the show,

17:21.060 --> 17:22.580
but he's listened to every episode.

17:22.580 --> 17:23.420
Wow.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.540
And that's not too uncommon.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.740
I mean, that's how I am for most of the podcasts I listen to.

17:26.740 --> 17:27.740
Seriously, same.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.660
Yeah, I think it's the norm.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.460
And, but I think for Cole,

17:32.460 --> 17:34.020
he was trying to think of a way to contribute

17:34.020 --> 17:35.980
that wasn't just like a financial contribution,

17:35.980 --> 17:39.940
but something that would be another value contribution.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.900
And I like this concept a lot

17:41.900 --> 17:44.460
because I think it could also be applied to free software.

17:44.460 --> 17:48.140
And so I sort of feel like I have felt so down

17:48.140 --> 17:49.820
about software development funding,

17:49.820 --> 17:51.500
free software development funding,

17:51.500 --> 17:54.420
since like Heartbleed and that kind of stuff.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.340
And it's starting to turn around

17:56.340 --> 17:58.020
when I'm starting to connect these pieces

17:58.020 --> 17:59.020
and it's still early days,

17:59.020 --> 18:00.380
but I'm starting to see something here.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.580
And because it resonated with Cole too,

18:02.580 --> 18:04.100
he's like, I wanna contribute.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.500
I've been listening to JB for over a decade.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
I've gotten value out of some of the shows

18:08.500 --> 18:10.180
and I wanted to do something for you that's valuable.

18:10.180 --> 18:11.260
And I'm a commercial electrician.

18:11.260 --> 18:14.300
And he had heard the story about the rack in the RV

18:14.300 --> 18:15.860
and chewing up my wiring.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.740
So we just got our slides fixed over the summer.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.100
And then it freezes like a bastard here

18:20.100 --> 18:23.340
in the Pacific Northwest and rats get into my RV

18:23.340 --> 18:26.100
and they chew through the wiring and break my slides.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.180
So I said, well, let me come up and take a look at it.

18:28.180 --> 18:29.340
And so, yeah, okay, come up.

18:29.340 --> 18:30.300
And he comes up.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.340
So I gave him the full tour,

18:31.340 --> 18:34.180
but I did a bit more of a focus on the electrical setup

18:34.180 --> 18:36.260
and on the solar system.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.540
And I explained to him the rat situation

18:38.540 --> 18:40.500
and that the wire they chewed through

18:40.500 --> 18:41.340
and that had he had fixed

18:41.340 --> 18:43.860
and I showed him that kind of stuff.

18:43.860 --> 18:46.980
And it was obvious that his experience

18:46.980 --> 18:48.300
was gonna be instantly valuable

18:48.300 --> 18:50.740
because he kind of just pretty quickly piece things together

18:50.740 --> 18:52.620
that I wouldn't have understood.

18:52.620 --> 18:55.340
And he explained that the way these switches work,

18:55.340 --> 18:58.260
there is a multiplexer sitting between the controller

18:58.260 --> 19:00.860
and the switches to send the different signals

19:00.860 --> 19:02.780
because there's two wires for in

19:02.780 --> 19:04.700
and there's two wires for out.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.780
So you have each switch has four wires total

19:07.780 --> 19:09.940
that run back to a multiplexer.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.300
And then the multiplexer just has one wire

19:12.300 --> 19:13.740
or two wires going to the controller.

19:13.740 --> 19:16.980
So it takes all these wires and multiplexes it down.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.180
And I didn't know that,

19:18.180 --> 19:21.100
but Cole recognized that right away.

19:21.100 --> 19:25.020
And so we started hunting for the multiplexer.

19:25.020 --> 19:27.700
Cole's here on the hunt for the multiplexer.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.660
That is definitely a false floor.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.180
If you think so, it could be hidden under there.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.180
There is definitely a cavity there.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.100
But what I'm thinking that probably actually is,

19:36.100 --> 19:38.940
is just for power.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.900
And when I'm looking at it,

19:40.900 --> 19:43.700
it does look like from that wiring harness,

19:46.460 --> 19:48.020
the wires go in two directions.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.100
So I'm thinking that maybe the multiplexer

19:52.100 --> 19:54.460
is behind that panel.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.140
Oh, behind the panel itself.

19:57.140 --> 19:57.980
Yeah, which would make sense.

19:57.980 --> 19:58.940
Should we take the panel off?

19:58.940 --> 20:00.780
Yeah, I was gonna see.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.500
Okay, let's take it apart then.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.340
Let's just see if you guys are okay with me.

20:04.340 --> 20:05.180
Yeah.

20:05.180 --> 20:06.020
I would also like.

20:06.020 --> 20:06.860
Yeah, I'd be curious too

20:06.860 --> 20:07.940
to see what it looks like under there.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.860
Yeah, yeah, and then I'm gonna ring it out.

20:10.860 --> 20:14.140
See if I can see continuity between those connections

20:14.140 --> 20:16.500
and see what we can see.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.780
So it's a big panel with half a dozen switches on it

20:19.780 --> 20:23.620
and LED lights to indicate sensors for tanks

20:23.620 --> 20:25.100
and all that kind of stuff.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.900
And we've never removed it from the wall,

20:26.900 --> 20:29.100
but I've always been curious what it must look like

20:29.100 --> 20:31.220
because it's just a ton of different switches

20:31.220 --> 20:33.420
and lights and stuff and sensors in one spot.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.700
What are you?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.020
Yeah.

20:36.020 --> 20:39.620
So Cole also brought like all his own tools

20:39.620 --> 20:42.180
because he knows me, he's listened for a while

20:42.180 --> 20:43.740
and he knows I'm not very handy.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.340
You don't have the tools.

20:45.340 --> 20:46.180
He's very polite about it though.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.460
Just bring what you need, you know?

20:47.460 --> 20:49.340
Yeah, so he brought his own set

20:49.340 --> 20:52.260
and he had that panel opened up right away.

20:52.260 --> 20:56.020
And I tell you what we found in there

20:56.020 --> 20:59.420
still sits with me right now in an uncomfortable way.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.900
Well, your problem is right here.

21:00.900 --> 21:01.940
What do you see?

21:01.940 --> 21:05.060
Oh, did they get up in the wall then?

21:05.060 --> 21:06.460
Oh yeah.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.020
Oh my God.

21:08.020 --> 21:10.420
This right here is where your problem is.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.980
You did a fantastic job down there, I got to say.

21:14.980 --> 21:15.820
I did?

21:15.820 --> 21:16.740
Down there on that side?

21:16.740 --> 21:17.860
Yeah, you did a good job.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.020
Good.

21:19.020 --> 21:22.180
So they chewed not only the spot you fixed today,

21:22.180 --> 21:23.580
but they chewed this area.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.860
They got on the back of this board and chewed this.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.260
They crawled up the wall.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.100
Yeah, you can see the connector here.

21:30.100 --> 21:32.940
This is why this one doesn't work.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.020
There's nothing here.

21:35.020 --> 21:35.860
Wow.

21:35.860 --> 21:36.700
Yeah, there's the sensor.

21:36.700 --> 21:37.820
This brown wire here is the sensor wire.

21:37.820 --> 21:39.060
That's why the sensor isn't working.

21:39.060 --> 21:39.900
Yep.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.980
I can see the other end of that wire that they chewed.

21:41.980 --> 21:42.820
Yep.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.100
That red guy up there.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.940
They were in everywhere.

21:45.940 --> 21:47.020
They got everywhere then.

21:47.020 --> 21:47.860
Yeah.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.860
That is disturbing.

21:50.860 --> 21:54.100
Yeah, it's not good, that's for sure.

21:54.100 --> 21:56.220
I'm surprised other crap isn't busted then.

21:56.220 --> 21:59.780
I just hate that they use this corn coating.

21:59.780 --> 22:02.500
I just really, I get why they do it.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
They do it because people abandon cars.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.180
People leave cars around for years and years and years

22:07.180 --> 22:10.660
and they don't want, it makes ecological sense.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.900
But it's basically building your house out of a snack.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.140
Can you believe this?

22:14.140 --> 22:15.780
So it's corn wiring.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.340
Gingerbread RV over there.

22:17.340 --> 22:18.380
And they love it.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.220
They love it.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.060
Cole's in the chat room right now.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.580
He says, it's probably not a bunch of rats.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.420
I don't know.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.620
I don't even know.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.740
As far as I ever saw on camera, it's hard to say

22:25.740 --> 22:26.860
because I just caught a rat on camera.

22:26.860 --> 22:27.900
I don't know if it's, you know.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.620
You know, my folks had a problem with this one.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.260
They're cars, but it was like a soy-based wine,

22:31.260 --> 22:34.020
but same thing, tasty wire covering.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.140
Who would have thought?

22:36.140 --> 22:37.540
Yeah, unbelievable.

22:37.540 --> 22:40.660
So then we did a run out to the hardware store

22:40.660 --> 22:44.340
and I'm ashamed to admit it.

22:44.340 --> 22:46.060
I don't own a soldering iron at home.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.540
We have one here at the studio, but we did the math

22:48.540 --> 22:51.540
and we're like, do we drive to the studio and pick it up?

22:51.540 --> 22:53.220
Or do we just go to the hardware store

22:53.220 --> 22:54.140
that's like five minutes away

22:54.140 --> 22:56.100
and I just have one at home too.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.420
So they had a decent soldering iron,

22:57.420 --> 22:59.940
but they did not have like the best solder options

22:59.940 --> 23:00.780
and stuff like that.

23:00.780 --> 23:01.620
Yeah, of course not.

23:01.620 --> 23:02.460
But he got it all done.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.940
He helped Tadia learn how to do some of the soldering too.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.540
It was her first experience and got it patched up

23:07.540 --> 23:09.540
and it's working.

23:09.540 --> 23:10.580
It's working.

23:10.580 --> 23:13.060
Oh, you're like fully back in slide action.

23:13.060 --> 23:16.260
Yeah, that's a quality of life improvement for us.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.260
It's a lot of value.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.620
It was huge and it was so nice of Cole

23:18.620 --> 23:19.580
to come up and do that.

23:19.580 --> 23:22.060
Well, it's almost the coming full circle

23:22.060 --> 23:25.020
and just from the past year and a half or longer, right?

23:25.020 --> 23:26.540
Like before your whole journey

23:26.540 --> 23:28.500
of preparing this, like you just,

23:28.500 --> 23:31.540
you're actually back in a fully functional lady juice, right?

23:31.540 --> 23:32.500
Oh my gosh, man.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.340
Oh my gosh.

23:33.340 --> 23:36.780
And now I'm ready to like redo the whole tech setup.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.060
I'm not exactly sure what hardware setup I'm going with yet,

23:39.060 --> 23:40.660
but I'm like getting in that space.

23:40.660 --> 23:41.900
I feel like talked a little bit last week

23:41.900 --> 23:43.300
about some of the software I'm gonna load,

23:43.300 --> 23:44.140
like a spring reload.

23:44.140 --> 23:46.060
I think there's gonna be several Mac Studios.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.900
Yeah, yeah.

23:47.900 --> 23:51.060
A couple of Mac Studios running under the booth.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.420
It's just about 12 grand of Macs in there, that's all.

23:55.420 --> 23:57.140
Yeah, yeah, that should be great.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.460
A lot of horsepower.

23:58.460 --> 23:59.540
Of course, I think they're probably all would use

23:59.540 --> 24:01.180
Intel emulation for all the software.

24:01.180 --> 24:02.020
Right.

24:03.820 --> 24:04.740
But wow, it's been great.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.580
It's been really great.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.100
And I'll have all that figured out soon.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.340
I'll get all that.

24:08.340 --> 24:10.580
And with Cole too, I was showing him some of my,

24:10.580 --> 24:12.980
like how I hacked to bring the Starlink

24:12.980 --> 24:13.820
and stuff like that.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.660
Oh, nice, yeah.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.900
Showing him ideas I had around cooling.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.140
So it's all, you know, it's just really great.

24:19.140 --> 24:22.700
It has been so like, you know, people say,

24:22.700 --> 24:24.460
you know, you can be wealthy in ways

24:24.460 --> 24:26.220
that are not money.

24:26.220 --> 24:27.500
But it really feels like that is true

24:27.500 --> 24:28.820
when it comes to our community.

24:28.820 --> 24:29.660
Yeah.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.260
And I think we have been particularly spoiled

24:31.260 --> 24:32.460
here in the Pacific Northwest,

24:32.460 --> 24:34.820
with just some really great people in this area.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.300
And then we travel, and you know,

24:36.300 --> 24:37.980
every time we're traveling,

24:37.980 --> 24:39.500
we hear from people that are offering,

24:39.500 --> 24:40.820
you know, hey, I got a driveway, you can stop in it.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.020
And this is just wild, right?

24:42.020 --> 24:43.500
Like you're in a strange place

24:43.500 --> 24:45.340
and you automatically have friends.

24:45.340 --> 24:46.700
Crazy people out there.

24:46.700 --> 24:47.660
You crazy people.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.260
Linode.com slash unplugged.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.380
You know, I should call up my friends at Linode

24:54.380 --> 24:56.540
and we should talk about having them come join us

24:56.540 --> 24:59.340
at the barbecue, because they know a great meetup

24:59.340 --> 25:00.980
when they see when they helped us put together

25:00.980 --> 25:02.220
the Denver meetup.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.220
They were absolutely essential in that.

25:04.220 --> 25:05.740
Go sign up at Linode and support the show

25:05.740 --> 25:08.340
by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.980
You'll get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

25:10.980 --> 25:12.820
And you're gonna support this here show.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.100
Linode's where we run everything up in the cloud.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.820
These are, I'm in everything, everything.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.900
And you can start with like a five.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.260
This is how I personally started with Linode.

25:21.260 --> 25:22.540
I mean, you know, you do you,

25:22.540 --> 25:25.460
but I started with like a $5 a month system.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.980
I put sync thing on it.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.900
I was like, well, I will use this

25:28.900 --> 25:32.380
to just move between all of my on-premises stuff.

25:32.380 --> 25:34.700
I'm just gonna do all on-premises.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.340
And I did use it like that for a while.

25:36.340 --> 25:38.780
But as I started kind of just understanding more

25:38.780 --> 25:40.340
about Linode, the company, the culture,

25:40.340 --> 25:41.860
the people behind it,

25:41.860 --> 25:43.860
I realized that I could trust it for my business.

25:43.860 --> 25:45.420
I could trust it for my mission critical stuff.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.580
I could trust it for my wife's business.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.580
Like that kind of stuff really is what resonated with me

25:50.580 --> 25:52.740
is I just understood it better.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.260
And then, you know, as time comes up,

25:54.260 --> 25:55.620
it has gone up, I've made friends over there

25:55.620 --> 25:57.180
and I kind of see the way they work.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.660
And I've been watching on some of the things

25:58.660 --> 25:59.500
that they're building,

25:59.500 --> 26:00.740
like their database as a service product

26:00.740 --> 26:02.420
that they're rolling out right now.

26:02.420 --> 26:05.460
And you get to choose from 11 data centers around the world

26:05.460 --> 26:07.900
and every service level you go with,

26:07.900 --> 26:11.020
from their $5 a month system

26:11.020 --> 26:15.380
to their like crazy bonanza, epic CPUs and MVME storages

26:15.380 --> 26:17.260
and all that kind of stuff this is,

26:17.260 --> 26:19.220
they're gonna give you the same great customer support.

26:19.220 --> 26:22.220
It doesn't matter, they got the best in the business.

26:22.220 --> 26:25.460
And honestly, I've never really had to rely on it

26:25.460 --> 26:27.460
cause everything's always been really great for me,

26:27.460 --> 26:31.780
but I have heard such a consistent feedback

26:31.780 --> 26:32.620
from the audience that,

26:32.620 --> 26:34.300
hey, I got in a jam and they really helped me out.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.900
I've heard that over and over again

26:35.900 --> 26:39.220
and that they've always blown away everybody's expectations.

26:39.220 --> 26:41.300
So I like to mention it because I think

26:41.300 --> 26:42.700
in a moment when that matters,

26:42.700 --> 26:45.140
that's gonna be nearly priceless.

26:45.140 --> 26:46.300
And they're willing to do that for you

26:46.300 --> 26:48.340
with a $5 a month account.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.740
It's pretty impressive.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.500
So go check them out, try it out, support the show,

26:51.500 --> 26:52.900
go learn something, build something,

26:52.900 --> 26:54.340
just enjoy the performance.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.420
It's just a lot of fun to play with a system that fast

26:57.420 --> 26:58.820
and you get a hundred dollars to do it

26:58.820 --> 27:00.180
and it's a way to support the show.

27:00.180 --> 27:03.500
So it's lino.com slash unplugged.

27:06.580 --> 27:10.980
Well, I think it's that time again, feedback.

27:10.980 --> 27:14.900
Ray wrote in this week, talking about experience

27:14.900 --> 27:17.100
with free and open source software.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.980
Wes's recent positive experience working

27:18.980 --> 27:22.620
with an open source project inspired me to share my own.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.940
After setting up TailScale on all my machines

27:24.940 --> 27:27.380
to experiment with mesh networking,

27:27.380 --> 27:29.180
I took an interest in HeadScale,

27:29.180 --> 27:32.900
the open source version of the TailScale control plane.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.500
Everything was working pretty great,

27:34.500 --> 27:38.340
but I ran into an issue adding a particular machine

27:38.340 --> 27:41.660
and went to the GitHub repo to seek some assistance.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.580
I was directed to their Discord server

27:44.580 --> 27:46.380
and within two minutes I was talking

27:46.380 --> 27:49.460
with more than one HeadScale developer.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.260
They were welcoming and helpful

27:51.260 --> 27:52.820
and we actually discovered my issue

27:52.820 --> 27:55.980
was due to a bug in the HeadScale code.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.580
I filed a bug and the fix was merged within a week.

27:59.580 --> 28:00.820
I wanted to highlight this project

28:00.820 --> 28:02.900
because the process was so pleasant

28:02.900 --> 28:05.380
and felt truly community led.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.540
The people working on the project really believe in it

28:08.540 --> 28:11.100
and are open to input and contributions.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.780
That is great to hear.

28:12.780 --> 28:14.260
I have also had a great experience.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.860
I have a business relationship with them.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.820
They are a sponsor of Self-Hosted, so disclosure there.

28:19.820 --> 28:23.300
If you'd like to sign up and get a personal account for free

28:23.300 --> 28:27.980
with up to 20 devices, it's tailscale.com slash SSH I think.

28:27.980 --> 28:31.860
But I have interacted with them from that side.

28:31.860 --> 28:34.340
And a couple of the people I chatted with

28:34.340 --> 28:36.100
were already Self-Hosted listeners.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.340
So that's always a good sign

28:37.340 --> 28:39.460
because it shows you they're really into this stuff.

28:39.460 --> 28:41.820
If they're listening to my geeky podcasts,

28:41.820 --> 28:43.260
they must really like this stuff.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.820
And that's kind of a sign to me that the staff are into it.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.780
And I've had a good experience.

28:47.780 --> 28:50.300
The same two, I will say, kind of a same line of thinking

28:50.300 --> 28:52.420
is I feel like I always have to give an honorable mention

28:52.420 --> 28:54.460
right here to the Nebula project.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.020
Both Wes and I have had great interactions

28:57.020 --> 28:58.740
with the Nebula developer.

28:58.740 --> 29:03.340
It has been also a great solution for mesh VPN network.

29:03.340 --> 29:06.100
So it's really nice to see some good options

29:06.100 --> 29:07.660
in the space right now.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.580
Now, we kind of got in trouble last week

29:09.580 --> 29:13.860
because, well, we didn't plan last week's episode

29:13.860 --> 29:16.000
much like this episode was completely unplanned.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.580
And so we were just going with the flow

29:19.580 --> 29:22.140
and I think we ended up hurting some sensitive ears.

29:22.140 --> 29:23.500
Yeah, we actually got a piece of mail

29:23.500 --> 29:27.460
that I think at once is both wonderful to hear

29:27.460 --> 29:29.780
and also some really good criticism

29:29.780 --> 29:31.380
that I think I agree with.

29:31.380 --> 29:34.460
So Gene wrote in about our last episode.

29:34.460 --> 29:36.540
He said, my toddler and I tend to listen

29:36.540 --> 29:38.300
to your podcasts in the car.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.700
That's the part where I think is really great.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.940
I had to turn Linux Unplugged 448 off partway through

29:43.940 --> 29:48.180
because you all were continually saying F-U-C-K

29:48.180 --> 29:52.280
and that's not exactly what I want him parroting at daycare.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.440
I'm really disappointed that we couldn't listen

29:54.440 --> 29:56.720
to this episode together, but even more disappointed

29:56.720 --> 29:58.900
that there was no warning at the top of the show

29:58.900 --> 30:02.340
that this episode was going to not be kid friendly.

30:02.340 --> 30:05.500
I'd really appreciate it if you all would keep kids in mind

30:05.500 --> 30:07.300
when choosing your language for the show

30:07.300 --> 30:10.260
as I really like sharing these shows with mine.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.920
I thought that was great feedback.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.820
It was tricky because the project itself,

30:13.820 --> 30:18.820
if you both remember, was called Brain F-U-C-K

30:18.820 --> 30:22.660
and that was hard to get around, but any thoughts on this?

30:22.660 --> 30:24.380
You know, this is definitely something

30:24.380 --> 30:27.620
that we bounce around a lot inside internally

30:27.620 --> 30:32.220
because we don't believe in sort of pretense

30:32.220 --> 30:34.440
of pretending we're something we're not,

30:34.440 --> 30:37.760
but at the same time, you know, I'm a dad and I get this.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.180
I think for the most part, we have very rarely sworn

30:41.180 --> 30:43.580
on this show just because we want everybody

30:43.580 --> 30:46.700
to be able to listen and we don't want that to be a barrier

30:46.700 --> 30:49.900
for why you listen and we also love the idea

30:49.900 --> 30:50.720
of kids listening.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.700
I think that, you know, getting kids into technology,

30:52.700 --> 30:56.300
especially something that's focused on open source,

30:56.300 --> 30:59.460
free software and not centralized, you know,

30:59.460 --> 31:01.580
typical things like Instagram and social media.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.100
I think that's a great, I think that's great

31:03.100 --> 31:04.740
to get kids thinking in that direction.

31:04.740 --> 31:07.260
I think where it gets maybe tricky is that we're not,

31:07.260 --> 31:09.020
we're kind of in the gray area in that I don't think

31:09.020 --> 31:11.420
we're thinking about kids explicitly

31:11.420 --> 31:12.840
when we're crafting the show or, you know,

31:12.840 --> 31:15.080
like that's not necessarily where I could target audience,

31:15.080 --> 31:17.660
even if it's a welcome subset and then at the same time,

31:17.660 --> 31:19.540
we're not explicitly like some other podcast,

31:19.540 --> 31:22.740
we're not explicitly saying that we're an adult only show.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.220
Right, right, yep.

31:24.220 --> 31:27.860
Yeah, so there is, it's just a balance that I think we walk.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.960
Like we don't make the show for any one particular audience,

31:30.960 --> 31:33.100
but we try to consider as many of them as possible.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.660
That's probably the way to put that.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.740
You know, and often the feedback that we get in that regard

31:36.740 --> 31:39.300
as you just heard is, has a tone, you know,

31:39.300 --> 31:40.260
I'll just leave it at that.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.380
And so that sometimes makes it hard to internalize

31:42.380 --> 31:45.420
that feedback in a way that doesn't make me angry.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.340
But I think when you hear the message

31:47.340 --> 31:48.980
that they're trying to get to, it's pretty understandable.

31:48.980 --> 31:52.660
Yeah, I think asking for a heads up is entirely reasonable.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.460
We heard from a lot of people about Bookstack

31:54.460 --> 31:55.420
and David wrote in, he said,

31:55.420 --> 31:57.380
I've been using Bookstack for a few months

31:57.380 --> 31:58.480
and I think it's superb.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.980
It's really elegant, it's easy to use

32:00.980 --> 32:03.820
and it can be used internally for organizational info.

32:03.820 --> 32:07.060
And I also got a, I think Cole recommended Bookstack

32:07.060 --> 32:07.900
as well.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.720
Is that right?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.500
Lyndon also wrote in, said that I'm using Bookstack

32:10.500 --> 32:13.460
for way too much.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.340
It might be too good.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.540
That's great.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.380
I like when people tell us where they're coming in from too.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.260
Like David's coming in from Wales.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.100
That's amazing.

32:20.100 --> 32:20.920
Aww.

32:20.920 --> 32:21.760
Keep that up.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.540
I think that's great.

32:23.540 --> 32:27.100
Trev wrote in to say, Trev was on fire this week.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.780
I think I saw Trev right into a couple of shows.

32:29.780 --> 32:33.500
As an Emacs user, I use the vulnerable org mode

32:33.500 --> 32:38.380
to organize my notes, agenda reminders and long time tasks.

32:39.220 --> 32:42.300
Yes, we should have given org mode an honorable mention.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.820
We did an episode of self-hosted on org mode.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.940
Yeah, that was a great episode.

32:45.940 --> 32:47.580
If you'd like to check that out.

32:48.780 --> 32:49.780
All right, moving right along.

32:49.780 --> 32:50.860
This is a lot of feedback you guys.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.060
So I'm kind of moving at a quicker clip here

32:53.060 --> 32:56.660
but we also got some mentions for Obsidian.

32:56.660 --> 32:58.940
Obsidian I believe has also been talked a bit

32:58.940 --> 33:00.380
about on self-hosted.

33:00.380 --> 33:04.240
I am not somebody who I, Obsidian just doesn't work

33:04.240 --> 33:07.500
for the way I work but I think it works for a lot of people

33:07.500 --> 33:09.660
especially people who like to link things to other things

33:09.660 --> 33:11.980
and then have visuals that show them their cluster

33:11.980 --> 33:14.180
of linkages, Obsidian can be great for that.

33:14.180 --> 33:16.860
And it's also a markdown at graphs on graphs on graphs.

33:16.860 --> 33:17.820
Yeah.

33:17.820 --> 33:18.660
Yeah.

33:18.660 --> 33:19.740
Wow.

33:19.740 --> 33:20.840
Whew.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.000
I got to take a break from that.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.840
It was too much.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.440
It's a lot of, so this is actually maybe a chance for me

33:25.440 --> 33:28.940
to get into a little bit of a soap box thing if I can.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.820
Do you want the walnut soap box?

33:30.820 --> 33:33.580
It needs to probably hold some weight for a bit

33:33.580 --> 33:36.260
cause let's be honest, I could stand to lose a few pounds

33:36.260 --> 33:37.920
and this is a big soap box here.

33:40.020 --> 33:44.660
And now as the French say, it is time for the boost.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.300
So I want to talk about these boosts for a minute

33:48.300 --> 33:50.220
cause you probably heard we've been doing these

33:50.220 --> 33:51.060
in the damn show.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.400
They hardly make any damn sense.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.780
Most of you don't know what the hell they are

33:53.780 --> 33:55.700
and you don't know why all of a sudden we're doing them.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.940
And I want to talk about this because this right here

33:59.940 --> 34:04.820
is I hope the very groundwork for a revolutionary way

34:04.820 --> 34:07.280
to monetize free software and content

34:07.280 --> 34:08.420
that can remain independent.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.260
And I'm going to start here.

34:10.260 --> 34:14.100
This is, we're going to have a little dad time now

34:14.100 --> 34:16.020
and I'm just going to tell you the way something is

34:16.020 --> 34:17.960
and you're just going to have to accept it.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.980
And that is that independent podcasting

34:19.980 --> 34:22.460
has about three years left, maybe five

34:22.460 --> 34:24.540
if you've got a huge established audience.

34:24.540 --> 34:28.100
And outside of that, it's going to be Mad Max territory

34:28.100 --> 34:29.480
for independent podcasts.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.140
It's getting bad.

34:31.140 --> 34:36.140
YouTube is large and it is specifically reaching out

34:36.500 --> 34:38.940
to podcasters to move to its platform.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.540
But you may already heard that.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.720
What you do not know because you have not been

34:43.720 --> 34:46.160
in these conversations, but I and friends have been

34:46.160 --> 34:50.940
in these conversations, is that traditional podcast sponsors

34:50.940 --> 34:54.020
have found that YouTube works better for them

34:54.020 --> 34:55.340
than podcasts do.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.780
They're wrong, but here's their rationale.

34:57.780 --> 35:00.420
And when you hear it, you're going to see why they do this.

35:00.420 --> 35:04.140
Number one, they love the idea of link down

35:04.140 --> 35:04.960
in the description.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.980
They think that makes more engagement.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.460
And they think that means that people click through easily

35:10.460 --> 35:12.060
more often because the links right there

35:12.060 --> 35:13.820
down in the description.

35:13.820 --> 35:18.220
Number two, is that YouTube is a giant centralized platform

35:18.220 --> 35:22.220
that generates a lot of metadata about its audience

35:22.220 --> 35:24.660
and about the creators and about the interconnections

35:24.660 --> 35:27.360
between those creators and audience.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.660
That allows sponsors to build tooling

35:30.660 --> 35:33.580
to essentially slice and dice the market up for them.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.420
So they can go in and say,

35:34.420 --> 35:36.820
I want 10,000 people that are interested in this.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.140
And I want to get this percentage of women

35:39.140 --> 35:40.900
and I want to get a content creator

35:40.900 --> 35:42.740
who's also connected with this content creator.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.820
And I want to ride this hype wave over here.

35:44.820 --> 35:48.580
What they do, and it's disgusting,

35:48.580 --> 35:50.980
is they will engage directly with these channels

35:50.980 --> 35:52.500
and they will do sponsored videos

35:52.500 --> 35:57.500
with absolutely no disclosure that that video is sponsored.

35:57.660 --> 36:01.280
Or it'll be like a really limp attempt at it.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.720
Like maybe down in the description,

36:03.720 --> 36:05.840
it'll say sponsored by.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.040
And it turns out like the manufacturer of the laptop

36:09.040 --> 36:11.260
was the one sponsoring the entire video,

36:11.260 --> 36:13.720
but they don't actually say that in the video.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.280
That kind of stuff is rampant on YouTube.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.180
And the reality is sponsors love it.

36:19.180 --> 36:21.220
They love that kind of native ad stuff.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.020
They love it.

36:23.020 --> 36:25.100
They love that they can use generic tooling

36:25.100 --> 36:28.540
and they love that they can buy five or 10 creators

36:28.540 --> 36:29.980
in a couple of clicks

36:29.980 --> 36:31.980
and that those creators don't even have to disclose,

36:31.980 --> 36:32.820
even though they're supposed to,

36:32.820 --> 36:33.760
they don't even disclose

36:33.760 --> 36:35.740
that they're being sponsored sometimes.

36:35.740 --> 36:37.540
They love that kind of stuff.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.180
Then you've got Spotify who's squeezing the market,

36:40.180 --> 36:41.820
trying to centralize over there.

36:41.820 --> 36:44.020
Now, independent podcasting that's unmonetized,

36:44.020 --> 36:45.180
well, that's a hobby

36:45.180 --> 36:48.380
and that's gonna just continue as people prefer.

36:48.380 --> 36:53.380
But unique crafted content

36:53.980 --> 36:58.220
that is the sole focus of content creators is fading.

36:58.220 --> 36:59.060
It's going away.

36:59.060 --> 37:02.560
I mean, honestly, how many Linux content creators

37:02.560 --> 37:05.400
do you know that actually do Linux content creation

37:05.400 --> 37:06.540
full time?

37:06.540 --> 37:09.060
Counting myself, I can think of Joe.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.540
So that's two.

37:10.540 --> 37:12.300
Everybody else has contract work.

37:12.300 --> 37:13.900
They got side gigs.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.820
Maybe Nick over the Linux experiment is doing it full time.

37:15.820 --> 37:17.900
I'm not sure, but it's like maybe no more

37:17.900 --> 37:19.500
than three or four content creators.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.140
And then you got Larble over at Ferronix.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.340
When you start getting into the written media,

37:23.340 --> 37:24.420
you got a little bit more.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.580
You got Joe at OMG Ubuntu, you've got LWN.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.640
But again, this is like under a dozen at all

37:31.640 --> 37:33.300
for this entire ecosystem.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.460
Like I think our niche is particularly vulnerable

37:35.460 --> 37:36.620
to this problem.

37:36.620 --> 37:40.620
And this brings on an obvious need for a change,

37:40.620 --> 37:43.220
which is why this conversation around the boosts

37:43.220 --> 37:45.820
has been coming up more and memberships

37:45.820 --> 37:47.500
that we launched a little while ago,

37:47.500 --> 37:49.580
because I'm trying to get ahead of this thing.

37:49.580 --> 37:51.540
I have been doing this for 15 years

37:51.540 --> 37:53.180
and I figure I've got about five years left

37:53.180 --> 37:55.900
to figure out how to make this sustainable forever.

37:55.900 --> 37:59.500
It's been a good run, but the music's coming to an end.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.140
And when I first saw Boost, what I saw was,

38:02.140 --> 38:03.460
okay, that's a great way for somebody

38:03.460 --> 38:05.780
to contribute a one-off contribution.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.140
And I thought, okay, I could really see

38:07.140 --> 38:08.500
how that also work with free software.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.140
Like the two are very clear for me

38:10.140 --> 38:12.420
and we are the world's largest Linux podcast.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.660
So if we help establish a system like this

38:14.660 --> 38:16.560
that people adopt and consider normal,

38:16.560 --> 38:19.020
then that may actually help move the needle a little bit.

38:19.020 --> 38:22.140
Like if we do the groundwork here,

38:22.140 --> 38:24.260
it may actually open the flood gates at one point.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.940
Like there's a real possibility for the show

38:25.940 --> 38:27.800
to make a difference in this area.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.460
And it's early, right?

38:29.460 --> 38:31.220
Like my peers don't even know

38:31.220 --> 38:32.380
what the hell I'm talking about.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.480
Like they don't even know, they think I've lost my mind.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.260
They don't even have any idea because it's so new

38:37.260 --> 38:39.160
and they're focused on what they do, right?

38:39.160 --> 38:41.320
Like, so it's early days still.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.540
But what I have noticed,

38:42.540 --> 38:44.900
now that we've been doing the Boost for a little bit,

38:44.900 --> 38:46.500
is there's something extra special there.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.860
And let me give you a little bit of background here.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.260
The cheapest, easiest, simplest way to comment

38:51.260 --> 38:53.420
is always going to lead to the worst comments.

38:53.420 --> 38:55.700
YouTube and Reddit are an example of this.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.880
Very low friction to leave a comment,

38:57.880 --> 39:01.300
very little individual thought has to go into each comment.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.620
And so you just get the worst comments.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.620
You step it up to Telegram and Twitter,

39:05.620 --> 39:08.080
things get a little bit better, but not much.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.180
You know what I'm talking about.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.580
Then you step it up to email.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.500
There things usually get pretty good.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.500
You know, you get a range of the type of feedback,

39:16.500 --> 39:18.620
but it's generally been thought through.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.740
It's often a couple of paragraphs long.

39:20.740 --> 39:25.380
It's not very, not great on the back end

39:25.380 --> 39:28.100
in terms of us having to process it and put it on air

39:28.100 --> 39:29.140
and try to read through it in a way

39:29.140 --> 39:30.940
that doesn't put you to sleep and that kind of stuff.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.720
But you get links, you get references,

39:33.720 --> 39:36.220
you get an actual full thought out email.

39:36.220 --> 39:40.120
Like that was what, email has been the peak of feedback.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.980
And that's why we push people to the contact page.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.380
But Boost hit that golden ratio in a way

39:46.380 --> 39:50.500
that is fundamentally a big improvement

39:50.500 --> 39:52.420
for the production of the show.

39:52.420 --> 39:53.940
Because the feedback that comes in,

39:53.940 --> 39:56.480
because A, you have to have one of these new podcast apps,

39:56.480 --> 39:58.500
newpodcastapps.com.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.780
B, you gotta put some change in this wallet

40:01.780 --> 40:03.500
on this podcast app.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.220
And then C, you gotta subscribe to our show

40:05.220 --> 40:06.580
or listen to our show in the podcast app

40:06.580 --> 40:08.140
and send us a Boost in there.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.780
That eliminates 90% of people almost.

40:10.780 --> 40:11.700
And it's changing, right?

40:11.700 --> 40:15.560
It'll be 80%, and then it'll be 70%,

40:15.560 --> 40:17.280
just like the Linux desktop has been,

40:17.280 --> 40:18.560
just like Matrix has been,

40:18.560 --> 40:22.160
just like everything that our audience has pioneered.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.240
Early adopters start, and our audience is always

40:25.240 --> 40:26.740
some of the very first to try something

40:26.740 --> 40:28.940
that's a sensible technology.

40:28.940 --> 40:31.580
And so it kind of self-selects

40:31.580 --> 40:33.620
who's giving us feedback at the same time.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.800
They're like limited to 300 characters.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.820
So it's easy for us to process and consume them,

40:37.820 --> 40:39.740
and we can actually export them and sort them by show,

40:39.740 --> 40:41.180
and we can see what show they were listening to

40:41.180 --> 40:42.980
if they want to include that information.

40:42.980 --> 40:45.420
And they have the opportunity

40:45.420 --> 40:46.620
to give us a little bit of value.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.580
And sometimes it's like a hundredth of a penny, right?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.340
And then sometimes it's like a couple of bucks.

40:52.340 --> 40:55.260
And it comes into a system that we can process

40:55.260 --> 40:57.320
and then put into the show in a way that's quick.

40:57.320 --> 41:01.860
And it gives the audience a chance to buy in, right?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.500
It gives them a little bit of ownership.

41:03.500 --> 41:06.100
It gives them an opportunity to contribute something

41:06.100 --> 41:08.020
and supply a message.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.200
It's created this manageable, valuable channel

41:11.200 --> 41:13.500
for feedback and ideas that are coming into the show

41:13.500 --> 41:14.860
that are giving us ideas to try things

41:14.860 --> 41:16.540
we've never even considered before.

41:16.540 --> 41:18.500
And I just never expected that

41:18.500 --> 41:19.820
when we started using the Boost.

41:19.820 --> 41:22.820
And so that's why we've been featuring the Boost more.

41:22.820 --> 41:25.840
And because I think the ideals of the podcast index

41:25.840 --> 41:29.500
and the podcasting 2.0 movement are necessary

41:29.500 --> 41:32.660
for the long-term sustainability of independent podcasting.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.100
And that independent podcasting

41:34.100 --> 41:36.700
that has traditionally been ad financed

41:36.700 --> 41:38.840
is gonna have to go through some bit of transition.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.540
It may not be a hundred percent transition.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.740
I don't know, it's gonna be different for everybody.

41:42.740 --> 41:44.520
But that S is coming.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.940
And I think a lot of the people around me

41:46.940 --> 41:47.820
haven't even figured out

41:47.820 --> 41:49.100
until they're listening to this episode.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.700
And then they're gonna listen to the words I'm saying

41:50.700 --> 41:51.920
and they're gonna realize I've been doing this

41:51.920 --> 41:54.580
for a long time and I know what the hell I'm talking about.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.740
And they're gonna have to start making a change.

41:57.660 --> 42:00.900
Just like that bill's been coming due in free software.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.300
But I think we have an opportunity here to do it right

42:03.300 --> 42:05.780
and to do it in a way that orients everyone's priorities

42:05.780 --> 42:08.740
to the audience or to the software creators.

42:08.740 --> 42:10.500
It's a huge movement that could be happening.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.380
And it's not just this show.

42:12.380 --> 42:14.220
So I think that's the other thing to consider.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.780
So that right there is my soapbox.

42:16.780 --> 42:19.340
Why don't we do our first Boost?

42:19.340 --> 42:22.180
Awesome Matt wrote in again and he said,

42:22.180 --> 42:23.900
really enjoying episode 448.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.780
Encrypted show notes idea is great

42:25.780 --> 42:27.580
and would love to see that again.

42:27.580 --> 42:28.900
I would do it again.

42:28.900 --> 42:30.940
I had a lot of fun doing that episode.

42:30.940 --> 42:32.620
Yeah, but you can't pick the same encryption.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.780
No, I think you're right.

42:33.780 --> 42:36.540
I think we'd have to come up with a new method.

42:36.540 --> 42:40.620
Maybe could we allow for linking to our show notes?

42:40.620 --> 42:44.860
So like maybe all you have to encrypt is the URL.

42:44.860 --> 42:46.180
Is that too much of a cop out?

42:46.180 --> 42:48.940
Because then that wouldn't be this massive challenge

42:48.940 --> 42:50.460
massive chunk of text.

42:50.460 --> 42:51.360
Yeah, right, all right.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.580
Yeah, you'd allow, you'd allow it?

42:52.580 --> 42:56.540
I suppose some sort of uniform resource locating system.

42:56.540 --> 42:59.340
We'll start brainstorming on that.

42:59.340 --> 43:01.500
All right, watch out Wes, here comes one.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.900
Oh, this one's from sexy pants excellent.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.180
Okay.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.660
Maybe you should start a podcast

43:07.660 --> 43:10.380
covering your life with ADHD.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.220
There's a YouTube channel that covers it.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.260
How to ADHD.com.

43:14.260 --> 43:16.860
Maybe you should reach out to them and do an interview.

43:16.860 --> 43:18.020
I don't know.

43:18.020 --> 43:19.620
I too suffer from the beast

43:19.620 --> 43:22.540
and it's just such a pain and makes things so hard.

43:22.540 --> 43:23.380
Hmm.

43:23.380 --> 43:24.220
What do you think about that, Chris?

43:24.220 --> 43:26.180
And a podcast on it, huh?

43:26.180 --> 43:27.820
Maybe like we could do an extra.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.460
You know what's funny about that whole ADHD thing?

43:32.500 --> 43:35.140
I was diagnosed as a young lad

43:35.140 --> 43:38.860
and then re-diagnosed in my late 20s.

43:38.860 --> 43:41.760
And I feel like I was always in denial

43:41.760 --> 43:43.500
that it affected me.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.380
Like, oh, I've got control over this.

43:46.380 --> 43:48.180
I can manage this.

43:48.180 --> 43:52.340
And being a dad, I realized that is not true.

43:52.340 --> 43:56.580
I actually do, this is actually a real issue.

43:56.580 --> 43:58.420
This ADHD thing is real.

43:58.420 --> 44:00.780
And sometimes I have no governance

44:00.780 --> 44:03.500
over what my mind switches focus to.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.940
And it can be really tricky.

44:04.940 --> 44:06.580
I mean, even when we're doing the show

44:06.580 --> 44:09.020
I've got a pen in my hand right now so I can jot down notes.

44:09.020 --> 44:10.980
So that way I don't squirrel away

44:10.980 --> 44:13.660
and forget that I was gonna talk about something.

44:13.660 --> 44:14.660
So I've kind of, you know,

44:14.660 --> 44:17.180
created myself a few tools to manage it.

44:17.180 --> 44:20.380
But how to ADHD.com sounds like the place

44:20.380 --> 44:21.960
that he liked a lot.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.300
So thanks for sending that in.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.260
That is something to think about.

44:24.260 --> 44:27.500
I'd like to, I think talking about challenges

44:27.500 --> 44:28.960
of how to optimize how you work,

44:28.960 --> 44:29.900
how do you get in the zone,

44:29.900 --> 44:32.500
how do you do whatever you do really well.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.900
I love talking about that stuff.

44:33.900 --> 44:35.580
I feel like it's not like a love topic

44:35.580 --> 44:37.540
but I'd be willing to talk about it somewhere sometime.

44:37.540 --> 44:40.700
Maybe a live stream or something could do that.

44:40.700 --> 44:41.720
Nick wrote in, he said,

44:41.720 --> 44:44.780
hey guys, listening to Love 448 and I just heard

44:44.780 --> 44:46.460
you mentioned Tor.

44:46.460 --> 44:49.420
Check out Onion Share, an open source tool

44:49.420 --> 44:52.660
that lets you share files and even host a small website.

44:52.660 --> 44:54.100
Thanks for the show.

44:54.100 --> 44:56.860
And it's at onionshare.org.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.420
Also, just a quick pause before we get into it.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.100
This is another thing I like about the boosts

45:01.100 --> 45:04.320
is Nick sent that in while we were talking about it.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.420
So he's hearing us talk about it in the app, right?

45:06.420 --> 45:07.560
And he's hitting the boost button

45:07.560 --> 45:08.860
while we're talking about Tor,

45:08.860 --> 45:10.300
which I just think is super cool.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.780
Have we talked about Onion Share before?

45:12.780 --> 45:14.500
I feel like that must have come up on the show.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.580
Oh no, you know there's a flat pack.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.500
Yeah, yeah, we'll put a link to that in the show notes.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.620
This is, I feel like maybe not getting enough attention

45:21.620 --> 45:23.060
when I started looking at Onion Share

45:23.060 --> 45:24.780
because it, yeah, it lets you share files

45:24.780 --> 45:27.460
and receive files and send files and all that kind of stuff.

45:27.460 --> 45:29.060
But it's also a chat client.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.180
So you could do like a private chat over Tor.

45:32.180 --> 45:35.420
You can generate URLs to link people to files

45:35.420 --> 45:37.280
or to receive a file.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.540
It's got all that kind of stuff.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.580
Plus it's got this static website hosting

45:41.580 --> 45:44.620
that lets you host a static website on Tor.

45:44.620 --> 45:45.940
I mean, probably not the way

45:45.940 --> 45:47.980
you're gonna wanna run a serious website,

45:47.980 --> 45:49.420
but if you're just looking for something

45:49.420 --> 45:52.100
for a day or two or whatever, I mean, I don't know.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.580
This is really a lot.

45:53.580 --> 45:55.280
Like that hosting a static website

45:55.280 --> 45:56.540
kind of takes it up to the next level.

45:56.540 --> 45:57.980
Like the sending files and chatting,

45:57.980 --> 45:59.580
that almost feels like table stakes.

45:59.580 --> 46:02.620
But then I see you host a website, I'm like, oh damn.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.300
Looks like a nice little experience too.

46:04.300 --> 46:08.660
Yeah, so yeah, man, check out onionshare.org.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.020
That looks really good.

46:10.020 --> 46:13.420
We have been talking about Tor behind the scenes.

46:13.420 --> 46:15.820
And interestingly, if you go into the matrix

46:15.820 --> 46:20.580
and you look at the LUP feedback channel in matrix,

46:20.580 --> 46:22.340
they're like, that's what they've been talking about

46:22.340 --> 46:25.700
for the last week is Tor and Onion stuff.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.020
And just discussing like how Onion URLs work.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.280
It's actually a really cool conversation.

46:30.280 --> 46:33.460
And there's some conversation there about Obsidian as well.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.860
So onionshare.org, go check that out.

46:35.860 --> 46:39.020
And then one last thing while we're talking about podcasts

46:39.020 --> 46:42.900
and the boosts, there are now 5,000 podcasts

46:42.900 --> 46:44.940
according to Kevin Rook that are on the lightning network

46:44.940 --> 46:47.380
for monetization, 5,000 podcasts.

46:47.380 --> 46:50.820
So while it may sound early in our circle

46:50.820 --> 46:54.140
where we are at in the Linux community,

46:54.140 --> 46:56.780
there are other communities that are making this work

46:56.780 --> 46:57.760
and have figured it out.

46:57.760 --> 47:01.800
And that's where I'm kind of seeing some parallels

47:01.800 --> 47:04.540
that I think could apply to the free software community

47:04.540 --> 47:05.660
and what we're doing here.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.560
That's it.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.400
That's it.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.240
Are you good?

47:08.240 --> 47:09.080
Are we good?

47:09.080 --> 47:10.020
I got it out of my system.

47:10.020 --> 47:12.140
Thank you for letting me get on my soapbox.

47:12.140 --> 47:13.140
Yeah, it helps.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.460
You can keep the box.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.180
That's just cause my feet were messy, right?

47:18.180 --> 47:19.260
Yeah, that's yeah.

47:19.260 --> 47:20.460
Boost to grand.

47:20.460 --> 47:21.660
He spilled some onions too.

47:21.660 --> 47:22.540
Yeah, that's true.

47:22.540 --> 47:23.660
That's true.

47:23.660 --> 47:27.060
I see you snuck a pic into today's doc there, Chris,

47:27.060 --> 47:30.340
or at least what remains of today's doc.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.260
Heroic Games Launcher, an open source GOG

47:34.260 --> 47:36.420
and Epic Games Launcher, you know,

47:36.420 --> 47:38.740
for the stuff that isn't on Steam.

47:38.740 --> 47:40.340
Just basically that.

47:40.340 --> 47:43.860
And if you get in yourself a deck,

47:43.860 --> 47:48.860
it's a lot easier to just go the Flatpak route for stuff.

47:48.860 --> 47:51.300
And that's why I thought this is some pretty good timing

47:51.300 --> 47:53.740
for the Heroic Game Launcher to land as a Flatpak.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.460
So I have a link to it up on Flathub.

47:55.460 --> 47:56.940
And it's like what Wes said,

47:56.940 --> 47:58.620
you can bring in your GOG games

47:58.620 --> 47:59.980
and probably more importantly for me,

47:59.980 --> 48:02.860
like I've got like maybe one Epic game ever.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.780
But I, you know, what am I gonna do?

48:04.780 --> 48:06.500
Install the Epic Windows software thing.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.580
It's just junk.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.220
So this lets you bypass all of that.

48:09.220 --> 48:13.660
And if you have yourself one of them Deckard Cain devices,

48:13.660 --> 48:14.580
you can put this on there.

48:14.580 --> 48:15.700
And then maybe tell us about it.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.380
Yeah, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

48:18.380 --> 48:19.220
I'd be really curious.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.060
Let us know.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.420
You can tweet us at Linux Unplugged

48:21.420 --> 48:25.760
or the feedback page is linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.180
Or you know what?

48:27.180 --> 48:29.520
Send us a gosh darn boost.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.020
We'd love to get those too.

48:31.020 --> 48:32.820
And we have that up during the day.

48:32.820 --> 48:35.260
I watch them come in as people say stuff to us.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.820
And then links to everything we talked about today

48:36.820 --> 48:39.740
at linuxunplugged.com slash for Fortnite.

48:39.740 --> 48:40.560
Keep an eye out.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.820
We'll probably do some either,

48:42.820 --> 48:44.520
we'll either do an episode of Linux Unplugged

48:44.520 --> 48:47.980
or we'll do an extra in the future all about IPFS.

48:47.980 --> 48:49.060
We did a lot of work on it.

48:49.060 --> 48:51.140
We just, we feel like it deserves

48:51.140 --> 48:53.140
a little more breathing room, you know?

48:53.140 --> 48:54.180
You know, you can always subscribe

48:54.180 --> 48:55.640
to some sort of all shows feed

48:55.640 --> 48:56.680
if you just didn't wanna worry

48:56.680 --> 48:57.740
about where that might show up.

48:57.740 --> 48:59.740
Some kind of all shows feed.

48:59.740 --> 49:01.060
Then you just get it all.

49:01.060 --> 49:02.700
The self-hosted show, the Koda Radio show,

49:02.700 --> 49:07.300
Linux Action News, which is a great companion to this show.

49:07.300 --> 49:10.780
And of course, when we do an IPFS special

49:10.780 --> 49:13.300
or an extra or whatever, and this here show.

49:13.300 --> 49:15.460
You could also become a member at jupiter.signal

49:15.460 --> 49:16.300
and support us that way.

49:16.300 --> 49:19.340
And you get access to all the shows on the network,

49:19.340 --> 49:22.180
ad free, the extended LUP recording,

49:22.180 --> 49:26.500
self-hosted post-show and much more at jupiter.party.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.980
I think that's what it is.

49:27.980 --> 49:30.020
Come party with us at jupiter.party.

49:30.020 --> 49:30.840
There you go.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.820
That's pretty good.

49:34.820 --> 49:35.660
Okay.

49:35.660 --> 49:36.480
All right.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.320
See you back here next time.

49:37.320 --> 49:57.320
We'll see you back here next time.
