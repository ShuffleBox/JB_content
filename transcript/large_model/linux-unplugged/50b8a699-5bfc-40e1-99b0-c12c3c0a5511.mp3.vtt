WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.780
I think, Kev, the reason Wimpy's not here is because we did our time change last weekend, and you do yours next week.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.380
Yeah, oh boy. Oh boy.

00:07.380 --> 00:10.180
Okay, what's happening, Wes? Will you break it down? We're falling...

00:11.080 --> 00:14.680
I don't know, Chris. How can I know? This is an arcane system. It makes no sense.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.180
Hold on, are you serious? You don't know?

00:16.180 --> 00:17.620
Okay, we're falling back.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.160
Does that mean it gets darker earlier or lighter earlier?

00:21.720 --> 00:23.420
Dammit, just tell me which one it is, Wes.

00:23.420 --> 00:24.260
This is too much fun.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.460
No, come on, Wes! I've been trying to figure this out for...

00:26.460 --> 00:27.460
It gets darker earlier.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.960
Okay, thank you. Okay, I've been trying to figure this out for two days.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
Yeah, that also gets lighter earlier.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.960
So, you know, it's already... this is a problem. This is a real problem. It already gets dark way too early.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.460
And I gotta be honest with you guys, I start getting sleepy as soon as it gets dark.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.960
Oh, I know. It's like, well, eight o'clock, I guess it's bedtime.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.460
Yeah, it is a big problem. It is a...

00:47.460 --> 00:50.960
I screw getting lighter earlier. Screw that. I don't need it to get lighter earlier.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.460
Then I just feel pressure to wake up earlier.

00:52.460 --> 01:00.960
Well, and sometimes, as soon as it's... I do, actually. I usually get up around 530. It's usually when I'm up.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.460
I like X-Metal's point here.

01:04.460 --> 01:04.960
What is that?

01:04.960 --> 01:07.460
Maybe J.B. Time should just be agnostic.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.460
Just make UTC the thing you've pinned to.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.460
All the best places use UTC.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.460
We're on UTC now.

01:15.460 --> 01:16.460
Hello, Wendy!

01:16.460 --> 01:16.960
Hello.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.460
Hello.

01:17.460 --> 01:17.960
Hello.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.460
Hey, do you want...

01:18.460 --> 01:20.460
I've just been caught out by TimeMath. I'm very sorry.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.460
Yes, we were kind of thinking that might be the case.

01:24.460 --> 01:32.460
I just wanted to do a little, when we get into the show, a little Ubuntu Mate 15.10 yak-a-yak, if you would, with us.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.460
I think that'd be very nice.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.460
Well, that'd be delightful. I'll look forward to it.

01:36.460 --> 01:41.460
And somehow I'm driving all the way to Liverpool in a couple of days' time. I mean, how did this happen?

01:41.460 --> 01:49.460
Oh, by the way, who's calling shotgun? I think Mark should sit in the front and I'll sit in the back so I can write my presentation.

01:49.460 --> 01:50.460
All-time shotgun.

01:50.460 --> 01:55.460
Sure, sure, sure. You can do shotgun to Laura's and then sit in the back.

01:55.460 --> 02:00.460
No, I want to sit in the back. I want to sit in the back the whole time so that you're my chauffeur all the way to Liverpool.

02:00.460 --> 02:00.960
Yeah.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.460
I don't want to have to sit with the workers.

02:02.460 --> 02:05.460
Let me work this out. Let me work this out. I'm just going to extrapolate here.

02:05.460 --> 02:09.460
Would you like me to wear leather driving gloves and a peaked cap?

02:10.460 --> 02:11.460
Wear whatever the hell you like.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.460
We're playing dress-up, don't mind.

02:13.460 --> 02:17.460
You just want to look like Miss Daisy in the back of my car, is that right?

02:17.460 --> 02:19.460
Only on the weekends.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.460
All I heard was leather.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.460
Oh, boy.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.460
Oh, hello, Chris.

02:27.460 --> 02:35.460
I've decided I'm going to move. I've got to move somewhere where it's sunny. Where can I go where it's sunnier right now? Where do I got to go?

02:35.460 --> 02:36.460
Australia.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.460
Australia?

02:37.460 --> 02:38.460
Sunnyvale.

02:38.460 --> 02:39.460
That's what I was thinking, Australia.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.460
Where it's sunny right now.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.460
Yeah.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.460
Six months of sun in the South Pole.

02:42.460 --> 02:47.460
Yeah, I could do that, yeah. Then I could be more productive. Then I could be more productive. That's what I was thinking.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.460
You're looking at a talk show that's ready.

02:51.460 --> 02:53.460
It is nice, sunny, and 70 degrees out.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.460
Where are you?

02:56.460 --> 02:58.460
I got to go. That's ridiculous.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.460
Looks familiar. He's yelling at me in IRC.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.460
What?

03:02.460 --> 03:06.460
I live in Texas, man, and it's sunny all day from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

03:06.460 --> 03:12.460
Well, it would be 9 p.m. still, really, because the thing is I can feel my productivity is going to start falling off.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.460
It's time to hibernate soon.

03:15.460 --> 03:24.460
Well, because our time zone change is going to make it darker sooner, and something with me, I think it's probably because I don't get good sleep or something.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.460
As soon as it starts getting dark or whatever, I'm an old man. As soon as it starts getting dark, I start falling asleep.

03:28.460 --> 03:31.460
I start getting tired. My energy drops way off.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.460
It's the release of melatonin that does that.

03:33.460 --> 03:38.460
I know. I'm 33. I know. I mean, I'm not actually that old, but I don't know what it is.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.460
It's been for the last two years.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.460
I remember when I was 33.

03:43.460 --> 03:48.460
Now, listen. You mock. You mock, but it is so bad. I thought there was something wrong with me.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.460
Well, there might be. Don't discount me.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.460
Okay. All right. Because for the last couple of years...

03:52.460 --> 03:54.460
We had a horse and a trap when I was 33.

03:54.460 --> 03:58.460
For the last couple of years, I was like, why am I falling asleep at like 6 o'clock, 6.30 at night?

03:58.460 --> 04:00.460
What is wrong with me?

04:00.460 --> 04:03.460
And then as it started getting lighter out, I started staying up later.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.460
And then I started staying up later.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.460
And then I'm up at 11 o'clock at night, and I'm feeling just fine.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.460
And in the middle of summer, I'm like, oh, because there's sunlight.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.460
And then as soon as it starts getting...

04:12.460 --> 04:15.460
You guys, I'm starting to get tired around 7.30 when the sun set.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.460
It is ridiculous.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.460
So basically, I've got from 5.30...

04:20.460 --> 04:23.460
From about really 6... Well, really, who's going to get out of the house?

04:23.460 --> 04:29.460
So from about 7.30 a.m. to about 7 o'clock p.m., that's my window of opportunity right there to do anything.

04:29.460 --> 04:32.460
And if it doesn't get done in that time period, it's not getting done.

04:32.460 --> 04:37.460
We need to get you some nice solar temperature lights in your rover.

04:37.460 --> 04:40.460
The truth is, I just got too much work. I need to work till 11 o'clock.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.460
That's how my life is structured.

04:42.460 --> 04:47.460
I have a job that expects me to be available till 11, and I can't make it past 7.30.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.460
Actually, 8.30, really.

04:49.460 --> 04:53.460
Yeah, so I tell you, maybe I'll get one of those satellites.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.460
Yeah, there you go.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.460
You would think being in a studio full of lights...

04:57.460 --> 05:01.460
The ones up in a constellation are the ones attached to the side of your house.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.460
No, like, you know, those seasonal affective disorder lights that, like, give you...

05:04.460 --> 05:06.460
I've got Hughes lights.

05:06.460 --> 05:09.460
This is not as cool as I thought it would be.

05:09.460 --> 05:14.460
No, in fact, one of the things that's really kind of neat with these Hughes lights is, check this out.

05:14.460 --> 05:17.460
Now, Wes, tell me this doesn't actually feel a little bit different.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.460
Tell me you don't notice a little difference when I do this.

05:19.460 --> 05:21.460
I'm going to hit the button here. It's called Energize.

05:21.460 --> 05:26.460
Ooh, suddenly I'm awake, alert, ready for a podcast.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.460
It does feel a little more like...look, don't you feel energized?

05:29.460 --> 05:31.460
Yeah, this is a great feeling.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.460
I didn't hear the energize sound.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.460
All right, so here's the difference.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.460
All right, so here's before right here, right?

05:38.460 --> 05:41.460
See, there's before, and here's after.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.460
Boom.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.460
Now I need to open a browser.

05:44.460 --> 05:47.460
Yeah, you do, you do. See, before...

05:47.460 --> 05:49.460
Hang on, hang on.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.460
That's kind of boring, right? It's kind of sleepy.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.460
Sad, sleepy Chris.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.460
Yeah.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.460
Does that only work with a cell phone?

05:57.460 --> 05:59.460
All right, go on, go on, do it again, do it again.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
Okay, so here's sleepy mode.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.460
This is what we're going to start the show with.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.460
Now here is energize mode. Boom.

06:06.460 --> 06:10.460
Boom. You see that? Big difference, big difference.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460
It basically...and I have other modes too, like...

06:12.460 --> 06:14.460
Oh, right, okay.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.460
Here's concentrate, which I don't like as much.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.460
Oh, that's kind of intense.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.460
Yeah, here's sunset.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.460
Yeah, now it just got warm in here, didn't it?

06:22.460 --> 06:23.460
Day is done.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.460
This is Greece.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.460
Oh, it's green. That's weird.

06:27.460 --> 06:29.460
God, I can actually see you, Chris.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.460
This is unnatural. I don't normally do that.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.460
Sorry, there, that's better.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.460
I think it's fixed.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.460
Put the curtain back up. Yeah, that sounds good.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.460
All right.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.460
So what does Philips Hues run on?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.460
Just a mobile phone app or...?

06:43.460 --> 06:45.460
Well, no, actually...

06:45.460 --> 06:47.460
Actually, they have...

06:47.460 --> 06:49.460
They even have, like, a Python API for it.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.460
Like, pretty much anything.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.460
There's all kinds of things you can use to set it,

06:53.460 --> 06:57.460
but the consumer out-of-the-box expectation is a mobile device.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.460
Oh, I see.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.460
So do you have to firmware update your lights?

07:01.460 --> 07:03.460
Not the lights themselves, but the controller, yeah.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.460
I don't know if it was the hues,

07:05.460 --> 07:07.460
but I saw Matthew Garrett talking about

07:07.460 --> 07:09.460
how one of the lights he has has Netcat on it,

07:09.460 --> 07:11.460
which is pretty disturbing.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.460
I don't know about these.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.460
I mean, it does have a little controller,

07:15.460 --> 07:17.460
and it does need updates from time to time.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.460
You know, they're pretty obvious for a studio use.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.460
Having color control over your lights is pretty obvious.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.460
Without you having to go fiddle with the gels?

07:23.460 --> 07:25.460
You know, I was talking to Benjamin Karenza.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.460
Did I say his name?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.460
Karenza?

07:29.460 --> 07:31.460
Karenza.

07:31.460 --> 07:33.460
Karenza, right.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.460
That's right, Benjamin Karenza, thank you.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.460
And he was talking about how you could tie in

07:37.460 --> 07:39.460
his Glucosio app,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.460
which checks for, like, your blood sugar levels and whatnot,

07:41.460 --> 07:43.460
with hues lights

07:43.460 --> 07:45.460
to change the light of the hues

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
depending on your blood sugar.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.460
Karenza, yeah.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.460
We just need to record you saying it correct once,

07:51.460 --> 07:53.460
and you can just have that as a clip ready to go.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.460
I know! I've got a frickin' soundboard!

07:55.460 --> 07:57.460
And also, whilst you're on form there

07:57.460 --> 07:59.460
with correct pronunciation, go on,

07:59.460 --> 08:01.460
do un-ter-gos just once.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.460
Un-ter-gos.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.460
You gave it!

08:05.460 --> 08:07.460
Creative commons, everyone.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.460
Creative commons!

08:09.460 --> 08:11.460
I've never installed gnu-slash-lux.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.460
I just need to replace all these Richard Stallman clips

08:13.460 --> 08:15.460
with me saying things correctly.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.460
That's all I need to do, and that'll solve the problem.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.460
This is

08:19.460 --> 08:21.460
Linux Unplugged, episode 116

08:21.460 --> 08:23.460
for October 27th, 2015.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.460
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

08:37.460 --> 08:39.460
Linux talk show that's ready to

08:39.460 --> 08:41.460
head out and find the sunshine.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.460
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.460
I'm just saying I get sleepy in the fall, Wes.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.460
That's all I'm saying. I do, too. Maybe after this

08:47.460 --> 08:49.460
we'll take a nap. Actually,

08:49.460 --> 08:51.460
you did bring us Red Bulls before the show.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.460
I'm doing my part. I'm doing my part. We gotta have

08:53.460 --> 08:55.460
a show somehow. It's been a long time since I've had Red

08:55.460 --> 08:57.460
Bull, too, so when you crack it open, it's got that

08:57.460 --> 08:59.460
distinct Red Bull smell.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.460
Yes, it does. But we are well caffeinated

09:01.460 --> 09:03.460
for today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.460
We're gonna get into, well, a few things.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.460
First of all, we're gonna chat with Wimpy

09:07.460 --> 09:09.460
about some of the new things in Ubuntu Mate

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
15.10. I'm looking forward to that.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.460
Big win for the EFF that benefits

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
Linux users. We're gonna chat about that.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.460
Why Intel x86 platform

09:17.460 --> 09:19.460
is gonna be, just basically,

09:19.460 --> 09:21.460
we gotta write it off. We gotta write it off.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.460
We're done. I love me some x86 CPUs.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.460
We gotta write them off, you guys. You think I'm kidding?

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
Actually, a really, really compelling

09:27.460 --> 09:29.460
report just came out on why we have to do that and why Linux

09:29.460 --> 09:31.460
users are in the best position to take advantage of that.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.460
It's from the guy who created Cube OS.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.460
And then later on after that,

09:35.460 --> 09:37.460
we're gonna, right here,

09:37.460 --> 09:39.460
right now, we're gonna admit

09:39.460 --> 09:41.460
that Richard Stallman was right. In what may become

09:41.460 --> 09:43.460
a reoccurring segment at this point,

09:43.460 --> 09:45.460
he nailed it. RMS nailed it.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.460
This week, a judge declared that

09:47.460 --> 09:49.460
because an iOS user does

09:49.460 --> 09:51.460
not own their software,

09:51.460 --> 09:53.460
Apple can be legally compelled to unlock

09:53.460 --> 09:55.460
the device. Because,

09:55.460 --> 09:57.460
by Apple's very own EULA, that user

09:57.460 --> 09:59.460
doesn't own their device. They don't own

09:59.460 --> 10:01.460
their device. Apple owns their device. The OS

10:01.460 --> 10:03.460
that runs on their device. And so because of that,

10:03.460 --> 10:05.460
Apple has to unlock it.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.460
Wow, is that not a huge

10:07.460 --> 10:09.460
red flag, and exactly what Richard Stallman

10:09.460 --> 10:11.460
warned us about, and exactly something

10:11.460 --> 10:13.460
that Linux users should be thinking about.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.460
And then after all of that,

10:15.460 --> 10:17.460
some really sleek new

10:17.460 --> 10:19.460
hardware could be coming out for Linux users.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.460
I believe, now I've been working

10:21.460 --> 10:23.460
on this. I believe it's pronounced

10:23.460 --> 10:25.460
YaoMei.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.460
Sounds good, Chris. Damn it, Wes.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.460
YaoMei. And they have something really

10:29.460 --> 10:31.460
interesting up their sleeves. So before we get into

10:31.460 --> 10:33.460
all of that, let's bring in the Mumble Room. Time

10:33.460 --> 10:35.460
appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.460
Good morning.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.460
Hello. Hello.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.460
Hi. Hi. Hi. So,

10:41.460 --> 10:43.460
you guys may or may not recall, a couple

10:43.460 --> 10:45.460
of weeks ago, we played

10:45.460 --> 10:47.460
the Linux Foundation's The World Without

10:47.460 --> 10:49.460
Linux episode. Let's

10:49.460 --> 10:51.460
play their second one that just came out, and

10:51.460 --> 10:53.460
then we're going to play Critics.

10:53.460 --> 10:55.460
So we're going to mystery science this thing. You ready?

10:55.460 --> 10:57.460
So here it is, The World Without Linux

10:57.460 --> 10:59.460
episode number two, by the way, with a

10:59.460 --> 11:01.460
real serious guitar intro.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.460
Alright.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.460
Road trips are the best, but

11:05.460 --> 11:07.460
I think we are totally lost.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.460
Don't fret, dude. I brought a trusty map.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.460
Dude. So, a map.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.460
All I have to do is convert inches into

11:13.460 --> 11:15.460
miles and cross-reference our perceived location

11:15.460 --> 11:17.460
with the mile markers on the road.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.460
Uh, my bad.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.460
Map goes out the window. Don't worry.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.460
As a backup, I printed out directions.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.460
These two aren't going to make it.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.460
Broken up by the end of the series.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.460
You take a left on...

11:29.460 --> 11:31.460
flight right on... right.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.460
Now... What in the world are you saying?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.460
Sorry. The printer cut off the directions

11:35.460 --> 11:37.460
on the side. Ah, MapQuest.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.460
I hope you never, ever go

11:39.460 --> 11:41.460
away.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.460
Okay, well, I think U-turn.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.460
Wait, U-turn? I was supposed to make it U-turn?

11:45.460 --> 11:47.460
No, U-turn. Wait, are you saying

11:47.460 --> 11:49.460
U-turn or you should turn?

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
Right. Are you saying right as

11:51.460 --> 11:53.460
correct or turn right?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.460
Stop. Wait, are you saying stop it

11:55.460 --> 11:57.460
or stop the car?

11:57.460 --> 11:59.460
A world without Linux

11:59.460 --> 12:01.460
would mean a world without direction.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.460
We are

12:03.460 --> 12:05.460
so lost.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.460
When do you think we'll get there?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.460
Alright, let's see. No, I'm going to do this. Okay, so if a train leaves New York

12:09.460 --> 12:11.460
at three o'clock. Okay, wait. Carry the one.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.460
You want miles, not kilometers, right?

12:13.460 --> 12:15.460
Okay, the way it looks to me, we're going to be there by...

12:15.460 --> 12:17.460
Halloween.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.460
A world without Linux is hard to imagine.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.460
Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of

12:21.460 --> 12:23.460
individuals and companies who support Linux,

12:23.460 --> 12:25.460
so we don't have to.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.460
Learn more and help support Linux

12:27.460 --> 12:29.460
today.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.460
Wait, that sign says Bermuda Triangle Street

12:31.460 --> 12:33.460
ahead. Finally, some good news.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.460
Oh, I know, right?

12:35.460 --> 12:37.460
Sounds tropical.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.460
Oh, hashtag world without Linux.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.460
So what do you think, Wes?

12:41.460 --> 12:43.460
Are you impressed by the world without Linux

12:43.460 --> 12:45.460
series so far? There really wasn't very much

12:45.460 --> 12:47.460
of Linux in it, so I guess that's good.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.460
You know... Chris.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.460
Yes, yeah, go ahead, Buffy.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.460
Is this a cultural difference

12:53.460 --> 12:55.460
between you guys and us, or is that

12:55.460 --> 12:57.460
just not funny in any

12:57.460 --> 12:59.460
way shape or form?

12:59.460 --> 13:01.460
No, I think you're right there, Buffy.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.460
It's pretty much not funny, Buffy. Not only is

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
it not funny, but I don't get the premise.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.460
Like, if she has printed out directions,

13:07.460 --> 13:09.460
what did she print them from?

13:09.460 --> 13:11.460
Probably the Internet, and then he references MapQuest.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.460
Which is probably running Linux.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.460
And I think the fundamental, and maybe I'm overthinking this, but I think the other

13:15.460 --> 13:17.460
fundamental thing is like, it sort of assumes

13:17.460 --> 13:19.460
that something wouldn't come up in its place, like

13:19.460 --> 13:21.460
a BSD or something like that. I love the

13:21.460 --> 13:23.460
idea, though, and I love the basic

13:23.460 --> 13:25.460
idea that they're trying to convey. That's the

13:25.460 --> 13:27.460
part I should say. I love that. I love the idea

13:27.460 --> 13:29.460
they're trying to convey is Linux makes the world

13:29.460 --> 13:31.460
easier in a way you don't even realize.

13:31.460 --> 13:33.460
Spotlighting how it builds all the common infrastructure.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.460
Do you think maybe these

13:35.460 --> 13:37.460
promotions

13:37.460 --> 13:39.460
are not aimed at us?

13:39.460 --> 13:41.460
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly correct.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.460
Do you think this is more suitable for my

13:43.460 --> 13:45.460
mum when I want to explain what Linux

13:45.460 --> 13:47.460
is and what it's done for the world?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
I do think so. I think it's kind of fun.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.460
I'm glad they're putting it out there, and

13:51.460 --> 13:53.460
you know, I've noticed that the first episode

13:53.460 --> 13:55.460
did get a little bit of attention. Yeah, it did.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.460
I think if I

13:57.460 --> 13:59.460
showed this to my mum, she'd say,

13:59.460 --> 14:01.460
that's nice, dear, and that

14:01.460 --> 14:03.460
would be it. Yeah,

14:03.460 --> 14:05.460
there's an element of that as well.

14:05.460 --> 14:07.460
It didn't make a big connection to

14:07.460 --> 14:09.460
the part Linux plays, really.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.460
No. No, I guess you have to...

14:11.460 --> 14:13.460
There's a huge amount that goes into providing the real-time

14:13.460 --> 14:15.460
directions. You kind of have to infer that Linux would

14:15.460 --> 14:17.460
be providing solutions for all those things

14:17.460 --> 14:19.460
but if you don't know anything about Linux...

14:19.460 --> 14:21.460
Debbie Downer and all that, but it just

14:21.460 --> 14:23.460
seems like a complete waste of time.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.460
The other

14:25.460 --> 14:27.460
question that has to be asked is

14:27.460 --> 14:29.460
is that being created under Linux?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.460
Yeah, right, exactly. I don't think it is.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.460
Was that contracted for a designer

14:33.460 --> 14:35.460
using a Mac? Yeah.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.460
I don't know, so I'm torn.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.460
Part of me really likes them getting the word out, and

14:39.460 --> 14:41.460
part of me likes the idea of sort of showing how Linux

14:41.460 --> 14:43.460
has made our modern lives easier, but part of me

14:43.460 --> 14:45.460
thinks it's a little off-tone

14:45.460 --> 14:47.460
because you have to kind of know how Linux fills in

14:47.460 --> 14:49.460
the gaps in order to get it in the first place, and if you know how

14:49.460 --> 14:51.460
Linux fills in the gaps, it's not resonating with you.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.460
And number two is... I probably think it was

14:53.460 --> 14:55.460
probably made on a Mac.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.460
My thoughts. Hey, you know what?

14:57.460 --> 14:59.460
Speaking of things that are probably not made on Macs,

14:59.460 --> 15:01.460
OggCamp 15 this weekend!

15:01.460 --> 15:03.460
October 31st and

15:03.460 --> 15:05.460
November 1st in Liverpool,

15:05.460 --> 15:07.460
which is a little

15:07.460 --> 15:09.460
bit of a commute from here. Just a little bit of a commute.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.460
So I don't think I'll be making it, but I bet a few

15:11.460 --> 15:13.460
folks in the... I've got a boat and everything. I know, I could.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.460
Put the rover.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.460
Yeah, just put the rover on a ferry and call it good.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.460
Put some pontoons on it. What else

15:19.460 --> 15:21.460
do I need? So anybody want to

15:21.460 --> 15:23.460
chat about OggCamp and kind of tell us what to expect

15:23.460 --> 15:25.460
if people are in the area? Maybe they could make it.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.460
Go ahead. Yeah, so

15:27.460 --> 15:29.460
this is, I don't know,

15:29.460 --> 15:31.460
like the eighth, seventh one?

15:31.460 --> 15:33.460
I've lost count.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.460
And something like that.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.460
And we do them every year.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.460
They're community-run events.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.460
It's an unconference,

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
and we've moved around the country a few times.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.460
We've run them in Liverpool a few times because

15:45.460 --> 15:47.460
one of the organisers lives near there,

15:47.460 --> 15:49.460
and we've got a really great deal on a venue.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.460
It's at Liverpool John Moores University.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.460
31st of October,

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
1st of November, so that's this weekend as we're

15:55.460 --> 15:57.460
recording.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.460
And people come along. It's not necessarily

15:59.460 --> 16:01.460
a Linux or open source

16:01.460 --> 16:03.460
or FOSS conference.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.460
It's free culture,

16:05.460 --> 16:07.460
open hardware hacking.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.460
There's some Linux people there.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.460
I bet there's a fair amount of Linux people there.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.460
Yeah, there is.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.460
But it's not

16:15.460 --> 16:17.460
distro-specific, so while

16:17.460 --> 16:19.460
Ubuntu is one of the sponsors, Fedora

16:19.460 --> 16:21.460
is another sponsor, and

16:21.460 --> 16:23.460
Martin can tell you one of the other

16:23.460 --> 16:25.460
sponsors in a minute.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.460
Yeah, we have a bunch of sponsors who

16:27.460 --> 16:29.460
help fund the event, but the key thing is it's free

16:29.460 --> 16:31.460
to attend, so you can

16:31.460 --> 16:33.460
buy a ticket if you want to,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.460
if you want to pay and donate a little bit that

16:35.460 --> 16:37.460
helps run the event,

16:37.460 --> 16:39.460
or you can just have a ticket for free.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.460
We don't differentiate.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.460
That's a cool system.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.460
But the thing is

16:45.460 --> 16:47.460
most years, the years when we started

16:47.460 --> 16:49.460
doing this community funded,

16:49.460 --> 16:51.460
it turns out that the community

16:51.460 --> 16:53.460
turned out to be one of the biggest

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
sponsors voluntarily.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.460
So people just voluntarily

16:57.460 --> 16:59.460
gave £5, £10, whatever they could,

16:59.460 --> 17:01.460
and that was

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
comparable or higher than

17:03.460 --> 17:05.460
the corporate sponsorships we got

17:05.460 --> 17:07.460
from big name

17:07.460 --> 17:09.460
brands, which I thought was really nice and really

17:09.460 --> 17:11.460
shows off the way that the conference runs.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.460
And if people want to come along, come along to

17:13.460 --> 17:15.460
Liverpool John Moores University.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.460
If you go to ogcamp.org,

17:17.460 --> 17:19.460
you'll find out all the details, the schedule, and

17:19.460 --> 17:21.460
if you've got something to talk about, bring that along

17:21.460 --> 17:23.460
and do a long form talk

17:23.460 --> 17:25.460
or we've got lightning talks as well.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.460
Cool. That's exactly

17:27.460 --> 17:29.460
the kind of event

17:29.460 --> 17:31.460
that I think is really in that sweet spot. So that

17:31.460 --> 17:33.460
sounds really cool. Ogcamp.org, and I'd love

17:33.460 --> 17:35.460
it if you guys showed up and told us

17:35.460 --> 17:37.460
a little about how it went next week. So Wimpy,

17:37.460 --> 17:39.460
you had a little deets on one of the

17:39.460 --> 17:41.460
potential sponsors here. Is this the one

17:41.460 --> 17:43.460
listed here at the bottom of the page?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.460
No, at the top of the page.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.460
So Entroware, who

17:47.460 --> 17:49.460
are the Platinum sponsor this year,

17:49.460 --> 17:51.460
they are also

17:51.460 --> 17:53.460
a hardware partner

17:53.460 --> 17:55.460
for Ubuntu Mate. Right, right.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.460
So Entroware

17:57.460 --> 17:59.460
is sort of the UK's answer to

17:59.460 --> 18:01.460
System76. So if you want a

18:01.460 --> 18:03.460
computer that is designed

18:03.460 --> 18:05.460
to run Linux, then

18:05.460 --> 18:07.460
Entroware is the place that you go.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.460
And at Ogcamp this year,

18:09.460 --> 18:11.460
they're the Platinum sponsor, I think the only Platinum

18:11.460 --> 18:13.460
sponsor. They're going to be

18:13.460 --> 18:15.460
showing off their new Skylake

18:15.460 --> 18:17.460
equipped systems

18:17.460 --> 18:19.460
at the event. They've also

18:19.460 --> 18:21.460
donated one of their

18:21.460 --> 18:23.460
new as yet unreleased models

18:23.460 --> 18:25.460
to the raffle. So there's a £600

18:25.460 --> 18:27.460
laptop up for grabs

18:27.460 --> 18:29.460
in the raffle, and

18:29.460 --> 18:31.460
I can exclusively

18:31.460 --> 18:33.460
reveal that Entroware are also

18:33.460 --> 18:35.460
a Valve partner, and they will be

18:35.460 --> 18:37.460
showing off their Steam Machine at

18:37.460 --> 18:39.460
this year's Ogcamp, and so you can come along

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
and have a play with Entroware's

18:41.460 --> 18:43.460
Steam Machine. So yeah. That's exciting.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.460
And this is great

18:45.460 --> 18:47.460
for me personally, because I know these

18:47.460 --> 18:49.460
people via email

18:49.460 --> 18:51.460
and Telegram and what have you, but I've

18:51.460 --> 18:53.460
never met them in person, so this is an opportunity

18:53.460 --> 18:55.460
for me to meet the

18:55.460 --> 18:57.460
guys at Entroware for the first time.

18:57.460 --> 18:59.460
So this is a perfect

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
example of what Entroware's all about. It's about

19:01.460 --> 19:03.460
bringing people together from the

19:03.460 --> 19:05.460
community to have a chat,

19:05.460 --> 19:07.460
have a meal, and have

19:07.460 --> 19:09.460
some fun, and do

19:09.460 --> 19:11.460
good things. Really cool.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.460
I'm glad that they're doing that. And

19:13.460 --> 19:15.460
Ogcamp.org is

19:15.460 --> 19:17.460
now, is there any chance at any

19:17.460 --> 19:19.460
point that this thing would ever

19:19.460 --> 19:21.460
be live streamed?

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
We've recorded

19:23.460 --> 19:25.460
talks in

19:25.460 --> 19:27.460
the past, and in fact we've

19:27.460 --> 19:29.460
had some people record

19:29.460 --> 19:31.460
talks and send them to us.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.460
One notable one was

19:33.460 --> 19:35.460
Stephen Fry,

19:35.460 --> 19:37.460
who sent us a talk that we

19:37.460 --> 19:39.460
played to the audience at

19:39.460 --> 19:41.460
Ogcamp a few years ago, which

19:41.460 --> 19:43.460
was really nice, and he talked about Software Freedom and

19:43.460 --> 19:45.460
GNU and all that good stuff.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.460
We tend to not live stream

19:47.460 --> 19:49.460
because we just

19:49.460 --> 19:51.460
don't have enough people and

19:51.460 --> 19:53.460
infrastructure and stuff to do it.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.460
You know what would be amazing? You know what would be an amazing goal?

19:55.460 --> 19:57.460
It's probably impossible, but how cool would it be

19:57.460 --> 19:59.460
for Ogcamp 16 if Jupyter Broadcasting could go

19:59.460 --> 20:01.460
and we could live stream it for you?

20:01.460 --> 20:03.460
That would be amazing.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.460
Put that in the budget, Chris.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.460
I just gotta take care of a few things.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.460
I just would love to.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.460
That's not a bad idea, actually.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.460
It's a really great idea, and

20:13.460 --> 20:15.460
I know of at least

20:15.460 --> 20:17.460
half a dozen podcasters in the UK that

20:17.460 --> 20:19.460
could help with your accommodation whilst you're out.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.460
That would be fun. That would be a lot of fun.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.460
Well, let's talk more. I think that'd be really cool.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.460
Alright, so

20:25.460 --> 20:27.460
Wimpy, while we're talking about Ubuntu Mate

20:27.460 --> 20:29.460
too, guess what? As the part of the big release,

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
all the big 15.10 releases came out,

20:31.460 --> 20:33.460
and the one that we follow really closely on

20:33.460 --> 20:35.460
the show is Ubuntu Mate Edition.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.460
15.10 is out, and

20:37.460 --> 20:39.460
I like the press kit page that was put together,

20:39.460 --> 20:41.460
and it looks like a ton of stuff.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.460
Obviously, the really big feature is

20:43.460 --> 20:45.460
Mate Desktop 1.10.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.460
Also, the new...

20:47.460 --> 20:49.460
I know that you worked really hard on the new welcome screen,

20:49.460 --> 20:51.460
so, Wimpy, where do you want to start with some of

20:51.460 --> 20:53.460
the new stuff that's in Ubuntu Mate, because it looks like

20:53.460 --> 20:55.460
a killer release.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.460
Well, I think so, but then I'm

20:57.460 --> 20:59.460
biased, aren't I?

20:59.460 --> 21:01.460
Well, I think... I mean, I'm telling you realistically,

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
I mean, one of the reasons people might

21:03.460 --> 21:05.460
ask and wonder why do I follow it closely

21:05.460 --> 21:07.460
on this podcast, why don't I follow Kubuntu

21:07.460 --> 21:09.460
or Zubuntu,

21:09.460 --> 21:11.460
which has been around for longer,

21:11.460 --> 21:13.460
because, honestly, to me,

21:13.460 --> 21:15.460
I feel like I've been watching a lot of different

21:15.460 --> 21:17.460
flavors for a long time, a lot of different

21:17.460 --> 21:19.460
distributions for a really, really long time,

21:19.460 --> 21:21.460
and there is really some

21:21.460 --> 21:23.460
great things you're doing here, so I think this is one

21:23.460 --> 21:25.460
of the standouts, and so that's why I like to cover here

21:25.460 --> 21:27.460
on the show.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.460
I'm biased as well. I think it really is

21:29.460 --> 21:31.460
a fantastic desktop for anybody that

21:31.460 --> 21:33.460
wants to game under Linux

21:33.460 --> 21:35.460
because the Mate desktop has very

21:35.460 --> 21:37.460
low overhead, but you're getting a very high-quality,

21:37.460 --> 21:39.460
very modern-looking desktop, or anybody that just

21:39.460 --> 21:41.460
wants a very simple, straightforward desktop that

21:41.460 --> 21:43.460
works the way they expect that has low resource

21:43.460 --> 21:45.460
usage. But still looks really good. Yeah.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.460
And it's friendly to use. It's very friendly to use.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
So I'm biased as well.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.460
Well, thank you very much for the kind words.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.460
That's very gracious of you.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.460
Yeah, so we've got the

21:55.460 --> 21:57.460
Mate Desktop 1.10, and you

21:57.460 --> 21:59.460
touched on the Steam stuff there.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.460
So there's a couple of things

22:01.460 --> 22:03.460
where the planets have aligned there.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.460
I think

22:05.460 --> 22:07.460
Foronix either today or yesterday

22:07.460 --> 22:09.460
published an article about the different

22:09.460 --> 22:11.460
desktop environments and their performance

22:11.460 --> 22:13.460
with running games

22:13.460 --> 22:15.460
under Linux. And Mate was up there

22:15.460 --> 22:17.460
in the top couple

22:17.460 --> 22:19.460
of desktops for sort of gaming

22:19.460 --> 22:21.460
performance. It makes sense.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.460
And then you marry that with

22:23.460 --> 22:25.460
the Ubuntu 15.10 base,

22:25.460 --> 22:27.460
which of course has got Steam

22:27.460 --> 22:29.460
Controller support out of

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
the box. And then what

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
we've done with Ubuntu Mate

22:33.460 --> 22:35.460
Welcome, which has got a one-click

22:35.460 --> 22:37.460
installer for Steam.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.460
And you have an environment

22:39.460 --> 22:41.460
that can, with one

22:41.460 --> 22:43.460
click, be your desktop

22:43.460 --> 22:45.460
gaming environment. So

22:45.460 --> 22:47.460
yeah, there's a few things that

22:47.460 --> 22:49.460
come together in a very sort of last minute

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
timely fashion. But you know,

22:51.460 --> 22:53.460
it's nice to see all of those

22:53.460 --> 22:55.460
things being pulled together.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.460
But I suppose Ubuntu Mate Welcome

22:57.460 --> 22:59.460
is more than people

22:59.460 --> 23:01.460
realize. I see people sort of

23:01.460 --> 23:03.460
immediately hitting close because

23:03.460 --> 23:05.460
these sort of welcome screens

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
traditionally have been a bit anemic.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.460
You know, just a bunch of links

23:09.460 --> 23:11.460
to websites and Ubuntu

23:11.460 --> 23:13.460
Mate Welcome is not that.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
It actually does things.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.460
You know, it gives you some help

23:17.460 --> 23:19.460
through the initial post

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
install configuration

23:21.460 --> 23:23.460
and can install,

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
not right now, definitely for

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
16.04, but now

23:27.460 --> 23:29.460
at least a good proportion of

23:29.460 --> 23:31.460
the software you would want to install on a

23:31.460 --> 23:33.460
computer. You know, if you've used a computer

23:33.460 --> 23:35.460
regardless of operating system,

23:35.460 --> 23:37.460
you're probably familiar with things

23:37.460 --> 23:39.460
like Dropbox and Google Chrome

23:39.460 --> 23:41.460
or Spider

23:41.460 --> 23:43.460
Oak 1 or a whole heap of other things.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.460
And Ubuntu Mate

23:45.460 --> 23:47.460
Welcome's got one click installers for

23:47.460 --> 23:49.460
all of those and many others besides.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.460
And we'll expand on that

23:51.460 --> 23:53.460
selection slightly, not

23:53.460 --> 23:55.460
overly, maybe about

23:55.460 --> 23:57.460
20 titles or so in the next

23:57.460 --> 23:59.460
release just to sort of make that

23:59.460 --> 24:01.460
the place you can go

24:01.460 --> 24:03.460
once you've installed. And also it's asynchronous.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
I don't think anyone's picked up

24:05.460 --> 24:07.460
on this, but you can go down that

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
link, that list and hit install, install,

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
install, install. Oh, I love that. That's wonderful.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
Thank you for that. So

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
is this also sort of

24:15.460 --> 24:17.460
a...

24:17.460 --> 24:19.460
Is this sort of an answer to

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
the software center that isn't a software

24:21.460 --> 24:23.460
center? It isn't an app store. It's

24:23.460 --> 24:25.460
almost something better because

24:25.460 --> 24:27.460
it's actually more in line with

24:27.460 --> 24:29.460
what users actually need.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
Every single time I give someone a new Linux desktop

24:31.460 --> 24:33.460
and it baffles

24:33.460 --> 24:35.460
me to this day,

24:35.460 --> 24:37.460
the hugest concept gap that they have

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
is how to acquire new software.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
Definitely. Because in their minds, I gave

24:41.460 --> 24:43.460
just this, just

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
Monday, I gave somebody a new Linux laptop

24:45.460 --> 24:47.460
and his first thought was

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
he wanted to go download Scrivener for the writing month

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
that's coming up. Download,

24:51.460 --> 24:53.460
he just went to Scrivener's website

24:53.460 --> 24:55.460
and immediately started looking for a download link

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
and a download in exe. And it

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
just does not register

24:59.460 --> 25:01.460
at all how it should be done. And I think

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
so an app store is actually too much.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.460
It is overshoot.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
They have

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
a category of applications they just

25:09.460 --> 25:11.460
want to get up and running with pretty quickly

25:11.460 --> 25:13.460
and then they pretty much never really go

25:13.460 --> 25:15.460
back and change it again.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.460
Most people, that's what they're doing. They're using the computer

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
to use these applications. That few functions, right?

25:19.460 --> 25:21.460
If you nail it with the welcome screen,

25:21.460 --> 25:23.460
you almost negate the

25:23.460 --> 25:25.460
need to have a really well robust

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
app store. I mean, it doesn't

25:27.460 --> 25:29.460
completely replace it, but for

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
a good decent chunk of users,

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
it negates the need as much.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
Yeah, for a good chunk of people

25:35.460 --> 25:37.460
it certainly fills a need.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.460
And that's what it's designed to do.

25:39.460 --> 25:41.460
So,

25:41.460 --> 25:43.460
Matt Hartley actually helped with the

25:43.460 --> 25:45.460
software selection in Ubuntu

25:45.460 --> 25:47.460
Marte Welcome. So, he helped

25:47.460 --> 25:49.460
identify the applications and

25:49.460 --> 25:51.460
what they were alternative or equivalent

25:51.460 --> 25:53.460
to. So, some of the apps you'll

25:53.460 --> 25:55.460
find in there says this

25:55.460 --> 25:57.460
is an alternative to. So, GIMP

25:57.460 --> 25:59.460
says it's an alternative to Photoshop.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.460
That's nice.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.460
Say it's equivalent.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.460
It's an alternative to. But we've done as

26:05.460 --> 26:07.460
much as we can to these

26:07.460 --> 26:09.460
applications to make them the best they

26:09.460 --> 26:11.460
can be. So, in the example of GIMP,

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
it doesn't just install GIMP. It installs

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
GIMP and a series of

26:15.460 --> 26:17.460
plugins including CMYK

26:17.460 --> 26:19.460
support. Oh, that's very polished.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.460
There's a little bit of tweaking that goes on

26:21.460 --> 26:23.460
there. So, when you choose

26:23.460 --> 26:25.460
to install Chromium. So, there's a little

26:25.460 --> 26:27.460
tick box that says hide proprietary

26:27.460 --> 26:29.460
software. If you're looking at the

26:29.460 --> 26:31.460
internet section and you click that,

26:31.460 --> 26:33.460
Chrome disappears and

26:33.460 --> 26:35.460
Chromium appears in its place.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.460
But when you install Chromium,

26:37.460 --> 26:39.460
it installs Chromium

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
and all of the

26:41.460 --> 26:43.460
supported multimedia extensions

26:43.460 --> 26:45.460
for Chromium are available.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
So, it does an awful lot behind the

26:47.460 --> 26:49.460
scenes. It does a lot of the heavy lifting.

26:49.460 --> 26:51.460
And, you know, it also brings some things

26:51.460 --> 26:53.460
in that probably need a bit of promoting. So,

26:53.460 --> 26:55.460
things like VeraCrypt which is now the

26:55.460 --> 26:57.460
successor to TrueCrypt.

26:57.460 --> 26:59.460
Now that TrueCrypt have been through its NCC

26:59.460 --> 27:01.460
group, you know, validations

27:01.460 --> 27:03.460
and they've signed it off and the guys

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
at VeraCrypt have really

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
improved the cryptography

27:07.460 --> 27:09.460
and some of the

27:09.460 --> 27:11.460
key generation in VeraCrypt.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.460
I think that is

27:13.460 --> 27:15.460
now a genuine

27:15.460 --> 27:17.460
alternative to TrueCrypt. So, there's a one-click

27:17.460 --> 27:19.460
installer, you know, for that. For those

27:19.460 --> 27:21.460
people that have got TrueCrypt

27:21.460 --> 27:23.460
volumes that really need to

27:23.460 --> 27:25.460
stop using TrueCrypt now,

27:25.460 --> 27:27.460
there's a solution for you to

27:27.460 --> 27:29.460
import your TrueCrypt volume, bring it up

27:29.460 --> 27:31.460
to date with the latest stuff.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.460
Makes it nice and easy to move over.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.460
Yeah, yeah. So,

27:35.460 --> 27:37.460
it does a whole heap of things

27:37.460 --> 27:39.460
and as you say, you know,

27:39.460 --> 27:41.460
for most people this will...

27:41.460 --> 27:43.460
So, I haven't

27:43.460 --> 27:45.460
cooked this up, you know,

27:45.460 --> 27:47.460
out of thin air. This is actually made

27:47.460 --> 27:49.460
by talking to actual people

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
that use the distribution or

27:51.460 --> 27:53.460
use other operating systems and trying

27:53.460 --> 27:55.460
to understand what they need.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.460
And it is more geared towards people

27:57.460 --> 27:59.460
who just need a helping hand to get

27:59.460 --> 28:01.460
started, but that

28:01.460 --> 28:03.460
asynchronous technique

28:03.460 --> 28:05.460
is also convenient for someone like

28:05.460 --> 28:07.460
me who when I install a new machine,

28:07.460 --> 28:09.460
I can just go down the list,

28:09.460 --> 28:11.460
install, install, install, install, install,

28:11.460 --> 28:13.460
walk away, make a cup of tea and come

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
back and all my stuff's installed.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.460
So, this is...

28:17.460 --> 28:19.460
I mean, that's just the welcome screen,

28:19.460 --> 28:21.460
but there's also one of the things that you

28:21.460 --> 28:23.460
I saw also updated was

28:23.460 --> 28:25.460
MateTweak, which I think is

28:25.460 --> 28:27.460
kind of maybe a nice point to underscore

28:27.460 --> 28:29.460
because I don't know if people realize when

28:29.460 --> 28:31.460
they install it, you can go in here and you can actually

28:31.460 --> 28:33.460
turn on a whole bunch of more stuff and tweak

28:33.460 --> 28:35.460
a whole bunch of stuff. So, not to stop the welcome

28:35.460 --> 28:37.460
screen, but I also wanted you to touch on the tweak screen

28:37.460 --> 28:39.460
or the new tweak app or the updates to the tweak app

28:39.460 --> 28:41.460
too. Yeah. So,

28:41.460 --> 28:43.460
MateTweak is

28:43.460 --> 28:45.460
distribution agnostic.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
I forked it from Mint Desktop.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
So, it's a utility that

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
is shipped in Mint Desktop.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.460
I forked it from there and then

28:53.460 --> 28:55.460
stripped out all of the Mint

28:55.460 --> 28:57.460
stuff and then made it

28:57.460 --> 28:59.460
distribution agnostic. So,

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
it'll run on any distribution. So, it's

29:01.460 --> 29:03.460
not pinned to Debian or Ubuntu.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.460
It runs on Arch just fine and

29:05.460 --> 29:07.460
some people stuck it in the AUR.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.460
But this enables you to

29:09.460 --> 29:11.460
one click

29:11.460 --> 29:13.460
activate compiz, for example.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.460
Right. So, just like

29:15.460 --> 29:17.460
Ubuntu used to do back in the day,

29:17.460 --> 29:19.460
you used to go into those extra options

29:19.460 --> 29:21.460
and turn on

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
extra animations and

29:23.460 --> 29:25.460
compiz would come on. There's a drop down to

29:25.460 --> 29:27.460
enable compiz and it's also got

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
a facility to

29:29.460 --> 29:31.460
somewhat

29:31.460 --> 29:33.460
reproduce the look and feel of

29:33.460 --> 29:35.460
other desktop environments

29:35.460 --> 29:37.460
outside of the Linux world and within.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.460
So, you've got a theme

29:39.460 --> 29:41.460
called Redmond, which looks

29:41.460 --> 29:43.460
much like Windows XP.

29:43.460 --> 29:45.460
A theme called Cupertino,

29:45.460 --> 29:47.460
which looks like Mac OS X.

29:47.460 --> 29:49.460
And then

29:49.460 --> 29:51.460
within there, I've

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
changed the layout slightly. I've improved

29:53.460 --> 29:55.460
the way the UI works.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.460
So, now there's the

29:57.460 --> 29:59.460
enable indicators, which enables

29:59.460 --> 30:01.460
the app indicator capabilities of

30:01.460 --> 30:03.460
Ubuntu underneath the hood. Very nice.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.460
If you want app indicator support, it's a tick box

30:05.460 --> 30:07.460
away. Or the advanced menu.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.460
The advanced menu again is

30:09.460 --> 30:11.460
forked from the Mint utilities.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.460
That's the Mint menu, which again

30:13.460 --> 30:15.460
I've forked and made distribution

30:15.460 --> 30:17.460
agnostic. So, this is

30:17.460 --> 30:19.460
something you can install on any

30:19.460 --> 30:21.460
distribution running Marte and

30:21.460 --> 30:23.460
it gives you that Mint desktop

30:23.460 --> 30:25.460
that I've sort of stripped out all of the bits

30:25.460 --> 30:27.460
that are specific to Mint

30:27.460 --> 30:29.460
and made it something that you can run

30:29.460 --> 30:31.460
anywhere. And that's

30:31.460 --> 30:33.460
those two utilities are sort of those

30:35.460 --> 30:37.460
sort of value add

30:37.460 --> 30:39.460
that give sort of Ubuntu Marte

30:39.460 --> 30:41.460
some of its identity, you know,

30:41.460 --> 30:43.460
that distinguish it from

30:43.460 --> 30:45.460
the other distributions.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.460
Right. Very much so.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.460
And it makes me

30:49.460 --> 30:51.460
wonder. The next thing that

30:51.460 --> 30:53.460
comes to mind is why I'd love to have somebody

30:53.460 --> 30:55.460
have all these things but not have to worry about them

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
upgrading their distro in nine months.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.460
What is the likelihood that any of this stuff ever

30:59.460 --> 31:01.460
makes it any further back down to sort of like

31:01.460 --> 31:03.460
an LTS release? Is that even possible?

31:03.460 --> 31:05.460
Well, definitely

31:05.460 --> 31:07.460
it's going to be in 16.04.

31:07.460 --> 31:09.460
So, going forward. All right. So, I

31:09.460 --> 31:11.460
guess I'd have to wait. So, if somebody

31:11.460 --> 31:13.460
today wanted to set up an LTS

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
laptop, they'd kind of have to either

31:15.460 --> 31:17.460
kind of wait or go

31:17.460 --> 31:19.460
with 15.10 and then update.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.460
Well,

31:21.460 --> 31:23.460
you've got a number of options. There is

31:23.460 --> 31:25.460
an Ubuntu Marte 14.04 release

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
which is based on the

31:27.460 --> 31:29.460
Ubuntu LTS release strategy.

31:29.460 --> 31:31.460
Those two utilities

31:31.460 --> 31:33.460
that you're looking at there have been

31:33.460 --> 31:35.460
backported. So, Ubuntu Marte

31:35.460 --> 31:37.460
Welcome and Marte Tweak have been

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
backported to 14.04.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.460
So, if you want them, they're there.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.460
Now, the thing is

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
I didn't

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
appreciate this at the time, but

31:47.460 --> 31:49.460
the gap between

31:49.460 --> 31:51.460
Ubuntu Marte 14.04

31:51.460 --> 31:53.460
and 15.10 is

31:53.460 --> 31:55.460
vast. So,

31:55.460 --> 31:57.460
my advice is if you're

31:57.460 --> 31:59.460
interested in trying out Ubuntu Marte

31:59.460 --> 32:01.460
today, install

32:01.460 --> 32:03.460
15.10 because

32:03.460 --> 32:05.460
the best version

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
we've made, the most polished

32:07.460 --> 32:09.460
version we've made,

32:09.460 --> 32:11.460
and one of the other things we've worked

32:11.460 --> 32:13.460
on in this release is that you can

32:13.460 --> 32:15.460
distribution release

32:15.460 --> 32:17.460
upgrade. So, I've upgraded

32:17.460 --> 32:19.460
all of my machines that I was on

32:19.460 --> 32:21.460
15.04 to

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
15.10 using the internal

32:23.460 --> 32:25.460
upgrade. I worked with the Ubuntu

32:25.460 --> 32:27.460
foundations team to make sure

32:27.460 --> 32:29.460
that that stuff worked right. So,

32:29.460 --> 32:31.460
if you install 15.10 today,

32:31.460 --> 32:33.460
I will personally guarantee

32:33.460 --> 32:35.460
you can upgrade to 16.04

32:35.460 --> 32:37.460
in April.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
Wow. Wimpy will fix it for you if it breaks.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
Yeah, well, I mean, even if

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
you didn't mention that, I was just going to say it seems like a pretty

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
safe bet that since the gap between

32:45.460 --> 32:47.460
15.10 and 16.04 is small,

32:47.460 --> 32:49.460
it should be fine.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.460
Yeah, it's one to one. You should be able to upgrade pretty safely.

32:51.460 --> 32:53.460
So, it seems like this would be the one to jump in at.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.460
But for me,

32:55.460 --> 32:57.460
I've recently rediscovered

32:57.460 --> 32:59.460
my love affair with Bluetooth.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.460
So, something the Mate

33:01.460 --> 33:03.460
team have been working on for a while

33:03.460 --> 33:05.460
now is helping

33:05.460 --> 33:07.460
the new maintainer of Blue

33:07.460 --> 33:09.460
Man 2

33:09.460 --> 33:11.460
to fruition.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.460
That's great.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.460
So, Blue Man 2 also features

33:15.460 --> 33:17.460
in 15.10. And

33:17.460 --> 33:19.460
Ubuntu Mate is not the only

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
flavor to take advantage of

33:21.460 --> 33:23.460
Blue Man 2.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.460
The underlying stack

33:25.460 --> 33:27.460
has been upgraded as well to

33:27.460 --> 33:29.460
Blue's 5.35

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
rather than an extremely old

33:31.460 --> 33:33.460
version of Blue's 4. So,

33:33.460 --> 33:35.460
consequently, I'm now able to

33:35.460 --> 33:37.460
do Bluetooth

33:37.460 --> 33:39.460
sharing

33:39.460 --> 33:41.460
over network sharing

33:41.460 --> 33:43.460
and connecting to

33:43.460 --> 33:45.460
headsets and speakers and stuff.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.460
Very recently, things I've become

33:47.460 --> 33:49.460
more and more...

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
I've wanted more and more as I've sometimes

33:51.460 --> 33:53.460
been in the rover without connectivity

33:53.460 --> 33:55.460
and I just want to move a file from

33:55.460 --> 33:57.460
my phone to the desktop. I just

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
want to move that file between these two devices and I

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
just have Bluetooth as my available option.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.460
That should be easy. Yeah, that should be.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.460
So, I know...

34:05.460 --> 34:07.460
It also feels like we are now

34:07.460 --> 34:09.460
really reaching the point where

34:09.460 --> 34:11.460
14.04, even with its updates,

34:11.460 --> 34:13.460
even the point updates, 14.04 is

34:13.460 --> 34:15.460
beginning to feel very old.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.460
And I...

34:17.460 --> 34:19.460
You know, we have a machine here

34:19.460 --> 34:21.460
in studio now that is dual

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
booting and one of the systems it's booting is Ubuntu

34:23.460 --> 34:25.460
15.10. And I think I'm going

34:25.460 --> 34:27.460
to stay there for a while and go

34:27.460 --> 34:29.460
to 16.04 because I don't think I can go back.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.460
Who's clicking there, Wes? Who is that?

34:31.460 --> 34:33.460
Who's clickalickin'? Who's clickalackin'?

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
That's

34:35.460 --> 34:37.460
Swift. All right, Swift.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.460
Maybe Swift needs to move up to the

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
staging area for a minute. Sorry

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
about that. So, what I was

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
just saying is I

34:45.460 --> 34:47.460
just very recently went through this debate as I was

34:47.460 --> 34:49.460
setting up this machine here in the

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
studio thinking, well, I might as well just stay at 15.10 for a while.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.460
Just hang out there. Yeah, check out there.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.460
And then go to 16.04. That'd be better than this.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.460
Generally, 15.10 is a really solid release.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.460
Yeah, that was my experience in the review testing

34:59.460 --> 35:01.460
that we did. There's an awful lot of

35:01.460 --> 35:03.460
effort, but you know, behind the scenes, having

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
some involvement with some of the

35:05.460 --> 35:07.460
people at Canonical now and

35:07.460 --> 35:09.460
being able to see what goes on

35:09.460 --> 35:11.460
sort of behind the scenes on a

35:11.460 --> 35:13.460
day-to-day basis. Yeah.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.460
To say that

35:15.460 --> 35:17.460
whilst visually on

35:17.460 --> 35:19.460
the surface, people might not appreciate it.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.460
And you didn't get

35:21.460 --> 35:23.460
grossed out. I'll give you

35:23.460 --> 35:25.460
an example. If you look

35:25.460 --> 35:27.460
at it on the surface, you might not

35:27.460 --> 35:29.460
think Ubuntu Software Center has

35:29.460 --> 35:31.460
changed, but I know it has.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.460
So, at the back end,

35:33.460 --> 35:35.460
Ubuntu Software Center has actually

35:35.460 --> 35:37.460
seen some

35:37.460 --> 35:39.460
bug fixing and improvements

35:39.460 --> 35:41.460
that you won't

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
appreciate, you know, through

35:43.460 --> 35:45.460
the UI because the version

35:45.460 --> 35:47.460
number is the same, but if you go and look at

35:47.460 --> 35:49.460
the change logs, you can actually see that the

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
Ubuntu Desktop team have been working on this.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.460
Well, that's a statement right there. I haven't heard one before.

35:53.460 --> 35:55.460
There's a whole heap of things like

35:55.460 --> 35:57.460
that that I've now got an insight to

35:57.460 --> 35:59.460
and an appreciation of.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.460
You know, that has been... I didn't previously

36:01.460 --> 36:03.460
have. That has been a universal

36:03.460 --> 36:05.460
experience of mine every time we've gone in

36:05.460 --> 36:07.460
and worked with any... a lot of these

36:07.460 --> 36:09.460
companies that work in this field is that there's

36:09.460 --> 36:11.460
a lot of work and things that get done

36:11.460 --> 36:13.460
that they are, A, just not

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
very good at communicating because they don't

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
have the time, they don't see the need, or the people who

36:17.460 --> 36:19.460
would be communicating don't see the need or aren't connected to the

36:19.460 --> 36:21.460
people making the change. Or there's legal reasons

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
a lot of the times, too, that they can't say anything.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.460
Or, you know, there's thousands.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.460
But every time we go in there, it's like, wow, you guys

36:27.460 --> 36:29.460
are really working really hard, even though from the

36:29.460 --> 36:31.460
outside we don't see it all the time. It's universally

36:31.460 --> 36:33.460
really much been the case, and I'm

36:33.460 --> 36:35.460
usually very impressed.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.460
Speaking of impressed, very impressed

36:37.460 --> 36:39.460
by Ubuntu Mate 15.10, I think

36:39.460 --> 36:41.460
that's becoming the default recommendation.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.460
If somebody wants to

36:43.460 --> 36:45.460
try Linux, I think this is the

36:45.460 --> 36:47.460
go-to, especially if they're coming

36:47.460 --> 36:49.460
from a Windows or Mac

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
desktop, even. Yeah, definitely.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.460
It's very approachable. Yeah. I mean, unless

36:53.460 --> 36:55.460
there's a specific reason they would need

36:55.460 --> 36:57.460
Gnome 3 or Unity, just to me seems

36:57.460 --> 36:59.460
if there's not a specific reason for that,

36:59.460 --> 37:01.460
because even on a brand new machine

37:01.460 --> 37:03.460
they're going to have a good performance. Yeah, definitely.

37:03.460 --> 37:05.460
And all the apps they could want.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.460
Personally, if

37:07.460 --> 37:09.460
Ubuntu Mate is the gateway

37:09.460 --> 37:11.460
drug for people to find Linux,

37:11.460 --> 37:13.460
I'd be perfectly happy to be

37:13.460 --> 37:15.460
that gateway distribution

37:15.460 --> 37:17.460
that people find Linux through.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.460
There you go. Very noble of you. Well said.

37:19.460 --> 37:21.460
If you use Ubuntu Mate

37:21.460 --> 37:23.460
and you like it, and then it whets

37:23.460 --> 37:25.460
your palate and you want to go on and find

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
other stuff, then great.

37:27.460 --> 37:29.460
Job well done, I think, if that's

37:29.460 --> 37:31.460
the position we hold in

37:31.460 --> 37:33.460
the Ubuntu distro community.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.460
So if you give it a try,

37:35.460 --> 37:37.460
let us know. linuxactionshow.reddit.com

37:37.460 --> 37:39.460
and find episode 116.

37:39.460 --> 37:41.460
And I wanted to also give Symonk2

37:41.460 --> 37:43.460
a chance to mention about his

37:43.460 --> 37:45.460
excitement for 16.04.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.460
Go ahead.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.460
Yeah, I was actually, I think I'm actually

37:49.460 --> 37:51.460
really, really excited for 16.04

37:51.460 --> 37:53.460
because I don't know if, I think it was Tech Republic

37:53.460 --> 37:55.460
that posted an article, and I kind of agree

37:55.460 --> 37:57.460
with this, where

37:57.460 --> 37:59.460
16.04 is probably going to

37:59.460 --> 38:01.460
be a very exciting release, because

38:01.460 --> 38:03.460
well, specifically for Ubuntu

38:03.460 --> 38:05.460
Unity, because

38:05.460 --> 38:07.460
Unity 8 is going to come around the corner.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.460
I don't know if it's going to be 16.04 or what their

38:09.460 --> 38:11.460
plans are, but I think this

38:11.460 --> 38:13.460
it's going to start to pick up pace

38:13.460 --> 38:15.460
not only with Ubuntu

38:15.460 --> 38:17.460
Unity, but with other

38:17.460 --> 38:19.460
flavors.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.460
So I really think this will be

38:21.460 --> 38:23.460
one of the... We'll see.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.460
Or is 16.04 going to

38:25.460 --> 38:27.460
be relatively simple and straightforward

38:27.460 --> 38:29.460
but yet with some nice features, and

38:29.460 --> 38:31.460
16.10 is going to blow your freaking mind.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.460
Yeah, probably. Something around there

38:33.460 --> 38:35.460
or within the next couple of years

38:35.460 --> 38:37.460
I think it'll drastically change.

38:37.460 --> 38:39.460
Stay tuned and find out.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.460
I love it. Keep watching this show.

38:41.460 --> 38:43.460
Okay, so we have some

38:43.460 --> 38:45.460
we have a big win for Linux users to

38:45.460 --> 38:47.460
get into. We still have the Intel discussion to talk

38:47.460 --> 38:49.460
about. Also, we have to

38:49.460 --> 38:51.460
discuss this, you don't own your

38:51.460 --> 38:53.460
operating system, therefore it can be decrypted

38:53.460 --> 38:55.460
and the new Linux laptop

38:55.460 --> 38:57.460
and we have some emails to

38:57.460 --> 38:59.460
get into, so I'm going to take a second here. I'm going to tell you

38:59.460 --> 39:01.460
all about Linux Academy. Yeah, I

39:01.460 --> 39:03.460
don't want to talk to you about Linux Academy right now. Go to

39:03.460 --> 39:05.460
linuxacademy.com

39:05.460 --> 39:07.460
to get our special Linux Unplugged discount

39:07.460 --> 39:09.460
and then give a tour, if you will,

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
of their different features. I think you'll be pretty impressed.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.460
It's Linux users that got together with

39:13.460 --> 39:15.460
developers and teachers to make something really great.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.460
And it's not... Oh, here's what I love

39:17.460 --> 39:19.460
about Linux Academy. It's not just an

39:19.460 --> 39:21.460
attempt at covering Linux and open source stuff.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.460
It is truly what they are passionate about.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.460
They have step-by-step video

39:25.460 --> 39:27.460
courses, comprehensive

39:27.460 --> 39:29.460
study guides, and the

39:29.460 --> 39:31.460
courses as well have come with instructor

39:31.460 --> 39:33.460
help, so you're not on your own necessarily.

39:33.460 --> 39:35.460
You can contact a real human being

39:35.460 --> 39:37.460
instructor and get help. There's a great community

39:37.460 --> 39:39.460
stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.460
The courses come with their own lab servers.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.460
Seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose

39:43.460 --> 39:45.460
from because they get that there's different distros you might need

39:45.460 --> 39:47.460
to learn on. You can keep track of

39:47.460 --> 39:49.460
your progress as you go and they've been rolling out

39:49.460 --> 39:51.460
brand new features. Rather than just

39:51.460 --> 39:53.460
checking solutions, you'll now get instant feedback.

39:53.460 --> 39:55.460
So you don't have to just try something, submit it,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.460
and see how it does and get scored. You can get immediate

39:57.460 --> 39:59.460
feedback when performing exercises.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.460
And then you can know if you need to

40:01.460 --> 40:03.460
make a change and do it correctly.

40:03.460 --> 40:05.460
There's a new learning tool that's part of Linux Academy

40:05.460 --> 40:07.460
membership at no additional cost that really adds

40:07.460 --> 40:09.460
some nice functionality. Like they're applying this

40:09.460 --> 40:11.460
new tool to build performance-based practice exams

40:11.460 --> 40:13.460
for search, such as the

40:13.460 --> 40:15.460
RHCSA and the Linux Foundation

40:15.460 --> 40:17.460
search. Now those Red Hat certifications

40:17.460 --> 40:19.460
are a serious thing that people

40:19.460 --> 40:21.460
really get stressed out about.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.460
And spend a lot of time and effort trying to get.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.460
Yeah, so the fact that they're building this performance-based practice

40:25.460 --> 40:27.460
exam I think is really

40:27.460 --> 40:29.460
slick, really well done.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.460
And it's for finally for

40:31.460 --> 40:33.460
people that are Linux users that have certain

40:33.460 --> 40:35.460
high expectations of

40:35.460 --> 40:37.460
what is being taught to them

40:37.460 --> 40:39.460
and not just like this basic stuff that's coming from

40:39.460 --> 40:41.460
somebody who's just doing a professional

40:41.460 --> 40:43.460
read, but actually somebody who wrote

40:43.460 --> 40:45.460
sat down and wrote the material instructors that are familiar

40:45.460 --> 40:47.460
with it when you need help. Scenario-based

40:47.460 --> 40:49.460
labs, you actually work with this stuff in a

40:49.460 --> 40:51.460
production live environment.

40:51.460 --> 40:53.460
A real lab server where you can SSH into and do

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
the actual work. I think it's

40:55.460 --> 40:57.460
really nice. And they also launched their professional

40:57.460 --> 40:59.460
development certification platform.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.460
It's a new set of tests that are very targeted

41:01.460 --> 41:03.460
and a lot different than professional certification.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.460
So there's a lot of new ways

41:05.460 --> 41:07.460
to challenge yourself. There's also tools

41:07.460 --> 41:09.460
available when you have limited availability that

41:09.460 --> 41:11.460
automatically adjust the courseware to match your

41:11.460 --> 41:13.460
availability. You combine that with the

41:13.460 --> 41:15.460
video streams. It's really pretty

41:15.460 --> 41:17.460
neat. And then, last but not least,

41:17.460 --> 41:19.460
you can deep dive into single topics with their nuggets.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.460
You go there two to sixty minutes long,

41:21.460 --> 41:23.460
learn something really simple, like

41:23.460 --> 41:25.460
how to use IP tables, how to use

41:25.460 --> 41:27.460
rsync, how to use Samba,

41:27.460 --> 41:29.460
how to set up Samba for this or that, just

41:29.460 --> 41:31.460
really specific topics. And it's really

41:31.460 --> 41:33.460
nice because they're all really quick or

41:33.460 --> 41:35.460
at least very specific. And I

41:35.460 --> 41:37.460
really think you should check out their lab systems.

41:37.460 --> 41:39.460
It's really cool. The fact that

41:39.460 --> 41:41.460
it comes with the lab is a nice feature

41:41.460 --> 41:43.460
too because if you're doing some of the AWS courses,

41:43.460 --> 41:45.460
you don't have to worry about setting up all that stuff.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.460
They'll take care of all of that for you as

41:47.460 --> 41:49.460
part of the integrated lab platform.

41:49.460 --> 41:51.460
It's really cool. No surprise, AWS

41:51.460 --> 41:53.460
builds. That's a big thing. Yeah, that has

41:53.460 --> 41:55.460
bit me. LinuxAcademy.com

41:55.460 --> 41:57.460
slash Unplugged. Go check them out. And a big

41:57.460 --> 41:59.460
thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.460
You guys are rockin'.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.460
And that new October update is huge.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.460
Huge. If you sign up, you can go read more about

42:05.460 --> 42:07.460
it and go check out their community section

42:07.460 --> 42:09.460
as well. It's very nice.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.460
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged. Thanks

42:11.460 --> 42:13.460
Linux Academy. Alright, so

42:13.460 --> 42:15.460
BRTMR wrote into

42:15.460 --> 42:17.460
the show. He says, I was not satisfied

42:17.460 --> 42:19.460
with podcatchers for the command line, so I

42:19.460 --> 42:21.460
built my own. And it's called PodFox.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.460
Now, I don't know how, how do you catch your

42:23.460 --> 42:25.460
podcast right now, Wes? How do you catch your podcast?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.460
How many podcasts do you subscribe to, Wes?

42:27.460 --> 42:29.460
Oh, maybe on the order of

42:29.460 --> 42:31.460
ten. Okay, yeah,

42:31.460 --> 42:33.460
that's actually almost exactly where I'm at.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.460
How do you download them? Are you

42:35.460 --> 42:37.460
familiar with curl? Are you

42:37.460 --> 42:39.460
serious? Well, no, actually I use

42:39.460 --> 42:41.460
ARIA 2, but it is in the terminal.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.460
That's usually how it goes

42:43.460 --> 42:45.460
for me. Really? Yes. Okay, so this might

42:45.460 --> 42:47.460
be perfect for you. So PodFox is a podcatcher

42:47.460 --> 42:49.460
for the terminal. I'm loving this logo here.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.460
Yeah, that is good, right? That is good.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.460
It's a work in progress, but it

42:53.460 --> 42:55.460
has got a nice, simple directory structure.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.460
Every podcast is identified with

42:57.460 --> 42:59.460
its own short name. I think you were checking this

42:59.460 --> 43:01.460
out a little bit ago. What do you think about

43:01.460 --> 43:03.460
something like this? I mean,

43:03.460 --> 43:05.460
you're doing a dozen shows manually?

43:05.460 --> 43:07.460
That does sound crazy

43:07.460 --> 43:09.460
now that I think about it, but yeah, that's what I have

43:09.460 --> 43:11.460
been doing. Have you tried BashPod or two? I have

43:11.460 --> 43:13.460
not actually, no. Okay, okay. So maybe I should

43:13.460 --> 43:15.460
give PodFox a shot here. Wow. I mean, I like

43:15.460 --> 43:17.460
Python. It looks neatly implemented.

43:17.460 --> 43:19.460
I thought for sure your answer is going to be on your

43:19.460 --> 43:21.460
phone. Oh, yeah?

43:21.460 --> 43:23.460
Well, actually, no, I do it the reverse. I usually download it on my

43:23.460 --> 43:25.460
computer and stick it in my sync thing folder, and then it

43:25.460 --> 43:27.460
syncs to my phone. So tell me, IRC,

43:27.460 --> 43:29.460
how do you, IRC room, what do you

43:29.460 --> 43:31.460
use? Like, what's the app name or the tool you

43:31.460 --> 43:33.460
use to download your podcast? And then Mumble Room,

43:33.460 --> 43:35.460
I'm curious, is anybody in the

43:35.460 --> 43:37.460
Mumble Room also using the command line right now

43:37.460 --> 43:39.460
to download your podcast?

43:39.460 --> 43:41.460
Stay with me, brothers. You used

43:41.460 --> 43:43.460
to, Poppy? What do you use? Okay, how did you

43:43.460 --> 43:45.460
do what you use now? There was a tool called

43:45.460 --> 43:47.460
HPodder. Oh, yes.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.460
HPodder was good. It was written in Haskell,

43:49.460 --> 43:51.460
I think, which is why it's called HPodder. I used

43:51.460 --> 43:53.460
to use that, but now, actually,

43:53.460 --> 43:55.460
I have an iPad

43:55.460 --> 43:57.460
1 that is pretty much useless

43:57.460 --> 43:59.460
for anything because no apps

43:59.460 --> 44:01.460
work on it anymore and there's no software updates.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.460
So I just have it sat there with the Apple

44:03.460 --> 44:05.460
podcast app running, and

44:05.460 --> 44:07.460
it downloads my podcast from iTunes, and I sit

44:07.460 --> 44:09.460
and listen, and that's the only thing it

44:09.460 --> 44:11.460
does. I guess it has a decent enough

44:11.460 --> 44:13.460
speaker, too, right? Yeah, exactly.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.460
That's not too bad. Yeah, okay, so

44:15.460 --> 44:17.460
sort of a mobile setup there.

44:17.460 --> 44:19.460
Do you see they have a TechSnap as one of the example

44:19.460 --> 44:21.460
URLs here? No, I didn't see that. Are you serious?

44:21.460 --> 44:23.460
It looks like it. That's really funny.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.460
Where do I go to see that? Go down to

44:25.460 --> 44:27.460
import and then, yeah, you're right,

44:27.460 --> 44:29.460
the TechSnap MP3 feed. I love them already.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.460
Well, I'm glad I came across them. That's just

44:31.460 --> 44:33.460
funny. No, I was just checking this out.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.460
Oh, well, he did submit it to the Linux Action Show

44:35.460 --> 44:37.460
subreddit, so that makes sense. That makes sense. That does make sense.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.460
The TechSnap MP3

44:39.460 --> 44:41.460
feed, that's a popular

44:41.460 --> 44:43.460
feed. Yeah, that's some great stuff there. That's a good

44:43.460 --> 44:45.460
commuter show, I gotta say. If you haven't listened to the TechSnap

44:45.460 --> 44:47.460
show, you throw that, I mean, you could look at Alan

44:47.460 --> 44:49.460
Jude's face if you want, but... See, for me, it's his

44:49.460 --> 44:51.460
voice. It keeps me calm when you're sitting in traffic.

44:51.460 --> 44:53.460
Right? Especially when he's talking about

44:53.460 --> 44:55.460
ZFS. Yep. Which is a lot.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.460
Alright, so

44:57.460 --> 44:59.460
anyways, moving on.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.460
So, okay, YouTube, I'm seeing

45:01.460 --> 45:03.460
YouTube DL.

45:03.460 --> 45:05.460
What are podcasts as looks for me? Somebody kick him

45:05.460 --> 45:07.460
out of here. Rekai says he streams

45:07.460 --> 45:09.460
all on YouTube, BeyondPod on

45:09.460 --> 45:11.460
Android. Hmm.

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
Anybody else in the mumble room have a shout out for

45:13.460 --> 45:15.460
the podcatching software they use?

45:15.460 --> 45:17.460
Pocketcasts.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.460
Yeah, Pocketcasts is one of my favorites.

45:19.460 --> 45:21.460
I totally agree. Oh, yeah, Wimpy, that's what you

45:21.460 --> 45:23.460
use for the 20

45:23.460 --> 45:25.460
podcasts you subscribe to.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.460
Yep, Pocketcasts, and occasionally

45:27.460 --> 45:29.460
I send those via Chromecast,

45:29.460 --> 45:31.460
but almost exclusively through

45:31.460 --> 45:33.460
Pocketcasts. Yeah, and on the

45:33.460 --> 45:35.460
internet phones, the

45:35.460 --> 45:37.460
Overcast from the Marco Arment is

45:37.460 --> 45:39.460
really good. It's free now. And

45:39.460 --> 45:41.460
one of the nice things, this is,

45:41.460 --> 45:43.460
if you get a, and Pocketcast does this too,

45:43.460 --> 45:45.460
if you get a podcast player

45:45.460 --> 45:47.460
for your phone, it's really nice to have it sync

45:47.460 --> 45:49.460
with a web player. Oh, yeah. Because when I,

45:49.460 --> 45:51.460
if I've been driving and the podcast gets

45:51.460 --> 45:53.460
really interesting and I park, I often times

45:53.460 --> 45:55.460
want to go in and finish it on my computer speakers,

45:55.460 --> 45:57.460
which are usually pretty nice, and listen to the podcast

45:57.460 --> 45:59.460
there. So to have the podcast

45:59.460 --> 46:01.460
mobile app sync with the web app is

46:01.460 --> 46:03.460
really nice. Oh, that sounds like a feature I would like.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.460
Yeah, it is. So you should check out Pocketcasts.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.460
Or Overcast if you want to get

46:07.460 --> 46:09.460
an internet phone. Yeah,

46:09.460 --> 46:11.460
so there you go.

46:11.460 --> 46:13.460
Apparently we woke up Alan.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.460
Now Alan's in the chat room. Sorry, Alan, we love

46:15.460 --> 46:17.460
you. Everybody say TechSnap is

46:17.460 --> 46:19.460
awesome. And

46:19.460 --> 46:21.460
CFS Rock's in the chat room. All right,

46:21.460 --> 46:23.460
so you can go check it out. So moving on

46:23.460 --> 46:25.460
from there, Wes, you caught

46:25.460 --> 46:27.460
this one today. This came out today

46:27.460 --> 46:29.460
as we're recording. It is a

46:29.460 --> 46:31.460
release or a media alert.

46:31.460 --> 46:33.460
Media alert, media alert.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.460
Hold on, we should do this legit style.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.460
Do you want to do this legit style? Let's do it. All right, here we go.

46:37.460 --> 46:39.460
It's a media alert, everybody.

46:45.460 --> 46:47.460
All right, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation,

46:47.460 --> 46:49.460
a media alert is coming in here

46:49.460 --> 46:51.460
that is actually a pretty big deal.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.460
It's actually good news.

46:53.460 --> 46:55.460
I started the day with bad news because CISA

46:55.460 --> 46:57.460
is raging through the US right now.

46:57.460 --> 46:59.460
And net neutrality just got a piss in the

46:59.460 --> 47:01.460
EU. So I was like, I was just nothing

47:01.460 --> 47:03.460
but bad news this morning. But today

47:03.460 --> 47:05.460
the EFF made a post that says

47:05.460 --> 47:07.460
the Librarian of Congress has granted security

47:07.460 --> 47:09.460
researchers and others the right to inspect

47:09.460 --> 47:11.460
and modify the software

47:11.460 --> 47:13.460
in their cars and other vehicles

47:13.460 --> 47:15.460
despite protests from vehicle manufacturers.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.460
They would protest. Well, this has

47:17.460 --> 47:19.460
become a big deal that we've

47:19.460 --> 47:21.460
those of us who

47:21.460 --> 47:23.460
have grumbled about the proprietary software

47:23.460 --> 47:25.460
in our cars have been talking about for a while

47:25.460 --> 47:27.460
but really came to light with the Volkswagen

47:27.460 --> 47:29.460
stuff.

47:29.460 --> 47:31.460
So the fact that this Volkswagen

47:31.460 --> 47:33.460
scandal with the cover-ups

47:33.460 --> 47:35.460
is really sort of

47:35.460 --> 47:37.460
forced this issue through, I think.

47:37.460 --> 47:39.460
And this is a big, big win for

47:39.460 --> 47:41.460
the end user. They say this

47:41.460 --> 47:43.460
access control rule is supposed to...

47:43.460 --> 47:45.460
This is what the manufacturers were using

47:45.460 --> 47:47.460
to block access. They say this

47:47.460 --> 47:49.460
access control rule is supposed to protect

47:49.460 --> 47:51.460
against harmful and unlawful copying.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.460
So the EFF staff attorney.

47:53.460 --> 47:55.460
But as we've seen in recent Volkswagen scandal

47:55.460 --> 47:57.460
where VW was caught manipulating some tests

47:57.460 --> 47:59.460
it can be used instead to hide wrongdoing

47:59.460 --> 48:01.460
hidden in computer code.

48:01.460 --> 48:03.460
The EFF also won an exemption

48:03.460 --> 48:05.460
for users who want to play video games

48:05.460 --> 48:07.460
after the publisher cuts off support.

48:07.460 --> 48:09.460
Yeah. For example

48:09.460 --> 48:11.460
some players may

48:11.460 --> 48:13.460
need to modify an old video game so it

48:13.460 --> 48:15.460
doesn't... They say... Yeah, some players

48:15.460 --> 48:17.460
may need to modify... Oh yeah, because this is where you're not

48:17.460 --> 48:19.460
getting in trouble for now. Some players may need to modify

48:19.460 --> 48:21.460
an old video game so it doesn't perform a

48:21.460 --> 48:23.460
check with the authentication server that has

48:23.460 --> 48:25.460
been shut down. The librarian also

48:25.460 --> 48:27.460
granted the EFF's petition to renew previous

48:27.460 --> 48:29.460
exemption to jailbreak smartphones

48:29.460 --> 48:31.460
and extend that to other mobile devices including

48:31.460 --> 48:33.460
tablets and

48:33.460 --> 48:35.460
smart watches. It's really upsetting

48:35.460 --> 48:37.460
to me that we have to get this as an exception

48:37.460 --> 48:39.460
that's occasionally granted by the Librarian

48:39.460 --> 48:41.460
of Congress, but I'm still very glad that it's

48:41.460 --> 48:43.460
continuing to be the case. It's like a subtle

48:43.460 --> 48:45.460
win for digital ownership

48:45.460 --> 48:47.460
that we kind of subscribe to. Yeah,

48:47.460 --> 48:49.460
it's like a continued win of something

48:49.460 --> 48:51.460
we should already just have. Yes, exactly. That should be

48:51.460 --> 48:53.460
enshrined and we shouldn't have to get it renewed every

48:53.460 --> 48:55.460
so often. But, thank you EFF.

48:55.460 --> 48:57.460
Yeah, I guess they...

48:57.460 --> 48:59.460
I mean, what this really is, is it's

48:59.460 --> 49:01.460
sort of... It's sort of

49:01.460 --> 49:03.460
working around the rules that the

49:03.460 --> 49:05.460
proprietary software vendors try

49:05.460 --> 49:07.460
to put in there, which we are going to be talking more about

49:07.460 --> 49:09.460
in a moment, so let's not go

49:09.460 --> 49:11.460
too far down there. While we're in

49:11.460 --> 49:13.460
the things that Wes came across that

49:13.460 --> 49:15.460
made us scratch our head this week category, because I think

49:15.460 --> 49:17.460
you also sent this in this morning

49:17.460 --> 49:19.460
when we were chatting.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.460
This is a real interesting

49:21.460 --> 49:23.460
piece on the invisiblethings.org

49:23.460 --> 49:25.460
blog, which is

49:25.460 --> 49:27.460
also where you would find

49:27.460 --> 49:29.460
Kube's OS.

49:29.460 --> 49:31.460
And I...

49:31.460 --> 49:33.460
I'm just going to read it to you, and then we'll

49:33.460 --> 49:35.460
see what to make of it. So, today I'm really seeing

49:35.460 --> 49:37.460
this first paper. Finally, you can see the PDF or

49:37.460 --> 49:39.460
EPUB here. As mentioned, this paper

49:39.460 --> 49:41.460
is mostly a survey of the various problems

49:41.460 --> 49:43.460
and attacks presented against the x86

49:43.460 --> 49:45.460
platform over the last

49:45.460 --> 49:47.460
10 years. And,

49:47.460 --> 49:49.460
uh, boy is

49:49.460 --> 49:51.460
it. It is, uh,

49:51.460 --> 49:53.460
it is, it is basically

49:53.460 --> 49:55.460
a, uh, it is a

49:55.460 --> 49:57.460
litany list of issues with x86

49:57.460 --> 49:59.460
that basically, to me, look like it

49:59.460 --> 50:01.460
condemned the platform, because there's so many

50:01.460 --> 50:03.460
different vulnerabilities built in.

50:03.460 --> 50:05.460
So, they start with the BIOS, the root

50:05.460 --> 50:07.460
trust of everything, bad SSMs,

50:07.460 --> 50:09.460
then they go on and talk about

50:09.460 --> 50:11.460
UEFI, they talk about some of the stuff

50:11.460 --> 50:13.460
Intel's built in for management, and then

50:13.460 --> 50:15.460
from there it's networking devices, of course

50:15.460 --> 50:17.460
USB devices, the graphics subsystem,

50:17.460 --> 50:19.460
disk controllers, audio cards, microphone speakers,

50:19.460 --> 50:21.460
cameras, embedded controllers, Intel management engines.

50:21.460 --> 50:23.460
The bottom line is

50:23.460 --> 50:25.460
specifically Intel x86

50:25.460 --> 50:27.460
based machines

50:27.460 --> 50:29.460
are just extremely, extremely

50:29.460 --> 50:31.460
vulnerable. No ways about it.

50:31.460 --> 50:33.460
Is that essentially what you got from it, too? Yes.

50:33.460 --> 50:35.460
I mean, I think a lot of what they're talking about as well is just the

50:35.460 --> 50:37.460
amount, you know, the instruction architecture

50:37.460 --> 50:39.460
is not necessarily bad. I mean,

50:39.460 --> 50:41.460
it might be old and crufty now. People have different

50:41.460 --> 50:43.460
opinions on that, but the amount of

50:43.460 --> 50:45.460
microcode and other things that runs without

50:45.460 --> 50:47.460
the running operating systems knowledge

50:47.460 --> 50:49.460
or intervention in any way has

50:49.460 --> 50:51.460
made it so that efforts, you know,

50:51.460 --> 50:53.460
from the open source community to make

50:53.460 --> 50:55.460
secure kernels that are running on

50:55.460 --> 50:57.460
verified hardware,

50:57.460 --> 50:59.460
you can never trust it now. It's similar to what we see

50:59.460 --> 51:01.460
in cell phones. Yeah, it's very

51:01.460 --> 51:03.460
much like that baseband that has its own...

51:03.460 --> 51:05.460
They can reach right into memory and, you know,

51:05.460 --> 51:07.460
stops the regular processor in its tracks.

51:07.460 --> 51:09.460
So, let's just...

51:09.460 --> 51:11.460
We'll just roll with the theory here that

51:11.460 --> 51:13.460
x86 is a very vulnerable platform.

51:13.460 --> 51:15.460
You know who I wouldn't want to necessarily

51:15.460 --> 51:17.460
be right now?

51:17.460 --> 51:19.460
I wouldn't want to be Windows. That's because they're

51:19.460 --> 51:21.460
really, really tied to this. I feel like

51:21.460 --> 51:23.460
this is something that Linux is going to be much better

51:23.460 --> 51:25.460
at rolling with if... I don't know what we'd roll

51:25.460 --> 51:27.460
to, but let's just, you know, we're just going with this

51:27.460 --> 51:29.460
theory here. If this is really a big deal,

51:29.460 --> 51:31.460
it seems like this

51:31.460 --> 51:33.460
would be something much quicker for Linux

51:33.460 --> 51:35.460
to respond to than it would be for Windows

51:35.460 --> 51:37.460
or Apple to respond to. Right. Assuming that, you know, we could

51:37.460 --> 51:39.460
get the headwind to change major

51:39.460 --> 51:41.460
architecture that is used by, you know,

51:41.460 --> 51:43.460
the computing public. Yeah. I think you're right.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.460
Yeah. What do you think, Wimpy? Is it possible?

51:45.460 --> 51:47.460
Is it all in the hands of the

51:47.460 --> 51:49.460
distros or could it just be a...

51:49.460 --> 51:51.460
Maybe like... Maybe one big distro

51:51.460 --> 51:53.460
comes out and says, all right, we're releasing for

51:53.460 --> 51:55.460
this laptop and they, you know, who knows how it could

51:55.460 --> 51:57.460
happen? There could be... There could be... There could be

51:57.460 --> 51:59.460
something there, but what are your thoughts?

51:59.460 --> 52:01.460
Well, all the big

52:01.460 --> 52:03.460
distributions are making their

52:03.460 --> 52:05.460
platforms available

52:05.460 --> 52:07.460
for other architectures.

52:07.460 --> 52:09.460
But when you look at Distro Watch,

52:09.460 --> 52:11.460
there's 800 some

52:11.460 --> 52:13.460
Linux distributions almost

52:13.460 --> 52:15.460
exclusively aimed at, you know,

52:15.460 --> 52:17.460
PC, the Intel chipset.

52:17.460 --> 52:19.460
Of those, there's

52:19.460 --> 52:21.460
about 20 or so that are

52:21.460 --> 52:23.460
aimed at ARM platforms.

52:23.460 --> 52:25.460
And

52:25.460 --> 52:27.460
if you're a distribution maintainer,

52:27.460 --> 52:29.460
it's very difficult for you

52:29.460 --> 52:31.460
to differentiate yourself

52:31.460 --> 52:33.460
from everybody else if you've got eight other

52:33.460 --> 52:35.460
distributions to,

52:35.460 --> 52:37.460
you know, compete against in

52:37.460 --> 52:39.460
air quotes. But

52:39.460 --> 52:41.460
if there's only 20

52:41.460 --> 52:43.460
distributions on ARM,

52:43.460 --> 52:45.460
for example, or

52:45.460 --> 52:47.460
half that on PowerPC, and

52:47.460 --> 52:49.460
PowerPC is still a thing. You know, people

52:49.460 --> 52:51.460
think of the old PowerPC on the G4s,

52:51.460 --> 52:53.460
but you can buy,

52:53.460 --> 52:55.460
you know, new PowerPC

52:55.460 --> 52:57.460
based equipment. You know, there's

52:57.460 --> 52:59.460
the Amiga 1,

52:59.460 --> 53:01.460
X1000, X5000, and

53:01.460 --> 53:03.460
X500 devices.

53:03.460 --> 53:05.460
Then, you know, if you're

53:05.460 --> 53:07.460
building for those architectures, then

53:07.460 --> 53:09.460
you're also, you know, just

53:09.460 --> 53:11.460
hedging your bets for the future because

53:11.460 --> 53:13.460
the trend is ARM

53:13.460 --> 53:15.460
is becoming the consumer

53:15.460 --> 53:17.460
chip platform.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.460
And, you know, you

53:19.460 --> 53:21.460
still want a foot in the Intel

53:21.460 --> 53:23.460
camp for serious gaming and

53:23.460 --> 53:25.460
professional workstations. You can't

53:25.460 --> 53:27.460
ignore that. And obviously, at the moment,

53:27.460 --> 53:29.460
despite the energy efficiency

53:29.460 --> 53:31.460
of ARM, you want Intel in the data

53:31.460 --> 53:33.460
center. But

53:33.460 --> 53:35.460
you, as a distribution

53:35.460 --> 53:37.460
maintainer, you can't not

53:37.460 --> 53:39.460
be looking at those

53:39.460 --> 53:41.460
alternate architectures.

53:43.460 --> 53:45.460
I do agree to an extent.

53:45.460 --> 53:47.460
It's an interesting, so it's an interesting

53:47.460 --> 53:49.460
thought that you put forward is that ARM is going to

53:49.460 --> 53:51.460
become the consumer platform. And

53:51.460 --> 53:53.460
kind of the concession that you're making there

53:53.460 --> 53:55.460
when you say that is

53:55.460 --> 53:57.460
consumers don't need a lot of CPU

53:57.460 --> 53:59.460
power.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.460
Well, they need some hardware acceleration

54:01.460 --> 54:03.460
for things for

54:03.460 --> 54:05.460
media consumption. And

54:05.460 --> 54:07.460
they need some degree

54:07.460 --> 54:09.460
3D performance for casual gaming.

54:09.460 --> 54:11.460
And it's only when

54:11.460 --> 54:13.460
you're into the serious gaming

54:13.460 --> 54:15.460
arena and professional work

54:15.460 --> 54:17.460
stations that you actually need to

54:17.460 --> 54:19.460
step out of the ARM arena where

54:19.460 --> 54:21.460
that isn't yet.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.460
And it could well be. I mean, I think it will.

54:23.460 --> 54:25.460
I mean, I think you look at some of the latest generation of

54:25.460 --> 54:27.460
CPUs and GPUs coming out for ARM.

54:27.460 --> 54:29.460
I have to say, I think most

54:29.460 --> 54:31.460
of the ARM stuff is driven by economy

54:31.460 --> 54:33.460
at the moment rather than technology.

54:33.460 --> 54:35.460
And I think ARM is far more capable

54:35.460 --> 54:37.460
than

54:37.460 --> 54:39.460
people are paying for. So I think

54:39.460 --> 54:41.460
it could well be the next

54:41.460 --> 54:43.460
platform. I really do

54:43.460 --> 54:45.460
think it's a contender.

54:45.460 --> 54:47.460
But we should be

54:47.460 --> 54:49.460
gearing up our distributions

54:49.460 --> 54:51.460
to support these

54:51.460 --> 54:53.460
platforms. So just

54:53.460 --> 54:55.460
thinking, you know, if you're being myopic

54:55.460 --> 54:57.460
and saying, oh, well, I'm laser focused

54:57.460 --> 54:59.460
on

54:59.460 --> 55:01.460
Intel 64-bit.

55:01.460 --> 55:03.460
Well, I tell

55:03.460 --> 55:05.460
you what, you're missing a trick there.

55:05.460 --> 55:07.460
There's what is it that I think

55:07.460 --> 55:09.460
in February, the Raspberry Pi

55:09.460 --> 55:11.460
Foundation said they'd sold

55:11.460 --> 55:13.460
5 million Raspberry Pis in

55:13.460 --> 55:15.460
two years. You know, if you

55:15.460 --> 55:17.460
extrapolate the numbers out, they must be

55:17.460 --> 55:19.460
clearing and approaching

55:19.460 --> 55:21.460
7 million by now.

55:21.460 --> 55:23.460
Right now, there are

55:23.460 --> 55:25.460
two Linux

55:25.460 --> 55:27.460
desktop operating systems, soon

55:27.460 --> 55:29.460
to be a third in the guise of

55:29.460 --> 55:31.460
Lubuntu, desktop operating

55:31.460 --> 55:33.460
systems available for the Raspberry Pi

55:33.460 --> 55:35.460
2. So

55:35.460 --> 55:37.460
do you want to be

55:37.460 --> 55:39.460
competing against 800

55:39.460 --> 55:41.460
distributions on Intel or do

55:41.460 --> 55:43.460
you want to be one of the three

55:43.460 --> 55:45.460
with 7 million devices?

55:45.460 --> 55:47.460
Yeah,

55:47.460 --> 55:49.460
you need to be

55:49.460 --> 55:51.460
gearing up to, and

55:51.460 --> 55:53.460
like I say, PowerPC isn't dead.

55:53.460 --> 55:55.460
PowerPC is massive in the data center.

55:55.460 --> 55:57.460
This is what's driving these

55:57.460 --> 55:59.460
new IBM

55:59.460 --> 56:01.460
mainframes.

56:01.460 --> 56:03.460
Yeah, that actually all rings

56:03.460 --> 56:05.460
pretty true. Let's be clear, they're not PowerPC, they're Power.

56:05.460 --> 56:07.460
Well, it's, yeah,

56:07.460 --> 56:09.460
the architecture. The Power architecture, yeah.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.460
Yes, the linearity, yeah.

56:11.460 --> 56:13.460
And also, there's still a pretty healthy...

56:13.460 --> 56:15.460
It has very similar problems to the x86.

56:15.460 --> 56:17.460
There's still also, I mean,

56:17.460 --> 56:19.460
a crap ton of literally PowerPC

56:19.460 --> 56:21.460
desktop machines on eBay. There's still

56:21.460 --> 56:23.460
a crap ton of those things getting sold.

56:23.460 --> 56:25.460
So, and I don't know

56:25.460 --> 56:27.460
if we could really walk away from this conversation without admitting

56:27.460 --> 56:29.460
that ARM probably is riddled with its own issues, too.

56:29.460 --> 56:31.460
It's not like ARM is some sort of savior platform that

56:31.460 --> 56:33.460
doesn't have security vulnerabilities, and not to mention

56:33.460 --> 56:35.460
it's always going to come down to implementation.

56:35.460 --> 56:37.460
And you have to trust whoever's manufacturing

56:37.460 --> 56:39.460
them anyway. Right, yeah. And when you have physical

56:39.460 --> 56:41.460
access to a device, it doesn't

56:41.460 --> 56:43.460
matter what the CPU architecture is, there's

56:43.460 --> 56:45.460
going to be vulnerabilities. Because all

56:45.460 --> 56:47.460
these ARM chips, all these ARM systems also

56:47.460 --> 56:49.460
have USB buses, so is there

56:49.460 --> 56:51.460
the same vulnerability there? But

56:51.460 --> 56:53.460
I think all the underlying points that

56:53.460 --> 56:55.460
Wimpy just made, and the point that I'm trying to make, too,

56:55.460 --> 56:57.460
is that Linux

56:57.460 --> 56:59.460
is specifically at a

56:59.460 --> 57:01.460
just technical advantage to roll with this.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.460
I think Wimpy underscores a good point, though, that

57:03.460 --> 57:05.460
really just out of the box, good to go

57:05.460 --> 57:07.460
consumer-focused distros that anybody

57:07.460 --> 57:09.460
could use, we're really lacking

57:09.460 --> 57:11.460
that right now. And I hadn't

57:11.460 --> 57:13.460
really thought about it, because when I think about it, I think

57:13.460 --> 57:15.460
of Raspbian, and I think

57:15.460 --> 57:17.460
of Arch, and that's what I run on the Raspberry

57:17.460 --> 57:19.460
Pi's. I don't really think about it.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.460
And unless

57:21.460 --> 57:23.460
you're up to speed with Arch, you've

57:23.460 --> 57:25.460
got to augment that into a desktop

57:25.460 --> 57:27.460
distribution right now. You've

57:27.460 --> 57:29.460
got Raspbian,

57:29.460 --> 57:31.460
Ubuntu, Mate, and

57:31.460 --> 57:33.460
soon, Lubuntu.

57:33.460 --> 57:35.460
And then you've got things like

57:35.460 --> 57:37.460
RISCOS, and you've got other distributions. There are other

57:37.460 --> 57:39.460
distributions out there, but they're not desktop

57:39.460 --> 57:41.460
focused, end user

57:41.460 --> 57:43.460
focused. And whilst the Raspberry Pi 2

57:43.460 --> 57:45.460
is just about capable

57:45.460 --> 57:47.460
of being a desktop replacement,

57:47.460 --> 57:49.460
it's not about

57:49.460 --> 57:51.460
what's there now. For example,

57:51.460 --> 57:53.460
Odroid, if you buy

57:53.460 --> 57:55.460
an Odroid and an eMMC

57:55.460 --> 57:57.460
chip with

57:57.460 --> 57:59.460
Ubuntu pre-installed as your

57:59.460 --> 58:01.460
Linux distribution rather than Android,

58:01.460 --> 58:03.460
when you plug that in and boot

58:03.460 --> 58:05.460
it, it's Ubuntu

58:05.460 --> 58:07.460
with the Mate desktop. Now, it's not

58:07.460 --> 58:09.460
Ubuntu-Mate, but it is Ubuntu

58:09.460 --> 58:11.460
and the Mate desktop.

58:11.460 --> 58:13.460
And they've got

58:13.460 --> 58:15.460
the fortunate position that

58:15.460 --> 58:17.460
their GPU has also got open

58:17.460 --> 58:19.460
source drivers, so you've got all of that

58:19.460 --> 58:21.460
3D stuff all accelerated out

58:21.460 --> 58:23.460
of the box. And Raspberry Pi

58:23.460 --> 58:25.460
is very, very close to

58:25.460 --> 58:27.460
delivering their

58:27.460 --> 58:29.460
accelerated drivers

58:29.460 --> 58:31.460
for X. So I think

58:31.460 --> 58:33.460
Linux 4.4 is targeted

58:33.460 --> 58:35.460
for the initial version that doesn't have

58:35.460 --> 58:37.460
all of the 3D acceleration yet, but

58:37.460 --> 58:39.460
it's coming. So

58:39.460 --> 58:41.460
this is why I've ported every

58:41.460 --> 58:43.460
Ubuntu flavor to the Raspberry Pi 2,

58:43.460 --> 58:45.460
because when that driver

58:45.460 --> 58:47.460
is available, every Ubuntu

58:47.460 --> 58:49.460
version is ready to go.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.460
I agree

58:51.460 --> 58:53.460
with you. When the horsepower gets there,

58:53.460 --> 58:55.460
I think you could see there's

58:55.460 --> 58:57.460
machines here in the studio I could even see replacing

58:57.460 --> 58:59.460
to a certain degree. And it seems like

58:59.460 --> 59:01.460
we're only on the start of that. The desktop

59:01.460 --> 59:03.460
computer revolution really

59:03.460 --> 59:05.460
gave Intel the funds to

59:05.460 --> 59:07.460
work on their fabrication technique. That's true.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.460
That's what we're going to see now in the ARM fabs.

59:09.460 --> 59:11.460
Yeah, and the phones are definitely, they're really adding a lot of

59:11.460 --> 59:13.460
fuel to that development fire. Apple pays all that money

59:13.460 --> 59:15.460
to get those A9s manufactured.

59:15.460 --> 59:17.460
That investment gets pushed up. And Samsung

59:17.460 --> 59:19.460
is building a lot of those, so that's

59:19.460 --> 59:21.460
not all lost. Even when they're building the Apple chips,

59:21.460 --> 59:23.460
they can't all be lost R&D.

59:23.460 --> 59:25.460
They have that machinery, right?

59:25.460 --> 59:27.460
I don't know. They learn from this.

59:27.460 --> 59:29.460
Right, exactly. And so

59:29.460 --> 59:31.460
I would say for me, it's

59:31.460 --> 59:33.460
nowhere near ready.

59:33.460 --> 59:35.460
I mean like, I

59:35.460 --> 59:37.460
yeah, I mean I just can't even

59:37.460 --> 59:39.460
see it for years for me. But I could see

59:39.460 --> 59:41.460
it for my kids already.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.460
And I could see it for

59:43.460 --> 59:45.460
a lot of people in a lot of different

59:45.460 --> 59:47.460
work roles very soon if not already.

59:47.460 --> 59:49.460
So it's very cool.

59:49.460 --> 59:51.460
Alright, so I want to move on from this.

59:51.460 --> 59:53.460
And I want to discuss this EULA situation

59:53.460 --> 59:55.460
that is

59:55.460 --> 59:57.460
very uncomfortable because it's a bad, bad precedent.

59:57.460 --> 59:59.460
And I think it's one that

59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.460
might be a good talking point for us that are discussing

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.460
with users. Why would you want to maybe use

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.460
Linux over Windows 10?

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.460
Why would you want to maybe use

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.460
the Ubuntu phone over Android?

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.460
Or something like that. Well, this might

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.460
be the number one talking point from here on out

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.460
I would think. But first,

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.460
I want to tell you about our friends at Digital Ocean.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460
That's where I have my servers.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.460
Back in the day, before Digital Ocean,

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.460
I was all about

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.460
Proxmox.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.460
I was all about Proxmox. If I needed a server,

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460
I'd spin up a Proxmox VM. Have you ever

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.460
messed with Proxmox? Only a little bit.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460
Yeah. But I've heard some good things. And you probably mess with

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.460
VirtualBox. Oh yeah, definitely.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460
That's so, you know, like, okay, so what would I

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.460
I would go get like my best Core i7 PC

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.460
and I'd put a bunch of RAM in it

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.460
and a bunch of hard drives in it of various

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.460
quality. And I would put that in my garage

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.460
and that would be how I would do my virtualization.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.460
Frankenstein monster virtualizer.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.460
Yeah, and that worked for basically always about

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.460
a year before for some reason it completely

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.460
blew up. And now

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.460
now I'm like big time. Now I'm

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.460
like, I walk in, I'm like a boss. I'm like, yeah, I have

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.460
infrastructure in the cloud. I have data

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.460
centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.460
Amsterdam, London,

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.460
Germany, and I just got an API.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.460
Got a new one up in Toronto. Yeah, I got it. It's straightforward

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.460
that API.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.460
You know, and one click deployment of

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.460
things like GitLab,

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.460
Docker, one of the first

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.460
to deploy Docker. Wow, Chris.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.460
My data center is, my data center

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.460
is Digital Ocean. Yeah, I know. It's

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.460
a big surprise. Digital Ocean, if you use the promo

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.460
code DOUNPLUGGED, you can get a $10 credit

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.460
and you can try out Digital Ocean two months

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.460
for free. The $5 rigs,

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.460
Wes, I'm telling you, I think just about every

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.460
time you come in here, you sit

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.460
down and log into a droplet in some form or another.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.460
Yeah, that's pretty much true. Is that Quazl core

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.460
there running off of it? It sure is.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.460
Yeah, I got my Quazl core running off of Digital Ocean

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.460
Droplet too. Seriously, if you use IRC

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.460
for work or for communications,

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.460
you should be looking at Quazl and Quazl core

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.460
and put Quazl core on Digital Ocean Droplet.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.460
Worth $5 right there. Oh yeah, and it's

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.460
real easy to get set up. It is. It just

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.460
always runs. It's just right there for you. Trust me.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.460
It makes, you know,

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.460
what you'll do if you do that is you'll be

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.460
like, why did we ever use anything

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.460
but IRC? Why is Twitter a thing?

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.460
Why is Slack a thing?

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.460
Why are we even using email?

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.460
Really, why are we not using IRC for

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460
all the things? Anyways, there's

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.460
a lot of different things like sync thing, own cloud,

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.460
like I mentioned earlier, GitLab,

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.460
BitTorrent sync. We do a big

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.460
distribution for BitTorrent sync for our

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.460
own filter show. Lots of people sync from

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.460
that. All powered by Digital Ocean Droplets.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.460
It's really a cool system. And one of the

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.460
really nice things if you need like a backend storage

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.460
rig, there is some really cool solutions

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.460
when you use private networking with Digital Ocean.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.460
The data sent between machines on the

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.460
private networking doesn't go against your transfer. Even though

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.460
you get a terabyte of transfer, you can use private

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.460
network and do like backend caching,

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.460
proxying, or a backend file server.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.460
And they have a really good interface to manage all of this.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.460
So for $5 a month, you can get 512

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.460
megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.460
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.460
Digital Ocean is nuts, son. They're crazy.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.460
I want you to go check them out. And they now also

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.460
have floating IPs.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.460
So that way when you go big,

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.460
when you're like, when you're Ubuntu Mate

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.460
and you're like, you're going big, you know,

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.460
or you want to be

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.460
fancy and you want to have a big launch day, they got

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.460
floating IPs.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.460
You can scale out however you need. Just move it around.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.460
It floats. It floats.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.460
That's fancy. You know what? Things in the cloud float.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.460
Yeah. What I like about Digital Ocean

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.460
too, it's all running on top of Linux. They use KVM

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.460
as the virtualization platform,

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.460
which some other providers out there that you

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.460
may have heard of before are kind of kicking themselves for.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.460
No kidding. They're kind of like, I wish I would have gone KVM.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.460
The best thing about KVM, you get that, you get your

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.460
own kernel right there, you know? You get

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.460
all the new fancy kernel features. You want cgroups,

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.460
you want IP tables, like whatever you want.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.460
It's right there. And that means they're able to

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460
roll out the newer distros way before

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.460
other guys do, which is really cool.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.460
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUG

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.460
to support the show and get a $10 credit

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.460
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.460
Linux Unplugged. You guys rock.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.460
Alright, so just let's talk about

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.460
this from a general Linux perspective.

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.460
The DOJ dismisses Apple's argument

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.460
against encrypting iOS. And to Apple's

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.460
credit, they have been fighting this

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.460
case trying to say that

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.460
they, you know, it'll do them harm

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.460
if they have to unlock it. They say they can't unlock

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.460
anything iOS 8 or above.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.460
However,

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.460
the federal court is not agreeing.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.460
The US government rejected Apple's argument in federal court

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.460
that unlocking iOS devices for police

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.460
would damage the tech giant's public image

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.460
because they've done it before.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.460
Boom. Apple designed, manufactured,

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.460
and sold the phone that is subject to the search warrant,

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.460
the government told US magistrate

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.460
Judge James. But this is only

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.460
the beginning of Apple's relationship to the phone

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.460
and this matter. Apple owns

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.460
the software and runs the phone, their argument

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.460
is. And the software is thwarting

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.460
the execution of the warrant. The

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460
software is thwarting the execution of the warrant.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.460
In the Justice Department's filing in the case

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.460
involving the iPhone discovered on the suspect,

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.460
he's indicted for a drug

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.460
possession, meth.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.460
And this is an ongoing battle.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.460
Apple filed a brief saying in most

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.460
cases now and in the future it would be impossible

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.460
for it to extract encrypted data

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.460
from an iOS device.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.460
But they dismiss the

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.460
argument, says Apple's asserts,

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.460
Apple's burden is not provable since they've done this

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.460
before. And

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.460
they also say,

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.460
moving ahead here, they say

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.460
Apple

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.460
should be able to unlock

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.460
it. The government's argument is essentially that Apple

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.460
has never really objected to this case and the fact that they

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.460
have set up guidelines by which they'll comply

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.460
doesn't stop them from objecting to any particular

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.460
case. But they have the ability to do it here and

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.460
clearly the judge was concerned.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.460
Apple also warned

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.460
that if we're forced to routinely decrypt data from law enforcement

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.460
its employees could theoretically be subpoenaed in every

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.460
case to provide expert testimony.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.460
They cited a previous case

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.460
where an actual employee

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.460
who did the decrypting ended up getting hauled into court

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.460
because he then saw the evidence.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.460
So just like the technician

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.460
that had to do the decrypting.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.460
Wow. Yeah.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.460
So there's several things Apple's trying to fight against.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.460
Having to do future decrypting,

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.460
having to

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.460
bring its employees into court

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.460
if they do the decrypting.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.460
And now this argument

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.460
that Apple's software licensing agreement

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.460
specifies that iOS software is licensed

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.460
not sold, quote unquote. And that users

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.460
are merely granted a quote

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.460
limited non-exclusive license

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.460
to use the iOS software.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.460
So in their argument because it's the software

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.460
preventing the decryption and Apple owns the software

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.460
not the user, Apple must decrypt it

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.460
because the users don't own the software.

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.460
Yeah I like how they came back and said that you know

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.460
well you guys have been claiming for so long now that

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.460
it's your software that you just licensed in it

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.460
so you can't have both sides of it.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.460
Proprietary software is not ethical.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.460
Yeah you know what else makes me think of?

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.460
Malicious functionality perverting

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.460
free software. That program

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.460
although it may be attractive

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.460
is really a trap.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.460
I think all of those statements are correct.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460
All of those statements. He's right.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.460
RMS is right.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.460
I mean

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.460
this

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.460
blows my mind. Their argument is literally

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.460
that because you don't own the software

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.460
you license the software

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.460
the manufacturer should be able to decrypt it.

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.460
And they might actually get this.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.460
They might actually win on that argument.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.460
They might actually be able to convince the judge of that.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.460
Maybe Apple

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.460
will take their security claims seriously

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.460
enough and change their licensing agreement.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.460
Probably not though.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.460
That would be I guess the best

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.460
direct fix right? Right.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.460
I mean they've already got the encryption going on

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.460
you know 8 and 9 but.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.460
But doesn't this seem like the biggest argument

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.460
like out of all of the arguments

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.460
doesn't this

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
really fundamentally prove why it's important to

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.460
own your own software? Yes I think so.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.460
Like this is like to me seems like the biggest

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.460
the biggest bullet point for that.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.460
And

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.460
there was a post that I caught recently

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.460
titled Richard Stallman is the hero the internet

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.460
needs. And a few bullet points.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.460
He warned of the growing danger

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.460
of DRM and the great story

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.460
The Right to Read in 1997.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.460
He warned about DRM in 97.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.460
He refuses to own a cell phone on the grounds

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.460
that it might be used as a tracking or covert listening

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.460
device. Slightly paranoid but

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.460
looks increasingly possible. Stallman considers

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.460
cloud computing. Increasingly. Yeah.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.460
Stallman considers cloud computing dangerous

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.460
in 2008. He thought this would sound

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.460
like an alarmist. Now nobody trusts the cloud.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.460
He always held the proprietary

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.460
software could not be trusted. Windows 10

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.460
shaded behavior proves that point.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460
You mean the Windows 10 I'm running here

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.460
in the studio Chris?

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.460
Yeah.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.460
But he was right. He has been right.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.460
He's been consistently on the ball there.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.460
Yeah. So I don't know

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460
does anybody in the Mumba Room have thoughts

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.460
on the EULAs and not owning the

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.460
software and the ramifications that maybe we're

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460
just now beginning to understand?

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.460
I'm still

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.460
reading the Windows proper.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.460
Go ahead North Ranger.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.460
Well if

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.460
the idea behind

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.460
copyright is for the benefit of the public

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.460
to secure for authors a limited

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.460
time. There's

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.460
really no limits at this point as far as the government

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.460
is concerned. Yeah exactly. That's a good point.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.460
Yeah. Yeah. OK. Now I know two other people

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.460
who else want to speak up. I caught that.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.460
Next go ahead and whoever goes first

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.460
can have it.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.460
That's not a very good system is it?

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.460
Free for all. All right. This is

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.460
unplugged after all.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460
Go ahead. Let Sean go first.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.460
All right Sean go ahead.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.460
I was just saying like given the fact

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.460
that basically all

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.460
software is licensed do we really

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.460
own any of it?

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.460
Yeah. I mean I guess you'd have to look into

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460
the individual EULAs for open source software

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.460
but I think if you have the code and you can modify

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.460
it functionally you own it.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.460
It's at least closer to our

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.460
pre-software definition of ownership than

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.460
what you get with a Apple

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.460
or Windows style license. And Casey you

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.460
were next?

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.460
Was it Sean that was next?

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.460
Sorry I can't see your names guys. The screen is too small for me.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.460
I'm an old man now. No. No. It was

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.460
me. Actually

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.460
the EULA for Windows

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460
10 I plan on going over with

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460
and then looking at it. It's pretty

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.460
horrendous when you see that

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.460
oh we can use

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.460
subject and

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.460
the body email to

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.460
just return user

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.460
input. It's really bad.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.460
Yeah. That is a particular nasty one.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.460
And Heavens you want to get a chance to jump in too.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.460
Go ahead.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.460
Oh we can't hear you.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.460
Wow. While he's getting his

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.460
mic fixed I would say in the future

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.460
I look forward to the day when the DOJ

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.460
holds Richard Storman

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.460
into court and says

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.460
that he has to

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.460
speak for the fact that

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.460
he created the license and all the stuff on

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.460
my machine is licensed under GPL.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.460
And so he's responsible

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.460
for the software that's on my machine.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.460
There you go. There you go. That's a good twist.

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.460
I like that. Heavens one more chance.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.460
Did you get your mic working?

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.460
Going once? Going twice? I wonder what happened

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.460
over there. What happened over there? Maybe pulse

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.460
audio. That's what everybody always goes to right? Everybody always has to

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.460
blame pulse audio. All right.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.460
Well Heavens I'll give you a chance to

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.460
troubleshoot that for a second. It was just a

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.460
thought provoking piece and I wanted to just

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.460
kind of call it out because I think it underscores something a lot of us

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.460
Linux and open source enthusiasts have

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.460
been talking about for a long time. I'll tell you

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.460
about something else I've been talking about. That's Ting

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.460
my mobile service provider. Ting is

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.460
mobile that makes sense. It's only pay for what you use

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.460
wireless. It's your minutes, your messages, your

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.460
megabytes. They add them up. Whatever bucket you fall into

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.460
that's all you pay. It's six dollars

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.460
for the line. A great control panel.

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.460
Really enthusiastic customer service.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.460
And really good selection of devices

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.460
too. All these are unlocked so you

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.460
own them outright. You can go to

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.460
linux.ting.com.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.460
You know Chris I was doing the math yesterday

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.460
trying to get my parents to switch to Ting.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.460
I looked at the last

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.460
year their bill. They would save an average of

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.460
sixty two dollars a month if they switched to Ting.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.460
That's a nice savings. These are real world figures.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.460
I did it yesterday. Yeah when you go to linux.ting.com

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.460
they have a savings calculator there on the front page.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.460
Makes it really easy. Yeah you just plug it in there.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.460
So would they be getting more of a smartphone

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.460
device or more of a feature phone device?

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.460
Well this is on their current feature phone trend.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.460
Maybe not the most

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.460
current. So they're cool with feature phones?

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.460
Yeah and Ting works great with that.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.460
They've been on another provider who

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.460
their phones will just work right with Ting.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.460
They won't have to change anything.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.460
Yeah the feature phone prices are ridiculous.

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.460
And then of course I love right here that you can

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.460
get the Moto X second gen for two ninety nine unlocked.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.460
The Moto Nexus 6

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.460
or you can get the LG 5X.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.460
Right when they're ready to go to that next level

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.460
Ting's got it all right there. You own the device

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.460
outright. It's nice. It's nice.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.460
Including my S6 Edge.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.460
Yeah so you can check them out at linux.ting.com

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.460
I love their customer service.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.460
I love the way their control panel works.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.460
It makes it really easy to manage my account.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.460
It's really easy also to pick between GSM

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.460
and CDMA so you can pick and choose which one's

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.460
better in your area. And if you're a little savvy

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.460
with Wi-Fi it's going to blow your mind

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.460
with the savings. Blow your mind.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.460
Check it out.

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.460
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.460
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.460
Okay Evans did you get your mic working?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.460
Did you get it fixed? Going once?

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.460
Yes I believe I did.

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.460
Yeah you're a little over

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.460
you're a little hot but you're good.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.460
You're coming in now.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.460
What did you want to add on before we wrap up?

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.460
Sounds good.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.460
What did you want to add on before we wrap up?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.460
It really just applies

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.460
to Apple's product.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.460
Apple software or possibly the Apple hardware.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.460
So if we have a hardware module

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.460
which we own ourselves

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.460
which they do not own

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.460
but their operating system APIs

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460
call, we could have

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.460
our own owned

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.460
decryption keys.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.460
Kind of like little, you know, cookie or whatever.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.460
Or the SIM card.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.460
That would be nice. It would come down to the user owning

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.460
the hardware and then just installing their OS on it.

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.460
Which they would use.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.460
And then they would bypass

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.460
the ULS agreement for us using

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.460
their software or their OS.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.460
That's an interesting idea. That is interesting.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.460
I wonder if that would ever actually happen. Ever happen, yeah.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.460
You know, so speaking of hardware

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.460
Yaomei I think is how you say it.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.460
They have been pondering a Linux laptop for a while

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.460
and now the folks over at

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.460
OMG Ubuntu say it's going to happen.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.460
Their long rumored Linux laptop has been

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.460
kicked around and we've covered it once before

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.460
in its earliest stage. It looks like

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.460
it's going to be a 12.5 inch display

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.460
and then another with a 13.3

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.460
inch display.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.460
The model with the 12.5 inch screen will be manufactured by

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.460
Inventek, who also makes laptops

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.460
for Acer and Toshiba and HP.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.460
With an initial order of 250,000

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.460
units. A slightly larger device is being

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.460
made by Compella Electronics.

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.460
They also supposedly manufacture some

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.460
Apple devices and various PlayStation, Xbox

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.460
and Nintendo game consoles.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.460
And Yaomei is supposedly placing a

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.460
300,000 order unit with them.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.460
Now this would be shipping with their

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.460
own version of Linux they say?

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.460
Oh interesting. Hopefully with

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.460
not too much added tree stuff.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.460
And no word even

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.460
if it'd be shipping anywhere specifically.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.460
According to the same sources

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460
they'll be priced cheaply but offer high

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.460
performance. I like that. Just like the

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.460
company's smartphones.

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.460
So probably

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.460
going to debut in China I would imagine

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.460
but maybe eventually make it over here. Is anybody interested

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.460
to see what Yaomei could do? Actually

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.460
I don't think anybody in here was last time we talked

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.460
about it. Has anybody changed their mind?

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.460
No. Seems to be more popular

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.460
online though. We've gotten people sending to the show

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.460
that are definitely looking forward to it. I mean I'm interested.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460
I don't know that I would necessarily get one

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.460
but I feel like there's a couple

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.460
you know 13, 14 inch laptops that people

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.460
can look at. But really

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.460
like 90% of the laptop field is boring

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.460
15 inch

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.460
over you know it's like 5 pounds. It doesn't

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.460
have a great resolution. If you're coming into the laptop market

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.460
today with a 12.5 inch or

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.460
13 inch laptop you are

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.460
probably targeting the MacBook Air

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.460
right? Right. And so then when

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.460
you say that I think

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.460
light, thin, but decent

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.460
performance. Right. But if you could

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.460
just offer me a few things that the MacBook doesn't

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.460
like a couple more ports would be nice. Better

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.460
Linux compatibility? Absolutely that would be

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.460
nice. Then maybe you got

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.460
something here. And it might be nice to invest

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.460
you know maybe not but it's nice to see clearly

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.460
you know the Asus and Acer's of the world

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.460
they have some stuff for us but they're

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.460
not really supporting our crowd very much.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.460
We might be able to support a new company who

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.460
will leverage that. Yeah System76 has

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.460
a laptop in this space. There's the Dell

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.460
XPS. Then you can also go get yourself a

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.460
ThinkPad. But

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.460
maybe it will be terrible

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.460
I don't know. But there's still room here I think.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.460
No I think there is still room here for this.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.460
You put a really nice screen on there. You put a decent CPU

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.460
in there and maybe some PCI Express

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.460
storage. At the right price point?

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.460
Yeah. I could be interested in that.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.460
I'm not really in the market right now. My XPS

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.460
13 does the job but I could be interested in that.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.460
Yeah. I don't know.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.460
Anybody remember I'm interested now? Anybody?

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.460
Come on.

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.460
I can't believe it. You guys what do you got?

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.460
You're all a bunch of ThinkPad users. No you're just all a bunch of

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.460
ThinkPad users.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.460
The problem is

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.460
chances are it's going to only be available in

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.460
China. Probably have some wacky version

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.460
of Linux that doesn't contribute upstream

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.460
at all. And so

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.460
if I wanted to wipe that and put

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.460
something else like Ubuntu Mate or

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.460
Ubuntu proper I

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460
would probably find the wireless doesn't work or

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.460
the touchpad skitty or whatever.

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.460
And I don't want to have

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.460
to buy something from China.

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.460
Find it doesn't work and then end up putting it in a drawer

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.460
or chucking it on eBay. I would rather know that it works

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.460
which is why I'm veering towards

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.460
a ThinkPad or a Dell XPS.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460
At least they contribute upstream.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.460
My question would really be is it going to be more Chromebook

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.460
than it is Linux laptop.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.460
And you know what I just kind of

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.460
remembered incidentally

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.460
is I believe my

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.460
Chromebook from 2015 was supposed to arrive in September.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.460
It is now October.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.460
Remember how I

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.460
backed that?

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.460
I'm sure it's coming soon.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.460
I was told it was. Maybe it's on the doorstep right now.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.460
Maybe. It would still be late.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.460
I would really

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.460
like to do that. All right Swift you want to talk about ThinkPads

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.460
go ahead.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.460
Yeah my thing about the whole

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.460
ThinkPads thing is while

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.460
the recent ones I keep hearing

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.460
about the whole Superfish issue

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.460
the classic ones are really nice.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.460
The only thing I would say is the resolution

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.460
is an issue.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.460
I'm currently in front of an X201

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.460
right now and I love this machine.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.460
Yeah I think that's

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.460
about what I hear all the time.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.460
That seems to be a pretty fair assessment.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.460
Wimpy you have a Librem 13. Tell me what do you think?

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.460
Well I have the better version

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.460
of the Librem 13 in that I

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.460
actually have one that you can buy today

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.460
and it works and

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.460
is running stuff. Yeah.

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.460
Do you like that hardware?

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.460
Well I do now that I've

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.460
helped fix the touchpad driver

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.460
in the Linux kernel. Yes it works very

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.460
nicely. But

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.460
what's interesting about the Librem 13 I have some

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.460
involvement with them. So hello

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.460
everyone from

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.460
Purism. You'll know me

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.460
from the guy that sent you the kernel patches.

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.460
But

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.460
it's a long time coming

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.460
so they're just shipping the Librem

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.460
13 and

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.460
Entraware who I spoke about

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.460
earlier who have been shipping that hardware

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.460
platform since almost

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.460
the start of this year

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.460
have already revved on

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.460
that platform and are just about

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.460
to release their new version

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.460
based on

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.460
Skylake and that's coming

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.460
out next week or the week after.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.460
That's going to be nice.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.460
Yeah and

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.460
I just don't get this

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.460
Purism thing.

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.460
Honestly that and

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.460
this YaoMei Linux laptop.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.460
I think this YaoMei Linux laptop

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.460
or however you pronounce it is a total non story

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.460
for any actual users.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.460
I don't think it's going to be a product that we

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.460
really get our hands on.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.460
Well maybe not in the US

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.460
and maybe not in Europe but it could be a thing in China.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.460
But even then they won't even probably know it runs Linux.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.460
Well do they care?

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.460
No. They just want something to replace Windows XP

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.460
don't they? Yeah.

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.460
Our first computer. Not even necessarily

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.460
something to replace XP.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.460
There's a giant market of people who've never

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.460
even owned a computer at

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:45.460
all out in the burbs and beyond

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.460
in China that have

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.460
never had a computer. Yeah absolutely

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.460
for them. For those people something like this that

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.460
can get on the internet is a fantastic device.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.460
Very much. I agree.

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.460
And I wait

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.460
with anticipation for my Librem so I can

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.460
give it a shot. I have been thinking

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.460
it would be. Oh oh

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.460
oh. Yikes.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.460
Did you hear that? There's a little voice.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.460
How much did you pay for that?

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.460
I don't remember. It was during their crowdfunding

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.460
and that was

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.460
I think over a year ago now. I can't remember.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.460
Chris believed in it?

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.460
Maybe it wasn't a year ago. Maybe it was the beginning

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.460
of the year.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.460
Really if I wasn't going to

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.460
you know a lot of times

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.460
a lot of times I will

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.460
buy something specifically so

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.460
I can have it for review on the show.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.460
And that does fall into the category of

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.460
this from a news

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.460
standpoint is an interesting topic

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.460
and it's really nice to be able to contribute

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.460
some actual genuine

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460
observations on the product in

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.460
the shows. So for me that pushes it

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.460
over the line. If I didn't have that I don't

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.460
think I'd push it over the line.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.460
But it's fair enough.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.460
I think the latest update

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.460
from crowd supply said that

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.460
the Librem 13 would ship in late

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.460
October.

01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.460
The 15.

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.460
Oh right. Maybe you order the 13.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.460
No the 15 is October 19th

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.460
it says here.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.460
OK. So today

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.460
is October 27th.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.460
All I'll say is that

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.460
the Librem

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.460
is about three times over

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.460
the price of where you

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:21.460
can get it elsewhere.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.460
And

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.460
if you want... Yeah but you get hardware kill switches

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.460
though Wimpy. Remember?

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.460
Have you

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460
actually seen those?

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.460
Well

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.460
we'll see. We'll see. The jury is out.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.460
We'll see. Well Chris look

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.460
you know if you want

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.460
to review another

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.460
hardware platform then I know

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.460
Entroware would be interested

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.460
in hooking you up with one of their new Skylake

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460
devices. Oh they should email me. That sounds fun.

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.460
I would not mind a Skylake device. That sounds cool.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.460
Well all right. I know my

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.460
quest. I feel like this quest

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.460
this quest for like a laptop

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.460
that would be available in the stores you walk

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.460
in and that thing runs Linux it's just...

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.460
It's impossible. We're so close but yet

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.460
so far away. Like there's really great

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.460
places now to go get good devices

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.460
like Entroware System 76

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.460
and even Dell has

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.460
Linux too. Right? Does Dell start

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.460
shipping that again? I can't keep track of what they do with Linux.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.460
But in theory they will. OK. So there

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460
are... But you have to know.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.460
That's the thing. You have to know.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.460
Just spend a significant time investment

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.460
in getting all that out. You know what else

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.460
you have to know? You ready for this Wes?

You know just for funsies.

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.460
Wes anywhere you want people to check you out online?

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460
Not this week. But there should be some

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.460
stuff coming. Mysterious.

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.460
Follow the network at jupyter signal for live stream

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.460
announcements and things like that. Linux

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.460
Action Show on Sunday this week. Moving

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.460
to Sunday this week

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.460
to make room for some stuff. So check

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.460
out Linux Action Show on Sunday instead of Friday.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:29.460
And see you right back here next week everybody.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:59.460
Alright

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.460
Wes we're all done. We're out of here. We're done.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.460
Mission accomplished.

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.460
Yes it was. Thanks everybody.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.460
Thank you everyone.

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.460
Sorry for being a grumpy

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.460
old sod about Nebrum.

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.460
No no it's fine. It's good.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.460
I'm sure you'll have fun

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.460
reviewing the device. Oh well we'll see.

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.460
Linux communities survive on

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.460
grump. So it's needed.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.460
I think people

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.460
have gotten a little too

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.460
sensitive about criticism.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.460
Just saying there's people out there that get a little too sensitive

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.460
about it. Sometimes criticism can be well

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.460
placed. So criticize Chris as much as you

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.460
want. He takes it very well. Oh my god don't

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.460
they. Oh brilliant.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.460
If there is seriously

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.460
people just criticize me constantly.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.460
They really do. And that's how you got so good.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.460
Oh sure. That's why you moved away

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.460
from IRC. Why you moved away from

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.460
Telegram.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.460
No kidding. No that's

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.460
not true. I'm in IRC all the time. But yeah

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.460
it is

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.460
very true. And you know honestly

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.460
there's just tools to tune it out

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.460
too if it gets ridiculous. That's really what

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.460
it's about is like you know

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.460
there are there are there are plugins to

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.460
you know just turn off comments when you don't

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.460
want to see them. And there's there's all kinds of things you can

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.460
do but you just got to walk the line because you don't want to overdo

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.460
it either. JBDotless.com JBDotless.com

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.460
I wasn't I wasn't trying to enroll

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.460
myself into your twit filter. I was

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.460
I was just trying to

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.460
provide some

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.460
level headed. I suppose

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.460
I'm just

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.460
forewarning you.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.460
Yeah.

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.460
Oh man.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.460
There's a little bit of a bummer.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.460
It's a bit of a bummer. And you know what

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.460
else is if if if you

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.460
if you if you had paid

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.460
for the

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460
for the Librem 13 what

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.460
you can get for it elsewhere and what

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.460
you know what you pay for it elsewhere

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.460
it's a good machine.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.460
But it's like three times more

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.460
expensive through Librem

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.460
and they're trying to pitch this as like

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.460
an Apple type

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.460
product and it just isn't that.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.460
So yeah.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.460
It's well you know fundamentally how

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.460
does a brand new company

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.460
compete with a 30 year old company

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.460
at manufacturing. How do you even do that fundamentally.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.460
Even if it's well and

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.460
the other thing is is that Pureism have tried to

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.460
pitch that they know they're doing all of this manufacturing

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.460
themselves and that's not the case either.

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.460
So you know it's

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.460
a little bit smoke and mirrors.

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.460
Mm hmm.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.460
So Chris can I criticize

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460
you for being so negative on the

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.460
Xiaomi laptop.

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.460
Sure. Yeah that's fine. Yeah you think

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.460
you think it has a you think it has a good chance of becoming

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.460
big. Well I

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.460
won't make any

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.460
prophecy but this company has been doing

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.460
great phones and

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.460
they really it seems like they really

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.460
have a great price to performance

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.460
ratio and also their devices

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.460
are always very well thought out

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.460
and they are also a very big manufacturer

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.460
of phones. So I think they have

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.460
quite some experience and I was actually hopeful

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.460
that they might shake up things a little bit.

01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.460
Well you should have said that in the show.

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.460
That's a good you know I hope

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.460
and I agree. I think probably

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.460
if you could I would I would criticize our takeaway

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.460
on is it could be big for

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.460
for thousands and thousands of people but

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.460
just not for us. I mean that's that's jaded

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.460
Americans. Yeah. The problem is

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.460
getting into the U.S. market I think

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.460
for a lot of these products.

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.460
Not really. The Chinese market

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.460
is gigantic

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.460
and that's

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.460
this we like we

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.460
get this in Ubuntu we get like

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.460
when is it coming to the U.S. when is it coming

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.460
to the U.S. and there's like 300 million

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.460
people in the U.S. or whatever your

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.460
population is but there's a shit ton of

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.460
people over in China as well

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.460
and those people are

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:41.460
people who are actually buying devices

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.460
who don't

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.460
currently have a device and

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460
or don't currently have a laptop and so

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.460
there's a gigantic untapped

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.460
market over that side

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.460
of the planet. And that middle that middle class over there is

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.460
expanding you know I mean there's

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.460
there is a lot there's a lot of

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.460
growth potential over there right now. Yeah. When

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.460
when Apple's profits in just China

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.460
dwarf Samsung

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:05.460
and Motorola and LG

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.460
and everybody else combined

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.460
you know that's a big market.

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.460
Yeah. Also China has one seventh

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.460
of the world's population so

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.460
yeah and so it could be

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.460
I'm really excited for my Chinese MacBook Air.

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.460
Yeah. Yeah. So exactly

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.460
it could be a Chinese MacBook Air exactly

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.460
and it could eventually make its way over.

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.460
Exactly like a MacBook Air. Well that picture

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.460
might literally be a MacBook Air.

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.460
I don't know. Yeah. Well you know I'm curious

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.460
if. Yeah that's the funny thing.

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.460
I saw a comment before

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.460
it was really funny

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.460
in IRC I saw a comment that said

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.460
that they could just

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.460
ship from China a

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.460
MacBook that has an Apple logo

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.460
that just runs elementary OS.

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.460
I thought that was funny. But I'm

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.460
bummed.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.460
What's new mate?

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.460
I have been looking at

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.460
new phones like you know

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.460
looking at what alternative devices

01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.460
are there out there and the

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.460
Xiaomi phones look

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.460
really nice. They're

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.460
nice mid to high range

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.460
high end like you're talking like

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.460
three gig of RAM rather than two.

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.460
They look with 4G

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.460
chipsets and decent resolution

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.460
screen and multiple

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460
SIM slots and all that kind of stuff for

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.460
a really decent price

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.460
point like $180 or something like that.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.460
Yeah I know. But you have to get rid of the software

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.460
if you've used one and the Chinese software

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.460
on there oh man.

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.460
Right. Probably wipe it and put

01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.460
cyanogen or something else on there.

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.460
Anyway.

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.460
It almost reminds me of that Windows firmware

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.460
thing with the

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:39.460
I don't know that it was

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.460
Windows something

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.460
with the BIOS or something like

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.460
that with the firmware that something

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.460
was in there. I saw I heard

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.460
on a previous show I don't know if it was Linux Action

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.460
Show or Linux Unplugged or something like that

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.460
but I heard about

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.460
Windows loading something

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.460
onto your oh yes it was

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.460
for the OEM or the OEM

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.460
laptops where the manufacturer

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:03.460
or someone could put

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.460
special firmware on your

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.460
on your

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.460
on your device whenever you installed

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.460
Windows on the if you reinstall

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.460
Windows it would automatically install those applications

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.460
again. Yeah.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.460
It kind of reminds me of that. Yeah.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.460
Yeah. Again.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.460
I think we should go with What's New Mate

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.460
or Mate. That sounds good to me. I think I like it.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.460
It was a good conversation.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.460
Thank you Wimpy for making it in here on the

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.460
and thank you Poppy for paying Wimpy.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.460
No thank you.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.460
Thank you very much. I'm just Popey's

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.460
he summoned you

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.460
we were going to

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.460
well it was either that or sick the whole chat room on you

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460
and so we figured that was probably more more efficient

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.460
to anything. Well yeah. Yeah.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.460
So thank you for making it. And thank

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.460
you guys for being here. Yeah.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460
And so chat room don't forget I mentioned it right

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.460
at the end of the show but we're going to do Linux Action Show on

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.460
Sunday. Sunday.

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.460
Probably 10 a.m. or regular time. Yeah.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.460
So OK. All right.

01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.460
Bye Mumble Room. Thank you for being here.

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.460
When do you change your clocks? Is it

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.460
Saturday night Sunday morning.

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.460
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.460
Is that a thing. Could I possibly

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.460
have you change this weekend.

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.460
Oh why did I have to.

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.460
On the one day we moved back to Sunday.

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.460
Oh my God.

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.460
Oh my God.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.460
Oh my God. It's horrible.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.460
That could not have gotten more worse.

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.460
Just set it back an hour. Yeah.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.460
That is horrible.

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.460
Just do it early on Saturday.

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.460
You know what makes it even more complicated

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.460
is Noah is traveling across time zones right now.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.460
And he will be traveling

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.460
while we're doing the show across time zones.

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.460
Oh that's going to be disaster.

01:31:37.460 --> 01:32:03.460
Holy crap.
