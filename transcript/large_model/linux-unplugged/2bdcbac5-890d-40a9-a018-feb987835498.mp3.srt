1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Will you describe to Angela sort of your approach to taking some of the excess revenue generated

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,880
for the Buntu Mate project and how you pass it on to some other open source projects?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,000
Because I don't think she's heard that before.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,760
So we receive donations from our awesome community and users and we've got far more money coming

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,280
in than we need to cover the costs of the project.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,160
So when there's a surplus, we identify other open source projects that we depend on or

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,480
are making use of, and we send some of those donations back to those projects.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,040
And that hopefully keeps them motivated and keeps them covering their costs.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,920
And it helps generate some collaboration and contact and communication with the various

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,560
projects that we reach out to in that way.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,440
That's good PR for his project too.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,000
So you pretty much fund the projects that you're most interested in?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,100
To some extent.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:11,600
So this month we've given some money to TLP, which is an advanced power management utility

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
for Linux, which is going to be integrated into the next release of Ubuntu Mate.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,560
Now I've been using that for some years and it really increases battery endurance on laptops

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
and things.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,760
So I wanted to integrate that and it started a dialogue with that developer, but we've

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,760
also sponsored other individuals and projects.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,120
It's not like loads of money.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,780
I'm not going to make anyone rich overnight or anything, but it's a nice way to recognize

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,280
their contributions because as single application and utility developers, they probably don't

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,560
generate much donations for their individual projects.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,840
But by using a distribution as a platform, we can be a bit more generous than you could

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,600
be as an individual.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,400
We've been kicking around in house as we've transitioned more and more of our production

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,080
over to Linux or open source tools.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Now we start to kind of feel like we'd like to come up with a model where we can contribute

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,460
some amount to the projects we depend on and maybe even help encourage them to continue

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,280
to support Linux because some of those projects, their Linux support is a little tenuous.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
So it seems like there's a whole range of software specifically around media production

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
that I've been sitting around and waiting for to get better for a really, really long

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
time.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,640
And some of it's gotten a lot better and some of it still hasn't.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,480
And so I'm starting to wonder if maybe there isn't a way we could start to move the dial

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,540
there a little bit.

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,720
So do you just kind of personally choose where the money goes or is there a – the main

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,960
thing I'm worried about is if I did something like that, I feel like it would be constant

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,640
scrutiny, constantly questioning how much and where I put – sent the money.

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,360
And I would like to base it on, well, I feel like this is what we can afford to do and

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,980
this is how that project is important to us or to media production in general or open

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
source in general, whatever.

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,180
You know, like I feel like I'd like to have some freedom over it to sort of help encourage

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,400
projects that make our content better.

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
But I feel like it would be – it would be constantly up against scrutiny.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,600
So how have you avoided that?

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Well, at the moment, this is one of the few things that I've not actually gone to the

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,240
Ubuntu Mate community and said, which projects do you think we should sponsor?

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:25,960
I've actually made that decision for myself based on the projects that I feel are most

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,200
important to Ubuntu Mate that aren't necessarily part of Ubuntu or Mate.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
So they've been quite diverse.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I mean, I've actually sponsored one of the elementary projects a couple of months ago

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,680
and now have good relationships there.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,240
And I've still got plenty of ideas in the pipeline about what projects I would like

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,000
to support through Ubuntu Mate over the next few months.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,760
And when I start running out of ideas, then I'll start asking the community.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,040
And I think, you know, there's obvious candidates.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,960
For example, we haven't sponsored Mozilla yet.

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,520
We haven't sponsored LibreOffice yet.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,720
We're not going to make any significant contribution there, but we should recognize

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,880
the part that they play in making up an operating system.

63
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,680
So, you know, they're clearly on the list and will get some recognition.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,840
But I'm sure the Ubuntu Mate community have got projects that are included in Ubuntu Mate

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,280
they'd like to see receive some money.

66
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
And when I start running out of ideas, I'll ask.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That makes sense.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And that might be kind of an approach I would take too.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
I've been kicking it around for a while, trying to figure out what I'm most comfortable

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,200
with and really willing to commit to.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,680
I actually think the way Martin does it is the right way to do it.

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,280
He picks what he thinks is most appropriate.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,720
And I know if someone sent him an email saying, hey, Martin, I really think you should consider

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,000
donating to these people, then I'm sure if it's not unreasonable, it will go on the list.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,320
But I don't think it's necessarily a good idea to put out a poll and say, who should

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
we give the money to?

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,320
Because that can cause resentment for people who were at the bottom of the list and can

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,360
cause people to gain the system and try and force Martin to give money to someone he might

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,840
not necessarily think is the most important or worthy recipient.

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Good point.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,080
Well, thank you for that vote of confidence.

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,040
Well in order to find out which projects are out there, you're kind of getting a, not necessarily

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,280
a polling, not to vote, but just to get the ideas.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,160
I feel like if I did one a month or something, I could probably do it for a year easily on

87
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
my own.

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
Just the ones that we depend on here for production.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
And I kind of feel like in some ways, like if they were commercial software projects,

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,540
I would have paid for them many times over now.

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,000
Like geez, how could I even put a dollar amount on FFmpeg?

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,860
I don't even like, I can't even, FFmpeg is worth more than any proprietary commercial

93
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,540
piece of software we have from Adobe or Apple.

94
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,880
And so I just can't even fathom, or really in some ways VLC is pretty fricking important

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
too.

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,760
So it's really weird, like these open source projects couldn't do our job without them

97
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
now.

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,160
Now that we've, you know when we look to replace proprietary components with open source ones,

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
when we made the switch, we made the switch because they were better choices, not just

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,740
because they were the free and open choices.

101
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,360
And so once you make that switch, it's kind of a mind F to think about how much money

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
you'd actually be willing to spend on those things that you just get for free.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm inclined to agree with Martin though, that if you pick out like the big ones, like

104
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,920
Mozilla and LibreOffice and others that you've listed, there's the possibility that you would

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
be a drop in the ocean.

106
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean I'm sure they're very grateful and thankful that you're showing your appreciation

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,120
by giving them some hard-earned cash, but the flip side is for all the money that you

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,960
give to those really big ones, there's all these unsung heroes out there creating some

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,080
tiny little thing that's a tiny cog in the whole mechanism of Jupiter broadcasting that

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
doesn't necessarily get the recognition.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,720
And I know you as a broadcaster are looking for content all the time and if you find and

112
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,480
discover those tiny little projects and you chuck a few bucks their way and say, you know,

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,440
I really appreciate the work you're doing, it may well help motivate them to continue

114
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
working on it.

115
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,880
They'll never know these tiny little projects, how much time they've gotten, whether they're

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,160
happy to carry on working on the project or not.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Or if they're burning out or whatever.

118
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Yeah, exactly.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has this chat room full screen

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
on your screen.

121
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
My name is Chris.

122
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
And I'm Angela.

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Hey there, Andrews.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm glad to have you here.

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
Now I'm not sweating alone.

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,080
I appreciate having somebody to sweat with during the show.

127
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I may or may not have pants on right now.

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
And you may or may not be in a tank top right now.

129
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,460
This is the summer edition of the Jupiter Broadcasting Programming.

130
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,080
It kind of reminds me of when we used to broadcast out of the garage.

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
We also were affected.

132
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
At least here in the studio we don't get crazy cold.

133
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,960
We only get crazy hot.

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
So it only goes one direction.

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,320
Well coming up on today's episode of 96, holy smokes, episode 96 of the show.

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,440
We got Matt coming on from the Fedora Project.

137
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,640
Matthew Miller will be joining us talking about Fedora 22 and Fedora 23.

138
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,440
Mark Shuttleworth was on stage today playing a can you name what it is game.

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
Yes, Ubuntu is now running on yet another crazy device.

140
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,200
We'll be talking about that.

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Angela's here to give us an update on her switch to Linux.

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,600
And she's got her top four things that she's run into and solved or maybe has not solved

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
since she's visited us last.

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,460
And I'm going to say one of them straight up I think is just one of the reasons why

145
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,000
Arch isn't super great for new users.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,280
But she doesn't mind tackling it.

147
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,640
We'll talk about that a little bit in the show.

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
And then at the end, if we have some time, we got some great insights into why some of

149
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,160
us are just maniac distro hoppers.

150
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,460
I think we might finally have the answer and we'll get some insights into all of that crazy

151
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,760
distro hopping that we like to do.

152
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,860
But first, but first, before we do all of that, let's say hey to our virtual log, time

153
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,280
appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

154
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Poppy is always on it.

155
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,360
He's like, boom, right in there with it.

156
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
That's nice.

157
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,660
Okay, so I just wanted to commence with you guys, what's going on with SourceForge?

158
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,120
So since we had a chance to get together last time, it's also come out now that the Nmap

159
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,200
project was taken over in the same way that GIMP for Windows was.

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,640
Also VLC, back in the day, like this didn't get a lot of attention, but back in the day,

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
check this out.

162
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,360
The founder of VLC sent an email to Ars Technica that said that the VLC project's account on

163
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
SourceForge was taken over in 2012, which was the most downloaded project at the time.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,520
In fact, it's still one of the most top downloaded projects on SourceForge, even though it's

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,080
not their primary hosting.

166
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
They say too that when that happened, and then VLC moved to their own hosting infrastructure

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,800
after that event, surprisingly those new servers were DDoSed.

168
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
They don't know if it was related or not.

169
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,480
So what's going on, Angie, if you're not familiar, SourceForge is a site that hosts a lot of

170
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
open source projects, gives them mirrors for downloading.

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,900
And you know, when you're writing free code, it's not like you have a bunch of extra money

172
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,240
to have a bunch of mirrors, so this is a very handy service.

173
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,060
And what they started doing is they take like the Windows installer for GIMP, and they'd

174
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,560
package it up with a bunch of adware.

175
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,340
And so when you download it, you get like the SourceForge version of GIMP that has ads

176
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,300
and installs on your machines and all that kind of crap.

177
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,360
And now we find out that they're doing it to other open source projects as well, like

178
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Nmap and VLC.

179
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,680
Wait, so SourceForge is grabbing people's open source projects, packaging them, loading

180
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,280
them, and then distributing them?

181
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,480
Why would people even use SourceForge if they're doing that?

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Well, SourceForge has a lot of momentum.

183
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,480
Is it a distribution method for open source projects?

184
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,660
A lot of people go there to find software, a lot of old links on websites linked back

185
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
to SourceForge.

186
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Do they just use GitHub?

187
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
There's a lot of play.

188
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, GitHub's not so much for hosting the file, although people do do that as well.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,560
There's a lot of other alternatives now.

190
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
It's old.

191
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
That's why it's there.

192
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
After parking in here.

193
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm not introduced to it yet.

194
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,560
SourceForge management changed, and then they decided to screw up the old trusty SourceForge

195
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,480
that used to be good.

196
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Yeah.

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
There was no GitHub, and then GitHub came along and did the thing it does better than

198
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,920
what SourceForge wanted it to be, and then everybody moved off SourceForge, and then

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,360
people at SourceForge feel like they need to get a lot of money, at least that's my

200
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
perspective.

201
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah.

202
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm just making that up, but it seems...

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,920
I don't need to get on the soapbox again, but what I don't like about it, and it probably

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,360
seems pretty obvious to you, is it kind of, to the average consumer, gives open source

205
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
projects a bad name.

206
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah.

207
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,200
If I tell you to go download VLC, and then you download... God, this is the worst case.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
We've had this happen with family members because they just screw it up.

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,320
We'll tell them to go download VLC, and then they'll go Google VLC, and they'll download

210
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,040
some adware version of VLC and get a ton of crap on their PC.

211
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Or bloatware, right?

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Isn't that what it was called?

213
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Yeah.

214
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,200
That gives open source projects like VLC a bad name, just that kind of stuff.

215
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,780
Now, when you go to a well-established distribution point for open source software, and they're

216
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,280
distributing open source software that looks official with adware, it looks like it's the

217
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
projects doing it.

218
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,960
If you're sort of a casual average user, it's a huge disappointment.

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,800
SourceForge is becoming another CNETsDownload.com, Elroy says, and I completely agree.

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Download.com did the same thing.

221
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah.

222
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Let's come out with a new one.

223
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Yeah?

224
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Yeah.

225
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I don't know.

226
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
What do you think, Alex?

227
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Binary downloads?

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Tell me more.

229
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Yes.

230
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
I think SourceForge is still the best for binary downloads.

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:33,880
There was a page that compared all our alternatives, and for binary, GitHub just doesn't cut it.

232
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Yeah.

233
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
There is, actually.

234
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,080
The mirror network is nice, too, let's be honest.

235
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Free bandwidth.

236
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,720
You can never really sneeze at that.

237
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,360
I posted the link.

238
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Yes.

239
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
Thank you.

240
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
From Rotten Corpse's blog.

241
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Yeah.

242
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
That's cool.

243
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I was just going to say, yeah.

244
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
All right.

245
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,200
So, I just would like to get the audience's opinion on that.

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
It's kind of a shame.

247
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
It is kind of a shame.

248
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
What is angersdownloads.com?

249
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Oh, try it.

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Click it.

251
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
What's the worst that could happen?

252
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It's not a link.

253
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Come on.

254
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I will copy it.

255
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I want something good.

256
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Come on.

257
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Come on.

258
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I want something good here.

259
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Let's see what we get.

260
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
What is it?

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
What is it?

262
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Sir not found.

263
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I think it's wasted effort.

264
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Darn it.

265
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I thought it was a wasted effort.

266
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Darn it.

267
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Go figure.

268
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Way to get me all excited.

269
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah.

270
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Well, maybe by the end of the show, you could have something there.

271
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
All right.

272
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I wanted to read a bit of feedback we got into the show.

273
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,160
It says, we're going to be talking with Matthew Miller from Fedora.

274
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,760
This is a great bit of feedback.

275
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:35,120
This was Tehamilox experience with Gnome Shell 3.16 on Wayland 1.8.

276
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,800
Since Wayland 1.8 was just released, I've decided to give Gnome Shell on Wayland a go.

277
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm using an upgraded Arch.

278
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I've been impressed overall with the smoothness, like resizing and dragging windows around.

279
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,440
However, there's still some problems that are unique to Wayland.

280
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
Now, this is what we've all been wondering.

281
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,760
What do I lose if I switch to this new display server on Linux?

282
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,400
No copy and paste support between X-Wayland and native applications, no middle button

283
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
paste.

284
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Wait.

285
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,520
With native apps, you can't copy and paste?

286
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
That seems...

287
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,480
Well, so you have apps that know they're in Wayland, and then you have these old X-apps

288
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
that are from the old display server that are running in compatibility mode.

289
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
You can't paste between the new smart apps.

290
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Oh, I see.

291
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
I see.

292
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,720
So, a lot of important apps that are still running in this compatibility mode, like VLC,

293
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,080
Chromium, even though native versions exist, they're not packaged properly.

294
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,800
X-Wayland applications are not clickable when placed on the second monitor.

295
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,160
Evian's PDF viewer displays every document at 400%, and you can't change that.

296
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
Double click doesn't work?

297
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,720
Okay, so as somebody that uses shortcuts on a mouse, is a middle button click a mouse

298
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
thing?

299
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
So, yeah.

300
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
In Linux, you can highlight text, and it automatically gets copied to the X Clipboard, and if you

301
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
use the middle button to click, it automatically pastes from the X Clipboard.

302
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,120
You never have to do Control-C, Control-V, nothing.

303
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Just highlight, click.

304
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
That's genius.

305
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Nice.

306
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,240
It actually turns out, too, that they never actually, I don't think, intentionally put

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
that feature in there.

308
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,400
But he says, overall, he's been pretty satisfied, if you're okay with those problems.

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,960
For my use case, it's not really, he says, not ready to be his daily driver, but it's

310
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,920
pretty exciting it's gotten this far.

311
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
Anybody else in the Mumble Room had a chance to play with Wayland as their main desktop

312
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
for a little while?

313
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,480
All these people didn't know about it.

314
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Well, you don't think so?

315
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
No.

316
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
I have it on the Yolo phone.

317
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Oh, yeah.

318
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Of course.

319
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Yes.

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,920
And I'm sure it works fine in that use case, right?

321
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah, quite good.

322
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Yeah.

323
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,200
I played with it briefly when I had...

324
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,680
I think I played with it.

325
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,600
I think it was with the Dora 21.

326
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,960
I think I played with it when I had it on an Intel driver machine.

327
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,320
And for the five minutes I used it, I was pretty impressed how well it worked.

328
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Go ahead, Corky.

329
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
There is one issue.

330
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Porting.

331
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,680
Well, Nome has partial Wayland support now, but for all other desktop environments and

332
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,640
window managers, the developers have to go through a long process of porting it.

333
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,960
And when some of them can't even get to GTK3, it's going to be quite a hard process to get

334
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,680
to an incomplete display server.

335
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Yeah.

336
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Yeah.

337
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
That's why...

338
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,840
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of compatibility stuff around for a long time.

339
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,240
I'm not in a huge rush, but it is good to see it moving right along.

340
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Okay.

341
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,960
I want to just take a minute and read another one more bit of feedback, and then we'll get

342
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,720
to Matthew.

343
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,240
So this one came in from KBNap.

344
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Kidnap?

345
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
KBNap?

346
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
What do you think, Ange?

347
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
KBNap?

348
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
I don't know.

349
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
KBNap?

350
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
I'm going to go with that.

351
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Yeah.

352
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
That's great.

353
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
It's called DOCLI, a command line tool for DigitalOcean.

354
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,760
He says, I'm a longtime listener of the show, all the JV shows, and I've been using DO for

355
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,960
quite a time thanks to Jupyter Broadcasting.

356
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,880
So I decided to try and make DOCLI, a command line utility for Linux, and probably OS too,

357
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,640
for managing your DigitalOcean infrastructure.

358
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Now check this out, Ange.

359
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
She made this tool.

360
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Okay.

361
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Be warned.

362
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,100
He says it's in beta and he needs testers.

363
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,800
So if you're feeling like you want to jump in, he'd love it.

364
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
You can check out...

365
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,360
He gives the command there to check it out.

366
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,160
And so it's like, here's an example, a command would be DOCLI dash dash verbose dash dash

367
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
no send then the command.

368
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,840
And you can do like delete command safely.

369
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
You could pass commands up to the droplet.

370
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,120
He says, it's using the DigitalOcean API wrapper library behind the scenes.

371
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,880
And if you use Rust, feel free to give in and contribute.

372
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,160
It's written in Rust.

373
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,240
Keep up the great work on the last community.

374
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,280
And he says it is in the AUR, if you're on Arch, called doccli-bin or doccli-git in the

375
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
AUR if you want to install that.

376
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,640
So this is a Linux command line utility that KB Kanap wrote to manage your DigitalOcean

377
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,560
droplet using their API and then submitted it into the show.

378
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Isn't that really cool?

379
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
That is really cool.

380
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,840
And so it's called DOCLI.

381
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,920
And in fact, while we're talking about that, why don't I mention DigitalOcean?

382
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
And she know about DigitalOcean?

383
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I sure do.

384
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, you do use DigitalOcean like on a daily basis now that you're on that Minecraft server.

385
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
And actually own cloud too.

386
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,720
You use an own cloud all the time.

387
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,280
Well, yeah, that's DigitalOcean is like our go-to now for when we need Linux infrastructure.

388
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,460
We used to build out servers here in the garage, but it gets hot for one.

389
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,560
And that gets ridiculous because I end up spending all my time doing system administration

390
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,080
instead of podcasting, which doesn't make any sense.

391
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
DigitalOcean makes a ton of sense.

392
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,680
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to

393
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,720
spin up your own cloud server.

394
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,520
And get ready for this, boss-level stuff here, if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one

395
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,120
word lowercase, DOUNPLUGGED, you get a $10 credit.

396
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
That's like a two-month credit.

397
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
It is.

398
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
It is.

399
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,440
Because you can get started for $5 a month and you can get going in under 55 seconds.

400
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,800
And for $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

401
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
of transfer.

402
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,160
You just spin it up when you need it, spin it back down if you don't.

403
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
It's pretty simple.

404
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,880
They offer hourly pricing if you want to go that route.

405
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,480
And then our $10 credit, DOUNPLUGGED, really, really gets you somewhere.

406
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,720
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

407
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
and in London.

408
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Isn't that proper?

409
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,960
And a brand new one in Germany as well, which is super slick.

410
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,000
It's got their fastest SSDs yet, which is already ridiculous that they're SSDs throughout

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
that whole business, which is brave.

412
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,140
And also, back when they first launched it, a little cray.

413
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,840
But now, it's like, you got to have it.

414
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,640
And now, all the other service providers are spending a ton of money trying to catch up.

415
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,920
And meanwhile, DigitalOcean's like, that's cool, you can try to catch up.

416
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,040
We're going to keep iterating.

417
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,160
They just released a new version of their API a couple of weeks ago.

418
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,180
They just rolled out support for Fedora 22 across the DigitalOcean infrastructure a couple

419
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,360
of days ago.

420
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,800
They've been working on Fedora 10, or I'm sorry, FreeBSD 10.1 support.

421
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,960
They got new tutorials out there.

422
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,480
But the best thing about DigitalOcean is that sweet interface.

423
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,280
DigitalOcean has a beautiful intuitive control panel.

424
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,440
Somehow they managed to make it easy and fast to use, crazy intuitive, but it's not watered

425
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
down.

426
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
The DigitalOcean control panel still allows you to do full feature DNS management.

427
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,680
You can create and destroy and snapshot and make templates out of your droplets.

428
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,000
And of course, they have one-click installation and deployments for the entire stack.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,880
So you can do a LAMP stack from the Linux kernel all the way up to Apache.

430
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,800
Or you can say, I already have an existing Ubuntu machine.

431
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,120
I want to deploy Ruby on Rails or GitLab, something like that.

432
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
I love it.

433
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,040
And if you use DO Unplugged, you get a $10 credit.

434
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,200
You can see why I rave about it so much.

435
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,120
And don't forget about their API.

436
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,920
Just like our emailer did, you can extend the functionality of their dashboard with

437
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,600
the API and start automating things, automating deployment, testing, spinning up machines,

438
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,880
destroying of machines.

439
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
It gets cray.

440
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,920
Also, they have some of the best tutorials on the web.

441
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,760
I think you can go check for yourself.

442
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,680
Go to DigitalOcean, click on that community section, and then be like, boom, in my face.

443
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,320
They're also hiring right now for Linux admins and content editors.

444
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Go check out DigitalOcean.

445
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,280
Go look at their community section.

446
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,120
Right now, they just posted Apache content caching on Ubuntu 14.04, Node.js application

447
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,560
production and how to get started with FreeBSD 10.1 tutorials.

448
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
It's good stuff.

449
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,160
And they have professional editors and crap like that.

450
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,120
I'm like, I don't even, at first, I was like, why are you guys doing all of this?

451
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
People can just go here and read these, and they're not even applicable to DigitalOcean.

452
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
Then I realized they're playing a long game.

453
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
Because the thing is, at $5 a month, that gets you in the door.

454
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,600
Because how are you going to beat that value?

455
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,160
But then, for a lot of people, they can go to get these tutorials, and the value you

456
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,760
get then out of that $5 because of these tutorials, they're unlocking stuff that, back when I

457
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,480
did IT contracting, this was the secret of the business.

458
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
This was the secret sauce.

459
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,000
And I'm like, oh, that's why they're doing this.

460
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
This is super smart.

461
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,100
And then it really clicked with me when they started hiring multiple content editors and

462
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,920
copyright editors and started paying people to submit tutorials.

463
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,200
They're serious about this.

464
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
And that completes the DigitalOcean picture.

465
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,560
You've got those great SSDs, the great data center locations, the fantastic interface,

466
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,160
Linux-based technology, KVM for the virtualization stack.

467
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,160
And they're always current with CoreOS and Fedora, and they're keeping up with FreeBSD.

468
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,440
They do a great job there.

469
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,680
And then they wrap it all up with those fantastic tutorials.

470
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,880
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED when you check out.

471
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,680
And a great, big, huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

472
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,240
Man, it is hot in here.

473
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
Wow, it is hot in here.

474
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Holy smokes.

475
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Holy smokes.

476
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,520
Anyways, I wanted to welcome Matthew Miller to the show from the Fedora Project.

477
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,200
He heads the Fedora Project up over there, at least so far.

478
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah, a year now.

479
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah, so Matthew, what's the stat for the average Fedora Project lead?

480
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
Is it something abysmal?

481
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Well, let's see, there's been only eight or so, so it's hard to get any good data.

482
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
There's been eight, and Fedora's been around for...

483
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
In like three months?

484
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
No, I'm just kidding.

485
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
No, but actually...

486
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Ten years.

487
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah, eight and ten years.

488
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,080
But I got a good feeling about you.

489
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,120
I think you're going to make it for a while.

490
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
So are you...

491
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Thank you.

492
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Are you doing okay?

493
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Are you exhausted from the big release?

494
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,680
Have you caught your breath from Fedora 22?

495
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah, I think from Fedora 22.

496
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,640
That seemed like that was in the distant past at this point.

497
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Really?

498
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Already, huh?

499
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Wow.

500
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm a little exhausted.

501
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
We had a big week last week.

502
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,160
We had a release engineering FAD, which FAD is Fedora Activity Day, and so we flew a bunch

503
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
of people into...

504
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,040
Actually, this one was held at Red Hat's Westford office, which is...

505
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,200
Westford is a distant suburb of Boston, so we flew a bunch of people in and there was

506
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,640
a bunch of hacking.

507
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,760
And that actually went on all weekend, but I ran away.

508
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,660
But that was a big, big, cool, busy thing.

509
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,480
But yeah, we're kind of busy working on infrastructure and stuff for Fedora 23 now, because a six-month

510
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
cycle comes quick.

511
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Yeah, it does.

512
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,760
So when you say infrastructure, what kind of things are being worked on at this point

513
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
in this point of the release cycle already?

514
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah, so a lot of this stuff is the build systems that we make the release with.

515
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,880
And so that pretty much has to be in place by the alpha in order for it to really work.

516
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,720
And actually, one of the things we have right now is that it's actually hard to make any

517
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,120
changes after the alpha, which, again, that's basically halfway into the six months.

518
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,480
And so the last six months, if we want to make a vagrant image all of a sudden because

519
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,400
we decided at last minute that that's a high priority, it's hard to add those things on.

520
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,360
And with the world changing so quickly, there's always last-minute things to add on.

521
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,600
So part of the idea is to make it more flexible so we can hopefully have some more last-minute

522
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,880
changes, getting more towards a continuous delivery of release engineering tools so that

523
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,720
we can kind of adjust as we need.

524
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,360
And then there's just a lot of technical debt and cleanup as all 10-year-old projects have.

525
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Sure.

526
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
So 22 is out.

527
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,840
Is there anything when you're going into 23 now that you're like, oh, we definitely didn't

528
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,400
hit the right note on this point in 22 and we want to make sure we get this note right

529
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
in 23?

530
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Is there anything that stands out for you?

531
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,960
Because to me, 22 on the outside seems like a pretty great release.

532
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Yeah, no, I think it is a really great release.

533
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,840
I think it's a lot of polish over Fatora 21, which was also a great release.

534
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,280
So it's nice to have that increasing polish.

535
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,480
And so I think so far we're seeing a lot of that kind of thing.

536
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,760
There's a new feature for secure DNS, DNSSEC, that's being worked on right now, which I

537
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,560
think is pretty cool.

538
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,560
I think that in addition, that actually includes having a local resolver on your system, which

539
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,520
we actually didn't have before.

540
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,320
And I'm spoiled because I worked for universities and had local servers that were used.

541
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
It makes a big difference.

542
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,920
High quality and fast.

543
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,840
But yeah, I installed this test feature and realized browsing the web at a coffee shop

544
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,680
was like 100 times faster.

545
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
So much faster over Wi-Fi.

546
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,500
It's like, wow, I wish I would have done that years ago.

547
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,080
So that's hopefully going to be default in Fatora 23.

548
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,280
So that's a nice workstation feature there.

549
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Cool.

550
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,000
I've also heard just today, I think I read that there's going to be support for firmware

551
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,840
updates on new EFI machines from within Fatora.

552
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,040
Can you talk about that?

553
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,920
I think that that cover is about my knowledge of it.

554
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,680
I know I talked a little bit to Peter Jones who's working on that.

555
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,080
But yeah, that's basically so you don't have to go into some other operating system or

556
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,880
some weird boot to update your firmware.

557
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,360
And I just think as that becomes more prominent, that's going to be really nice.

558
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,120
Now, Matt, one thing I had you on here before and I asked you about, and I was hoping to

559
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,320
see more in 22 and I'm wondering what your thoughts are on 23 is, we see these when we

560
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,280
go to conferences and events, and you must see it too when you travel, just these conferences

561
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,960
and events, these Linux conference and events are awash in MacBooks.

562
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Like it's maybe sometimes like depending on the venue, 70% of the machines there, 80%

563
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,020
of the machines there are MacBooks at Linux events.

564
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,840
And so I have been just so desperate for a distribution to come along and say, we are

565
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,520
really going to tackle the MacBook problem and handle its, you know, SMC firmware, its

566
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,060
weird boot system setup and we're really going to try to understand this and make it easy

567
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,840
for Mac users to have an open source workstation they can load on their premium hardware.

568
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,040
Is this an area at all you guys are continuing to look at and any discussion there?

569
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Yeah.

570
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,080
I mean, so the Mac hardware itself is kind of hard because it's not like Apple wants

571
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,760
to bend over backwards to work with us on that kind of thing.

572
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,840
Not that they're engineers or bad people or anything, just that it's not their company

573
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
priority.

574
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
It's not a priority.

575
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,800
They definitely don't care about other operating systems running on their hardware.

576
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,300
They're kind of a unified system.

577
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,160
And so we often have problems with, you know, like wireless drivers and things like that.

578
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
And the webcam.

579
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,840
Yeah, exactly.

580
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,560
So that's going to continue to be a challenge.

581
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,440
We're going to continue to work on it because we love for it to work on the Mac hardware.

582
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,240
I think we also have some other work going on to get it running on some of the nice,

583
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:20,640
you know, Ultrabook kind of non Mac hardware that looks and feels as nice as that.

584
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,780
I think traditionally Red Hat has given Lenovo laptops to all their employees.

585
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,120
So Lenovo has been the safe laptop for Fedora and a lot of Linux distributions because of

586
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
that.

587
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Yep.

588
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Yep.

589
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,920
And I think we're and not that, you know, abandoning Lenovo or anything or that we actually

590
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,360
had a formal commitment to that.

591
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,080
But I think we're branching out on some of the shinier laptops as well.

592
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,040
I know one of the desktop people was showing me one of these Kashiva laptops that splits

593
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,160
in two so you can pull the tablet off and they had Fedora working on that.

594
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

595
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
It's kind of weird.

596
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Like you leave the keyboard behind.

597
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Yeah.

598
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Yeah, I've seen that.

599
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,120
OK, so let's shift gears back to Fedora and the transition that's one of the big transitions

600
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,680
been going on now for what, two releases or more, really?

601
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,580
But really the last two releases, I feel like it came to the surface was the transition

602
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,260
from YUM to DNF.

603
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,820
And for the most part, it's been pretty clean.

604
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,780
But I guess there's still like some cleanup to do, like perhaps GNOME software is still

605
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,720
using YUM on the back end and so that can sometimes cause problems.

606
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,200
How's that transition going?

607
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,040
Actually, yeah, so actually there's a thing called Hockey or I'm not sure how you pronounce

608
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
it.

609
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,320
There's a library underneath it and both GNOME software and DNF are using it, but they're

610
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,740
using it differently.

611
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,240
And then YUM uses its own thing.

612
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,360
So right now you could potentially have three different things going on.

613
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,480
So there's that that will hopefully become more unified in I don't know if that's proposed

614
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,160
for 23, but in the future, so it'll all be in one place.

615
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Yeah.

616
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,800
So right now you can easily download all the repository metadata three times if you're

617
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
using all those things.

618
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
And that's kind of wasteful, a little unannoying.

619
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,560
So how do I know as an end user that DNF is going to be it now for a while?

620
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,500
Because I feel like YUM just finally kind of got squared away.

621
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,000
So how do I know as an end user, like it's safe to invest in, I feel like when Linux

622
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,960
distributions sort of change out these things, as an end user, I sometimes am left going,

623
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,680
oh, now I feel like these core components that I thought were like temples of my distribution

624
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
are interchangeable.

625
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,720
And I'm not sure, I'm so sure I want to get really super connected to this new component.

626
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,160
Is DNF here for the long haul or could you see it being replaced in a couple of years?

627
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,880
That's open source and software in general for you.

628
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,240
Something comes along even better for that than that.

629
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,160
We will definitely look at it.

630
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,680
I think that the team working on it at Red Hat is pretty committed to this.

631
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,360
And they really lobbied to have it named something other than YUM4, which was kind of what I

632
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,920
think in Fedora, a lot of us were hoping that that's what it would go to.

633
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,920
And it really is like, it's for the basic things of like installing software upgrades,

634
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
those kind of things.

635
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,980
It's really like drop-in compatible, you don't have to think about it.

636
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,280
But it behaves a little differently because it uses a different like mathematical approach

637
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,880
for dependency solving, which means that your results might not be exactly the same.

638
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,840
And they were worried that that would be more confusing to people if they didn't also emphasize

639
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,240
that there was a change with the name change.

640
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,700
So they won out on that one.

641
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,200
So that's why we've got a new name.

642
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,120
But that team is pretty committed to this being the future for that.

643
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,840
And one of the things is that it is designed with sort of a modular architecture and a

644
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,160
clean code base with a defined API and all these kind of modern software engineering

645
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:45,360
ideas that YUM kind of grew up over the years into what it was.

646
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,220
So there's a lot of, like you said, there's a lot of improvements and all that, but there's

647
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,760
also a lot of cruft and it's getting harder for the developers to manage.

648
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Well, that's actually pretty old, isn't it?

649
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah.

650
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,640
I guess if it comes from Yellow Dog Linux, which isn't even around anymore, and Power

651
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
PC hardware isn't even that prominent anymore.

652
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,520
So yeah, it has been, it served a good purpose for a good long time, really.

653
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,440
So that's pretty understandable.

654
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,160
I like, you know, one of the things I like about Fedora is that it's a great place to

655
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:18,680
sort of experience one of the latest versions of GNOME and GNOME 3.16 is no exception.

656
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,320
It looks great under Fedora.

657
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,200
And I've noticed the Fedora project is making really super minor tweaks to the default.

658
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,220
It's pretty much a default GNOME experience, but there's a couple of things you guys change

659
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,640
that nobody else does.

660
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,080
One thing, elementary OS does it, but outside, but they're not using GNOME 3, is if you have

661
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,840
a command in the terminal that completes and the terminal isn't active anymore, you've

662
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,640
integrated it with the GNOME notification system to give you a notification that, hey,

663
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,520
the command on your terminal that you're no longer watching has completed and you can

664
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,020
return to your terminal now.

665
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Nobody else does that.

666
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,120
And that's not a big deal, but I thought it was interesting.

667
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,780
There's a specific Fedora tweak you're making.

668
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,880
There's also discussions about Fedora willing to make tweaks to make the GNOME terminal

669
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,400
transparent when it's not a default in GNOME 3.

670
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,440
And there's another small one, like you have an extension that overlays a opaque Fedora

671
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,440
logo over the background, small little tweaks to the GNOME desktop.

672
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,840
Matthew, as you guys go forward, do you see Fedora continuing on the workstation spin

673
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,840
to, or ring or whatever you want to call it, to make tweaks to GNOME or is it pretty much

674
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
going to say stop?

675
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,440
Because I kind of like where you guys are going with some of this stuff.

676
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Yeah.

677
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,920
So I think we do really like keep following the upstream with a lot of our software is

678
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,160
one of our main ways we work in Fedora.

679
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,120
So we're going to keep to that as much as we can.

680
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
But we also wanted it to kind of feel like it had a unique Fedora identity to it.

681
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,320
That's the logo as part of that.

682
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,240
And we might do some other kind of visual things as we go forward that will be maybe

683
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,000
more subtle, but more subtle and less, you know, there's an F in your face.

684
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,540
But also just different identity kind of theming kind of things might happen.

685
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,680
But then some of the other things like the notifications that kind of come from the target

686
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,360
audience for the Fedora workstation is we're trying to make it hit that people using Macs

687
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,280
at the conference, sort of a software developer using a Mac is kind of one of the users.

688
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,620
We have it as a primary target for this.

689
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,640
And so that was one of the things we got feedback about that would be a little thing we could

690
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,080
change that would that people would like.

691
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,880
And so we're probably going to look at doing more and more of those things, especially

692
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,480
as they hit somewhere on the Wiki, there's a target audience for Fedora workstation you

693
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
can look at.

694
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,640
And so that I don't have in front of me, but it's basically we're kind of focusing that

695
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,160
feedback on the software development target and all kinds of software developers from

696
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,400
independent to big enterprise to students.

697
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,600
I like that sort of a sort of a way to focus where we're going, because when you try to

698
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,560
make it be all things to all people, then somebody says, well, that's not me.

699
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,040
And then and then you say, well, you're not all people.

700
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,040
And it gets to be a whole like, who's this and who's that?

701
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,800
But you know, when I was using it distinctly, the impression I got was this is the beginning

702
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,440
of a small tweak you're making for it for a target audience.

703
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,080
And that was essentially the impression I got.

704
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,000
So it wasn't too much.

705
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,680
And the other thing is, as somebody who reviews a lot of distributions, I install a lot of

706
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:17,480
GNOME desktops and having super, super small things that give it a feeling that this is

707
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,360
something unique I'm getting by installing Fedora, because what I don't like doing is

708
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,400
installing Fedora and being like, OK, well, I've got what I had with Antigros four weeks

709
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
ago.

710
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Right.

711
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,520
I like when I install Fedora, I like going, oh, I only got this because I installed Fedora.

712
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
That's the only way I could have got this.

713
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,720
Not that it's a proprietary or it's exclusive, but it's just a nice touch that somebody went

714
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,520
in and did that no other desktop environment, no other distribution, desktop distribution

715
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
is doing.

716
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,320
And so it makes it something kind of unique and it feels like extra thought went into

717
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,480
it, even though it's something small.

718
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,600
And so you guys build on top of that.

719
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I enjoy it a lot.

720
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Yeah.

721
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,680
And so and that's kind of also kind of a visual indicator of something we feel is actually

722
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:00,120
going on throughout the whole stack where you can see the GNOME desktop on the top and

723
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,540
it might look like another GNOME test up anywhere else.

724
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,320
But we also even our desktop team kind of works all the way down to the kernel level

725
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,240
to try and make everything integrated together into one nice distribution.

726
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Yeah, you can feel it.

727
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,960
We kind of want to remind you, we put in all this work into making this a whole integrated

728
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,120
experience and you can't, you know, you can't just necessarily get that somewhere else because

729
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,900
it won't be Fedora underneath.

730
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:30,100
So before we run, I'm looking at the release schedule right here for Fedora 23.

731
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,780
And if I see if everything goes as planned and, you know, sometimes it doesn't happen,

732
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:40,640
it looks like October 27th, ooh, right by Halloween, a Halloween edition of Fedora.

733
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,460
I don't know if you remember the old Red Hat Linux days, but some of the first releases

734
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,480
of Red Hat Linux were Mother's Day and Halloween.

735
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,400
And so those were the actual, you know, their release names or they actually had some secret

736
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,120
code name, but that was like, that's what they're known as.

737
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,840
And so we're with Fedora kind of following that tradition and actually kind of want to

738
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,720
get back to Mother's Day and Halloween releases as a regular cadence that can help people

739
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,520
follow that.

740
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
I love it.

741
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,880
It's whimsical in a way too.

742
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,240
Well, and the next FAD day should be Fedora activity promotion.

743
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,800
Yeah, there you go.

744
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Yeah.

745
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Promotion.

746
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Feb.

747
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Well, Matthew, is there anything else?

748
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Feb.

749
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
No comment on that one.

750
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Feb.

751
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,120
We do have a Fedora community-based Fedora marketing, I'm not touching that joke with

752
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
the 10-foot pole.

753
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
That's fine.

754
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Go ahead.

755
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Go ahead.

756
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,280
We do have a community-based Fedora marketing team that anybody can join and take part in

757
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,680
and help us promote what we're working on.

758
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,800
So you're very welcome and invited to join us.

759
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,160
Awfully punny with the touching.

760
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
You are.

761
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
You are good with that.

762
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,680
So Fedora 23, anything else Matthew you want to touch on before we wrap up?

763
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,280
I think one of the things we're kind of working on an initiative to, you know, you probably

764
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,120
have seen your CoreOS and Ubuntu Snappy and those kind of things and we've been talking

765
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,260
about Fedora rings for a while, kind of sort of seeing this as sort of a general sense

766
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,800
in the way operating systems are going, but we're also kind of edging slowly into it.

767
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,880
I think we're going to try and prototype some ideas around a modular OS that is kind of

768
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,980
built up out of these different components because that seems like it's kind of the way

769
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,840
of the future and it's what a lot of developers want and I think that it'll be a way that

770
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,720
hopefully we can address some of this long-term support idea which we probably are really

771
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,200
never going to do in Fedora because that doesn't fit our charter and sort of the way it works.

772
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,060
There's a general problem in operating systems of everybody wanting it to move fast and everybody

773
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,200
wanting to move slow both at the same time and nobody agreeing on which part they want

774
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,120
to be which and so having the modular operating system lets us and our users make different

775
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,080
decisions there.

776
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,280
So we might be able to, for example, have some language API Python stack which we say,

777
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,440
okay, Fedora release is retiring, but Django, for example, web stack, it's going to be the

778
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,720
same API for three releases here or there'll be a version of the same API for three releases.

779
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,000
So you know you can upgrade underneath it and keep your app running and that kind of

780
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
thing.

781
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So there's more possibilities there.

782
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Good, good, good.

783
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,060
Do you think we'll start to see the start of that in Fedora 23?

784
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,600
But it's not going to be anything like that.

785
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,960
It's not going to be a release artifact, but if you're following the development, you'll

786
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,200
see some things along those lines.

787
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,600
That sounds like a hint to keep our eyes peeled for further development there.

788
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Cool, Matthew.

789
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Yes, yes, exactly.

790
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Well, let's chat again soon.

791
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Maybe you can give us an update on that initiative and all the other goodness that's going on

792
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
over there.

793
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
You're always welcome to join us.

794
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Now that you've got Mumble built for Fedora, you have no excuse.

795
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Cool, yeah, yeah.

796
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,720
And I have to figure out why it's not in the official repository.

797
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,200
Somebody built it before and then got retired.

798
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,160
You know, we might get more Fedora users in here if it gets fixed.

799
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,680
All right, Matthew, you are welcome to hang out if you'd like.

800
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,560
We're going to move in and get an update from Ange on her transition to Linux, which I've

801
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,400
been pretty excited to watch.

802
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,200
And we'll be reporting on it here in just a moment.

803
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,640
But first, I want to tell you about our great friends over on Ting.

804
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
That's right.

805
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Go to linux.ting.com.

806
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,160
So that way you get to put Linux in your URL bar, in your URL bar.

807
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,960
In Uncle Earl's bar, you could put linux.ting.com.

808
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,840
But more importantly, right now, until the end of the month, $50 free conservation credit

809
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,640
or $50 off your first device.

810
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,760
Yep, that's amazing.

811
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,000
That's so great because Ting's only pay for what you use, and so $50 is going to pay.

812
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,940
I've got three phones, and I'm not paying $50 a month for three phones.

813
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
So come on.

814
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,680
It was like $47 last month.

815
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Yeah.

816
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Wow.

817
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I know.

818
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Isn't that great?

819
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Yes.

820
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,160
It's $6 a month for the line, and then it's just my usage on top of that.

821
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Ting just takes my minutes, my messages, and my megabytes, and they add them all up.

822
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,640
And so like, Angie and I, we used to have a plan of like, what was our... I don't want

823
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,600
to say the name of the company because they're a bunch of jerks, but...

824
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,100
Starts with an A.

825
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,600
What was our monthly plan from them?

826
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
$174.

827
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, I thought it was less than that.

828
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
$174 a month, and that's for two phones.

829
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,880
Anyways, so you can go to Ting.

830
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,040
You can go to linux.ting.com.

831
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
You click that savings calculator.

832
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Find out how much you would save.

833
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,240
You put your usage in there and find out.

834
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,160
Also, just part of the service, hotspot, tethering, mobile, go caller ID, all that stuff.

835
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
You just check the box.

836
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
You got it.

837
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
No hold customer service.

838
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,760
No hold customer service.

839
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
No hold customer service.

840
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,140
You call my 1-855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m., and a real human being answers

841
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
the phone.

842
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,140
I love it.

843
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,600
And also, check out their blog.

844
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,080
They've got great tips up there.

845
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,240
Here's one they just posted today, a Ting tip for Android, how to return paid apps on

846
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Google Play.

847
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Ooh.

848
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,200
That sounds really helpful, actually, because I never try to return digital things.

849
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,720
And then when you finally want to do it, you're really pissed off.

850
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,760
You just want to know how to do it because you got all worked up.

851
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah.

852
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
So they got a tip on how to do that.

853
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,560
Also, check out the Ting shopping site.

854
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,040
First, make sure you go to linux.ting.com, so that way your discount is applied.

855
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,520
You can get a $9 Ting SIM card.

856
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,200
They have GSM and CDMA.

857
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,400
So if you just have something that has a GSM slot, and you can add the Ting service to

858
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
that thing.

859
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
It's great for like internet of service type things.

860
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Yes, I said it.

861
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,180
It's good for like security cameras.

862
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,700
It's great for all kinds of devices.

863
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,640
It's great for two super tiny small phones like Noah has.

864
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,020
And here's the thing.

865
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,600
After that $9, you still have $41.

866
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,960
Yeah, I know, right?

867
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I know.

868
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Check this out.

869
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,080
I picked this phone out because I just think this is such a great one.

870
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,720
The OnePlus One is now available for $250, unlocked.

871
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,280
You own it from Ting, only pay for what you use, no contract.

872
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,640
And by the way, if you are in a contract right now, Ting has an early termination relief

873
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
program.

874
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,000
You switch over, you get to pick from a CDMA or a GSM network.

875
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,120
You get a dashboard that allows you to manage your device and your phone like you've never

876
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,220
experienced before.

877
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,960
And this is great if you have multiple devices or a single device, and you're going to get

878
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
no whole customer service.

879
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,020
Then you get to support the Linux Unplugged podcast, linux.ting.com.

880
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,840
Go check out Ting and see why they truly are mobile that makes sense, and see why you can

881
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,480
have a much better mobile experience.

882
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,640
And you also get to help put pressure on the big duopoly to change the way they do business.

883
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Linux.ting.com.

884
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,520
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

885
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,280
All right, Andrews, let's talk about your switch over to Linux.

886
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,960
And before the show, we came up with a couple of items that have been contention points

887
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
for you so far.

888
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,080
And, number one, which is not going to be a surprise to anybody in the mumble room.

889
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I know you guys are not going to be surprised at all.

890
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,560
Nobody listening is going to be surprised by this.

891
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,680
But Angela decided to take it upon herself to install some updates.

892
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,880
You know, I watched to make sure it went fine because she was a little bit nervous because

893
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,200
there's like a crap ton of updates, so it's pretty understandable.

894
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,560
It always is.

895
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,280
Every time I open the laptop, it has anywhere between 20 and 100 updates.

896
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
But I kind of explained why, right?

897
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Yeah.

898
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
It's all the programs on the computer.

899
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Yeah, it makes sense.

900
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Yeah.

901
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
And you like getting all of them updated.

902
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Yeah.

903
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,080
So one thing, though, is some of them come from the AUR, or the Arch User Repository.

904
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,640
And I think one of the things you noticed, I noticed in the notes here, is sometimes

905
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,320
these programs prompt you like three or four times for stuff.

906
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Yeah.

907
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
So you have to babysit it.

908
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
And they're not logical.

909
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,800
Well, they might be logical questions, but for me, they make no sense.

910
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
Do you want to edit the package build?

911
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Yeah.

912
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Like, I don't know.

913
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Do you want to continue building?

914
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Do I?

915
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I do want the update.

916
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
If I say no, will it not update?

917
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Right.

918
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
You know, I don't know.

919
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Yeah.

920
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,080
But there was one where you were like, no, you say no to that.

921
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
And I'm like, no.

922
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,760
I thought it was going to be yes.

923
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,160
Before you get crazy, the only thing she's really got coming from the AUR is Google Chrome,

924
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,380
so that way her Netflix works, and like the Evil Pop GTK theme.

925
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,380
It's not like a bunch of stuff.

926
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,380
Yeah.

927
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,520
But it does get updated.

928
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,440
And so, and that's, that's, but do you think, are you, are you willing, like, is that like

929
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,560
now that you know how to answer that, is that a, is that okay?

930
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Like if we did like a couple more times, you feel like you'd be fine with it?

931
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah.

932
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,320
I think I would need to either write down the questions and the answers, which I know

933
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,440
is just yes or no's, but, or like even just the, the sequence, yes, no, yes, no.

934
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
No, no, yes.

935
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
I think it is.

936
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Yeah.

937
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Yeah.

938
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,720
Um, cause like I said, what was logical to me was not the actual, was not the correct

939
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
answer.

940
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
So.

941
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Yeah.

942
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,720
When we went through it.

943
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Yeah.

944
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,880
And so for the most part, I've been doing the updates for her, but we decided to let

945
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,880
her try it just to see how it goes so we can report back on the show.

946
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,800
And usually the way we do it now is I update one of my machines first.

947
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Yeah.

948
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
That's, that is, I do wait.

949
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Yeah.

950
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,360
To do the updates because yeah, he could be, he could warn me if, if there shouldn't be

951
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
an update.

952
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Yeah.

953
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Yeah.

954
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
So that is definitely if you, if you install things for the user from the AUR.

955
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Yeah.

956
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Awesome.

957
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Now we do have some good news though.

958
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Okay.

959
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,840
Uh, you have something that is improved from the Mac when switching to Linux.

960
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
It's better under Linux.

961
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Yeah.

962
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
Yes.

963
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,920
And it's something that Mac Office didn't do very well for you that now is no longer

964
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,240
an issue when you're using Office under Linux.

965
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Yeah.

966
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,040
And I can't figure out exactly why, but basically it might just be because the Mac Office is

967
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,160
like a really old version.

968
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,160
I think it's 2011.

969
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Maybe.

970
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,520
They updated it for like 200 years.

971
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Yeah.

972
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
It's, it's so ridiculous.

973
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
Approximately.

974
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
And they still charge, they still charge like $2 million for it.

975
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,120
These are all rough estimations.

976
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:48,200
Well, so I've always had an issue with the formula bar on my, on my Mac.

977
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,400
Like where you go to edit, like the, in Excel and this.

978
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Yeah.

979
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,600
Like if I, yeah, if I want to go, if I click on a cell and I want to start a formula, normally

980
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,040
you could just hit equals, right?

981
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,920
But if I already have a formula there and I just want to copy it so I can paste it into

982
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,780
another cell, I cannot get the formula bar to display at the top, to display the formula.

983
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,360
And I've messed around with the, you know, where, where the toolbar is, but it will not,

984
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,360
it will not, for the lack of a better word, it will not snap into place.

985
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,880
And there's just something really weird about it.

986
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
The UI is super weird about that.

987
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,720
I end up having to work around formulas all the time.

988
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:29,440
And the other thing is that if I do hit equals and I want to like include cells around that

989
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,760
cell in the formula, it makes, it makes a temporary pop-up and it covers up the cells

990
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
around it.

991
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
Yeah.

992
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
So I can't see them.

993
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,240
The other thing I've noticed on our, on your list is.

994
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Well, wait, hold on.

995
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,920
So, but I do not have that issue.

996
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
That's what I was going to say.

997
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah.

998
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,040
So now you've been using Office 365 and other than it's a little cramped in the web browser

999
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
you find, right?

1000
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Yeah.

1001
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Right.

1002
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
Yeah.

1003
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,160
Having it on a bigger monitor is, yeah, it's kind of hard to work on just the laptop screen.

1004
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,200
There's so much UI on Office 365 that it like puts the actual spreadsheet like halfway down

1005
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
the page.

1006
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Yeah.

1007
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
Or more.

1008
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,920
It's like, yeah, half, half tools and toolbars and half.

1009
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,320
The ribbon UI is so fricking big that it takes up so much of the screen, but it's compatible

1010
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
with your spreadsheets.

1011
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,880
You didn't have to save them out.

1012
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,720
All the formatting, all the colors, you know, the color highlighting, the bolding.

1013
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,600
How do you feel about the way you're launching it right now?

1014
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,640
You have the, so I gave you an Excel icon, but it's like browser and browser.

1015
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Is that a.

1016
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
That doesn't bother me.

1017
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Good.

1018
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
No.

1019
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,080
As long as, I mean, if it took a really long time, like remember how Mac Word or Mac Office

1020
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,680
was running really slow for me on my previous Mac.

1021
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Yeah.

1022
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Yeah.

1023
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,560
If it got like that, then it would be, but it's pretty seamless.

1024
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,640
So I never tried Caligra, Heaven's Revenge is asking, because we got to Office 365 and

1025
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,160
it's been working for you.

1026
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,640
And the reason why I decided I liked it is because it kind of gives us a fail safe if

1027
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,880
you decide to move back at some point.

1028
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,520
I had originally tried Libre Office.

1029
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Yeah.

1030
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
That didn't work.

1031
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,640
It really didn't work because of the, my spreadsheets were saved as.xlsx.

1032
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,200
So and I didn't, I don't want to go through and have to re-save everything if the Office

1033
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,200
365 works.

1034
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Yeah.

1035
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,400
And like Heaven's Revenge, I already did spend the money.

1036
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,760
So I bought you a year subscription just to try it out.

1037
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Who did?

1038
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,760
I did.

1039
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Yeah.

1040
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,280
No, it's only like $9 a month, but yeah, I know it's, it's a full.

1041
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Auto renew?

1042
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
I don't know.

1043
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,280
Let's cancel that card.

1044
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
We have so many subscriptions.

1045
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,880
We don't need to go into it.

1046
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,920
That's just the way this, the welcome to the new world.

1047
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
It's the cloud, baby.

1048
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
The new world of broke.

1049
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
I know.

1050
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Geez.

1051
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,960
Now we have to talk about a travesty.

1052
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
Okay.

1053
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,280
A absolute, I had to watch a train wreck in front of my eyes.

1054
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,480
I stepped away.

1055
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,280
I had to cuddle myself to get over this.

1056
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,280
He's holding the notes.

1057
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
I have no idea what he's talking about.

1058
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Remind me, please.

1059
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,280
Do you remember me shaking?

1060
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,280
No.

1061
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
No.

1062
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
What was it?

1063
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:59,280
Well, at one point you said, Chris, I've got to have icons on my desk.

1064
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
Oh yeah.

1065
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,280
Right.

1066
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,080
And so I was like, all right, honey, hit the medic key and type in tweak.

1067
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,080
Yep.

1068
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,960
And then you brought it up and went to the desktop section.

1069
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,960
Guess who knows about tweak now?

1070
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Yeah.

1071
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,280
No, tweak has been, has been found by Angela and she turned on desktop icons.

1072
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Yep.

1073
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I just prefer it.

1074
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,560
Because with my photos, I prefer, as opposed to going through the directory, right?

1075
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,720
Is that the file directory?

1076
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Yeah.

1077
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
Your home folder or whatever.

1078
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,720
Yeah.

1079
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
As opposed to going through there.

1080
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,280
I just want to throw it on my desktop because you know what?

1081
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,520
Browsers invent a drag and drop for a reason.

1082
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Wow.

1083
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,600
That's what I'm saying.

1084
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,760
So I use social media enough that I-

1085
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,040
You want a drag and drop?

1086
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,640
Need the drag and drop.

1087
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
For social media?

1088
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
Yeah.

1089
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,440
Because you're dragging from your photo program to your desktop, from your desktop to your

1090
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,440
browser?

1091
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Yes.

1092
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
That's fine.

1093
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
That's a flow, man.

1094
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
That's a flow.

1095
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
There's some things-

1096
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
I'll give it to you.

1097
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,440
It's a workflow.

1098
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Yeah.

1099
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
It is a workflow.

1100
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
It is.

1101
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Because you know, I have 80,000 pictures.

1102
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
Yeah.

1103
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
And well-

1104
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
And one desktop.

1105
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Yeah.

1106
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
Well, they're just there temporarily.

1107
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
Yeah.

1108
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,120
So that was one of the things that Noah worked on is he made sure that-

1109
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,960
And by temporary you mean once you get a new computer.

1110
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,480
He made sure that he got me, no, no, shush.

1111
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,680
He got me Shotwell because it supports drag and drop without removing the picture from

1112
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,560
the library, which is what happened to me when I switched to Windows back in 2005 and

1113
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,240
was using Picasa.

1114
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,800
And that was, yeah.

1115
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
So.

1116
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
All right.

1117
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,680
Well, so that's Angela's update on her transition to Linux so far.

1118
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,200
And you're liking the Lenovo still too?

1119
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Yeah.

1120
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Yeah.

1121
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
You like the hardware.

1122
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Yep.

1123
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
What do you think, Mumbleroom?

1124
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
How are we doing so far?

1125
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Any tips or advice or notes for Angela to take home?

1126
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,200
Oh, look at that.

1127
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,680
A room full of critics has no criticism so far.

1128
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,000
I thought for sure we'd get some crap for the Office 365 thing.

1129
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That's good.

1130
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Nope.

1131
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's good.

1132
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,200
I tried getting it to work in Wine and then I tried getting it to work in Play and my

1133
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,120
attention span just just stopped.

1134
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Yeah.

1135
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
I know, right?

1136
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,600
And then you realize, geez, I am trying so hard to get Microsoft Office working.

1137
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,860
Like it starts to eat at you a little bit.

1138
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,720
You know, I used Abbey Word back-

1139
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,720
Yeah, you did.

1140
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
In 2001.

1141
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Yeah.

1142
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
You used it way back in the day.

1143
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Yeah.

1144
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
And Gnumeric.

1145
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,720
Yeah.

1146
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,720
I didn't remember that.

1147
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,200
Gnumeric is what you used for your spreadsheets back in the day.

1148
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Okay.

1149
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Yeah.

1150
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Yeah.

1151
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
I've been pretty excited to see it happen.

1152
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,640
Although part of me was hoping the whole thing would blow up and then we'd have a great

1153
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,080
Lenovo I'd have to play with.

1154
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
But that's fine.

1155
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,400
No, actually I'm really glad.

1156
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,880
Now I think our next step for you, and this is the one I've been dreading, is I want to

1157
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
tackle your dual monitor.

1158
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,120
But the reason why I've been dreading it-

1159
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,120
I know.

1160
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,800
Is like I think like we got to get like a series of adapters because the Lenovo is mini

1161
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
HDMI out.

1162
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,280
And that's the only thing it does is like, or micro HDMI, it's like the teensy-tinesy

1163
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,680
HDMI that's like for smartphones.

1164
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,680
That's the display out.

1165
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,680
Wow.

1166
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,840
And then that has to go to like, I don't know what your monitor is, DVI or DisplayPort or-

1167
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
I can't remember.

1168
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Yeah.

1169
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
I think it's DisplayPort.

1170
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,480
So, but I think that's the next step so that way you don't have to have such crunched up

1171
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,480
spreadsheets.

1172
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,480
Yeah.

1173
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,480
Yeah.

1174
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,480
So we'll, maybe we'll report back on that soon.

1175
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,160
Well, thankfully my workflow, like I have just a couple spreadsheets that I maintain.

1176
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,840
Bills and Nanny, like mainly.

1177
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:15,520
And then everything else is in GDocs.

1178
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,840
So like are already online.

1179
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,780
So you do a lot of Google Docs too, huh?

1180
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,780
I do for a Jupyter broadcast.

1181
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,760
You got a big, you got a good mix of stuff, don't you?

1182
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
I do.

1183
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Yeah.

1184
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
I am very diverse.

1185
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
Diversified.

1186
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,520
You are, you are diversificated, as they say.

1187
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
I think so.

1188
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,160
Well, I guess that makes the transition to different operating systems a little easier

1189
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,960
if it's all at least online.

1190
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
Mm-hmm.

1191
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,840
All right.

1192
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,520
So Mark Shuttleworth was on stage.

1193
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
I think, let me see.

1194
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,520
Do I have a date on this?

1195
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,640
I think it was today.

1196
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Or not.

1197
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
It was a while ago.

1198
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
I'm not sure.

1199
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,920
But I just found this great video of Mark talking about, and just, Ubuntu is running

1200
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,080
on so many things today.

1201
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,240
And boy, wasn't Matthew just talking about that, about having a modular operating system

1202
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,680
and how there's all these kind of different demands for it.

1203
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,680
Well, Ubuntu Snappy just landed on something else that could be actually pretty cool, especially

1204
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,880
for you sysadmins.

1205
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,040
So we're going to, I'll play the video.

1206
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,600
It's kind of a funny video, because Mark tries to get the guy to guess what it is.

1207
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,080
And the guy has the hardest time guessing.

1208
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,600
It's so obvious, too.

1209
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
So stay tuned for that.

1210
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,780
But first, I'm going to tell you about our buddies over at Linux Academy.

1211
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,560
And do you know what I love about Linux Academy?

1212
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,560
Everything.

1213
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,720
Well, that's true.

1214
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
That's true.

1215
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,000
What I love about Linux Academy is they stole my great idea.

1216
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They really did.

1217
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,160
I think if we were going to redo Jupyter Broadcasting today, this is the direction I would have

1218
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
gone.

1219
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
And I say that because I look at this and I go, oh, oh, oh.

1220
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
It kind of did what we did.

1221
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,600
You've got guys together that are super passionate about Linux and open source.

1222
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,040
The real enthusiasts, the people that follow this stuff as a part of their passion.

1223
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,280
You work on it during your day job, then you go home and you work on it, and you read about

1224
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,920
it during the weekends, and you talk about it with your friends online, and you argue

1225
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,920
about it in chat rooms.

1226
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,920
Hobby turned life.

1227
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Yeah.

1228
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
That's these guys.

1229
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
And they went out and they created the Linux Academy platform.

1230
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,800
They got developers and educators together to create something they're truly passionate

1231
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
about.

1232
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,200
And I love that, because that sets them apart.

1233
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,160
That means the content they produce is genuine.

1234
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,600
It's from real people who are passionate about this stuff, just like the Jupyter Broadcasting

1235
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,600
Network.

1236
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,960
And they're updated.

1237
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,600
And they follow the trends, too, because they're following this stuff constantly.

1238
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,780
Yes, very much.

1239
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,080
And they also get that Linux users have specific requirements that some of the average generalized

1240
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,640
education sites that cover everything from kitchen sinks to Adobe After Effects don't

1241
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
care about.

1242
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,420
Like, for example, over at Linux Academy, you get seven-plus Linux distributions to

1243
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,420
choose from.

1244
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,160
They automatically adjust the courseware to those distributions.

1245
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,960
And I think this is super smart, is they throw in virtual machines that match the courseware

1246
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
with that.

1247
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
And those virtual machines match the distribution you chose for the courseware.

1248
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,600
And of course, that's the kind of thing Linux users care about.

1249
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,440
And of course, they're going to give you a remote SSH login.

1250
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Of course, they're going to do that.

1251
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
They get you.

1252
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,600
They also have launched new courseware all the time, like new Red Hat certified courses

1253
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,000
that are great if you're going to go get your Red Hat certifications.

1254
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,800
They got Nuggets to help you deep dive on a single topic and get in and out in a couple

1255
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,120
of hours if you need.

1256
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,840
And anything, really, from two minutes to 60 minutes.

1257
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,000
It's great types of content that really help you take it up to the next level.

1258
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,700
Instructor help is always available.

1259
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,760
They have really good AWS courses out there, some of the best in the business.

1260
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,360
In fact, they just were awarded for some of their AWS content.

1261
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,080
And I also think you've got to go, if you've been a member now for a while, you've got

1262
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,160
to at least get a little interest in their Founder's Club.

1263
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,480
It's kind of like what we can offer for patrons.

1264
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,640
They have Founder's Club where they get to vote on new content, get beta access to things,

1265
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,780
help troubleshoot anything you find in the courseware through that Founder's Club.

1266
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,280
It's a great way, if you're really passionate about Linux Academy, to help them take it

1267
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,780
up a little bit to the next level.

1268
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,380
They launch new courseware all the time, so do this.

1269
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,800
And we have a great discount if you do this.

1270
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,480
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1271
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,720
You'll get our 33% discount when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1272
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,880
Buy them out for a little while, try out some of the courseware, take a few different courses,

1273
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,440
the self-paced labs, select your availability for how much coursework you have, and they'll

1274
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,720
set up a courseware based around your availability.

1275
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,600
It's really, really good stuff.

1276
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,920
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1277
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,960
Get our 33% discount.

1278
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,300
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

1279
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,300
You ready to see this video?

1280
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,300
Yeah.

1281
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Okay.

1282
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,040
So maybe Poppy might already have seen this.

1283
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,880
You know, Poppy, he's hooked in over there at the Canonical HQ.

1284
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,600
But this is Mark Shalterworth up on stage, and he's introducing a new device, a new category

1285
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,920
device that runs Ubuntu Snappy, and he wants to see if this guy can figure it out.

1286
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,680
You're just going to tell us what you see.

1287
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Okay.

1288
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Okay?

1289
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Yeah.

1290
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
You ready?

1291
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,680
Yeah.

1292
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,680
All right.

1293
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,680
Let's go.

1294
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,680
I can tell you what it is by the sound of it.

1295
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
I can tell what it is by the sound of it.

1296
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,680
Doesn't that sound like our closet?

1297
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
Yes.

1298
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,680
Come around.

1299
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
Come around.

1300
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,680
Look from this side.

1301
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,680
You have to look from every angle.

1302
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,360
The guy's checking it out.

1303
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
He's getting up close.

1304
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
I'm gassy.

1305
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,840
You know, like a blade server.

1306
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
A blade server.

1307
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
He's like a blade server.

1308
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Yes.

1309
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
With all of these port thingies in the front.

1310
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Yeah, with all these ports.

1311
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Really?

1312
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Okay.

1313
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
So.

1314
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Anybody want to help him out?

1315
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,840
A switch?

1316
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,840
A switch?

1317
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
A switch.

1318
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
What do you think?

1319
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Switch.

1320
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Okay.

1321
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
You think it's a switch?

1322
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Okay.

1323
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Okay.

1324
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Look close.

1325
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Okay.

1326
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Okay.

1327
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:58,240
Yes, it's a switch.

1328
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,720
With a lot of connecting there.

1329
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,720
Yes.

1330
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
I mean, the port.

1331
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
It's a switch.

1332
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
So it's sort of a trick question.

1333
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,720
Not really.

1334
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,440
But you did exactly the right thing.

1335
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,440
It's a switch, right?

1336
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Okay.

1337
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Thank you very much.

1338
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
You're welcome.

1339
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,440
And he's exactly right.

1340
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
He's exactly right.

1341
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,880
It is a switch.

1342
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,000
And to prove it, here is the software running on that switch, right?

1343
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,480
It's a switch with switch control software.

1344
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:39,280
Except the switch is actually running the new version of Ubuntu called Snappy Ubuntu

1345
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
Core.

1346
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,200
And it's not just running switch control software.

1347
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,760
It's also running this.

1348
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:56,360
It's running something from Miracura, which is a software-defined networking solution.

1349
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,400
So there you go.

1350
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Quite a package.

1351
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,480
You've got a switch that runs Ubuntu with all of the benefits and features thereof,

1352
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,480
a full-fledged operating system with management GUIs and things like that.

1353
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,360
And also, Mark Shuttleworth talked about all other kinds of devices.

1354
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
We've seen fridges.

1355
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,360
What do you think, And?

1356
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,560
You're going to have Linux on everything in the house one day.

1357
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,080
Everything from your fridge to the hardware that runs the house.

1358
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,240
I think they could have used a quieter device.

1359
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,040
That was pretty annoying, wasn't it?

1360
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,640
It does sound exactly like our closet, which I would also like to be replaced sometime

1361
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
soon.

1362
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
Yes, I know you would.

1363
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Yes, thank you, honey.

1364
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,640
I know.

1365
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,480
Guys, any thoughts on Canonical's efforts on the Internet of Things and these embedded

1366
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
devices?

1367
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,880
You think this is going to be the next big frontier for them?

1368
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Nothing.

1369
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Hold on.

1370
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Hold on.

1371
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
Let me get the right.

1372
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Hold on.

1373
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Hold on.

1374
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Let me get the...

1375
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
I got it here.

1376
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Hold on.

1377
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
I know what I need.

1378
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,880
There we go.

1379
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
Nobody has any comments on the story?

1380
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
All right.

1381
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
We'll move on then.

1382
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
Yeah.

1383
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
It's basically Noah's house.

1384
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,880
Exactly, Micah.

1385
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880
Exactly.

1386
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,880
That's what Micah says in the chat room.

1387
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
He says, basically, it's Noah's house.

1388
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
PF...

1389
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
We have PF Sense and a switch in our closet.

1390
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Yeah.

1391
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Yeah.

1392
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
I think it's a fascinating move.

1393
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,880
I love it.

1394
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,880
I love the idea of everything running on Ubuntu.

1395
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,480
If you could have a network, just to picture it, your servers, your desktops, your switches,

1396
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,680
your routers, it could be a disaster.

1397
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,960
But the idea seems fascinating to me.

1398
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,900
And so Canonical has a whole page up about all this over on their site.

1399
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,900
You can go find it.

1400
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,040
I have it linked in the show notes if you guys want to read more.

1401
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
They talk about critical infrastructure devices.

1402
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,640
They even talk about robots on the page and appliances like door locks and whatnot and

1403
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
drones too.

1404
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
Cool.

1405
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,640
Yeah.

1406
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,640
The whole range of stuff.

1407
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Go check it out.

1408
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,640
I would cry.

1409
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,520
Wimpy, you think it's useful for home automation and routers like Ubuntu Snappy on these Linksys-type

1410
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,520
devices?

1411
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
Not necessarily.

1412
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:53,840
Well, it probably is suitable for home automation, but I'm more thinking about the consumer grade

1413
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,920
wireless routers and broadband routers that once they go out the door, they get updates

1414
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,800
for a few months and then never again.

1415
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:11,440
And Snappy Core does provide a mechanism of patching the underlying OS without breaking

1416
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,440
the whole system.

1417
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:18,400
So it will be interesting to see if it gets adopted by the likes of TP Link and organizations

1418
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,120
like that as the basis for their consumer products.

1419
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,440
Is TP Link and Linksys a problem been that the operating system is hard to update or

1420
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,160
is it just been that the vendor lacks the will to do it?

1421
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,040
Like it's just not their business priority.

1422
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,460
Yeah, that's true.

1423
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,840
But Snappy Core removes some of that complexity because the base operating system is taken

1424
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,720
care of for you by Canonical.

1425
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,720
Fair point.

1426
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,720
Fair point.

1427
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
I would love to see that work out.

1428
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,920
I think that's a major problem we have with all these devices connected and we've talked

1429
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,940
about this on last week's episode of TechSnap a little bit, is that we were pushing out

1430
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,960
all these devices that run operating systems and we still haven't patched.

1431
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,240
We still haven't figured out the last round, like all these routers and all that things.

1432
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,960
I have so many vulnerabilities that we've talked a lot about in TechSnap.

1433
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,240
I don't have much more.

1434
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
We have a thread.

1435
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
I think I'll keep it for the post-show.

1436
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,400
Matthew, thanks for joining us on Unplugged today.

1437
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
It was good to have you here.

1438
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,920
There's a link to the Fedora project and your page, so folks can find that.

1439
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,560
Anywhere else you want to send people to?

1440
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,560
Get fedora.org.

1441
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,040
Is that what you are linking to?

1442
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
Ah, yes.

1443
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,520
No, I will link to that as well.

1444
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
Get fedora.org.

1445
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,520
Yes, of course.

1446
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,520
Thank you, sir.

1447
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,160
Sort of the download brochure page.

1448
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,840
If you're an old school familiar with Fedora, it's probably not where you want to land,

1449
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,520
but for new users and just kind of like showing somebody what's available and what you need

1450
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,240
to start with, that's kind of the place to go.

1451
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,360
And it's where you go to download it, of course.

1452
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,360
Yeah.

1453
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,360
Excellent.

1454
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,360
I love it.

1455
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
I will add that to our show notes.

1456
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
Episode 96 is in the can.

1457
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,160
If you have any comments, go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1458
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,520
There will be a feedback thread in there.

1459
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,360
And you can also join us next Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1460
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,840
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time.

1461
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,280
And thanks for joining me.

1462
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,280
Do you want to plug anything?

1464
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,680
Like Jupiter Signal, at Jupiter Signal on Twitter?

1465
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,560
Yes, but also Women's Tech Radio with Shannon tomorrow.

1466
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,560
Shannon Morris.

1467
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,560
Mm-hmm.

1468
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,560
Snubs will be on Women's Tech Radio tomorrow.

1469
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,560
It'll be out in the morning.

1470
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
Yep.

1471
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
Check that out at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1472
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,560
Yeah, that's a good one.

1473
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
Yeah.

1474
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
All right, everybody.

1475
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,560
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1476
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,120
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1477
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,120
Cool.

1478
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,120
Thanks for having me.

1479
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:34,360
Thanks for having me.

1480
01:01:34,360 --> 01:02:01,680
All right, we're all done.

1481
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,680
We're all out.

1482
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,680
Good show.

1483
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,680
That was good.

1484
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,680
Ah, Fujino missed it.

1485
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,680
Aw.

1486
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,480
And he was particularly interested in my advancement in Linux.

1487
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,160
Well, he'll have to get it on download, unfortunately.

1488
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,880
Hey, I go to JB Titles.

1489
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,880
It's called Go Boat.

1490
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,600
And then I wanted to share this thread that was in the subreddit with you guys about distro

1491
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,600
hopping.

1492
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,600
Let's go boat.

1493
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,600
Everybody go boat.

1494
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,600
JBtitles.com.

1495
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Source forgery, that's not bad.

1496
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Fedora's fabulous fapping fad.

1497
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
No.

1498
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,600
It's literate.

1499
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,600
I'll give you that.

1500
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,600
I know.

1501
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,440
I can always count on the internet to pick up my...

1502
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,640
Yes, you can.

1503
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,200
I do like having something with Fedora in there.

1504
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,840
All right, so here is the distro hopping thread from Last Feedback.

1505
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,440
I wanted to put this in here because I feel like he created this account just to give

1506
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,560
us feedback because this account is called Last Feedback.

1507
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,080
It says, in my humble small role, I notice a lot of people hop to various distros.

1508
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,080
Some consider it good.

1509
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,120
Some consider it a fault of Linux community, fragmentation, et cetera.

1510
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Here's my thoughts on why people could be hopping distros.

1511
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,920
Number one, I think noobs are attracted to Linux, read articles, have opinionated friends,

1512
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,920
and give them initial thoughts.

1513
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,580
When this happens, their decisions, opinions are vastly influenced by media, FUD, et cetera.

1514
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:05,280
For a noob, there's no difference between Etsy, Init RD, Upstart, or System D. It just

1515
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,640
requires somebody telling them the sky is falling.

1516
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:14,040
I think number two, first and foremost, is about being comfortable with the base installation

1517
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,860
config files, package management, the desktop.

1518
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,440
Those who attain certain level of power users capability don't need to hop distros.

1519
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,040
Now I also, I would branch off this and say one of the reasons I hop distros early on

1520
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,680
is I would find one distro had one set of tools.

1521
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
I like to do one task.

1522
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,360
A different distro would have a different set of tools to do another task.

1523
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,200
He says, not every distro is suitable for everyday users.

1524
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,720
Distros specialize on certain specific aspects of a workflow.

1525
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

1526
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,600
A given user coming from, say, Windows or Mac may not be accustomed to these workflows.

1527
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,880
But I really like some of the points that were made in the subreddit thread following.

1528
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,040
He says, so Rob said, he says, I don't think distro hopping is limited to new users.

1529
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:52,040
I think it's a different kind of distro hopping for new users than for experienced users.

1530
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,800
Aha, I completely agree with that one.

1531
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,040
P4 or P3R says, we should try to funnel users to specific distros like Ubuntu or Mint for

1532
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
new users.

1533
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,040
Or Fedora.

1534
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Or Fedora.

1535
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,040
That's right.

1536
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,360
Yeah, so it was a good thread.

1537
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,920
Or try to figure out what that person is trying to achieve instead of like shoe hoarding them

1538
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,040
into Ubuntu or Mint strictly saying, okay, what are you doing?

1539
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,600
What do you want to achieve?

1540
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:24,680
And see how you can try to understand their needs and point them to the right desktop.

1541
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,960
Desktop environment or distro for them instead.

1542
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,960
Sun Sol, go ahead.

1543
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:30,960
You can talk.

1544
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,960
We're after the show.

1545
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,440
Hey, so in terms of like distro hopping.

1546
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,720
So in my experience with distro hopping, I do it for terms of accessibility.

1547
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,040
I'm a blind Linux user.

1548
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,480
So I look to see accessibility as a key factor in how distributions work.

1549
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,520
So Fedora is one of those accessibility that I look at.

1550
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,080
And some other distros like Arch as well.

1551
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,080
Yeah, I like that.

1552
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,080
That makes a lot of sense.

1553
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,400
I'm going to up Fedora's bright future.

1554
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,400
I like that one.

1555
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,760
Yeah, the accessibility thing could be a big driver.

1556
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,760
That makes a lot of sense.

1557
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Yeah, I'm glad.

1558
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,400
I know there's been a lot of effort in GNOME for that.

1559
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,200
So I'm glad that's working for you.

1560
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,560
Yeah, I actually do some of the bug reporting and trying to get some of that stuff improved.

1561
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,040
Awesome.

1562
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,040
Ange learns to tweak.

1563
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
That's not bad.

1564
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,800
What do you think of that one?

1565
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
Ange learns to tweak.

1566
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
That's awesome.

1567
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,240
Source Forgery is going at the top.

1568
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,240
But I like it.

1569
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,240
It's clever.

1570
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,200
But I feel like we should probably spend more time on Fedora in the title because that's

1571
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,760
kind of more what was sort of mentioned throughout the whole episode.

1572
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm liking Fedora's bright future by Odyssey Westroad.

1573
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,720
I like that one.

1574
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Yeah, I bet.

1575
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Yeah.

1576
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Linux undressed.

1577
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,720
What?

1578
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,720
Oh, geez.

1579
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,720
It looks familiar.

1580
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Evolving Fedora.

1581
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,720
Trick or treat Fedora 23.

1582
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,720
We should save that for when it comes out.

1583
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,720
Yeah.

1584
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,720
That's a good title for when it comes out.

1585
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,720
They're spooky goings on.

1586
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,720
What did FAD stand for again?

1587
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,720
What's that?

1588
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,120
What did FAD stand for again?

1589
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,040
Fedora Activity Day.

1590
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,600
Fedora Activity Program.

1591
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
Day.

1592
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Promotion is what I suggested.

1593
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Yeah.

1594
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Day.

1595
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Day is what we're going with there.

1596
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Day.

1597
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Day.

1598
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,200
It's one of the things that we spend out of our community budget for, to bring people

1599
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
together.

1600
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Oh, so you pay.

1601
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
It could be Fedora Activity Pay.

1602
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
Uh-huh.

1603
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Uh-huh.

1604
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,200
I see a focus.

1605
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Letter choices.

1606
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:20,280
I see a focus.
