WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
You guys have you guys noticed that if you watch

00:03.200 --> 00:08.160
The show in VLC or MP at do with a watching MPV actually don't watch it in VLC

00:08.280 --> 00:12.340
Have you noticed that if you watch the show in MPV like the RTSP stream like?

00:13.400 --> 00:15.880
It's like a two second delay versus the flash player

00:15.880 --> 00:17.120
Which is like a seven second delay

00:17.120 --> 00:21.120
So if you want to interact with me in the chat room and you want me to be able to read you like you want to

00:21.120 --> 00:23.040
Be able to respond a lot really fast and stuff

00:23.040 --> 00:27.980
Maybe this is how JB Hawk a truth gets all the best titles if you watch the RTSP stream like an MPV

00:27.980 --> 00:29.980
You just have to have a good connection

00:30.680 --> 00:34.360
Yeah, I'm a con. I think it's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:35.160 --> 00:37.160
Yeah

00:38.600 --> 00:42.480
Yeah, yeah, I've been so burned by my s6 this last couple of weeks oh

00:46.240 --> 00:49.460
Man don't give me you're good trying to get you are trying to get me into a rant

00:49.460 --> 00:53.800
I am a con that's what you were trying to do you are trying to get me into a rant look at him oh

00:53.800 --> 00:55.800
Oh

00:56.680 --> 01:02.500
Man go ahead go ahead API. I want to hear that or aka Andy

01:03.580 --> 01:10.860
Okay, thanks, so does we'll see support the RTSP protocol. I am using RTMP for the moment

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
VLC is great. Yeah, VLC is good, too

01:14.720 --> 01:16.720
MPV is just a little better and

01:16.720 --> 01:22.280
And you are right about the delay, I think it does have a little

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
But I haven't measured it I

01:30.760 --> 01:35.520
MPV one of the things I liked about MPV is I was watching the stream once and I had it in guake

01:35.520 --> 01:39.440
I had I just did MPV on the command line MPV, and I pasted in the URL of the stream

01:39.440 --> 01:43.000
And I watched MPV as is like this is the codec

01:43.000 --> 01:46.380
This is and you know you just see all the cool nerdy output on the on the command line

01:46.380 --> 01:48.380
and I

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
noticed it started saying something and

01:51.160 --> 01:54.240
Then I when it when I read what it said I from that moment forward

01:54.240 --> 01:58.520
I knew I would never use another desktop application to do live streaming and

01:59.160 --> 02:01.160
it said

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
lip-sync mismatch detected

02:03.720 --> 02:10.620
Automatically correcting and it automatically delayed either. I can't remember who's the audio or the video just enough. How did it detect that I?

02:11.760 --> 02:13.760
Don't know I don't know

02:13.760 --> 02:19.640
But it fixed it for me automatically right there on the fly, and I thought to myself

02:21.560 --> 02:27.880
Brilliant people wrote this this software was written by brilliant people and your MPV is it's got a lot of legacy to it

02:27.880 --> 02:31.240
And it so it's got a good hit, and I thought this is the application

02:31.240 --> 02:34.640
I have noticed now as somebody who watches a lot of live streams

02:35.120 --> 02:39.560
I'm a cord cut. I don't have cable television, so I consume a ton of content

02:39.560 --> 02:46.200
Over live streams, and I have I have squirreled out some of the bet like I have found the RTSP streams at some of the

02:46.200 --> 02:51.400
Internal networks used to send content around to each other like I probably I can't really say this

02:51.400 --> 02:56.040
But I had a recent live coverage of a big tech event that I put out for our patrons

02:56.040 --> 03:00.680
And I got the master feed that they were sending out to all of their endpoint stores

03:00.680 --> 03:06.960
And I've got this whole stash of RTSP feeds that I use to watch shows and and and get content and get news and I

03:06.960 --> 03:13.600
Tell you what VLC is very very good VLC is amazing for like capturing and recording and doing streaming converting and VLC is like one

03:13.600 --> 03:17.440
Of my favorite applications on the Linux desktop, but if I'm just watching a live stream

03:18.360 --> 03:20.360
Nothing beats MPV

03:20.360 --> 03:38.440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 96 for June 16th 2015

03:39.080 --> 03:43.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's mocking the Concrud

03:44.120 --> 03:49.480
From afar my name is Chris and 96 is gonna be a packed episode for you guys

03:49.480 --> 03:51.480
I am super excited I

03:51.840 --> 03:58.320
Love this about the Linux Unplugged program our connection to the community and and really how crucial is that to open source?

03:58.320 --> 04:02.520
That's what we're talking about today in episode 96. We're gonna get an update from the open tech conference

04:02.520 --> 04:05.040
that was across the pond this weekend and then I

04:06.800 --> 04:12.420
Scoured through all of the live footage from self this weekend, and I found an amazing chat

04:12.960 --> 04:18.520
That our Noah had with a contributor to open source comm mr. Semiotic robotic

04:18.520 --> 04:21.840
You may have heard of him before they had a great chat on the live stream

04:21.840 --> 04:26.080
It was like a 45-minute chat. I paired it down to the best of it. We're gonna play that then

04:26.760 --> 04:29.000
We're gonna meet one of the authors of the

04:29.600 --> 04:35.420
Really the man who wrote the book on slackware mr. Alan Hicks will be on the show today to talk about his impressions of

04:35.560 --> 04:41.680
Southeast Linux fest and the kind of fest it is and why that's so critical to how open source software is made and how he'd

04:41.680 --> 04:46.620
Take the lessons learned from these fest and applies them to his job as a system administrator, but first before all of that

04:46.620 --> 04:47.620
before

04:47.620 --> 04:51.900
All of that we're gonna get to some feedback and some updates that have occurred somehow

04:52.500 --> 04:59.640
Between Sunday's show the Linux action show and Tuesday's episode of Linux unplug if you can believe it or not somehow news is actually

04:59.980 --> 05:01.980
transpired between now and then and

05:02.980 --> 05:09.620
Unfortunately, it's actually huge news that probably impacts a large large majority of the Jupiter broadcasting audience

05:09.620 --> 05:15.540
So before we dig into this first story, let's bring them over so that way we can all commiserate together time appropriate greetings

05:15.540 --> 05:17.540
my virtual hug

05:20.340 --> 05:22.700
Okay, so I'm just I

05:23.260 --> 05:28.780
Apologize if you happen to be one of those listeners who happens to catch a lot of the Jupiter Jupiter broadcasting shows

05:28.780 --> 05:31.060
I hope you don't get burned out on this topic

05:31.060 --> 05:36.300
But I feel like it's a public service announcement that we cover this on all of the shows and I know it impacts a lot

05:36.300 --> 05:37.980
Of us right here on this show

05:37.980 --> 05:44.380
This week last pass announced that their services were compromised your individual passwords were not compromised

05:44.380 --> 05:48.180
But potentially the salted database has been you know

05:49.180 --> 05:52.960
Encrypted like a hundred thousand times over has been stolen of your master password

05:53.420 --> 05:56.420
Email reminders about when your passwords expire

05:56.420 --> 06:01.260
Which kind of is sort of an important bit of information for an attacker to use and other bits of information

06:01.540 --> 06:06.220
Have been revealed and last pass is advising that everyone change their master password

06:06.220 --> 06:10.860
And if you do not have two-factor authentication, if you do not have two-factor authentication turn that s on

06:10.860 --> 06:12.860
And now I

06:13.580 --> 06:21.020
Have been a pretty big proponent of last pass and I I fully acknowledge that our open-source alternatives to last pass. I maintain

06:21.900 --> 06:26.380
That the convenience of last pass if you I should back up

06:27.780 --> 06:32.700
Security is always a compromise between convenience and practicality and and unfortunately

06:33.340 --> 06:34.940
Having a password for every different service

06:34.940 --> 06:42.100
Having a password for every different service I use is a very hard thing to actually pull off in practicality when I have a studio

06:42.100 --> 06:47.620
And a house and I move around a lot and I have multiple offices and I have different computers

06:47.620 --> 06:50.340
And I don't keep everything synced having a cloud-based service

06:51.780 --> 06:53.780
While inherently risky

06:54.300 --> 06:56.740
has an inherent value to it and

06:57.180 --> 07:04.280
To me last pass sort of walks that sweet spot where I have local encryption. It's available on my Android device

07:04.280 --> 07:08.340
It's available on an iOS device. It's available in my browser. It's available on the web

07:10.340 --> 07:15.300
So I have advocated for last pass a lot and I've even done specials on last pass

07:16.300 --> 07:20.320
And I wonder now and I want to bring this so I want to I want to turn this over to the mumble room

07:20.820 --> 07:25.580
When you hear about something like this, do you think all right? This is it. This is another proprietary service

07:25.580 --> 07:27.580
I can never use I can only use an open-source solution

07:27.580 --> 07:33.460
I'll start I'll start with Popey because I I know Popey's here. I just talked to him Popey

07:33.460 --> 07:36.140
Does this to you? Is this is last pass dead to you?

07:36.140 --> 07:39.500
Are you gonna switch to key paths forever or does this reinforce your belief? Oh

07:40.220 --> 07:45.420
So the frustration for me is the reason I switched to last pass was when Gorka was hacked four years ago

07:45.420 --> 07:50.940
And I and I realized that I reuse the same password in a bunch of places. You know, that's my story too, right?

07:50.940 --> 07:52.940
You know, that's my story

07:52.940 --> 07:57.580
Exactly it. Yeah, so I switched the last pass and I thought yeah

07:57.580 --> 08:03.980
this is the least worst option for me that enables me to have the convenience of having my password filled in when I need to and

08:04.660 --> 08:05.980
my

08:05.980 --> 08:08.100
feeling of security that the

08:09.420 --> 08:16.020
Security file the password file is in unencrypted on my local machine and it re-encrypted on my local machine with my master password

08:16.020 --> 08:21.500
Which is really long and I never use anywhere else. It's like I learned my lesson. I'm using that one password. So

08:21.500 --> 08:23.640
Part of me thinks, you know

08:24.260 --> 08:29.340
This is a problem and I should jump ship and go and use something open-source and only store on my own computer

08:29.340 --> 08:30.380
But then who am I kidding?

08:30.380 --> 08:36.420
I'm already using like Gmail and Facebook and Twitter and I'm already using other people's computers. This is just yet another thing and

08:37.780 --> 08:39.780
I checked with our

08:39.820 --> 08:42.700
internal is people and because we

08:43.180 --> 08:48.260
We canonical use it as well. So, you know, I actually have two accounts. I have my personal account

08:48.260 --> 08:53.780
I work out there and I check with them and their opinion was not that you know, everyone should you know

08:53.780 --> 08:59.620
Nuke the world and go some good do something else. So I trust them. So I stick with it

08:59.620 --> 09:05.260
I set up two-factor authentication there. Yes, right and and and can I add something to that and and this is of course

09:05.820 --> 09:07.820
hindsight, right etc, etc

09:08.100 --> 09:10.100
but I would say

09:10.500 --> 09:15.580
This is here's the lesson. I have learned going forward from this last pass breach. I

09:15.580 --> 09:22.940
Will no longer wait for a notification on a blog from the company telling me I should change my password

09:23.180 --> 09:27.480
I'm going to set a reminder in my calendar to just change my master password from time to time

09:28.140 --> 09:30.420
And I recommend to you do not wait

09:31.380 --> 09:33.540
Do not wait for them to get hacked

09:34.340 --> 09:41.220
Turn on two-factor authentication now change your master password every three months. Why not? I mean really is it that actually?

09:41.220 --> 09:47.820
When I when I went to the dialogue to change my master password, it said your master password was last changed

09:48.820 --> 09:50.220
1502 days ago

09:50.220 --> 09:51.820
I'm not gonna lie

09:51.820 --> 09:59.060
Bopey I won't lie. I actually have a little sentimental attachment to my master password because it is a paragraph

09:59.060 --> 10:05.300
I came up with a long time ago like before I really truly understood computer security

10:05.300 --> 10:10.600
I thought to myself well geez a paragraph seems like a much better idea than a six center six six

10:10.600 --> 10:12.000
character six character password

10:12.000 --> 10:18.240
And I can remember a paragraph and so I wrote a little paragraph in my mind that I have been able to recite for

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
the last 15 years and

10:20.600 --> 10:27.780
I I have zero zero zero worries that anybody will ever guess what it is because there's a completely nonsensical paragraph

10:27.780 --> 10:34.320
It doesn't make any sense and I came up with it, and I love it, and I'm I'm going to go change it

10:34.320 --> 10:39.320
Um I know that sounds weird, but I'm attached to it. Yeah

10:40.360 --> 10:44.120
Full stop on the end. You really only have to change it by one character

10:44.120 --> 10:48.520
So you can add buffers to the beginning and end and there you go one two three

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
So of course

10:52.160 --> 10:54.160
You know keeping our audience in mind

10:54.200 --> 10:59.640
This sort of provokes thoughts of switching the key pass, and I found a thread on hacker news

10:59.640 --> 11:01.840
Oh, did I oh did I grab it let me see oh?

11:01.840 --> 11:04.720
I might not have actually grabbed it for the show notes

11:06.360 --> 11:11.740
As you would expect though the focus has changed now to key pass well now that last pass is no good

11:11.740 --> 11:15.420
And then let's be clear. Let's be totally 100% legit honest

11:15.920 --> 11:18.900
Last pass is a big old target it has

11:19.800 --> 11:24.320
It is really at the target of all targets. It's everybody's password

11:24.360 --> 11:27.480
That's I mean even if you could never crack it like

11:27.480 --> 11:32.000
just the idea of that makes it a target and and by by by

11:32.920 --> 11:38.760
Participating in the last pass service you are participating in what is got to be one of the largest targets on the internet

11:40.200 --> 11:46.280
So you have to have some faith in encryption and the general technology there and and so I don't think it's unreasonable to say

11:46.280 --> 11:48.080
I'm not doing that

11:48.080 --> 11:52.600
That the concept of just how big of a target they are is too much risk for me to assume

11:52.600 --> 11:57.520
I'm not doing that and if and I'm gonna go with key pass, and I don't think that's unreasonable

11:58.240 --> 12:00.600
But I think it is unreasonable to say

12:01.440 --> 12:06.720
Key pass is flawless now. We all respect key pass. We all are thankful

12:07.480 --> 12:12.200
They're making an offline solution. They're making something that actually has a very awesome Firefox

12:12.800 --> 12:18.680
Plugin they're making something that has awesome Android apps they really are making one of the best open source apps in the world

12:18.680 --> 12:24.040
But like all open source applications that can't be flawless because they're created by humans

12:24.040 --> 12:26.240
And there could be a flaw in key pass as well

12:26.240 --> 12:30.640
And so the there is a lesson to be learned globally here for all of us

12:30.640 --> 12:33.320
And I I do not think it is Linux specific

12:33.320 --> 12:36.820
But I think it is super important when so many of our credentials so many things online

12:37.320 --> 12:38.520
I

12:38.520 --> 12:41.600
I can get so easily on a soapbox about this

12:42.440 --> 12:47.260
But whatever the case may be just I would recommend everybody change these master passwords often

12:47.260 --> 12:53.020
Try to keep this try to try to make this the thing that you are actually diligent about

12:54.260 --> 12:57.340
Because going forward these things have a way of getting away from you

12:57.340 --> 13:01.020
So try to make this the thing if you maybe you're lax on backups

13:01.020 --> 13:03.980
Maybe you're lax up on commenting your config file

13:03.980 --> 13:09.780
I don't know what it is, but but of all of the things I plead with you make this the thing that you are diligent about

13:09.780 --> 13:16.780
Because it good password hygiene can is just it's just a little bit of work up front to prevent so much chaos later on

13:16.780 --> 13:22.180
And I'm gonna end with this hashtag watch text now boom. That's all I have to say

13:22.180 --> 13:25.500
I'm an end of topic mumble room anybody have anything. I want to throw them before I finish

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
Yeah, I would like to defend

13:29.500 --> 13:33.500
Last pass in this incident because they actually did act

13:33.500 --> 13:40.500
Responsible and they did act in a timely manner to let their their users know that their data could be compromised

13:41.500 --> 13:45.500
And they give them the tools to lock it down and secure it

13:46.500 --> 13:51.500
Yeah, I mean and the value of this is negative. Here's the thing how many lessons do we need to learn?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
How many times do we need to be taught?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
That we should be that we should have used the open source

13:56.500 --> 14:04.500
Publicly audits audited solution. I do not want to stand here and say put trust trust last pass trust everything with a proprietary solution

14:04.500 --> 14:09.500
Because I mean time after time after time. It feels like

14:10.500 --> 14:15.500
We sit here and we can mock what RMS says but then like three or four or five or six or seven or twenty years

14:15.500 --> 14:18.500
Later turns out dude was right dude was right

14:20.500 --> 14:25.500
The problem is only the really tech savvy people are the ones who are

14:25.500 --> 14:30.500
going to be the ones that are diligent enough to do this right where everybody else is

14:31.500 --> 14:36.500
You know not and yeah, like I'm gonna come was pointing out something earlier this morning

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Open-source is great and all and it could be audited

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
We don't know the last type

14:42.500 --> 14:48.500
Stuff has been audited or bugs have been found and you know, there are people that don't report bugs

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
So, you know

14:49.500 --> 14:56.500
It's still something that boils down to the most responsible tech savvy people are gonna be the ones that are gonna be ahead of this

14:57.500 --> 15:04.500
There is currently a bug floating around the hacker news a kind of a flaw in the dotnet version of key pass and

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
It could potentially expose users

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
now

15:09.500 --> 15:12.500
This audience that doesn't affect you you're using the Linux version

15:12.500 --> 15:16.500
But don't put key pass on some sort of pedestal like the chat room is doing right now

15:16.500 --> 15:21.500
There is today a flaw in key pass and like WW NSX just said in the chat room

15:21.500 --> 15:26.500
There are people that are motivated to exploit these things and I I completely agree

15:26.500 --> 15:31.500
Like I see here and I think just remember it really comes down to your personal responsibility

15:31.500 --> 15:35.500
It is it falls on you. Don't put don't put your faith in an open source project

15:35.500 --> 15:38.500
Don't put your faith in a proprietary project. That's kind of what you're saying, right WW

15:39.500 --> 15:45.500
Yeah, you know you're you're ultimately going to be responsible for your own security. Yes exactly

15:45.500 --> 15:48.500
Yes, Sunsell do you want to expand on that?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.500
Oh

15:49.500 --> 15:55.500
I mean just basically what the video was saying that it really is the user responsible of one's ability about their passwords

15:55.500 --> 16:01.500
You know keeping care of what they do with their passwords and how they manage them because no matter what solution you use

16:01.500 --> 16:06.500
Open-source or proprietary now no matter what or less that you use to manage this stuff. It's still on you

16:06.500 --> 16:11.500
It could be the greatest solution ever and you're not managing your stuff very well. Yeah. Yeah

16:11.500 --> 16:16.500
Yeah, yeah, I agree and Sean PC says that it's made by humans

16:17.500 --> 16:21.500
Right and thus it likely will have flaws wizard. Do you want to add in something here?

16:22.500 --> 16:27.500
Yeah, I just the the one thing that I can you know, I don't want to sound like that

16:27.500 --> 16:31.500
You know part of the mob saying oh, yes, which keep ass but no go ahead there is

16:31.500 --> 16:38.500
Yeah, but there is there is kind of the it is a lot easier to protect key pass than last pass itself

16:38.500 --> 16:42.500
Because at the end of the day, it's like we follow the things we've been falling for

16:42.500 --> 16:47.500
You know as long as we have, you know, you know sandbox applications and you know, make sure you have your firewall

16:47.500 --> 16:51.500
Then you know on because it does use localhost to go and communicate

16:51.500 --> 16:55.500
If you had cover the basics, you should be okay with key pass

16:55.500 --> 17:01.500
It's when you start going outside that it's when you start and you start just kind of giving up on security everywhere

17:01.500 --> 17:05.500
That's when you screw up. Well and wizard I will say to this

17:05.500 --> 17:09.500
Couldn't you make the same argument for Dropbox versus think thing

17:09.500 --> 17:16.500
Think thing is peer-to-peer. It's machine to machine. You don't have to worry about them indexing your files

17:16.500 --> 17:22.500
Submitting the list of your files to the RIAA for DMCA takedown, right? It is machine to machine

17:22.500 --> 17:29.500
There is an inherent advantage to just using key pass in that you are one person

17:29.500 --> 17:36.500
And you have realistically you are not very interesting to the global hacker community

17:36.500 --> 17:40.500
Whereas last pass is a global target

17:40.500 --> 17:46.500
Now all that said, I am not responsible enough. I am not judicious enough

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
I should rephrase this

17:49.500 --> 17:54.500
I care more about my children than I care about good password hygiene

17:54.500 --> 17:59.500
I care more about my children than I care about updating the patches on my home server

17:59.500 --> 18:04.500
I would rather have sex with my wife than manage my passwords

18:04.500 --> 18:08.500
I would rather have a really good rib dinner

18:08.500 --> 18:13.500
I would rather barbecue something that is delicious than manage my passwords

18:13.500 --> 18:19.500
That's my personal choice. I recognize that is not necessarily your choice, the listener

18:19.500 --> 18:25.500
But because that is my list of priorities, because those things become before password hygiene

18:25.500 --> 18:31.500
If I am being completely honest with my audience, those things are more important to me than password hygiene

18:31.500 --> 18:38.500
So for me, last pass is a really great solution because it manages to straddle that sweet spot

18:38.500 --> 18:45.500
Between automation and holding my hand, but yet local encryption, transparency

18:45.500 --> 18:50.500
And empowering me to make the decisions I need to choose if I continue to use the service

18:50.500 --> 18:55.500
And because they check those boxes, I continue to use the service

18:55.500 --> 19:00.500
Because I have to fundamentally believe that it is more important and it is better that I use last pass

19:00.500 --> 19:04.500
With two factor authentication and a great master password

19:04.500 --> 19:13.500
Than it is to potentially botch some local password management solution

19:13.500 --> 19:17.500
So that's where I live. And Rekai comes in, not to mention he says

19:17.500 --> 19:21.500
Why is it safer for me as an unexperienced person, good point

19:21.500 --> 19:26.500
To maintain my own security and hope I do well and trust the people to do this for a full time job

19:26.500 --> 19:30.500
So he is saying, this isn't my job, this is not what I do for a living

19:30.500 --> 19:34.500
But this is what last pass does for a living

19:34.500 --> 19:38.500
Even if they are a target, they know what they are doing while I don't

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
And Rekai is a very smart person

19:41.500 --> 19:46.500
Like if Rekai wanted to put his mind to it, he could create the most ultimate password storage solution

19:46.500 --> 19:51.500
But that is not what he would want, that is not what he chooses to dedicate his time to

19:51.500 --> 19:56.500
And I cannot judge him for that, so he continues to use last pass, as I will

19:56.500 --> 20:02.500
Just as I will not judge you for using key pass or a text file on some Lux encrypted volume

20:02.500 --> 20:06.500
Have at it. I say it works for you? Good for it

20:06.500 --> 20:10.500
I wanted to cover something really quick before we move into a couple of more things

20:10.500 --> 20:13.500
This is the week that we cannot move forward without mentioning

20:15.500 --> 20:17.500
Guard your wallets, it's the Steam sales

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
I have spent some money this week but not actually that much

20:22.500 --> 20:27.500
And Linux underscore gaming on Reddit has had a daily update on some of the best sales

20:27.500 --> 20:31.500
There is a lot of different dynamics to this, so if you are following Tech Talk today you are already hip to all this stuff

20:31.500 --> 20:35.500
But if you have been kind of on the fence about trying out gaming under Linux

20:35.500 --> 20:39.500
Maybe you don't have a great video set up, maybe you are not using the proprietary driver

20:39.500 --> 20:42.500
And you are not sure how well games would work with the free driver

20:42.500 --> 20:51.500
This is a great time to create a Steam account and show Valve that they are not wasting their money

20:51.500 --> 20:54.500
Go in there, go get some of these games for ridiculous discounts

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
Go show these developers that there are Linux users out there

20:57.500 --> 21:03.500
If you have kind of been motivated to show support for the Linux desktop that are not a big gamer

21:03.500 --> 21:05.500
This is a great time to do that

21:05.500 --> 21:09.500
I'm just putting that out there, I'm going to have a link in the show notes, it's the roundup of the best sales

21:09.500 --> 21:12.500
When the sales are happening, it's a thread on Linux gaming

21:12.500 --> 21:15.500
Right now this one is created by Spinner Will

21:15.500 --> 21:18.500
I'm sure Linux Gamecast will have better coverage on this than I can

21:18.500 --> 21:21.500
But they have when the deals end, how much the discount is

21:21.500 --> 21:28.500
They have it in USD, Euros, Canadian funny money, Australian monies and all the other monies too

21:28.500 --> 21:32.500
And I'm mentioning this because if I don't mention it I'll get a hard time

21:32.500 --> 21:35.500
And also, I know some of you are like me

21:35.500 --> 21:41.500
Where sometimes you might buy a product just to show the vendor you appreciate them supporting Linux

21:41.500 --> 21:44.500
And maybe later on you'll enjoy it

21:44.500 --> 21:47.500
This is what the Steam sale is all about

21:47.500 --> 21:54.500
I also, like Waltiff in the chat room, he says I've been waiting for some of these games

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
I bought the ones that are 50% off

21:56.500 --> 22:00.500
I've had a whole bunch in my wishlist for a long time and now I'm going through and collecting them

22:00.500 --> 22:04.500
So I might give away some games on the live stream for this Sunday's Linux Action Show

22:04.500 --> 22:07.500
Tune in live on Sunday and I might give away a few games

22:07.500 --> 22:10.500
Because I've been buying a few on sale that I've wanted for a while

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
And I might not even play them

22:11.500 --> 22:15.500
But one was like a four pack of a game that was normally $40

22:15.500 --> 22:18.500
And I got a four pack for $6.99

22:18.500 --> 22:21.500
What's up? What you got?

22:21.500 --> 22:24.500
So check it out, we have a link to that in the show notes

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
But that's all I have to say on that

22:26.500 --> 22:28.500
That concludes

22:28.500 --> 22:31.500
That concludes the Valve update

22:31.500 --> 22:34.500
Right there

22:34.500 --> 22:39.500
Now I wanted to mention something real nice for Mr. Dominic

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
Coda Radio is...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
Man, what did we just talk about this week?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
Oh, snaps

22:45.500 --> 22:48.500
In fact, I'll save what we talked about

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
But it relates to something we're going to cover a little bit in this show

22:50.500 --> 22:52.500
Coda Radio has been going on for a while now

22:52.500 --> 22:54.500
And Michael Dominic, he's an independent software developer

22:54.500 --> 22:59.500
And he originally launched with a focus on Mac OS and iOS

22:59.500 --> 23:01.500
Pretty understandable, really

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
For somebody who wants to make money

23:03.500 --> 23:07.500
And he has sort of gone through a transition

23:07.500 --> 23:10.500
To pivot and focus on open source and Linux

23:10.500 --> 23:12.500
And he's launched a new company around that

23:12.500 --> 23:13.500
And I just wanted to kind of support that initiative

23:13.500 --> 23:15.500
Because he's one of our friends

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
He's the co-host of Coda Radio

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
And so if you're out there and you need somebody who focuses on things like

23:20.500 --> 23:26.500
Docker, or AngularJS, or Ruby on Rails, or PHP, or Android development

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
And he can still do iOS development, obviously, as well

23:28.500 --> 23:30.500
Or HTML5 stuff

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
Native mobile development

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
Buccaneer Tech is his new company

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
And for JB listeners

23:36.500 --> 23:40.500
I think if you go over there, he's going to give you a free consultation on your project or your business needs

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
So if you've got like a small business that maybe needs an app

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
Or a website

23:44.500 --> 23:47.500
And you'd like to give it to somebody who's trying to support Linux and open source

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
And one of the Jupyter broadcasting communities

23:49.500 --> 23:51.500
You can email him and mention in there

23:51.500 --> 23:53.500
Like say, offer code Sparrow or put that in the subject line

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
Put Sparrow in the subject line, something like that

23:55.500 --> 23:57.500
And he's going to give you like a free consultation

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
And I just wanted to mention this

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
This Buccaneer Tech is his new company

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
And I really wanted to support one of our co-hosts going out and saying

24:02.500 --> 24:03.500
You know what?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.500
I know the big industry trend is iOS and Android

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
And it's all Apple development right now

24:07.500 --> 24:10.500
And Windows 10 apps or whatever the hell they're going to do

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
I mean, yeah

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
I can totally understand why that would be the trend

24:15.500 --> 24:16.500
But instead he's saying

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to carve out a niche

24:18.500 --> 24:20.500
Right here in Linux and open source

24:20.500 --> 24:21.500
I'm going to try to do this

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
And so BuccaneerTech.com

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
Go check that out

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
And use the promo code Sparrow if you want to email him

24:25.500 --> 24:26.500
Just, I don't know

24:26.500 --> 24:28.500
Go over there and do sales at BuccaneerTech.com

24:28.500 --> 24:29.500
And send him an email and say

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
Hey, we want to talk to you guys

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
I just want to give him a mention because

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
You know, he's a friend of our show

24:34.500 --> 24:38.500
And we just got back from Self

24:38.500 --> 24:43.500
And there's so many independent developers out there right now

24:43.500 --> 24:46.500
That are doing the small businesses marketing

24:46.500 --> 24:49.500
And just one of the things I talked about in Coda Radio

24:49.500 --> 24:50.500
That I was hinting at is

24:50.500 --> 24:53.500
I recently attended some small business meetings

24:53.500 --> 24:56.500
One in our local town where the studio is

24:56.500 --> 24:57.500
It's Arlington

24:57.500 --> 25:00.500
And another town that's about 15-20 minutes north of me

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Burlington

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
And I went to both these towns

25:02.500 --> 25:05.500
And I attended some local business referral meetings

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
Business groups

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
Where you can go to see if you want to become a member

25:08.500 --> 25:09.500
If you're a small business owner

25:09.500 --> 25:12.500
And you want to become a member of the small business community

25:12.500 --> 25:14.500
That's not why I went

25:14.500 --> 25:18.500
I specifically went with the intention of trying to get show content out of it

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
And I wanted to get a feel for like

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
What kind of proprietary solutions are they using?

25:22.500 --> 25:25.500
Who's developing their websites and their applications?

25:25.500 --> 25:27.500
And I just wanted to get a feel for like super local businesses

25:27.500 --> 25:30.500
How are they getting technology solutions?

25:30.500 --> 25:33.500
And for the most part

25:33.500 --> 25:36.500
You know, a lot of it was Linux based

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
Wordpress based

25:38.500 --> 25:40.500
And things like that

25:40.500 --> 25:43.500
And I was pretty stoked by that

25:43.500 --> 25:47.500
However

25:47.500 --> 25:50.500
The second meeting I went to

25:50.500 --> 25:53.500
They had a guy from Microsoft show up

25:53.500 --> 25:57.500
And he did a presentation on why Windows 10 is going to be great for their business

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
I couldn't even

25:59.500 --> 26:01.500
I had to laugh

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
Like the guy shows up and we're at a restaurant

26:03.500 --> 26:06.500
So they're having this business meeting at a restaurant

26:06.500 --> 26:10.500
And because this is something they do on a weekly basis

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
There's like six things you can order

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
So I get like this

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
Pecan crusted chicken salad

26:16.500 --> 26:18.500
And I've ordered this pecan crusted chicken salad

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
And I see on the agenda

26:20.500 --> 26:22.500
Windows 10 for your business

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
Okay, I'm already like

26:24.500 --> 26:26.500
I'm thinking to myself

26:26.500 --> 26:30.500
Chris, you have a couple of options here

26:30.500 --> 26:34.500
You can just sit here and listen to what this guy has to say

26:34.500 --> 26:37.500
Or you can stand up

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
And go into show mode

26:39.500 --> 26:41.500
And give a Linux pitch

26:41.500 --> 26:43.500
And I didn't know which way I was going to go

26:43.500 --> 26:45.500
Like literally I sat there and I thought

26:45.500 --> 26:47.500
I kind of got a little nervous

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
Like I didn't have much of an appetite

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
I kind of ate like the pecan crusted off my chicken

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
But I'm like I cannot sit here

26:53.500 --> 26:55.500
And listen to this guy tell these people

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
How Windows 10 is going to help their business when it's not even released yet

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
Like at a moral

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
At my moral core

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
I cannot sit here and listen to this man

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
Tell these people how this proprietary product

27:05.500 --> 27:07.500
Which is not even on the market yet

27:07.500 --> 27:09.500
Is going to help them

27:09.500 --> 27:11.500
And I sat there and I ate my pecan crusted chicken

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
I just ate the edging of it

27:13.500 --> 27:15.500
And the guy didn't show up

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
He no-showed

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
He totally no-showed

27:19.500 --> 27:21.500
And I thought to myself wow, well I was right

27:21.500 --> 27:23.500
So I sat up and I did a little 30 second commercial

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
When he didn't show up

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
And I gave the pitch

27:27.500 --> 27:29.500
For podcasts in general

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
And I advised them to go find a podcast

27:31.500 --> 27:33.500
About your passion

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
And I said if you're a small business

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
And there's about 15 people here

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
That are all like the owners or CEOs

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
Or whatever and I said if you have a problem

27:41.500 --> 27:43.500
Today, if you have a need today

27:43.500 --> 27:45.500
There's probably already

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
A solution out there that somebody else has created

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
For you and I just, I ask you, just do

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
This one, I only had 30 seconds, I only had

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
30 seconds you guys, I said do this

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
Google it

27:55.500 --> 27:57.500
Google the solution

27:57.500 --> 27:59.500
Before you pay for something there may be a free

27:59.500 --> 28:01.500
And open source package that can do it for you

28:01.500 --> 28:03.500
And that's all I could say

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
And that's all I could get in

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
And that was one of the two meetings I went to

28:07.500 --> 28:09.500
And the second meeting

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
I was like I was all fired up and now I don't know if I'm going to go to another one

28:11.500 --> 28:13.500
I'm not sure yet, but Kits and Kitty you wanted to jump in here

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
Go ahead

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
Microsoft has always

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
Promised the next

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
Product will be good

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
Anybody remember Object FS?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.500
Right, yes this is the thing

28:25.500 --> 28:27.500
I started to feel like a bit of an anxiety

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
Attack because I'm like this guy cannot

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
Come up here and promise these people the world

28:31.500 --> 28:33.500
Again and again and again like somebody has

28:33.500 --> 28:35.500
To say something

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
That was like

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
That was a serious intense

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
Situation and I wanted to enjoy my salad

28:43.500 --> 28:45.500
But you know

28:45.500 --> 28:47.500
It worked out, it worked out and I got

28:47.500 --> 28:49.500
A good plug in for open source and Linux and for

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
Podcasts in general, so hopefully

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
I think I might well I might

28:53.500 --> 28:55.500
I'm finding good insights when I attend these business

28:55.500 --> 28:57.500
So this is the second one I have attended now

28:57.500 --> 28:59.500
And at first I was like I'm not going to do

28:59.500 --> 29:01.500
This crap, I'm not going to waste my time doing this crap

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
This is stupid, I have better things to do

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
But then listening to

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
Them talk about some of their problems and listening to some of the

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
Things they wanted, how technology can fit in

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
Like a lot of these

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
Meetings have been based about the technology solutions

29:13.500 --> 29:15.500
They're going to use to solve their problems

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
So I may attend another one just to kind of get

29:17.500 --> 29:19.500
Some more insights there

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
Alright well I want to talk to Popey about

29:21.500 --> 29:23.500
The conference that he attended this week, well

29:23.500 --> 29:25.500
Actually before I

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
Before I get too far into that, this is really

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
This is the part where we're going to transition to some great stuff

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
For the show, and I want to thank

29:31.500 --> 29:33.500
First of all, I want to start, let's start with the community

29:33.500 --> 29:35.500
Let's start with Linux Academy

29:35.500 --> 29:37.500
They're from the community, they've created something for the community

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
They're truly Linux enthusiasts

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
And this is, you know, if you go back

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
You look at what, Linux Action Show, it's been around

29:43.500 --> 29:45.500
Now for nine years, which is ridiculous

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
But it's been around now for nine years

29:47.500 --> 29:49.500
But if you go back seven, eight

29:49.500 --> 29:51.500
Years ago

29:51.500 --> 29:53.500
It's rough

29:53.500 --> 29:55.500
It's not so good

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
But the passion and the enthusiasm

29:57.500 --> 29:59.500
What we wanted to accomplish

29:59.500 --> 30:01.500
What we cared about, the enthusiasm

30:01.500 --> 30:03.500
About that, right, like how

30:03.500 --> 30:05.500
How much we wanted to share with you

30:05.500 --> 30:07.500
That was the spark

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
And now looking back at Linux Academy I think

30:09.500 --> 30:11.500
Boy, maybe I should have gone this route

30:11.500 --> 30:13.500
See they had that same spark, they had that same passion

30:13.500 --> 30:15.500
But they went a different route

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
They took the people

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
That were truly passionate about

30:19.500 --> 30:21.500
Open source, Linux

30:21.500 --> 30:23.500
All of the technology around that

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
They met up

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
With developers

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
And educators

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
And they were able to create something

30:31.500 --> 30:33.500
Really unique, just for the Linux

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
Audience

30:35.500 --> 30:37.500
There's other educational sites out there

30:37.500 --> 30:39.500
That'll teach you everything, I mean really

30:39.500 --> 30:41.500
They promise everything

30:41.500 --> 30:43.500
From how to build a rocket

30:43.500 --> 30:45.500
To how to

30:45.500 --> 30:47.500
How to edit something in Adobe After Effects

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
I mean they really, they promise everything

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
Not Linux Academy

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
They don't promise

30:53.500 --> 30:55.500
They promise everything

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
They promise

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
To focus on Linux and the best technologies

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
Around Linux

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
They promise to focus on the things

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
That'll make you more employable

31:05.500 --> 31:07.500
To make you better at your job

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
To scratch your educational itch

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
To challenge your mind

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
That's what they focus on, that's Linux Academy

31:13.500 --> 31:15.500
They have self paced courses

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
You can go in there and see how much time is available

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
How long it's going to take, and you can tell

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
Linux Academy, I've got this much time available

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
On a Monday, I've got this much time available

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
On a Wednesday, you want to base your

31:25.500 --> 31:27.500
Educational courses around when we're not live

31:27.500 --> 31:29.500
You can do that

31:29.500 --> 31:31.500
Linux Academy has self

31:31.500 --> 31:33.500
Setting educational plans, they'll fill

31:33.500 --> 31:35.500
In the gaps with reminders and all of that

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
They have scenario based labs so that way you

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
Work with this technology in the real

31:39.500 --> 31:41.500
World, you get a sense of how to configure

31:41.500 --> 31:43.500
These things, so when you go out there and do it in production

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
It's not the first time you've done that

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
And that little bit of confidence

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
Makes

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
All of the difference

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
As somebody who's been in the industry for a long

31:53.500 --> 31:55.500
Time

31:55.500 --> 31:57.500
When you walk into a place with confidence

31:57.500 --> 31:59.500
When you sit down at a job with confidence

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
Everybody around you

32:01.500 --> 32:03.500
Is reassured, everybody around

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
You feels a little bit more comfortable

32:05.500 --> 32:07.500
Because you're confident

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
That's what scenario based labs do

32:09.500 --> 32:11.500
I want you to go to Linux Academy

32:11.500 --> 32:13.500
Right now, I want you to check them out right now

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
I want you to go to linuxacademy.com

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
Discount, a 33% discount

32:19.500 --> 32:21.500

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
Linuxacademy.com

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
Slash unplug, they have instructor help

32:25.500 --> 32:27.500
Available and I know you're busy

32:27.500 --> 32:29.500
I appreciate you just

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
Listening to this podcast

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
So I want

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
You to use your time wisely

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
And Linux Academy does too

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
That's why they've rolled out nuggets

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
It's a cute name for an awesome

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
Feature, a nugget is

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
A single how to that walks you through a specific

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
Task

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
That make you better at that specific task

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
It doesn't necessarily belong in a big course

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
Or some big hourly multi

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
Hour courseware, it's a lesson

32:55.500 --> 32:57.500
Between 2 and 60 minutes

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
That teaches one specific thing

32:59.500 --> 33:01.500
And you can actually, look at this

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Go to linuxacademy.com

33:03.500 --> 33:05.500
Slash nuggets right now

33:07.500 --> 33:09.500
Create an AWS EBS snapshot

33:09.500 --> 33:11.500
Bash script backup, right there, you need to backup

33:11.500 --> 33:13.500
An AWS machine, I don't have any

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
Freaking idea how I would do that

33:15.500 --> 33:17.500
I tell you what, if I was

33:17.500 --> 33:19.500
Put in the position of being responsible for an

33:19.500 --> 33:21.500
AWS instance, and I

33:21.500 --> 33:23.500
Didn't know how to back it up

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
That might give me some anxiety

33:25.500 --> 33:27.500
That might make me

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
A little stressed out

33:29.500 --> 33:31.500
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
That's the first nugget

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
Right there, and they got a bunch of other great ones

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
Cloning a virtual box VM

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
Building an IP tables firewall

33:39.500 --> 33:41.500
Creating a pixi boot server, what

33:41.500 --> 33:43.500
The hell is active directory

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
How do I have single sign on with linux boxes

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
And windows boxes, these are individual

You guys

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
Seriously, I wish I had a

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
Resource like this when I was in the business, linuxacademy.com

33:59.500 --> 34:01.500
Slash unplugged, and a big thank you

34:01.500 --> 34:03.500
To linuxacademy for sponsoring

34:03.500 --> 34:05.500
The unplugged program, you guys

34:05.500 --> 34:07.500
Keep it up, and keep building that platform out even

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
More and more, alright so

34:09.500 --> 34:11.500
Kitson are you hearing me okay, or is the

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
Mumble room dropping us out, what's going on over there guys

34:13.500 --> 34:15.500
We've had Comcast issues all day

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
Seems good to me

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
Alright, good

34:19.500 --> 34:21.500
For a second there during your pitch

34:21.500 --> 34:23.500
It just dropped you

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
And the lips

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
Weren't red, they were just gray

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
Well good, well then just go to linuxacademy.com

34:29.500 --> 34:31.500
Slash unplugged and you got it all, alright

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
So Mr. Popey is here today

34:33.500 --> 34:35.500
And he, hello

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
Hello Popey, hello, boy

34:37.500 --> 34:39.500
And Corky, I know Corky

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
Couldn't join us today, but he was here earlier this morning

34:41.500 --> 34:43.500
On linux, or I'm sorry, tech talk today

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
And he talked a little bit about OpenTech

34:45.500 --> 34:47.500
2015, but Popey

34:47.500 --> 34:49.500
I couldn't attend it, I wish I could've

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
Attended it, and it sounds like it was a pretty

34:51.500 --> 34:53.500
Fun event, it's been going on for a while

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
Could you recap with the folks that are listening

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
What OpenTech 2015 was, and

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
Anything you want to add in there? Sure

34:59.500 --> 35:01.500
So it's an event that happens

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
Regularly, irregularly

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
It's happened six, seven times over the last

35:05.500 --> 35:07.500
Ten years, and

35:07.500 --> 35:09.500
It's a low cost

35:09.500 --> 35:11.500
Tech event, which

35:11.500 --> 35:13.500
Focuses on what you might

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
Call OpenTech

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
Which covers quite a lot of ground

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
Actually, there was quite a lot of

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
Different talks that covered

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
Vaguely related

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
Topics, but there were also some a little bit

35:27.500 --> 35:29.500
Out there ones as well, I tried

35:29.500 --> 35:31.500
To push myself to go to

35:31.500 --> 35:33.500
Talks that were outside

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
My comfort zone, so rather than go to a talk

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
About Edward Snowden or

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
Something that I kind of know about, I might

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
Go to something else a little bit more weird

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
And there were three tracks

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
So three separate rooms

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
And they were full all day with

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
Various talks, and

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
Yeah, it was good fun, and it was

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
Nice to see some familiar faces there from the

35:53.500 --> 35:55.500
Tech crowd

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
In the UK, I've

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
Made some notes about a few of the more interesting

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
Talks, if you want me to go for a few of them

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Yeah, I do, I guess I'll start with

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
Kind of a basic question, so it doesn't necessarily sound

36:05.500 --> 36:07.500
Like it's a Linux

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
Event per se, but more of a

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
Technology event

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
Anything that's open in technology

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Is that right? Right

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
So people were talking about

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
Getting access to

36:19.500 --> 36:21.500
Your medical data

36:21.500 --> 36:23.500
For example, or preventing

36:23.500 --> 36:25.500
Someone else having access to your medical data

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
Or they were talking about security topics

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
Or privacy topics

36:29.500 --> 36:31.500
Those kind of things that are

36:31.500 --> 36:33.500
Open data, getting access to data

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
From the government, and using data that's been

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
Provided by the government, so those kind of

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
Topics, it wasn't so much open source

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
In fact, it was encouraged

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
For you not to have your laptop out at all

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
And I didn't see many

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
Laptops there at all, because

36:47.500 --> 36:49.500
You know, at some of the conferences, if you

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
Go into a room where a talk is being given, you can see

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
A bunch of people sat around with their heads

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
Down on their laptops tweeting about what's going

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
On, or you know, chatting with friends

36:57.500 --> 36:59.500
Not actually paying attention to what's going on

36:59.500 --> 37:01.500
And here it was very different, people were very

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
Engaged and discussing topics

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
With the presenter, and

37:05.500 --> 37:07.500
Not focused on whatever's going on

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
On their laptop. Interesting, very interesting

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
Now, I

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
Hope I gotta

37:13.500 --> 37:15.500
Ask you, just sort of, if you could just

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
Remove all filters

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
Pretend like you're recording a podcast

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
For the UK audience

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
Is there a

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
Is there a sort of

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
Sense of

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
I'm trying to frame this correctly

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
What is the feeling of

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
Is there a feeling that the American government is overreaching

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
Is there a feeling that let's talk about how to protect

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
Ourselves from the NSA at a conference

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
Like this?

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
Well, that kind of topic

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
Kind of did come up in specific talks

37:43.500 --> 37:45.500
But it wasn't the main focus

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
Of conversation, there were

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
Talks about

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
Privacy on the internet, and

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
You know, Snowden

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
But actually there was more about the European government

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
And the UK government doing

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
Religious things than the US

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
Because we're doing just stupid things over here

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
As the US

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
You know, three letter

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
Organizations are as well

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
It's just as daft here, unfortunately

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
Yeah, interesting

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
But how many people would you say attend this thing?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
It's a good few hundred

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
I don't know, it's not like massive

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
Event, it's just

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
It's not like massive event

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
It's held in a university

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
In London, and it's got a low

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
Barrier to entry as well, it's only five

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
Pound to get in, which is what, seven

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
Eight dollars, something like that

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
And it's

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
In the middle of London, so it's really easy to get to

38:35.500 --> 38:37.500
It's at a university

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
So there's plenty of facilities nearby to get

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
Food and drink at lunchtime and that kind of stuff

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
So yeah, it was

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
Really enjoyable

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
Now, I would love to hear some of your notes about the event itself

38:47.500 --> 38:49.500
So, a couple

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
That stood out for me, one was

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
To give you an idea of the diversity

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
Of the topics

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
That were covered, there was one talk

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
That was called

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
Objects of Intrigue

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
And it was by a woman called

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
Rachel Mote, she's on

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
She's on Twitter as atrachelmote, and she

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
Volunteers at a school

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
For children, specializes in help

39:11.500 --> 39:13.500
For children with special needs, and some of these

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
Children have difficulty doing things

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
Like even feeding themselves

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
Or they have

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
Reluctance to

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
Touch certain surfaces

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
Or

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
Textures

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
There are certain things

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
That they just have difficulty with

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
And what she wanted to do was

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
Help children with their eating

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
And

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
She had out on the stage, she had

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
Three bowls, one of them contained custard

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
One contained water, and one

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
Contained spaghetti, and

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
She's constructed with an

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
Arduino, and a little

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
Speaker, and some

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
Various other components, she's constructed a little

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
Setup that encourages

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
The children to touch these bowls

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
Of food and

39:59.500 --> 40:01.500
Liquid, and they

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
The way she does it is there's a

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
Touch sensor underneath the

40:05.500 --> 40:07.500
Bowl, and when the kids put their hand in the bowl

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
And like touch the custard, or touch

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
The water, it plays music, or plays a

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
Drum sound or something, so they can actually make

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
Music just by putting their hands in

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
These bowls of water, and that might not sound

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
Like a major achievement or a particularly

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Technically advanced thing, but getting these

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
Kids to touch stuff like custard

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
Or spaghetti

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
Or something that they wouldn't normally touch

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
And then when they take their hands out

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
Putting their hands in their mouth and actually eating the

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
Food afterwards is quite an

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
Achievement for a child with special

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
Needs, so that

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
Gives you an example of how someone's using

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
Technology like an Arduino

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
And simple circuitry

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
In order to

40:45.500 --> 40:47.500
Help someone else, and

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
I think she's made the designs and the

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
Details available online, so

40:51.500 --> 40:53.500
It was a really nice

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
Different talk that wasn't just

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
Privacy and tech

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
And nerding out

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
Completely, but there were some

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
Nerdy ones, one of them

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
That I found particularly fun

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
Was there's a hack space in London

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
LHS, London Hack Space

41:09.500 --> 41:11.500
And they've got a caravan

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
Which they've converted

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
Into a spaceship

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
And it's

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
Completely awesome

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
If you imagine being inside a really

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
Really tiny

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
Star Trek Enterprise

41:25.500 --> 41:27.500
Bridge, I love it

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
It's excellent

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
They've got loads of controls, switches

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
And buttons and dials and wires

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
Dangling and stuff, and

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
Everyone's got their own screen and

41:37.500 --> 41:39.500
Their own readout, and then there's a main screen

41:39.500 --> 41:41.500
As well, and there's a comms link

41:41.500 --> 41:43.500
And an engineers station and a weapons station

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
All of that, it's

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
Just brilliant, and they wrote their

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
Own game in

41:49.500 --> 41:51.500
Unity 3D, which runs on a

41:51.500 --> 41:53.500
PC out the back, and people are

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
Invited to come in and play the

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
Game, and it's a multiplayer game, and you're all

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
Sat inside the

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
Caravan, each taking on the role

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
Of a different member of the crew

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
And the people

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
Who own the caravan throw certain

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
Scenarios at you, and you have to do things like

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
Press certain buttons at a certain time, or a certain sequence

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
Of buttons, like you would on a real

42:13.500 --> 42:15.500
Spaceship, but also you have to do things like

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
There are cables that become

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
Disconnected, and you have to figure out which cables go

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
Where, and you have to get up from your seat and actually

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
Do manual stuff like you would see on

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
Star Trek, it's pretty impressive

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
And they've got a website for it, if you go to

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
I think it's LHS

42:29.500 --> 42:31.500
LHS

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
LHSbikeshed.com

42:33.500 --> 42:35.500
LHSbikeshed.com

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
You'll find pictures of this caravan that they take

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
To events, and invite people

42:39.500 --> 42:41.500
To come in and fly the missions

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
This is so cool!

42:43.500 --> 42:45.500
It is, it is really cool

42:45.500 --> 42:47.500
That's one of the nerdier things

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
It's really good fun

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
So, one of the other ones

42:51.500 --> 42:53.500
That I found particularly interesting

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
A woman called

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
Kat Matfield, I think it was

42:57.500 --> 42:59.500
She works as a consultant

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
Developing applications

43:01.500 --> 43:03.500
And they do privacy related

43:03.500 --> 43:05.500
Applications, and

43:05.500 --> 43:07.500
She gave us some tidbits of information that

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
Feedback they've got from user testing

43:09.500 --> 43:11.500
Of privacy based products

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
And some of the notes I took

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
That kind of surprised me a little bit

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
The

43:17.500 --> 43:19.500
Perception of privacy among normal

43:19.500 --> 43:21.500
People, like, not you and me, but like

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
Normals out there, right?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
Is a little bit strange

43:25.500 --> 43:27.500
People focus on passwords

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
And people, they think that

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
The password is the most important thing

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
That I have to have a safe password

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
And that they think that

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
Bad people target

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
Specific individuals, they don't realize

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
That fraudsters can just go out and buy

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
A list of credit card details

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
And they're arbitrary, they don't care

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
Who those credit card details come from

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
People seem to think that

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
I am a target, that I am

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
The individual that they're going to come after

43:53.500 --> 43:55.500
When in fact they just like

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
Reap thousands of credit cards

43:57.500 --> 43:59.500
And take money from all of them

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
Wherever possible

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
One of the interesting things

44:03.500 --> 44:05.500
That came out of their user testing

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
Was that adding

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
A Facebook button, like for

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
Facebook login to a product or a

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
Service, actually makes people

44:13.500 --> 44:15.500
More uncomfortable, having

44:15.500 --> 44:17.500
That button there, when you're logging into

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
Any kind of service, if there's a Facebook button on

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
The screen, people in their user testing didn't

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
Like it, because they felt that it associated

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
That product and service with their personal

44:25.500 --> 44:27.500
Data, and that their

44:27.500 --> 44:29.500
Brother or sister or friend or parent

44:29.500 --> 44:31.500
Might see what

44:31.500 --> 44:33.500
They're doing on that website, because

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
Of the Facebook button, and that made them

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
Feel very uneasy, and that kind of surprised me, I thought

44:37.500 --> 44:39.500
People loved the Facebook button, I thought they thought

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
Well that's an easy way for me to log in and I don't have

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
To worry about it, but it turns out

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
Exactly, and I don't have to

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
Remember yet another password, so it surprised

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
Me that people, normal people, not just

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
You and me, but normals, don't like that

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
Facebook button, and

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
The funny thing that came out of this was

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
People focus on

44:57.500 --> 44:59.500
The little padlock, they see that as

44:59.500 --> 45:01.500
A way of ensuring

45:01.500 --> 45:03.500
That the page is safe

45:03.500 --> 45:05.500
And so, in their user testing

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
They started adding padlocks to

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
The page, and they kept

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
Adding more and more padlocks all over the place

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
To the page, and

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
As they added

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
Padlocks, people felt the page was

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
More and more safe, and

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
They never managed to get to

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
What they called peak page

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
Padlock, and peak page

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
Padlock, peak page padlock would be

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
The maximum number of padlocks you

45:29.500 --> 45:31.500
Could possibly have on a page, and they never got to that

45:31.500 --> 45:33.500
Point, they could throw as many padlocks as they wanted

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
On the page, and people would just

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
Accept that that was more secure, because

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
There were more padlocks on there, it was brilliant

45:39.500 --> 45:41.500
And it's all security theatre

45:41.500 --> 45:43.500
But it was great to

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
Hear those kind of user experience testing

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
Results, it was great

45:47.500 --> 45:49.500
It was a good conference, I would certainly go again

45:49.500 --> 45:51.500
Wow, and so, do you know at this point

45:51.500 --> 45:53.500
Will there be another one next year?

45:53.500 --> 45:55.500
I don't know actually

45:55.500 --> 45:57.500
That was my first one, I've not been to it before

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
You know, based on

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
My experience, and the people

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
That I was chatting to afterwards in the bar

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
They all enjoyed it, and would certainly

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
Go again, so

46:07.500 --> 46:09.500
Did you get a chance to say hi to any Jupiter

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
And the meetup page was so new when you guys

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
Launched this, did anybody actually make it there?

46:13.500 --> 46:15.500
Yeah, there was a couple of people

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
Who made it along, I was just standing

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
There, and we didn't actually have

46:19.500 --> 46:21.500
A specific place to meet up

46:21.500 --> 46:23.500
Or anything, it was just

46:23.500 --> 46:25.500
That's the thing we gotta do next time, right? You gotta have specific

46:25.500 --> 46:27.500
Details, but if you don't know the venue

46:27.500 --> 46:29.500
It's hard to do that

46:29.500 --> 46:31.500
Right, well the good thing is, people just walked up to me and went

46:31.500 --> 46:33.500
Hello baby, and they recognised me

46:33.500 --> 46:35.500
And so

46:35.500 --> 46:37.500
You know, we

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
Had a chat, and then later on afterwards in the bar

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
There were a couple of guys there from the

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
Linux Luddites podcast

46:43.500 --> 46:45.500
We sat and had a chat with them in the bar

46:45.500 --> 46:47.500
And then we made our way to a pub

46:47.500 --> 46:49.500
Which is the traditional

46:49.500 --> 46:51.500
British way to end a conference, is to go to a pub

46:51.500 --> 46:53.500
Afterwards, had a few beers

46:53.500 --> 46:55.500
And chatted about all kinds of stuff, including

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
Jupiter broadcasting

46:57.500 --> 46:59.500
And all kinds of other podcasts and stuff

46:59.500 --> 47:01.500
All good things I'm sure, all good things I'm sure

47:01.500 --> 47:03.500
Yeah, it was good fun, it was really really good fun

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
You know what's funny is, when we go to some of these

47:05.500 --> 47:07.500
Events, people walk

47:07.500 --> 47:09.500
Up to the booth, or they'll walk up to us and they

47:09.500 --> 47:11.500
Just kind of stand around for a bit, and maybe you've

47:11.500 --> 47:13.500
Noticed this, they stand around

47:13.500 --> 47:15.500
For a bit, and they wait for us to talk

47:15.500 --> 47:17.500
And then they're like, oh

47:17.500 --> 47:19.500
You're Noah, you're Chris

47:19.500 --> 47:21.500
And they recognise the voices

47:21.500 --> 47:23.500
After we've talked for a bit, and then they introduce themselves

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
Did that happen to you at all?

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
No, they just walked straight up to me

47:27.500 --> 47:29.500
And said hello, so they clearly recognised me

47:29.500 --> 47:31.500
You know what that means is, your mug

47:31.500 --> 47:33.500
Your mug chasing that chicken is all over the internet

47:33.500 --> 47:35.500
That's what that means

47:35.500 --> 47:37.500
Yeah, that's true, but it was really lovely

47:37.500 --> 47:39.500
Because everyone's, you know, a typical British event

47:39.500 --> 47:41.500
Like, everyone's really understated and

47:41.500 --> 47:43.500
Really pleasant and friendly, and it was good

47:43.500 --> 47:45.500
It was really really good

47:45.500 --> 47:47.500
Good, boy, I tell you what, if I was

47:47.500 --> 47:49.500
Somehow able to make it next year, that would

47:49.500 --> 47:51.500
Boy, that would be amazing, that would be the highlight

47:51.500 --> 47:53.500
If I was in a position to be able to make it next year

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
We are

47:55.500 --> 47:57.500
I mean, these events are so awesome

47:57.500 --> 47:59.500
I would love to have audio from these kinds of things

47:59.500 --> 48:01.500
I mean, Poppy, don't you think this is one of the best things

48:01.500 --> 48:03.500
About our community?

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
Yeah, and I kind of

48:05.500 --> 48:07.500
I did take a handheld voice recorder

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
With me, and I was tempted to do

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
Some interviews and record some

48:11.500 --> 48:13.500
Stuff, but actually

48:13.500 --> 48:15.500
I was on my own dime

48:15.500 --> 48:17.500
And I thought, you know what, I'm just going to

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
Focus on the talks, and

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
Absorb this stuff, and especially

48:21.500 --> 48:23.500
As I wanted to go to the ones that were

48:23.500 --> 48:25.500
Out of my comfort zone, there was one

48:25.500 --> 48:27.500
I'll give you one last talk that I went to

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500
Towards the end of the day, and

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
It was called Science as Art

48:31.500 --> 48:33.500
And it was a

48:33.500 --> 48:35.500
Woman called Leah

48:35.500 --> 48:37.500
And a guy called James, who are

48:37.500 --> 48:39.500
Very artistic

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
And they've been

48:41.500 --> 48:43.500
Trying to use open data

48:43.500 --> 48:45.500
That's been made available by

48:45.500 --> 48:47.500
Governments and NGOs and other organizations

48:47.500 --> 48:49.500
And try and

48:49.500 --> 48:51.500
Represent that in different ways, rather than just have

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
Graphs, and they actually made

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
Some music out of

48:55.500 --> 48:57.500
Open data, it's quite hard

48:57.500 --> 48:59.500
To explain, but they've got

48:59.500 --> 49:01.500
Information about the rise

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
In CO2 gases

49:03.500 --> 49:05.500
In the atmosphere, and they map that to music

49:05.500 --> 49:07.500
Yes, they map that to one

49:07.500 --> 49:09.500
Instrument, and then they took something else

49:09.500 --> 49:11.500
Like the number of earthquakes

49:11.500 --> 49:13.500
Or floods in Pakistan

49:13.500 --> 49:15.500
For example, and then mapped that

49:15.500 --> 49:17.500
To the drums, and so they play a

49:17.500 --> 49:19.500
Little snippet of each of these, and then they

49:19.500 --> 49:21.500
Mashed it all together into

49:21.500 --> 49:23.500
A piece of music

49:23.500 --> 49:25.500
And actually it was really

49:25.500 --> 49:27.500
Thought provoking, because

49:27.500 --> 49:29.500
You knew that that big drum sound

49:29.500 --> 49:31.500
Was an earthquake 15

49:31.500 --> 49:33.500
Years ago, and then another one, and then two

49:33.500 --> 49:35.500
In quick succession when there were two more earthquakes

49:35.500 --> 49:37.500
Or something, it was really, really nicely done, and they're

49:37.500 --> 49:39.500
Looking for more sources of data

49:39.500 --> 49:41.500
And how they can

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
Map that into music or

49:43.500 --> 49:45.500
Theater

49:45.500 --> 49:47.500
Or anything, it's a nice way to represent data

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
That might be a bit dry

49:49.500 --> 49:51.500
Otherwise, so that

49:51.500 --> 49:53.500
Also I found particularly interesting

49:53.500 --> 49:55.500
Boy, no kidding, I bet that was actually

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
Kind of powerful, to see, to

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
Represent data through music

49:59.500 --> 50:01.500
This sounds corny

50:01.500 --> 50:03.500
Because you're going to laugh at me

50:03.500 --> 50:05.500
There were some skeptical people in the room

50:05.500 --> 50:07.500
There were, in a vertical, real scientists

50:07.500 --> 50:09.500
But it's pretty powerful, isn't it? It is in a way

50:09.500 --> 50:11.500
It's kind of, it's a different way to

50:11.500 --> 50:13.500
Visualize it, but

50:13.500 --> 50:15.500
Yeah, it sounds funny to say visualize, but you know

50:15.500 --> 50:17.500
What I mean, yeah, and

50:17.500 --> 50:19.500
Yeah, that's great, well thank you Popey

50:19.500 --> 50:21.500
Thank you so much, and thank you honestly

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
Thank you very much for helping

50:23.500 --> 50:25.500
Being willing to take on the Meetup page

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
So we had an event, meetup.com

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
Broadcasting if you were going to make it

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
And Popey was

50:31.500 --> 50:33.500
More than willing to be an event organizer

50:33.500 --> 50:35.500
And if you want to go to the next one

50:35.500 --> 50:37.500
Popey, you know, let's do it again

50:37.500 --> 50:39.500
Let's just, any events like that in the

50:39.500 --> 50:41.500
Area, because it's an area that

50:41.500 --> 50:43.500
You know, we just don't have a lot of oversight

50:43.500 --> 50:45.500
On, and so I really

50:45.500 --> 50:47.500
Appreciate you kind of filling me in on that

50:47.500 --> 50:49.500
Because we have 30% of our

50:49.500 --> 50:51.500
Audiences over there, and so

50:51.500 --> 50:53.500
Like, I feel like I

50:53.500 --> 50:55.500
I know, we're really packed in on this tiny bit

50:55.500 --> 50:57.500
You guys are

50:57.500 --> 50:59.500
You probably all know each other

50:59.500 --> 51:01.500
I assume

51:01.500 --> 51:03.500
Oh yeah, yeah, totally

51:03.500 --> 51:05.500
So meetup.com plus Jupiter broadcasting you for future

51:05.500 --> 51:07.500
Events, I don't know, one of the next

51:07.500 --> 51:09.500
Live events we might do

51:09.500 --> 51:11.500
I would really

51:11.500 --> 51:13.500
Really, really love to do

51:13.500 --> 51:15.500
Linux Unplugged on location sometime

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
Why?

51:17.500 --> 51:19.500
Not because it makes the show better

51:19.500 --> 51:21.500
Necessarily

51:21.500 --> 51:23.500
Why? Because I

51:23.500 --> 51:25.500
Wanted to do it before I ever launched the show

51:25.500 --> 51:27.500
So, a couple of weeks ago

51:27.500 --> 51:29.500
Two weeks ago on the Linux Action Show

51:29.500 --> 51:31.500
We said if we got to 530 patrons

51:31.500 --> 51:33.500
I would go out to Noah's house

51:33.500 --> 51:35.500
And I would go

51:35.500 --> 51:37.500
And I would tour Noah's automated house

51:37.500 --> 51:39.500
I would put on his freaking

51:39.500 --> 51:41.500
Google Glass, even if it stings

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
A little bit, and I would walk around his house and get a tour

51:43.500 --> 51:45.500
And

51:45.500 --> 51:47.500
If I find Windows

51:47.500 --> 51:49.500
I will tell you about it

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
Like, I will tell you about it

51:51.500 --> 51:53.500
And I will search out Windows

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
In Noah's house, and we got to 530

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
In fact, we're at 538 right now

51:57.500 --> 51:59.500
Which is awesome

51:59.500 --> 52:01.500
I'm really excited about that

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
So we might do Linux, I don't know how the timing will work out

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
We might, oh god, wouldn't it be cool if we could do Unplugged 100

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
From Noah's house

52:07.500 --> 52:09.500
I'm really looking forward to this

52:09.500 --> 52:11.500
Because one of the things I want to do, I mean, we're going out to Noah's house

52:11.500 --> 52:13.500
As a way to sort of just celebrate a milestone

52:13.500 --> 52:15.500
But long term

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
I really

52:17.500 --> 52:19.500
Want to do more of these event coverages

52:19.500 --> 52:21.500
I really, really, really think this is an area

52:21.500 --> 52:23.500
That if Linux Unplugged and

52:23.500 --> 52:25.500
Linux Action Show focused on, and by the way

52:25.500 --> 52:27.500
Just wait

52:27.500 --> 52:29.500
Because we're about to get into

52:29.500 --> 52:31.500
One of the discussions that Noah

52:31.500 --> 52:33.500
Had at Self

52:33.500 --> 52:35.500
And I think you guys are going to meet

52:35.500 --> 52:37.500
Somebody you're probably just going to start following now

52:37.500 --> 52:39.500
Somebody who's a thought maker in Linux and

52:39.500 --> 52:41.500
Open Source that you've probably never even heard of

52:41.500 --> 52:43.500
And after today's episode you're probably going to follow them on a daily

52:43.500 --> 52:45.500
Basis

52:45.500 --> 52:47.500
Going out and meeting these people and talking to these people

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
And if you haven't heard Poby's description, it's awesome

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
And it's what's the best thing about our community

52:51.500 --> 52:53.500
And so, yeah

52:53.500 --> 52:55.500
We got to 530 people

52:55.500 --> 52:57.500
And now 538, which is cool

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
Yeah, I'm going

52:59.500 --> 53:01.500
To Noah's house as a way to celebrate

53:01.500 --> 53:03.500
And yeah, I'm going to do Linux Action Show from Noah's house

53:03.500 --> 53:05.500
And it's, in a way, it's a way for me to say

53:05.500 --> 53:07.500
Thank you to Noah because he comes out here all the time

53:07.500 --> 53:09.500
But what it's really about

53:09.500 --> 53:11.500
Is it's investing

53:11.500 --> 53:13.500
In the content that I think

53:13.500 --> 53:15.500
I'm almost so positive

53:15.500 --> 53:17.500
That if we could expose more of this

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
In a better way than we do it now

53:19.500 --> 53:21.500
Like the event coverage we do now

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
Is like 10% of what I want to bring you

53:23.500 --> 53:25.500
Because what I want to bring you

53:25.500 --> 53:27.500
Is, I want to

53:27.500 --> 53:29.500
Make it like you're there

53:29.500 --> 53:31.500
And I want you to experience why when we go to these events

53:31.500 --> 53:33.500
We come back so supercharged

53:33.500 --> 53:35.500
About Open Source, about the community

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
About Linux

53:37.500 --> 53:39.500
I want you to experience that

53:39.500 --> 53:41.500
And that's why I'm excited about 530 people

53:41.500 --> 53:43.500
Not because I'm going to Noah's house

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
Or I'm going to do a segment or the entire show from a boat

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
That's awesome

53:47.500 --> 53:49.500
That's not why I'm excited

53:49.500 --> 53:51.500
I'm excited because after we do that

53:51.500 --> 53:53.500
We're starting to

53:53.500 --> 53:55.500
Kind of move into the next phase

53:55.500 --> 53:57.500
We're moving to the next step

53:57.500 --> 53:59.500
We're going to the next area for Jupyter Broadcasting

53:59.500 --> 54:01.500
Where pretty soon

54:01.500 --> 54:03.500
Let's be real

54:03.500 --> 54:05.500
What's it going to take to make it possible for me to go to Self

54:05.500 --> 54:07.500
And for me to go to things like Open Tech

54:07.500 --> 54:09.500
And for me to go to things like BSD Can

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
What's it going to take? It's going to take somebody right here in the studio

54:11.500 --> 54:13.500
It's going to take somebody sitting here at the spot

54:13.500 --> 54:15.500
That I'm sitting at switching

54:15.500 --> 54:17.500
It's going to take somebody vamping

54:17.500 --> 54:19.500
It's going to take somebody that can mix in remote locations

54:19.500 --> 54:21.500
It's going to take a producer in studio

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
That's where I'm going with this

54:23.500 --> 54:25.500
I know it's crazy ambitious

54:25.500 --> 54:27.500
But I want to be able to raise the funds

54:27.500 --> 54:29.500
To afford a full time person in studio

54:29.500 --> 54:31.500
And I'm willing to start part time

54:31.500 --> 54:33.500
A couple times a week, whatever I can do

54:33.500 --> 54:35.500
But where I eventually want to go is I want to have a full time person in studio

54:35.500 --> 54:41.500
And I don't want to pay for it with sponsors

54:41.500 --> 54:43.500
I'm willing to, because in some ways

54:43.500 --> 54:45.500
It feels like the shortcut

54:45.500 --> 54:47.500
Because I could get a sponsor

54:47.500 --> 54:49.500
I could get a sponsor to sponsor just that

54:49.500 --> 54:51.500
I've got two emails literally in my inbox right now

54:51.500 --> 54:53.500
From two different companies that want to sponsor our shows

54:53.500 --> 54:55.500
And I'm sitting here telling them

54:55.500 --> 54:59.500
I'm sorry, I only want to have as few sponsors of the show as possible

54:59.500 --> 55:01.500
Because I only want to pick the people I use

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
And I only want to talk about the people I think you guys would use

55:03.500 --> 55:05.500
Right?

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
But holy shit is that limiting

55:07.500 --> 55:09.500
Turns out that's a super limiting model to go with

55:09.500 --> 55:11.500
But it's the only one I can go with

55:11.500 --> 55:13.500
Where I can show up at this microphone and genuinely talk to you

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
So what I like about this

55:15.500 --> 55:17.500
Is this is giving me some runway to start budgeting

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
God, you know what?

55:19.500 --> 55:21.500
If we got to 600 I could start thinking about actually budgeting

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
To have a part time person

55:23.500 --> 55:25.500
And then I could actually start traveling

55:25.500 --> 55:27.500
And when I start thinking about it like that

55:27.500 --> 55:29.500
I get really excited

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
Because then I'm responsible to the audience

55:31.500 --> 55:33.500
I'm responsible to you

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
I'm not thinking

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
How am I going to formulate this new show

55:37.500 --> 55:39.500
And make sure I got good spots for sponsors

55:39.500 --> 55:41.500
How am I going to make sure this content

55:41.500 --> 55:43.500
Is going to make enough people click

55:43.500 --> 55:45.500
That the sponsor gets enough return on their investment

55:45.500 --> 55:47.500
What I'm thinking about instead

55:47.500 --> 55:49.500
When it's a Patreon inspired show

55:49.500 --> 55:51.500
Is I'm thinking

55:51.500 --> 55:53.500
God, what does the audience really want?

55:53.500 --> 55:55.500
Does this show even need intro music?

55:55.500 --> 55:57.500
It's a 10 minute, 15 minute show

55:57.500 --> 55:59.500
Does it need intro music?

55:59.500 --> 56:01.500
The audience doesn't need that?

56:01.500 --> 56:03.500
What do they need?

56:03.500 --> 56:05.500
What do they want to know about?

56:05.500 --> 56:07.500
And when you expand that out to covering things like community events

56:07.500 --> 56:09.500
I can't think of a better way to have

56:09.500 --> 56:11.500
Coverage of community events

56:11.500 --> 56:13.500
The fundamental foundation of what inspires

56:13.500 --> 56:15.500
Our open source community

56:15.500 --> 56:17.500
I can't think of a better way to cover that

56:17.500 --> 56:19.500
Than something that is also funded by the community

56:19.500 --> 56:21.500
And I'm not totally opposed to sponsorships

56:21.500 --> 56:23.500
I tell you what, one way or another

56:23.500 --> 56:25.500
I will make this happen

56:25.500 --> 56:27.500
And if I go to commercial sponsors to make it happen

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
Because I think this is

56:29.500 --> 56:31.500
The most important aspect of open source

56:31.500 --> 56:33.500
Coverage that is neglected

56:33.500 --> 56:35.500
Because nobody can do it

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
Because it's expensive

56:39.500 --> 56:41.500
And it's a risk

56:41.500 --> 56:43.500
And I will make it happen

56:43.500 --> 56:45.500
I will make it happen one way or another

56:45.500 --> 56:47.500
If I go to sponsors and make sure that

56:47.500 --> 56:49.500
Every live event we go to is sponsored

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
I will do that

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
And I will find a way to walk that line for you

56:53.500 --> 56:55.500
To make sure that it doesn't influence our coverage

56:55.500 --> 56:57.500
I will do that for you

56:57.500 --> 56:59.500
But it will take

56:59.500 --> 57:01.500
It will take going that route, it will take sponsorships

57:01.500 --> 57:03.500
It will take making sure we only go to events

57:03.500 --> 57:05.500
That have enough coverage to make sure

57:05.500 --> 57:07.500
That our sponsor gets a return on their

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
Substantial investment

57:09.500 --> 57:11.500
And what I want to do instead is I want to cover it for you

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500
Patreon.com slash today, yes it's a

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
Tech Talk Today page, yeah I get that, I know that's confusing

57:15.500 --> 57:17.500
I understand, that was a dumb idea

57:17.500 --> 57:19.500
But Tech Talk Today is a thank you

57:19.500 --> 57:21.500
To 538 people

57:21.500 --> 57:23.500
Who make

57:23.500 --> 57:25.500
Expanding our coverage

57:25.500 --> 57:27.500
Genuine coverage possible

57:27.500 --> 57:29.500
That's what Tech Talk Today is

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
For 538 people, I do a show for 538

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
People, that's dumb

57:33.500 --> 57:35.500
Nobody would do a podcast for 538

57:35.500 --> 57:37.500
People, and if you do you should stop

57:37.500 --> 57:39.500
You can't make any money

57:39.500 --> 57:41.500
Doing that, unless it's this model

57:41.500 --> 57:43.500
That's why Patreon makes a difference, Patreon.com

57:43.500 --> 57:45.500
Slash today, it funds this show

57:45.500 --> 57:47.500
It funds the Linux action show, it funds future

57:47.500 --> 57:49.500
Shows you don't even know we have in development that are

57:49.500 --> 57:51.500
Focused on open source, well you might actually

57:51.500 --> 57:53.500
Know because it got out for a little bit

57:55.500 --> 57:57.500
And I'm not trying to

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
Shame you, I'm not trying to guilt you, but what I am trying

57:59.500 --> 58:01.500
To say is, I'm going to make

58:01.500 --> 58:03.500
This happen one way or another, I'm going to make Jupiter

58:03.500 --> 58:05.500
Broadcasting the company that covers these

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
Events properly, and if

58:07.500 --> 58:09.500
You watch BSD now this week

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
You're going to see the same exact thing happening

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
For the BSD community

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
And they've got a lot more together

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
Right now

58:17.500 --> 58:19.500
And I want to make sure that Jupiter Broadcasting

58:19.500 --> 58:21.500
Is the company and the community and the Linux action

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
Show, Linux Unplugged is the podcast that represents

58:23.500 --> 58:25.500
The Linux community and the open source community

58:25.500 --> 58:27.500
And the life that they deserve, because right now

58:27.500 --> 58:29.500
What we get is a bunch of bloggers that want

58:29.500 --> 58:31.500
Clicks, and we get a bunch of people that want

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
To get people to retweet and they make crazy

58:33.500 --> 58:35.500
Ass headlines, and if it's not that

58:35.500 --> 58:37.500
If it's not people trying to get clicks for advertisers

58:39.500 --> 58:41.500
It's websites that are set up by

58:41.500 --> 58:43.500
Proprietary companies or huge companies or even

58:43.500 --> 58:45.500
Open source companies that are huge in our industry

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
That are paying journalists to write pro things

58:47.500 --> 58:49.500
About them, that's the state of open source

58:49.500 --> 58:51.500
Journalism right now, and all of them

58:51.500 --> 58:53.500
Are neglecting this fundamental

58:53.500 --> 58:55.500
Aspect, the core community

58:55.500 --> 58:57.500
Aspect, and I know I'm making a huge case

58:57.500 --> 58:59.500
Right now, but I, throughout the rest of this

58:59.500 --> 59:01.500
Episode, will speak for

59:01.500 --> 59:03.500
Itself of how important covering

59:03.500 --> 59:05.500
These events are

59:05.500 --> 59:07.500
I am willing to go out on a ledge right now and tell you how

59:07.500 --> 59:09.500
Important this is based on the rest of the content

59:09.500 --> 59:11.500
Of this episode, patreon.com slash today

59:11.500 --> 59:13.500
Please go there, help expand

59:13.500 --> 59:15.500
Our coverage, I want to be able to go to things like

59:15.500 --> 59:17.500
Open tag, I'm sick of standing here

59:17.500 --> 59:19.500
In the studio, I want to go there, I want to cover these

59:19.500 --> 59:21.500
Things, I want to bring them to you, I want to bring video

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
I want to bring audio, I want to bring all

59:23.500 --> 59:25.500
Of it, I want to bring exposure to all of it

59:25.500 --> 59:27.500
Not for me

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
Alright, I'm done

59:31.500 --> 59:33.500
Alright, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

59:33.500 --> 59:35.500
In fact, we should probably get into some of it

59:35.500 --> 59:37.500
I know, go ahead kids and kitty, go ahead, am I

59:37.500 --> 59:39.500
Am I up in my soapbox too much?

59:39.500 --> 59:41.500
No you're good

59:41.500 --> 59:43.500
I wasn't asking you, I was asking

59:43.500 --> 59:45.500
Kids and kitty

59:45.500 --> 59:47.500
But alright, alright

59:47.500 --> 59:49.500
Kids, you say you want to say something

59:49.500 --> 59:51.500
Jump in, but what did you just leave?

59:51.500 --> 59:53.500
No, go ahead

59:53.500 --> 59:55.500
I'm used to push to talk, working

59:55.500 --> 59:57.500
On the keyboard, not in the window

59:57.500 --> 59:59.500
Sorry about that

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
No, no problem

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
What you said though, it's

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
That's just like most of the other internet

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500
In terms of journalism, it is

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
All dominated by

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.500
Clickbait basically, and I think

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500
That is a huge problem, and I think it's

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.500
Great that you're looking to

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
Alleviate that

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
Through an independent means

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500
Yeah, and I mean

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500
I know that anybody can say it

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Anybody can

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.500
Make that claim, the only

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Proof I have is in the content

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.500
That we produce, and

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
The only thing I can make

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
The only plea I can make is if you believe in the content we've produced

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
So far, and you like the direction

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
We're going, that's the bet I'm asking

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
You to take

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Not necessarily for me, I don't even really

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.500
I don't really need a lot, I just need to be able to do this

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.500
On an ongoing basis, and be able to go do these

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500
Things on an ongoing basis

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500
I don't need a lot, I

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500
I know, I know it sounds like a crazy plea

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500
This, I can't write code

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500
Right, like

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500
I'm just too ADD, like I'm never

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500
Gonna do, I don't even submit bugs that often

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500
I do about, like what, a dozen bugs a year

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Tops

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500
It's not who I am

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500
I know, I know, I know, but this is

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
What I do, this is what I can do

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500
And I just

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500
When we go to these events man, it's like

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500
We're so close to covering them in the way

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.500
We want to cover them, but yet

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.500
I can see the huge gap, like

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.500
Like, sitting at a desk and

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
Talking to people, and getting great people

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
To stop by the desk, and talking to them

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Is great, that is

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
Super good content, and

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
If I objectively observe it, it's

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
Exclusive content that nobody else has

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500
And I'm very, very happy, and man

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.500
Did the team work super hard to accomplish that

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.500
It is awesome

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500
It's not enough for me

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.500
It's not enough, I really want to show

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500
You how awesome, I feel like you guys never get an idea

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.500
Of how awesome these things are

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.500
And that's all, and I feel like

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.500
I feel like if we knew that, I feel like

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.500
All of the bickering, and like

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
The religious wars

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Around system D, and all of it

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
Would sort of melt away, I know it's crazy

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
It's crazy, but I just

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500
Feel like that's my way to contribute to the community

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
Is to try to

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Bring

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Some sort of balance

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500
To what the commercial interests

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
Are bringing to the dialogue

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500
I want to bring balance to that dialogue

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.500
That is focused

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
And funded by the community

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500
And that's my goal, and I know that sounds crazy

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
But I feel like

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.500
The reason why that's important is open source

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.500
Software is created by people for people

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500
And I know that sounds so stupid, but

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
When people get all crazy

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
And people start making death threats and stuff

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
People bail on open source, they don't develop open source

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Software, it creates this barrier to entry

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
It creates this mystique

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
About how hostile the Linux community is

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500
And none of it is actually true

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
It is a small

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500
Percentage of our community

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500
It is a minority, but they get all

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500
Of the attention because all of those jerks

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Out there want to write headlines to get

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500
Clicks, and they want karma

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
On Reddit, and they want retweets

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.500
And whatever the hell the

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
Pretend internet points is that they want

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
That's what motivates them

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500
And I

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500
I will never be motivated by those things

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
Go look at my Twitter feed right now

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500
Go look at my Google Plus feed

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
Right now, go look at my Reddit

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
Submissions, I could not give a shit

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
About those things, I never will

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
I never will be motivated by those things

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500
I am generally motivated

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
By these, by

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500
I truly believe that if people could see

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500
More about what happens at these conferences

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.500
About what Popey just shared with us

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
About what we're about to play for himself

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
If you could see more of this, you would understand

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.500
That these are real people creating amazing things

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
That when they go to these conferences

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.500
It is not a hostile environment

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500
It is real people that connect and collaborate

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500
And create and move forward

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500
It is not like the comment threads

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.500
That you read online, and it is not

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.500
What you have been led to perceive

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
By the tech journalists that want you

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500
To read their articles and click their

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500
Headlines, and I know

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500
That seems like it's not a big deal, but I think

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
If you set the tone correctly

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
It sets the tone for the entire community

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.500
And it creates a collaborative

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.500
Environment that trickles down, and I know I'm sounding like

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Ronald Reagan right now, but I think it's the truth

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
It's trickle down community

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Okay, I gotta shut up

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.500
Cause I could literally

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.500
Spend an entire episode talking about this

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.500
It's one of the number one things I think about

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500
All the time, and it's a huge soapbox

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500
That I've been on, and I apologize that I've just wasted

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
This much of the show, why don't we talk about something else

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.500
Let's take a minute, I'm gonna talk about Ting

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.500
I want you to go to linux.ting.com

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500
Right now, go check them out

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500
Listen, we wouldn't be able

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
We would not be able to do this without Ting

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.500
They have seriously a great product

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500
Here, and you know how I've often

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Advocated you need to vote with your wallet?

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500
That's Ting, Ting is changing the mobile

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500
Industry, you only pay for what you use

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.500
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes and they add them up

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.500
Whatever bucket you fall into

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500
That's what you pay, it's a flat six dollars for the line

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500
Now

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500
In practicality, what that means is we are

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Able to give every one of our members

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.500
At self this weekend, a phone

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500
I don't have a lot of

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.500
Money you guys, and I gave every one of our

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.500
Members at self this weekend a phone

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
That made production

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.500
Possible, and that's how we were able to coordinate

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.500
All of this, that's how I was able to send

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.500
Noah messages saying, hey this clip has

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
Five minutes left and then we need to transition to you

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.500
With an interview, you need to have that person on mic

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
In five minutes, I could not have done that

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.500
Without Ting, Ting is awesome

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.500
And either if you just have one phone

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.500
Or if you have more than ten devices, you're going to save

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500
Money, because think about this

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500
Current mobile industry practices are getting you

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500
To pay for plans that you don't necessarily

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500
Need, you might need four gigabytes

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.500
You might need a thousand

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500
Minutes, you might need five hundred

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.500
Messages, you might not

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.500
Me, I don't

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
Okay, all of my text

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500
Messaging happens over either Hangouts

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.500
Or Telegram, majority is Telegram

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500
Voice calling

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.500
Happens over Hangouts or

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
Viber

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500
So I'm able to have three lines

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.500
And I only pay about

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.500
Well, I think last month it was like 37

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500
Dollars for three lines, that's an

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500
HTC One

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500
A Nexus

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500
Five

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.500
And an iPhone 5

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500
All

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.500
On one account

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500
See Ting isn't based on your device

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.500
Ting is based on you, so if you want

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
To have a MiFi hotspot, if you want to have a couple

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500
Of devices, if you're a developer

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
And you want to be able to test across multiple

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.500
Devices, maybe you need iOS, maybe you need

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.500
Android, maybe you need multiple Android devices

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
And you don't want to pay a whole bunch of

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
Fees every single month

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
Ting is perfect, linux.ting.com

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.500
You're going to get a fifty dollar credit

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
Off your first device, linux.ting.com

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
You're going to get a fifty dollar

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500
Credit, and if you have a Ting compatible

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500
Device, and you might, because let's

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500
Be honest, cell phones have been around for a while, and

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.500
Ting has got coverage on GSM and CDMA

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.500
If you

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Have a device, you're going to get a fifty

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500
Dollar credit on your entire Ting

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500
Service

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Which, for me,

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
When I signed up, I got like a twenty five dollar credit

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
That fifty dollar credit is only good

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
Till the end of June too, so jump on that, and by the way

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
Ting also has an early termination relief program

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
To help you get out of a current contract

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Get out of that duopoly!

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.500
With the Ting ETF program, you can find out more about

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500
That, and also

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
If you've listened to these ads, and you've thought

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
Yeah, okay, that sounds too good to be true

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
I've been burned by mobile service providers before

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
Okay, that's fair

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
That's fair. I invite you

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500
To check out Ting's hangout

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Ting is going to have a hangout on Thursday at noon

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
Eastern time

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500
Just around the TechSnap time, so

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
Watch this, and then join us for TechSnap

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
And you can ask the Ting crew

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500
Anything you want to know

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
How the hell do they make money?

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500
Are they going to be around for a long time?

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
Why do I only pay for what I use?

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500
How can they have unlocked devices?

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
How can they afford an early termination relief program?

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500
How do they have no hold customer service?

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500
Are you skeptical?

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500
Ask them! They have amazing

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500
Answers

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500
And I think after you watch that, you'll be impressed

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500
In fact, they have all kinds of great tips, you can go check it on their blog

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
Go to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
Right now, get a fifty dollar credit

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
No contract, only pay

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500
For what you use, no hold customer service

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500
Boom! That is Ting

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500
Right there in a brief

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500
linux.ting.com, and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500
The Linux Unplugged Program

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.500
And check out this week's Linux Action Show for

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.500
Noah's new Bat Phone, which is

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
Ridiculous. Noah's got this new kind of crazy

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
Mobile phone that

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.500
I'm a little jelly of, to be honest with you

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.500
Now, Mumble Room, I was talking about

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
Open Source Journalism

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
And we're going to hear from somebody

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
Who has

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
Been directly involved with Open Source Journalism

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
Now, for quite a while

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500
And I actually kind of rather

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500
Enjoy this man's commentary

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500
So, Noah sat down during self

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500
And he had a chance to talk with Brian

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500
And Brian is an author at

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500
OpenSource.com

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
So, he's also a Red Hat employee

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500
And so, OpenSource.com and Red Hat kind of have the

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500
Connection there, and he had a lot of

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Good commentary on the things that Noah wanted to

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Chat with. And so, we

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
I want to play a few clips for you from Brian

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
So, here he sits down, he talks about how to

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
Tell whether Open Source is one or not

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Like, there's a metric that I think we could probably all

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500
Agree on. Is Open Source

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500
One in this category? How do you tell?

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500
How do you know once you can declare victory?

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500
Well, he's got some thoughts on that

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.500
And also, knowing

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
Him chat about how you can add value to

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
Open Source software when you are

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.500
In the IT department and you want to say, hey

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500
I want to switch off Microsoft

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
Office, let's switch to Libre Office

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
And the first answer is, how could something

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500
Free be better? It turns

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
Out, there's a way to make that

01:09:39.500 --> 01:10:05.500
Case pretty crystal clear.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
I want to see you. I want to see your face.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500
Do you hear my mouth in your ear hole?

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.500
Hi there.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500
Hi there.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
So, I'm Noah. Good to meet you.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
I'm Brian. Nice to meet you.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500
So, tell me, Brian, what it is

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500
That you love about Linux.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500
Well, I love everything about Linux, but

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500
I love the concept of openness because I like

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Collaboration.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500
I am a contributor

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
To a website called opensource.com

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500
And I've worked for that

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
Open source.com team

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500
For about five years and there

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
We tell stories about the ways

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
That open source values make

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
A difference in people's lives

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.500
Outside the realm of software.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.500
So, that's what I find most intriguing about

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500
Open source. I love the way that it can be

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
Adapted to different domains like

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500
The government or your health or

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Education.

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.500
Now, do you attend a lot

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Of different conferences? I don't.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500
This is my second time itself. Oh, no kidding.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500
Yeah, second time itself. I was here two years ago and loved it.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500
I don't attend too many conferences, but

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500
I do love this one. And I live up

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500
In the Raleigh area, so I wanted to make sure I shot down and got here.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
Now I know why you value

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
Openness. Because

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500
Here's why. For those of you that don't know

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500
Red Hat is based in Raleigh.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
And Red Hat has, from my perception

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500
From talking to other people that are from the area

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500
And around and work for Red Hat,

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500
Basically, everyone

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500
That is involved

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500
Has

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
Red Hat has had this influence

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500
On the community around them to encourage

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500
Everyone to be open. That's right.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500
So I had a chance to sit down with the folks from Red Hat and

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500
Interview them. And we were talking to them

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
And I would give them

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
Opportunities to pump their own business.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500
I'd say, tell me what advantages

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
You can offer over your competitors.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
And they would say, well, we're

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.500
Open source, so anything that we can

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.500
Offer, our competitors can offer.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500
Because we're all just teammates.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500
And I think that goes a long way.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500
Now, do you use Linux on your desktop? I do, yeah.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500
Okay, which distro are you using? I'm using Linux Mint.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500
Alright. Linux Mint XFCE.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.500
So what would you say to people that say

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
When you walk around

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500
And you see people that aren't using Linux and they say

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Well, you know

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500
I need a bash shell to get my stuff done

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500
So I wouldn't be, I don't think I'd be able

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
To use Linux. I'd have to use the Mac

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
Because I also have to have an office suite.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
Stuff like that. Yeah, well I'd say

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
That those two are not mutually

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500
Exclusive. So I would say that

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
Out of the box, you get the software you need

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
To do all the things that you just described

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.500
By using the software that I would suggest

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.500
That you use. So instead of

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500
Creating a false dichotomy between software

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500
That has and software that has not

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500
I would try to suggest that these people look at

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500
Software solutions

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500
That do everything.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500
And the thing is

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500
I find that the people that

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500
Keep telling me Linux isn't capable of doing

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
Things are usually getting in my way of

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.500
Making Linux do things, right?

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.500
We were told, so our company

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
Jupiter Broadcasting, we were told I don't know how many times

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.500
That you can't do live

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500
Broadcast on Linux.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500
And everyone else in that

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500
I don't know

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
It kind of looks like the answer to that question

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500
Yeah, no, this is actually a version of

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500
Windows. It's Windows with

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Mate. Yeah, yeah, Windows

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500
But no

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500
For a long time, everyone

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500
In that sphere told us, well you can't do that

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500
You have to have a Mac, or you have to have Windows

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
To do it. And

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500
We're fortunate

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500
At least I feel fortunate

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500
That the owner of the company has

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500
A deep-rooted belief in using

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Linux where he can. So when I came to him, I'm like

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.500
Hey, Chris, guess what? This works

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500
It works on Linux. I mean, he wanted to see it

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500
Work first, but as soon as I showed him

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500
It took him, I bet, less than seven seconds

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.500
Of me flipping through the cameras and saying, look, it does it

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.500
And he goes, great, let's start the production

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500
I mean, it was that fast.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
Yep, yep, yep, I can agree

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500
He's done the same thing with people

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Fixing up old computers, plopping them in front

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.500
Of them, and with little or no

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
Guidance, they're able to work their

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Way through the system easily

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
I think one of my

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500
Favorite success stories was

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.500
My parents just bought

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500
A new computer. They got a Mac

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500
And I said, okay, I'll help you set it up

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
So I helped them set it up. And my mom

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Does a lot of word processing

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500
So she wanted iWork on her computer

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.500
And she called me a week later and was like, look

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500
This iWork thing, I just don't get it

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
I just don't understand it. I was like, look, I'm going to try something

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.500
I'm going to come over and put a new

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Program on your computer. It's called Libre Office

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.500
And we're going to see

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.500
What it's like. A week later

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.500
I get a text, oh my god, this is so much better

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500
And it was

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500
No learning curve at all. I mean, I just put

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500
The software on her machine, and

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500
That was it. That was the end of the story

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500
And she figured everything from there, and I think what you're saying

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500
Is true.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.500
I'll share

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.500
A success story that's kind of similar. I was at a

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
I do a lot of IT contracting work

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.500
And we're big into the hospitality

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.500
Industry. Right. So

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
A lot of hotels are moving to web-based solutions

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500
And of course, web-based solutions really lend themselves

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500
To Linux because I don't have to worry about virus protection

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Malware protection, you know, all that

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
Not to mention the ability to remotely

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
Update Linux. It's a heck of a lot easier than trying to

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
Remotely update Windows, right? Right, sure.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
So we had installed this computer

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500
And I had put

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
Libre Office on it, and the girl looks

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500
At it, and she goes, aww. And as soon as

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
She did that, I knew, I thought, oh, she's

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
Heard of Libre Office, and usually it's a

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
Oh, I don't want the Microsoft Word replacement

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
I want actual Microsoft Word. She looks

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500
At me, dude, and she goes

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.500
Why do you have Macsoft? What, do I have

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500
To use the Mac version? I'm like, what do you mean the Mac version?

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.500
Yeah, I'm like, what are you talking about? She goes

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500
Oh, the school system, they all have Macs

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
And they have this Libre Office, and they've switched the whole school

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500
And I'm like, what?

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
What'd you just say? And I'm like

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
The entire school district is using Libre Office, and she's like

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Yeah, and I'm like, so

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Open-source software has gotten to a point now where

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
It gets confused for the overpriced, overinflated

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.500
Mac stuff. Yeah, that's awesome

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
I think that's a huge compliment to the Libre Office folks

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500
Some people wouldn't consider it

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500
But I think that's perfect

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500
That is

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500
That's what you need

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
You need the

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
How do I put this? When it becomes a non-issue

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
When it becomes so commonplace

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
You know, Clay Shirky

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500
Has this bit in his book

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
Here Comes Everybody, where he talks about the common

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500
Placeness of technologies, and he says that

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.500
He recalls

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
He recounts the story of his

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500
Parents meeting for the first time

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
And it's a story they told him many times

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
How they met, and he said

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500
It involved a car, and the one thing that was

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500
Didn't resonate

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
Wasn't part of the story at all, was the car

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500
The car was just a mundane thing that was there

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
And it was part of the story

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
But it didn't bear any remark at all

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500
And that's sort of how

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
Open source software needs to function

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
When it becomes the default

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
And it becomes taken for granted, we've won

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
Yeah, that's right, and the nice thing about that is

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Now we're vastly

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
Approaching a point where companies are

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500
Starting to, they don't necessarily value

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
The ideals like maybe you and I would

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500
But they value the way

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
That it can be cost effective to them, so the fact that

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
They're not locked into a proprietary

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
There's no vendor lock-in

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
And the fact that typically the cost

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500
To implement the software or roll it out is

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500
Low, and a lot of things is

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
I worked for a large organization

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.500
A very large organization, and I

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500
Pitched LibreOffice to them, and because

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500
I knew what they were capable of

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
Monetarily wise

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
I had recommended, I said rather than

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
Pay $400 for Microsoft Office

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
Technically we can install it for free

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
Make a donation to LibreOffice

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
And we'll install

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
For every copy you install, instead of paying $400, make a donation

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
For $200, and I knew

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500
We're going to roll it out over X amount of computers

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
That's going to add up quickly

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
But the company, even though

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500
It was going to cost them money, they were happy to do it

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
Because they didn't have vendor

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
Software lock-in, they had an upgrade

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
Path, so in their mind

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.500
They were going to pay once and upgrade forever

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.500
And so yeah, I think that brings a lot of value

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Absolutely

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.500
Now I love that Chad, and

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500
It's an interesting idea, like bringing value

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
To open source software by saying

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500
Okay, we're going to use this free software

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.500
But let's donate a little

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500
Money first, and you'll donate once

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500
And then you can use it guilt-free going forward

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.500
I don't know if that worked for everybody

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.500
But I suggest that

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500
As an interesting idea, if you run into

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.500
A barrier, and I've

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500
Been there, and I don't know if this is still as common as it used to be

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500
But if you run into

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
A barrier where they say, how can this be any good

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500
It's free

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500
Before the conversation

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.500
Ever gets to that point

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500
If you know that's your company's inclination

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
Maybe suggest to them

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.500
That they start by making a contribution

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.500
Let's use this software, and we're

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
Going to make a contribution first

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.500
You're going to spend $200 per

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.500
User, for the rest

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
Of that user's

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500
Existence, you know? Like you're not

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
Every three years going to spend $200

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
You're going to spend $200 once per user

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500
Maybe you even do it, every new user that rolls out

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500
You spend $200, right? It's still half

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.500
The amount

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
Wouldn't that fundamentally change

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.500
Open source software? Isn't that a great idea?

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.500
I was really inspired

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
By that

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500
So that was Brian's take on that

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.500
Now, Brian and Noah talked about

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500
Maybe the best way to get

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
Started is, you know, a lot of times

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500
You run into this tool bias

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500
And this is going to be a theme of their conversation

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.500
As we go forward, tool bias

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500
Well, I know I can

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500
Make it work under Excel

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500
Well, I learned how to do it in

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.500
Well, I know that

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500
I've done it before

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500
Under, you've heard those

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500
Excuses before, why you can't switch to Linux

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
And maybe

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500
The strategy actually is

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.500
Maybe Microsoft and definitely

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500
Apple got it right all along

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500
Get them while they're young, maybe that's what it is

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500
I think that's why

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500
A lot of these, I'm reading a lot more

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
Initiatives about open source

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500
And education and the way that people are not

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
Only taking open source principles and importing them

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500
Into classroom settings, but what they're doing is they're trying

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.500
To change

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.500
Computer education to talk

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
About digital rights

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
And to talk about privacy rights

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.500
And to talk about openness and to talk about

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.500
The way that the tools we use define

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500
Our capabilities in some way

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500
That is extraordinarily important

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500
Those initiatives are extraordinarily important because

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Like you say

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.500
People who don't

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
People like us are reflexive about the tools we use

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
We care about them, other people don't, and that doesn't

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500
It's not a criticism, it's just

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500
It is what it is

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
To have a tool

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
Synonymous with the job, I use X to do Y

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500
If I don't have to think about

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.500
Using X to do Y, that's better for me

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500
So when I learn that X does Y

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.500
Whether it's LibreOffice or Word or whatever

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500
It might be, that's what I'm going to go to

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500
That's what I'm going to use

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500
Getting started early

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500
As has been the Microsoft strategy

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
As has been the Apple strategy

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.500
Getting people started early is

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500
Teaching them to associate their computing

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500
Experience and their computing habits

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500
With open source solutions, I feel like

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500
Sounds like a great strategy

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.500
If I were to be invited

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
To a school board and they said, Noah, tell me

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Tell me why we should use this software

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500
That or the other, I would

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500
Submit to them that by

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500
Implementing things like LibreOffice

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500
You empower your students

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
With more, so it's more

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500
Fair to your students, so for example

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
A financially underprivileged

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Student is going to have a hard time kicking out

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.500
What's the education version, $100, $200

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500
Or whatever, so even that is a lot

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.500
Of money for a high school student or even some

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500
College students to pay for

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.500
So this idea that if a professor is

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.500
Going to release a presentation, why not

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.500
Release that in LibreOffice

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500
Where everyone can download it and use it

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500
I have two things to say about that

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.500
The first is that

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500
It's an uphill battle because people

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500
Associate openness with price

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
With open source software with price

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
And so what they will do is they will say, oh, well

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.500
You get a student discount on Microsoft Word

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.500
There's no reason for you to

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.500
If you really have a problem, you can get a free

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500
Copy, you can present a financial hardship

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.500
Application or whatever

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.500
And get the software for free, and it's like

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500
People don't understand that it's not about that

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500
But for so many people

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500
It is, so we need to fight that fight

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500
I like this

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500
Idea

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500
I want to change the conversation

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500
When somebody says, well look, I can get Microsoft Office

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.500
For free or I can get it with a discount

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.500
You say, it's not about that

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500
It's about, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500
Sure, you can buy today's version

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
But just look

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.500
At how much it changes over the last few years

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.500
You can learn

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
See, when you learn Microsoft Office

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
You are learning Microsoft Office

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500
When you learn

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500
LibreOffice, you are learning

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500
Skills that apply to a free platform

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
That can be applicable anywhere

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
In the world

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
There's such a huge difference

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
When you

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
Learn skills that work with LibreOffice

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Versus Microsoft

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
I feel like what we need to do is we need to change the

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500
Yeah, you can get a discount on Microsoft Office

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.500
Sure, yeah, you can do that, of course you can

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
And you can

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
Become super well skilled

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500
In a very limited time product

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500
But technology is always changing

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500
It's always moving forward

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.500
And LibreOffice allows you to stay current

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500
You keep

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500
It's free, you can keep staying up to date

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500
You can keep that skill set

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500
Now, let's talk about specifically

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
How to get past that bias

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
Of, well, I've seen this font

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
And I like the way this font looks

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500
Or I know this application

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500
Like Publisher, that was a huge one

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
When I was trying to convert somebody

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
Somebody special in my life

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500
I tried to convert to Linux, and they couldn't do it because of

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.500
Publisher

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500
How do you get past that tool bias? Well, Brian and Noah

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500
Have some thoughts, and Noah shares his

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
Super secret trick

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
Welcome

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
On opensource.com last week, we had a new author

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
Her name's Lee Brian, she told

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
We have a regularly

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.500
Occurring column series on opensource.com

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500
Called My Linux Story

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
And it's where people who, it's where people come on

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
And just tell their story about how they got started with Linux

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500
Why it appeals to them, and sort of

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.500
Where it's taken them in their life

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500
And we had a really great column last week by

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.500
A newbie writer, Lee Brian

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500
Who wrote about, wrote her Linux story

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.500
And talked about how tough it was

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500
For her to adopt opensource tools as a student

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500
Because teachers

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.500
Would see that the default font

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.500
Was different in the documents, or the margins were wrong

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.500
Oh, they rail against it, yeah

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.500
Yeah, they rail against it, and it's like

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
You know, a lot of great comments, over 100

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
Comments on that story, people just saying they didn't

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.500
Understand why

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500
You know, the criticism was about

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
The way the paper was laid out, and that was written

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.500
And why

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.500
The tool became so important

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
And I didn't know how to answer those comments

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500
You know, I really didn't understand

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500
I haven't yet figured out the strategy

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.500
For how you dislodge

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500
You know, the bias towards

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.500
Certain ways that things appear, and the way that

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.500
You know, certain tools function

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.500
And make their final product, it just doesn't make any sense

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.500
So, I had a client

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500
She had a

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
She had a computer, and it had failed

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.500
And I went to take a look at it, and she goes

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.500
Can we put Windows 7 back on there? And I said, well

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.500
You know, let me tell you about Ubuntu

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.500
You know, it's a software we use, it has

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.500
It is basically immune to virus

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.500
Spamware comes with the, we're going to put

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.500
An office suite on there, we're going to provide that for you

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.500
Your mail client is going to be there, you're going to be able to do all the same

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.500
Things, and she worked in an

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.500
Environment where all she was doing was office documents

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.500
And I said, you know, it's really, it's going to work just as

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.500
In fact, she was even using LibreOffice

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.500
I said, it's going to work just the same as Windows, except it'll be

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.500
A little bit more reliable for you and such

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500
And I get done explaining that, and she goes, no, I'd really rather have

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.500
Windows 7, and I said, alright, well, no problem

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.500
We'll go ahead and get the restore disk sorted for you

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.500
Because we don't have those, so I'll get those from HP

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.500
So, call HP

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.500
Order the restore disk, they said it's going to be 7 to 10 business days

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.500
So I called her back and said, so, it's going to be a little bit

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.500
Before we can get that out to you, and she goes

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.500
Do you have a loaner computer? I said, I do

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.500
We have plenty of them, but I don't have anything with Windows on it

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.500
I'm sorry, it's just we can't pay for the license

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.500
It's just going to be a pain

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.500
And she goes, well, I guess if it's only for

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.500
10 days, I'll use it, and I said, okay, sure

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.500
Great, Trojan horse

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.500
So we get it put into her place

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.500
Into her desk, now I paid $53

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
For the recovery disks, which, if we had restored

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.500
Her computer, that would have gotten passed off to her

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.500
Plus, I would have charged her for my time to come out and install it

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500
So, I come back out

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.500
And I said, hey, I just want to let you know that

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.500
The restore disk came in, so we'll be there on Friday to restore your computer

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
And she goes, is it too late

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
To change my mind? Because, I'm not

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.500
Going to lie, I actually

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.500
This is working really well, and she's like, I've never

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.500
Had my computer perform this fast

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.500
Now, I do have a secret weapon

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500
When I switch people to Linux, or when I get them to try Linux

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500
The first time, traditionally

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.500
Computers, this might change in the near future

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
But right now, desktop computers are

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.500
Typically shipping with spinning rust

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.500
And so, what I'll do is, I'll rip that out

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
And I'll swap it for an SSD

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.500
And there are a couple people in the chat room, they always give me

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500
Crap about it, and they say, wow, you're being dishonest

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500
You're misrepresenting, and I'm like, you know

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500
I'm giving Linux a little bit of an edge

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.500
You know, when you get it on that SSD, all of a sudden

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500
You click on something and everything flies, it's like

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.500
Oh, this is way faster. Well, she told me, she goes

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.500
This is just so much more faster and responsive to

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.500
What I'm used to, and

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.500
But I keep it, and at that point, it's like, wow

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.500
This is where the whole commitment to open source comes in

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.500
Because I'm just going to eat the cost and tell her, alright

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.500
So, you know, it was all set up

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500
And so, you know, we didn't end up billing her for anything

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.500
Yeah, exactly, but

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.500
The point was, what you were talking about

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.500
Once you can get past your preconceived

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
Ideas of how something should function

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500
Or how something should be, once you can

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.500
Get past that, and she didn't have a choice, because

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500
We just sat the computer in front of her, once she

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
Got past that, then all of a sudden

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:25.500
Linux became a viable option for her

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500
I like

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
Inagura's comment in the chat room

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500
Cost of the SSD is basically

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.500
The cost of a Windows license, and it's a one-time

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.500
Investment. What a great point

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.500
What a great point. So,

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.500
We got a couple of mumble

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Commentary. Kits and Kitty, I wanted to start with you

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.500
First. You made a great comment during

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.500
That clip, and I wanted to let you jump in right now

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.500
Yeah, one of the things that I do

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.500
Because I work in sales

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
Is when I want to sell somebody on a

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.500
Product, I ask them, well

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.500
What do you like about

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.500
What you're currently using?

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.500
Tell me about that. And then I

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.500
Use that as ammunition

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500
To push the sell

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500
Because I know everything

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500
About the product that I sell

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500
So you say, what feels

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.500
Good? What do you like about

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.500
Solution A?

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.500
Exactly

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500
And a lot of times what you

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.500
Will find is people

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500
Don't have much to say

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.500
About the product that they have

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500
So then that lets you

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Come in and present

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500
Option B. Actually

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500
I don't want to

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.500
Skip over this. This is

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500
Pure brilliance. Make them

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500
Focus on what they like. What do you

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.500
Like about X, right?

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500
And then say, okay, well you know what

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.500
I get that. And by the way

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.500
Y provides this and even

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500
More. And I think if you could make that

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500
Case, that's a very, very, very strong

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
Way to do that. Great point

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.500
Kitson. Sunsol, you wanted to make a comment about

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.500
Awareness overall. Go ahead.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
So I'm in the same

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500
Boat as I guess most people

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500
So I'm trying to make people

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.500
Aware, especially in my

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500
Small community. People who are

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.500
Blind or visually impaired about Linux

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500
How it can help you

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.500
Especially for how it's advantageous for them

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500
So I always present the case of

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.500
Look, what is your current

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.500
Workflow and how does it work for you

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500
And I try to show them this is how this

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.500
Can work for you because

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.500
In my line of people

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500
They have to be shown

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.500
It's kind of like

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500
What Noah and Brian had started

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.500
Talking about, about change. A lot of people

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500
Are really hard on change

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500
So when you try to show them

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.500
Something new and try to show them the benefits

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.500
They're almost not willing to accept it unless you can show them

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.500
A good way of how this is really going to

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500
Enforce a good change.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500
Wow. Great point.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500
And thank you for bringing up the accessibility aspect of that too.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.500
Great point.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.500
And

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500
You know, I wanted to talk about

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500
As we move, as we zoom

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
Out a little bit because that's

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500
Such a good point and yet

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
It's really in the weeds, right? And so

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
How do you address that at a

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
Global level? And

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.500
As somebody who has followed

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500
Linux forever

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500
Basically

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500
I've never really known where to put

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.500
Red Hat, right?

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
I grok a lot of what they

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.500
Do. At the same time, I kind of

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500
I'm inclined because

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500
They're worth a lot of money and they're

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500
A company. I'm inclined to put them

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500
Sort of at a far and

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.500
Watch them at a distance.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500
That could all change though.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
I don't know where I'm going to stand.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500
I'll tell you more about this, but we had something

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Really unique happen this last week for

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
The Linux Action Show and

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500
Red Hat. And

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500
This clip with Brian

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.500
And Noah touches a little bit on this. I'm going to

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500
Expand on this more after we play this, but

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500
Let's talk about Red Hat a little bit.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.500
Welcome.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.500
I guess what surprises me so much about Red Hat

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500
Is they're so big.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500
And I guess I'm surprised

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500
I shouldn't be, I guess, but

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500
I guess I was pleasantly

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
Surprised at how such a big company

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.500
Can get to a point and still

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.500
Maintain their integrity. They still

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500
Maintain that really strong

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500
Sense of community and they really get it.

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
I mean, they really, really get it.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500
Well, you know, it's really great to hear you say that

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.500
Because I feel that way.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500
And if I can just make one more

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.500
Shameless plug, our CEO

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500
Jim Whitehurst just wrote a book about this

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.500
Very topic. It's called

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.500
The Open Organization.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.500
And it's about Whitehurst's

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.500
Time at Red Hat.

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.500
He's very open about the fact that he came

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.500
From Delta seven or eight years ago.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500
Very traditional hierarchical

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500
Organization, you know, real button

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500
Down, straight laced place. And he came

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
To Red Hat and he thought his mission was going to be

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500
As he says in the book, I thought my mission was going to be

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.500
To clean this place up. This is chaotic.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.500
You know, this company

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.500
Is just, you know, it's doing things

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500
In a way that I've never seen things done before.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500
And he said instead of changing the company

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.500
The company changed him. So he wrote

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500
This book that I just finished reading

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.500
And we write about on open source dot com

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500
A little bit. It's called The Open Organization

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
And it's about the ways that open source principles

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Function in organizations.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500
The way that they actually present a model

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
For organizing that is more in line

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500
With 21st century business practices, right?

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
And the way that, you know, our

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
Economy today demands in some ways

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500
Demands that companies

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500
Adopt open source principles. So what he says

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.500
Is that, you know, Red Hat's been a great project

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.500
And it's taught him a lot. But what he's saying in the book

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500
Is that other companies can begin

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
To adopt, you know, these principles

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.500
And make their companies

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.500
Open. And in fact they will have to survive.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500
Yeah.

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
Now, this is something I'm pretty fascinated by.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500
How connected

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500
Is Red Hat with the community?

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500
And really how tuned in are they?

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500
So we're going to do something kind of unique.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500
Something we've never done

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
For really the history of the Linux

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Action show.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500
We're going to totally drop the format

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.500
Of the show. And we're going to do a special Linux

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
Action show visits Red Hat on Friday

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.500
At 3 p.m. Pacific. Go to

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500
Time.

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500
Self was

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500
Kind of within range of Red Hat's

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.500
Corporate offices. And so

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500
Producer Q5 Sis and

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.500
Noah went out there

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500
And talked to Red Hat. And we

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500
Have three hours plus

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.500
More than three hours

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Of footage. And we're going to try

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
To whittle all of it down to the best of in about an hour

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Format. And for

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500
The next week's Linux Action show

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500
For just that episode we're going to

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
Kind of

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
Throw the format out the airlock

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500
If I could use a Star Trek reference

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
If I could. And for episode

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
370 it's going to be the Linux Action

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
Show visits Red Hat's offices.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500
And we're going to go down there and talk to them about this.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.500
And so when I heard that interview with

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500
Brian I got pretty excited about that.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500
And I'm really looking

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500
For that. So this Friday join us won't you.

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500
We're going to do a special 3pm Pacific

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500
For a Linux Action

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500
Show visits Red Hat. Now

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500
That was Brian from

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500
Opensource dot com. We'll have links to his material

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500
In the show notes. Thank you to Brian too for tuning

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.500
In. And apparently he's a big fan of

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.500
The network too. Which I am

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
You know I can't lie. I'm a fan

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500
Of him too. So Semi-Robotic

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.500
He's known as online. And we'll have

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.500
A link to his blog and more

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
In the show notes if you want to follow up with Brian.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
Now we have one more thing

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500
To get to.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500
Something really special. I'm really looking forward to playing this.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500
And part of it is because

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500
When I play this next clip I think

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500
Of all of you outside the good old

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.500
United States of America. Who

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.500
Don't get really exposed to that good old

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.500
Southern twine. Well this next

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.500
Clip is going to be Alan Hicks. A long time

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500
Contributor to the Slackware project. In fact

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
The man

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.500
Who wrote the book on Slackware.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.500
He's going to join Noah. He's going to talk

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.500
About self. He's going to talk about Slackware.

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.500
I really want to play this clip for you. But first

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.500
I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.500
Last sponsor

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.500
Of the Linux Unplugged program. Go to Digital Ocean

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.500
Won't you? And use our promo code

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.500
DOUNPLUGED. That'll give you a $10 credit.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.500
Get a $5 rig. Try it out for a couple

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500
Of months absolutely for free.

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500
Now what I love about Digital Ocean

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500
Is they're a company that recognized

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500
That look there's a few key points we got to hit.

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
We got to have great connectivity.

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.500
Like for example they just built out the new data

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.500
Center over in Germany.

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.500
40 gigabit e-connections

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.500
To each hypervisor.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500
Their fastest SSDs yet.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500
And like Digital Ocean

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.500
Is like a tactical strike when they do this

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.500
Kind of thing. They made sure that when

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500
They picked their data

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500
This new data center in Germany it's

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500
Perfect if like not only

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.500
Germany is a great country but you got to distribute

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
To anybody around Germany

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.500
This is a great data center. So 40 gigabit

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.500
E-connections to each hypervisor.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.500
Their fastest SSDs yet.

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
That's awesome.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500
But really what I love about Digital Ocean is they

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500
Early on decided we're going to go SSD only.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500
They made that bet way

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500
Before anybody else.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500
And yeah you know

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500
Linux is the obvious bet. And yeah

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500
KVMs are the obvious

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.500
Bet. But for a commercial

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.500
Company to go out there

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500
And base their entire company around

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500
Linux. Around

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.500
KVM.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500
That's a bold bet.

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500
That's a bold bet. I got to respect

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500
That. And that's what Digital Ocean

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500
Did. But they realized it's not just

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500
Linux. It's not just KVM.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500
We got to have super great hardware.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
We got to have SSDs. We got to have the

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
Best best best data centers anywhere.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500
And that's why Digital Ocean has data center locations

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500
In New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500
London and that new one in Germany. Right?

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500
And you can get started in less than a minute.

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500
You can get started in less than a minute.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500
And remember use the promo code

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
DOUNPLUGGED. You'll get a $10 credit.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500
You can try out Digital Ocean a couple of months for free

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500
Because for $5 a month

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
You can get a $5. $5 a month.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500
Just $5. That's less than a burger.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500
512 megabytes of RAM.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500
A 20 gigabyte SSD.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500
One CPU.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500
And a terabyte of transfer.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.500
That's crazy.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500
For $5 a month. That's crazy.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500
And if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
Not only are you supporting the show and keeping us on the air

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
But you're going to get a $10 credit. You can try it out for 2 months for free.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500
Guys. Go try out

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
Core OS. Go try it.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
Core OS is like. I don't know.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
I love it. Because you know me. I'm all in

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500
On rolling. But there are some

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
Serious disadvantages to our rolling distribution.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
Well Core OS sort of solves that. Right?

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500
Between containerization. Between Docker. Between the rolling

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500
Base OS. That's a great solution.

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500
And Digital Ocean worked with the upstream project

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500
To make sure that way you get the

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500
Updates directly from the Core OS

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
Project. I love that.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500
Digital Ocean has the big picture

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500
In mind. And when you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.500
DOUNPLUGGED

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.500
DOUNPLUGGED. One word.

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Lower case.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
You get a $10 credit.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
I want you to just experience it.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.500
Go create a machine. They have an HTML5

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500
Based console. You can get from post all the way

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500
Up to the boot screen.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.500
All HTML5. From your mobile

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500
Device to your desktop. No

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
Flash required. You know you love that.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
You can transfer devices

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
Between clients. So if you want to make something for somebody

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.500
And sell it to them. You can.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500
They have the best tutorials on the web.

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
I'm sorry Arch Wiki.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500
Fact of the matter is. Digital

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500
Ocean has you beat. Ah you're a good

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.500
Number 2 Arch Wiki. And

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500
Gentoo. Yeah you're number 3.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500
But the Digital Ocean

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.500
The Digital Ocean documentation is so good

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.500
Because they're actually willing to pay people to write that

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.500
Stuff. And they actually have open

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500
Positions right now for technical

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500
Writers. That way.

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500
It's all about. You can get started. You can do one

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500
Application deployment. Sure yeah you can deploy Ruby on

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.500
Rails. Wordpress. Ghost with one

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500
Click. That's pretty cool.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
But you might run into a wall.

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500
And you might decide. Well okay I've done this

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500
But now I'm not getting anything out of

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500
This.

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500
That's where this really

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
Really good tutorials kick in.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
And you can get a little more out of Digital Ocean. Go to DigitalOcean.com

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Right now. DigitalOcean.com

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500
And use the promo code DO

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
Unplugged. It's all one word. Lowercase.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500
You'll get a $10 credit. You can try out a

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
$5 droplet. Two months for free.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500
If you've been a long time Linux

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500
User. Maybe this is

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500
The opportunity. To

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500
Experiment with FreeBSD. Cause they've got those

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Droplets as well. Or maybe if you've been a long

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
Time Debian user. If you've been a long time

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Red Hat user. Try out

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500
Core OS. It's a different approach

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
To doing Linux.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
And I think it's gonna go big.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
DigitalOcean.com

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
Use the promo code DO Unplugged.

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
Sponsoring.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
Linux Unplugged Program. Alright. Now before I completely

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
Die of heat suffocation in this freaking

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
Studio. Cause it is freaking hot.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
It is ridiculous. I want to play Alan

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
Hicks. Now you may have heard of Alan

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
Hicks if you were a Slackware user before.

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
He wrote the book on Slackware. Or he was part of it.

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500
He's been a long, long, long

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500
Time contributor to open source.

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
And he's one of the main contributors to the Southeast

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500
Linux Fest Conference itself.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
So he sat down with Noah.

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500
And he talked about South. And can I give

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
If you've been wondering, is this something I

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500
Should attend? Is this something, is this worth

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
Me spending the money to fly out there and visit?

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500
Well, this talk might give you a little

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
Perspective.

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500
Welcome. So Alan, tell me

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500
Tell me who you are. And

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.500
And what distro you're using.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500
Well, the distro I'm

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500
Using is obviously gonna be Slackware.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500
That's what I've been using since about 2001

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
When I got started. Actually 2000

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500
When I got started. But

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500
My name's Alan Hicks. I've been

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
Working with Slackware and

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.500
Working professionally

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500
With Linux for

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500
14, 15 years now.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.500
I'm currently a

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.500
System administrator for

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.500
Well, I forget what

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500
Our new name is. Cronky Sports

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
Group or something. We recently got purchased

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.500
And we're going through name changes.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.500
So I'm not sure about all that.

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
But I've

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
Been involved in a lot of different projects.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500
I've been

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.500
One of the most frequent speakers here

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500
Itself. This is actually the

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.500
First year ever that I'm not gonna be speaking

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
Presenting, doing networking

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500
Stuff. This is the first year that

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.500
I'm just taking it easy and enjoying the conference.

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500
Yeah, yeah. You are in

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500
Relax mode this year. But even on relax mode

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500
Alan, I watched you set up tables down

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
That way and people pull you right and left.

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500
Well, it's just

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.500
The way it goes. You know, 80 percent

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.500
Of the people do 80 percent of the work.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
I was one of those unfortunate

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.500
20 percent when I was born.

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.500
So this is what I think

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500
Is particularly

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.500
Kind of cool about self, right? Is that

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.500
We have, you and I

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.500
We both like Linux. And we could talk about

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.500
Linux all day long. But the reality is the

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.500
Majority of the conversation that occurred last night

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.500
Was about guns.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.500
Was about guns and about politics and how the world's

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.500
Going to hell in a handbasket.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.500
And that is something that I

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500
Don't get at other conferences.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500
And I think part of that is

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
Because of the nature of the open

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500
Source community. We all want to build relationships

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500
With each other. It's not just about how can

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500
I make money off of this? Or how can your

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.500
Project benefit mine? When I go, when I used

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
To travel for work, I would

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500
Go to conferences and it would be a very typical conversation

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500
We talk about what we do. And then at the end of it

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.500
It would be, well, I think our company

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Would really like to work with yours. I think that you could

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500
Really be an asset to us. And I think that we could

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500
Really be an asset to you. And if you put me in touch with

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
Your PR people, I could put you in touch with my

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500
Secretary. You know, that kind of nonsense.

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.500
And that's not the kind of environment

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
I see here.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500
Yeah, and I've never really liked those kinds

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.500
Of environments. This is really the

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
Only conference I ever attend each year.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
And I've only been to one or

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.500
Two others and they were in

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500
South Paulo, Brazil for a

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500
Slackware conference many years ago.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500
And I don't

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.500
Really go for the whole

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500
Corporate networking thing.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500
That's just not me.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.500
I'm not big

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
On that. I don't enjoy that aspect.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500
I like a one

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500
On one relationship with a person.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500
Rather than a business

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.500
To business relationship. And

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500
While there's plenty of businesses here

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
Who have their wares,

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
Their offerings and stuff

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:05.500
On display and will, you know,

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.500
Happily work with you. Self is

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500
Really geared towards that

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500
One on one relationship person to person.

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
Yeah, and my experience has been the same.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500
And it's not that I particularly enjoy

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
Corporate networking.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
I just sometimes feel like I don't have much of a choice.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500
Because if I want to provide

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500
A competitive advantage to my clients,

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
Then what that forces me to do sometimes

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.500
Is to become,

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500
I have to become knowledgeable and I have to

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500
Work with those people. And a lot of

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
Those companies, the way that they want to do business

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.500
Is they have it all

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500
Situated. They have everything

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500
Kind of set out the way that they want you to follow a

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
Process. And then

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Deviate from it. And you're exactly right.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
When you want to talk to, you have a problem with a

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
SQL database, you can go find the guy that did SQLite.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.500
You have a problem with Red Hat. I can go talk to Red Hat

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.500
Right there. There's a guy right there from Red Hat.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500
If I wanted to talk about Slackware,

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.500
I'll ask the guy that wrote the book.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.500
And you'll tell me about Slackware.

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500
Yeah.

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.500
That's what I love about these conferences, you guys.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.500
Is, you know,

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
I sat down at lunch and had a barbecued

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500
Salmon with the guy that wrote my SQL.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500
And that's

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
Different. It's different. It's an experience.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500
And so, Southeast

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500
I gotta go next year.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
I gotta go to that. It's a really

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500
Cool experience. And thank you to Alan Hicks

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500
And thank you to Brian for stopping by and chatting

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
With Noah. And

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.500
I can't go forward without saying a huge

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500
Thank you to Noah

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500
For all of his crazy

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500
Hard work.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500
Only I know how hard he worked

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.500
And I really

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
Really, really, really, really, really

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500
Appreciate it. He is awesome.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500
Now, one of the other guys

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
That's awesome is producer Q5 Sis

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
And he had a talk itself

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500
That I think might be right up your alley.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500
He talked about creating

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.500
Your own Linux laptop.

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500
Building your own Linux laptop.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500
This is an hour and

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500
Five minute talk. I can't play for it.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
I cannot. I'm sorry.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500
I cannot do it. But I wanted to

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500
I went in about six minutes

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500
Into his talk. I have the whole thing linked

01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500
In the show notes. Really, if you've ever

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500
Wanted about building your own laptop, now

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500
Is a better time than ever.

01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:13.500
I jumped in about six minutes

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500
Where he talks about batteries. So you want to get a

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500
Board that's going to be power efficient and

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.500
Still be able to accomplish the tasks

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.500
That you're going to want to accomplish.

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500
As for

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.500
The screen, who's heard of Adafruit?

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500
I love this.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500
If anyone that has their hands

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500
Up, is anyone next to

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500
Them that is a friend of them that doesn't have their hand up?

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500
This is

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500
This question right here is Mr. Q5

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500
Sis. Producer Q5 Sis.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500
Perfect. This is what it's like

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
To work with Mr. Q5 Sis.

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500
He's so great because he

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500
Once he researches something

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500
Once he understands something

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
He evangelizes it.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500
Don't we all do that? And he's so great

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500
About that. Not your friends.

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500
I want to back up a little bit. I want to play a little bit of this

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500
For you. I want to back up.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500
Hold on. I want to play a little bit of him talking about this for you.

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500
So you can find the whole talk.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500
And there is a couple of minutes where you might

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500
Have some audio issues. Do not worry about that.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500
There was a little bit of YouTube issues.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500
I think top 2 needed enhancement.

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Oh there we go.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500
So he

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500
Notes to me here that there's a couple of minutes where

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500
YouTube didn't quite capture the Hangouts audio.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500
So if you listen to the

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
I have a link to the show notes. Mr. Q5 Sis

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
Talks about battery issues.

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
3D printing your own laptop.

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500
Building it around a Raspberry Pi.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
All of those topics are in his talk.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
And I have it linked in the show notes.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500
It's over an hour so I can't play the whole thing.

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
But I really recommend you check it out.

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500
And it is also like Micro 89 points out

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
Available in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500
Oh yes. The Linux Action Show subreddit.

You weren't happy?

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500
What? What?

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.500
We didn't do it? What?

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.500
You weren't happy?

01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500
Okay. I'll take that.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500
I am trying to figure out what all of you

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.500
Are doing in response to the last pass.

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.500

Of the Linux Unplugged program.

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500
And let me know. Are you going to switch

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.500
To key paths?

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.500
I want to know. The anime says he's doing nothing.

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.500
Hmm. Okay.

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.500
Alright. I'll take that as well.

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500
Go over there and let me know what your plans are

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.500

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.500
Kids and Kitty, you've submitted

a straw poll.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.500

Go ahead.

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.500
Are you muted? Still having trouble with that mic, kid?

So, Kids and Kitty

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500
asked the live stream, will you be migrating

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.500
away from LastPass? And it's just a simple

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.500
yes or no question.

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.500
And I'm going to vote no right now.

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.500
But I'm curious.

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:07.500
Ooh, it's split. It's literally split right now.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.500
50-50. 50-50 in the live stream.

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.500
Ooh, wow.

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.500
Wow, you guys. Really?

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.500
Should've had third options

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.500
because I'm using KeyPass

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.500
and there's no option for that.

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.500
No, no, no. Because that's a no.

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
If you're going to KeyPass, that's a clear no.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.500
No, I like this. Two options is good.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.500
It's good.

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.500
I specifically did that

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.500
intentionally because the

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.500
question is, would

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:35.500
you move away? Right.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.500
So, it's irrelevant whether or not

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.500
you have LastPass now

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.500
per se, as

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.500
if you were using it, would

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:45.500
you move away?

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.500
Are we going to be talking about Fedora again?

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.500
No, I think we're all done. Why? Do you have something to say?

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.500
I just tried it out this week.

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.500
It's awesome.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.500
Should've tried it out last week.

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.500
I'm sold.

01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.500
I'm sold. I wiped the

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.500
SUSE partition

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.500
after I used it

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.500
for a few days.

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.500
Whoa.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.500
So, you're like switching?

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.500
You're that sold?

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.500
I am that sold and I'm a hard

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.500
sell from SUSE.

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.500
Okay, all right. What is the big

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.500
diff? Because at the end of the day, they're both

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.500
RPM distros.

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.500
One's got the build service. One's got

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.500
copper. What?

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.500
What's the big difference?

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.500
You know what sold me was the fact that

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.500
everything was just so consistent.

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.500
I didn't have to, pardon the language,

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.500
dick around with four

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.500
different software managers

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.500
to do what I wanted to do.

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.500
I could go into software or I go into

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.500
DNF. Oh, yeah. It is a bit of a

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.500
it's a little

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.500
I sometimes feel like OpenSUSE is a little

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.500
bipolar. It's a little

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.500
chaotic in that sense. There's a lot of

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.500
different tools available to you. And that honestly

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.500
maybe is my bias of all the transitions they've

01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.500
done with their package manager. But when I sit down

01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:59.500
to use it, I feel like

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:01.500
there's a lot of places I go to manage sources

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.500
and I just

01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.500
but I felt like with Fedora,

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.500
okay, I've got DNF repos and

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.500
I've got GNOME software. Boom, boom. I can use

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:11.500
it on the command line or I use it in the GUI. Is that how you

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.500
felt?

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500
Largely. And the other thing

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.500
is that I noticed is every

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.500
time I wanted to do something with

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.500
this installing software

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.500
at one point, it wanted to

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.500
drag a bunch

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.500
of packages in

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.500
because they were part of the

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.500
meta package that I had installed.

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.500
So I had to taboo those

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.500
in Yast. And they would

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.500
still want to install.

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.500
And heaven forbid, you have to do any kind of

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.500
conflict resolution

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.500
through Yast. That's

01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.500
where it kind of gets hairy because

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.500
I feel like when I have to do

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.500
conflict resolution for RPMs and dependencies

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.500
and because the meta package

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.500
wants to be able to replace a package that another

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.500
meta package wants, all of a

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.500
sudden I feel like I'm back in like 2006,

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:59.500
2004

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.500
Linux. And

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.500
I kind of just start shutting

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.500
down and I think my time could be

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500
spent better than this.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.500
But, okay, come on chatroom.

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.500
Come on. Strawpoll.me.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.500
Strawpoll.me.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.500
Oh, I'm, alright, well

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.500
see

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.500
the problem is like 40

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.500
to 50% of the people are not even in the

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
chatroom. So I've got to give it to them over air.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.500
The strawpoll URL sucks, but it's

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.500
strawpoll.me slash 46

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.500
53

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:31.500
78

01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.500
strawpoll.me

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.500
slash 46

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.500
53

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
782.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.500
And there's a link in the chatroom.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.500
We have 19 votes

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.500
right now. 20 votes.

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.500
I just can't see moving away from

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:49.500
last pass. It seems too practical to me.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.500
But I, at the same time,

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:53.500
like part of me recognizes they are a

01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.500
huge, huge, huge

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.500
target.

01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.500
On another

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.500
note, I kind of wish that Colonel

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.500
Linux would have been here to join us

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.500
because I wanted to

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.500
ask him if he ever saw anybody

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.500
show up the self

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.500
in full leather bondage gear.

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.500
Confused. Okay, alright, okay,

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.500
alright, okay. So

01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:17.500
going on at the same time of

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.500
Southeast Linux Fest is the southern

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:21.500
I don't even know the whole acronym, but it's like

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.500
Southeast Leather Fest

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:25.500
and it's a leather

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.500
fest. And

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.500
last year, if you searched Twitter for

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.500
self, you got pictures of

01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.500
65 year old ladies in leather.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.500
Now, this year

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:37.500
they coordinated and self had

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.500
there was self and then

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.500
there was the Southeast Leather Fest and they had their own

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.500
hashtag separate from self.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.500
But no, Noah

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.500
very, very much so. I believe

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.500
I'm not positive. I think

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.500
he's in Amsterdam right now.

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.500
So what Noah does is

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.500
Noah works at like

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.500
300-400 percent

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.500
and I'm not exaggerating. I've never known

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.500
anybody who's ever worked

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.500
harder in his life. I don't

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.500
know how his wife and

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.500
his kids accommodated,

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.500
but nobody works harder than Noah.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:11.500
And so he goes out to these conferences

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.500
and then he's hooking up with a

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.500
buddy of his and I think he's in Amsterdam

01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:17.500
right now. So he goes out

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.500
and he just totally goes all in

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.500
on these conferences.

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:23.500
And then I think right now he's like

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.500
on his way home, on his way

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.500
home from self, he's stopping by

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.500
Amsterdam and he's having a party with his buddy

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.500
and then he's going to go home.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.500
And then he'll be back by Friday so that way we can

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.500
do the Linux action show.

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500
That's pretty crazy. But I think that's

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
how he rolls so that's why he couldn't join us today.

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500
Swift,

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.500
I'm okay. I'm a little stressed out.

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:51.500
Yeah, it has been very difficult

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.500
to make all of this happen centrally

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.500
and it has been very hard

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.500
to watch all of it happen remotely, if

01:55:57.500 --> 01:55:59.500
that makes sense. So it has been very

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.500
hard technically to pull it all off

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.500
because Jupyter Broadcasting has grown

01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:05.500
and so we have

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.500
Roku devices and

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500
Tivo's and audio

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.500
streams and web browsers

01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500
and VLC that when you

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.500
think you can tune in live and watch,

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.500
you think you can go to your Roku app or you

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.500
think you can go to the Kodi app

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.500
or whatever, XBMC app, whatever,

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.500
and just watch live. It takes

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.500
a crazy amount of coordination

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.500
behind the scenes to actually deliver content

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.500
at all of those endpoints.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.500
And thankfully Rekai and I

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.500
really, Rekai managed

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.500
to pull it all off, but it was very stressful.

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.500
And it was also stressful because

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.500
I wasn't there. I really wanted to be

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
there. But otherwise, I'm okay.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.500
I'm good. I'm very happy.

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.500
I think Noah is an incredible

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.500
asset. So I'm very good

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.500
about that. And Rekai has been amazing.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.500
So everybody say thank you to Rekai

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
for how hard he worked this weekend.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.500
We don't pay him to work over the weekend and

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.500
yet he did. And

01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:59.500
he made it possible for us

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.500
to stream the content from self-live

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.500
to all of the endpoint destinations.

01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.500
The beard made it all

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.500
happen. So thank you to Rekai.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.500
And as

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.500
all things, our poll is

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.500
completely split down the middle. If you're a long time listener

01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.500
or a viewer, you know,

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:17.500
everything, every freaking

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.500
poll, every

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.500
time, goes 50-50. You know

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.500
what this happens if you've been

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:25.500
listening. You know this if you've been

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.500
following for awhile.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.500
16 votes say...

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.500
This is so ridiculous.

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:33.500
I can't even...

01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.500
Okay. We've had

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.500
31 votes from the live stream.

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.500
This is incredible.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.500
I didn't

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.500
expect anything less.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:45.500
16 people will move away from

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.500
LastPass and 16 people will not.

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.500
It's

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.500
literally split right

01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.500
down the middle. You guys

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500
are such sons of bitches. You are

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.500
so hard to please because you are

01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.500
literally split on every single

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:01.500
topic. And you know if you've been watching

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.500
for awhile, you know this is true.

01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:05.500
You know I always run into this.

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.500
You are so hard. I

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:09.500
love you though. I love you.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.500
Chris, um,

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.500
blue bricks or red curtains?

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.500
I'm sorry.

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:25.500
Well, last week it was blue bricks and the week before that it was red curtains, obviously.
