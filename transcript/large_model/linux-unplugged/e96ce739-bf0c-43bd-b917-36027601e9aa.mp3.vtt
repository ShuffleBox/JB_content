00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
In celebration of Unix turning 50 today, we open with a special clip.

00:05.480 --> 00:11.520
Back in 1969, a couple of computer scientists here at Bell Labs started to develop some

00:11.520 --> 00:15.020
programs they needed for their own use.

00:15.020 --> 00:19.700
What Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie started developing then has evolved into the Unix

00:19.700 --> 00:24.240
operating system, which by now is widely used around the world.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.060
We were trying to make computing as simple as possible.

00:27.060 --> 00:32.080
In the late 1960s, Dennis Ritchie and I realized that the then current operating systems were

00:32.080 --> 00:33.940
much too complex.

00:33.940 --> 00:40.400
We attempted to reverse this trend by building a small, simple operating system on a minicomputer.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.160
What we wanted to preserve was not just a good programming environment in which to do

00:45.160 --> 00:58.880
programming, but a system around which a community could form, fellowship.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.400
Hello friends and welcome into the Unplugged program.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
My name is Chris.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
And my name is Wes.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
Hello, Wes.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
Hello.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.080
You know, we have something special planned for old 324.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.120
Oh, we've been hard at work.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.120
We have.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.840
We've been having a lot of fun this week.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.720
We wanted to put ZFS and Extended 4 to the test.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.000
The promise of ZFS is pretty high.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, yeah.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.320
But is there a performance bottleneck for that data security?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.600
What's this going to be like using it for real day to day?

01:26.600 --> 01:30.680
Yeah, maybe you're on a laptop, you've got an SSD, but it's nothing super fancy.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.600
In our case, this week, we used a Samsung Evo 850.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.800
And we wanted to see how Extended 4 and ZFS performed against each other in both normal

01:40.800 --> 01:44.120
conditions and lower memory conditions.

01:44.120 --> 01:50.080
Maybe you've got a few electron apps running, you've got some tabs going, how then do things

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
perform?

01:51.080 --> 01:53.480
And what kind of penalty do you take for that data security?

01:53.480 --> 01:54.520
Or do you?

01:54.520 --> 01:55.520
So we wanted to find out.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.560
Plus, we've got some more thoughts on 1910.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.240
And we've also been running Pop OS as just our daily driver, which has been pretty great.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
We have some thoughts on that.

02:04.240 --> 02:09.040
And I had a quick chat with Carl from System76 and have some good little insight nuggets

02:09.040 --> 02:12.320
from him on things we can talk about, including that upgrade process.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.880
Yeah, that sounds pretty smooth.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.840
I want to talk about that too.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.600
But before we get to that and the community news and all the other goodies, I got to say

02:19.600 --> 02:21.160
hello to Cheese and Alex.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
Hello, gentlemen.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.160
Hey there.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
Hello, internet.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
Hello there.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.880
And of course, a big time appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
Hello.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Hello.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
Hello.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Howdy.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.880
Howdy.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.880
Happy Linux Tuesday.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
We've got a chipper bunch today.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.080
That's great.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.560
Everybody's been properly caffeinated, at least I have been.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.080
Now I have to also admit that I've got a CPAP machine now.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.260
So not only am I sleeping, but I'm also still caffeinating.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.040
So you better watch out, Wes.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.240
Superpower of regular sleep.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.920
Well, we have some community news that I wanted to start with.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.080
Besides the fact that Unix turned 50, they actually, it's a funny thing, I have some

02:57.080 --> 03:01.200
links in the show notes, they celebrated over like a two day period.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.800
So I think it was either yesterday and today or today and tomorrow.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.040
But it's technically the 50th anniversary of Unix.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.200
And I have a really great clip that when I was playing as part of a longer series.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.700
And I linked that in the show notes.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.200
So if you guys want to watch that, it's so great.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
So great.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.680
In fact, if I remember, I'll play part of a training video that they did.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.360
Some of these old clips are hilarious.

03:24.360 --> 03:30.320
But also, I mean, it's shocking both how far we've come in 50 years and also how much is

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
pretty much the same.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
Yeah.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.800
It's kind of shocking how far we've come in 15 years.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.020
This is a really great interview with Matthew Miller over at Tech Republic about Fedora

03:41.020 --> 03:43.400
at 15 years old.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Wow.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
It doesn't feel like it.

03:46.400 --> 03:52.680
Considering I was using Red Hat before Fedora as my desktop.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
Kind of it really does.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.920
It kind of it shocks me.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.600
It's really it's something.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.520
It's been a long time, but it doesn't feel that long anyways.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
Good interview.

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
We'll leave it to you to read most of it.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.820
But there's a couple of tidbits in here that I wanted to chat about with you guys.

04:06.820 --> 04:09.800
Throughout the process, he asked a series of questions.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.800
He being James Sanders, sorry, over at Tech Republic.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.720
And one of the topics that comes up is flat packs and snaps.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.560
And he asked why Fedora prefers flat packs as the portable application standard.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.360
And Matthew responds, there are definitely some technical differences.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.920
If you talk to our engineers who are working on this, they're very, very passionate about

04:28.920 --> 04:31.040
the technical differences.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.880
One of the things with snap is it's the answer to all things.

04:34.880 --> 04:42.540
We see OCI docker containers as having won the server enterprise and IoT use cases.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.840
Docker doesn't necessarily fit well for the desktop.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.520
So flat pack is a technology specifically meant for the desktop.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.920
I mean, it shows right?

04:50.920 --> 04:55.320
We talk about that property of flat pack all the time.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.080
It does put a different spin on it.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.400
I kind of thought of it always as like a limitation.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.980
You know, I kind of mix command line and gooey apps.

05:01.980 --> 05:02.980
So this was weird.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.940
That does make some sense, though.

05:04.940 --> 05:10.800
I don't think I have heard that as clearly just enunciated like it's, it's just simply

05:10.800 --> 05:16.160
not trying to address that I like you saw it more as an oversight as a lack of like

05:16.160 --> 05:17.160
something.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.820
Wait a minute, you know, Wes, now that I think about it, I think I've even seen developer

05:20.820 --> 05:25.120
statements to the extent saying they were planning to add server support, like that

05:25.120 --> 05:27.160
was something they were going to build in later on.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.640
I'm pretty sure I've read those statements.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.380
Perhaps things have changed because I also tend to agree with this, as I've been getting

05:35.380 --> 05:41.080
pretty excited about self hosting, and been spinning up more and more of my own infrastructure.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.600
I've had the option for a couple of them to use snaps.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.960
But the reality is it's containers all the way down, baby.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.240
Yeah, and mostly advice and workflows and styles of doing so well, it's built around

05:52.240 --> 05:53.840
the container ecosystem.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.280
And that ecosystem has come a long way in having cross compatibility on its own.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.040
I'm glad to hear that, Chris, by the way.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
I bet you are.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.020
I mean, you know, the thing is, is, you know, this very well.

06:04.020 --> 06:08.440
It's just that containers just kind of came in and became a default way for people to

06:08.440 --> 06:10.680
ship software on servers.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
Absolutely right.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.600
For better or for worse, in some cases, perhaps, but we're not here really to debate that today.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.280
There's a part in this interview that he touches on about improvements that have come along

06:19.280 --> 06:21.820
or innovations, as the article puts it.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.080
And I was just waxing about this on the live stream about how this has really changed the

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
game for me.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
Yeah, right.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.040
It is something if you think about it, it makes sense.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.600
And Matthew Miller's answer is interesting.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.960
I think it's when the graphics driver people decided to go with open source, Intel buying

06:36.960 --> 06:42.240
in first on the network drivers, and then on the graphics drivers was huge.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.680
Now AMD coming along, I have an AMD desktop that I use for gaming.

06:46.680 --> 06:51.160
It's awesome how it just works without having to fiddle with anything.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.880
I love that.

06:52.880 --> 06:58.400
There's also obviously a subtext of, come on, NVIDIA, get with the program.

06:58.400 --> 07:03.680
I am blown away on my desktop workstation upstairs.

07:03.680 --> 07:11.000
I've got full 3D acceleration, and I'm playing nice games, and I'm using zero proprietary

07:11.000 --> 07:15.440
drivers, no binary driver for my video card.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.440
It's so great.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.040
And then, of course, the Intel side has been like that for quite a while.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.040
Right.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.280
Not for granted, but over the 15 years, that's definitely changed, and I wouldn't want to

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
go back.

07:24.280 --> 07:29.240
Tech Republic also touches on a spot that seems to have really left a mark on the project.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.960
This was a while ago in 2011, I think before Matthew Miller was even involved with the

07:33.960 --> 07:35.060
project.

07:35.060 --> 07:39.680
There was a shock to the ecosystem when Fedora 15 landed.

07:39.680 --> 07:45.840
Fedora 15 was the version that shipped Gnome Shell for the first time, Gnome Shell 3.0.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.400
At the same time, System D.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.400
Mm-hmm.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.400
Yeah.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
What?

07:50.400 --> 07:53.600
Miller says the release had an incredibly dramatic amount of change.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.420
Both Gnome Shell 3.0 and System D. landed in that release, and basically, we lost half

07:57.420 --> 07:58.960
our users doing that.

07:58.960 --> 08:04.920
Or at least, put another way, half of them did not upgrade to Fedora 14, and they stopped

08:04.920 --> 08:05.920
growing.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.000
They say it was a pretty bad situation, and that there were plenty of ways that blame

08:10.000 --> 08:14.360
was getting thrown around, but just absorbing all of that change all at once is really hard

08:14.360 --> 08:15.360
on people.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.360
But what they learned, if you look at the Gnome user interface, is if you go back and

08:19.360 --> 08:23.280
install Gnome 3.0 and compare it to 3.3.2, it's a very different experience.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.280
Yeah.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
I mean, he's totally right.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.840
I don't think about it that way, but it is.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
Oh, it is radically different.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.060
It was a totally, it was almost a different vision now.

08:32.060 --> 08:39.600
He says in here, I think that if Gnome Shell goes to 4.0, it's not going to be a radical

08:39.600 --> 08:41.120
redesign like that.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.560
It's going to be architectural shifts under the hood.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
That makes sense, right?

08:45.560 --> 08:49.760
I mean, we need to move, and yes, Fedora moves quickly, but at the end of the day, I still

08:49.760 --> 08:50.760
want it to work.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.760
15 years old.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
Are you kidding me?

08:52.760 --> 08:53.760
Are you kidding me?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.280
Here's to the next 15, huh?

08:55.280 --> 08:56.280
No kidding.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.760
I'd love to know a little more, Chris, what you mean when you say that version three is

08:59.760 --> 09:02.600
such a huge departure from 3.3.2.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.040
Oh, boy.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.760
Well, first of all, it's a huge, there's a lot of UI differences.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.960
It's very, very big, like big.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.960
It's big.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.960
Everything's big.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.960
Everything's touch focused.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Huge.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.120
It looks like a maniac.

09:17.120 --> 09:24.760
Crashes like Richard Hammond, just frequently and big, and also is very, very, very early.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.760
It's very rough.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.920
Let's just say a clunky doesn't feel well put together yet.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.920
Go look at a screenshot of it.

09:29.920 --> 09:35.280
It's really, it's remarkable, and if you remember back then too, touchscreens were really becoming

09:35.280 --> 09:36.280
a big thing.

09:36.280 --> 09:43.500
The iPad was a new product, the PC was a truck, and iPads were a car, and everybody was going

09:43.500 --> 09:44.960
to be on a car.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.320
What date was name three released?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.320
I don't know.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
I mean, it was a long time ago.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
I'll look it up.

09:49.320 --> 09:54.280
Kind of, you know, I think I recall where I was when I heard about it.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.720
There's a few major moments.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.640
I remember where I was when Unity was announced.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.600
I remember where I was when it was announced that Unity was ending.

10:04.600 --> 10:10.740
I was at Linux Fest Northwest when it was announced in a room with Brian, and we were

10:10.740 --> 10:12.680
about to do Alas.

10:12.680 --> 10:20.640
And I was at Dell when they announced that it was ending with Noah in a room with the

10:20.640 --> 10:27.000
Sputnik team who also learned about it at the same time, and it was really something.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.160
So name three was April 2011, so it's a different world in terms of mobile and everything else,

10:34.160 --> 10:35.160
you know?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.160
Absolutely.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.080
Well, speaking of interviews, just a quick plug for me.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.880
I was interviewed by opensource.com, Mr. Don Watkins, a gentleman over there who I've met

10:43.880 --> 10:44.880
in Denver.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.880
Really nice guy.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
Yeah, we met him over at System76.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.280
Look at you with the memory.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.240
Just dang, West is on fire today.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.120
And it's a Jupiter Broadcasting origin story and sort of like the future where we're going

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
under the wing of Linux Academy.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.640
And it published a couple of weeks ago.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.160
I just have not been good about mentioning it because I was traveling.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
It's worth a read, though.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.160
I mean, it's not too long.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.160
Oh, stop.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.360
I even learned some things.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
You did?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.360
Oh, yeah.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.360
Really?

11:11.360 --> 11:12.360
Yeah.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.360
I mean, there's a lot of stuff in kind of the longer term history that I just didn't

11:13.360 --> 11:14.360
know.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.360
Early days stuff.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.360
Sure, yeah.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.360
We'll put a link in the show notes if people are interested.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.520
I think, you know, that kind of stuff to me, it's like I'm so focused on what we're working

11:22.520 --> 11:26.480
on now that I actually kind of forget every now and then to look back at how far things

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
have come.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.480
And it really is pretty remarkable.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.240
It's pretty, like I was just saying to West, it's like, you know, it's really, there's

11:33.240 --> 11:34.400
a lot that has changed.

11:34.400 --> 11:41.200
And in such a way that I'm really proud of, it's really been for the benefit of us taking

11:41.200 --> 11:45.040
our craft more seriously and trying to do a better job and trying to do better reporting

11:45.040 --> 11:52.040
and doing research and contacting sources, all these things, staffing editors, it's been

11:52.040 --> 11:53.040
pretty awesome.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.880
It's just enabling us to do a better job of doing this.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.880
It's been iterative.

11:55.880 --> 12:00.640
If you've been a listener for a while, you can really hear an iterative trend.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.160
And that's another nice way of saying our old stuff is really crappy.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.360
I mean, you tell me if the whole clip, oh boy.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
It's bad.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.360
We just cringe.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.360
All right.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.480
Well, we got a little interesting valve news in the show.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.680
It's been a while.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.600
Did you hear about Steam Remote Play?

12:17.600 --> 12:22.960
It is a new Steam feature that lets you play on your couch or on your computer with your

12:22.960 --> 12:24.840
friends over the internet.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.760
With Remote Play together, they say, you can now invite Steam friends to join your local

12:28.760 --> 12:34.760
co-op or your local multiplayer with a shared or split screen game.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.760
Yeah.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.040
Only the host needs to own and install the game.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.720
The additional players just connect through Steam Remote Play.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.640
It's kind of neat because it just kind of shows up as a menu entry item.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.100
If everybody supports it, it's just a little button and the menu says Remote Play together.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.100
It's really easy.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.100
Yeah.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.400
And then like all your friends, their controllers just act like they are right there on your

12:54.400 --> 12:55.400
computer.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
And then you've got a little menu.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.000
You can control voice and volume and hear everybody.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
This is some magic.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.880
It sounds so easy.

13:01.880 --> 13:07.080
And they right here say just some words on the screen.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.080
Supports Linux.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
It's going to be good.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.080
I mean, you know, they've done a lot of work on the streaming stuff in the back end.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.480
I remember playing with it, I don't know, four or five years ago now.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.560
And I haven't heard about it since.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.560
Obviously it still works.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
So it's nice to see a new development.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.920
I have to tell you, man.

13:23.920 --> 13:28.680
I had a Valve developer in my ear like two years ago telling me we're doing big things

13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
with streaming.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
Just wait.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.680
And I was like, great.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.240
Oh, I'm super excited.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.000
And then never heard anything and never saw anything.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.600
I was like, oh, that project must have been killed.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.000
I think this is this is what it was.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Skunkworks.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.200
It was in the Skunkworks for quite a while.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.280
And sometimes this stuff takes a little while to suss out, especially when you're supporting

13:47.280 --> 13:49.720
Windows, Mac and Linux.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.600
I mean, and over the network, that's always a little bit tricky.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.480
Well, I'm curious how it's doing the device stuff.

13:55.480 --> 14:01.040
Like how is it taking my like, say I got a controller over USB or Bluetooth hooked up

14:01.040 --> 14:03.240
to my Linux box.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.120
Is Steam just taking those inputs and then forwarding it to the remote?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.520
Is it just like raw throwing it over the network?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.640
Is there something more sophisticated in the middle?

14:11.640 --> 14:15.240
The other thing that's fascinating about this, as you think about it, is they're now first

14:15.240 --> 14:16.240
to streaming.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.360
They beat Stadia and they beat the Xbox.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.360
I mean, does this count?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
It is only in beta.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
They're at least right.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
They're up there.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.040
I'll tell you what I like about it is without a shadow of a doubt, it's going to have the

14:27.040 --> 14:28.040
best game catalog.

14:28.040 --> 14:32.280
The thing I'm thinking about Stadia is I'm going to get my Stadia package in like late

14:32.280 --> 14:34.840
November and it's going to show up and I'm going to be able to play two games that are

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
even worth it.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.840
I hope you like them.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
Yeah.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.960
Whereas this could be any game I've ever owned in Steam and the fact that you can do local

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
player stuff.

14:42.960 --> 14:48.800
So that opens up to a whole range of games and you're not having to futz with firewall

14:48.800 --> 14:50.840
stuff or anything.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.080
So got to give this a go.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.080
I'm going to try it.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.800
You know, I haven't really needed or needed to do this, had an opportunity, but it's something

14:55.800 --> 14:56.800
I'd be worth it.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.640
You know, the whole Steam Machine thing.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
It's funny.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
Now it's almost a perfect time.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.320
I kind of want just a little Steam Machine set up next to my TV now.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
Oh yeah.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.320
Steam Machines.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
Oh yeah.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.320
Oh yeah.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.840
That was a thing for a little bit.

15:10.840 --> 15:16.760
Oh, you know, you know what you always say, Wes, and you always say this.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.240
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
But sometimes not.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Yeah.

15:21.240 --> 15:28.360
Hey, why don't we just take a moment and mention that the Gnome Foundation is full on fighting

15:28.360 --> 15:32.960
this patent troll that is coming after them for this Shotwell photo transfer feature.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
Yeah, they're bringing it.

15:33.960 --> 15:34.960
It's nice to see.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.080
It is really nice to see.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.000
And in that effort, they are attempting to raise some funds.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.920
So so far they've done pretty good.

15:40.920 --> 15:46.000
They've got 108 donors and they have raised $28,000.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.320
They have a goal of 125, but my instinct says they could probably use triple that amount

15:50.320 --> 15:52.720
because it'd be really nice for them to be able to bring this fight.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.440
So we're going to have a link in the show notes Linux Unplugged dot com slash three

15:57.440 --> 15:59.600
to four.

15:59.600 --> 16:03.280
If you can throw, you know, any amount at them.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.240
They have some one times that are just click one buttons.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.180
They have some monthlies you can do.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.560
It looks like it's a really nice, clean, simple, not going to have to like sign up with a whole

16:11.560 --> 16:13.640
bunch of accounts crap to do it.

16:13.640 --> 16:18.900
And it would definitely be a good cause because even if you're not a Gnome Shell user, this

16:18.900 --> 16:23.160
patent fight is really important because if they can come well, I guess another way to

16:23.160 --> 16:28.480
put this is Shotwell is damn lucky they're part of the Gnome Foundation.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.700
If they were an open source independent project that wasn't part of a foundation like this,

16:32.700 --> 16:35.180
they would be royally screwed right now.

16:35.180 --> 16:39.040
So it's important that even if you're not a Gnome Shell user, that we help them fight

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
this crap.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
Right.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.320
I mean, we want to send this tone that you don't you don't get to be abusive and trolling

16:44.320 --> 16:46.160
these open free and open source projects.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.980
You know, it gets me worked up and I'm already over caffeinated with and you know what happens

16:49.980 --> 16:53.320
when I get worked up as I start renting.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
Let me get the soapbox.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
Yeah.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.320
Yeah, we left it outside.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.160
It's been a little while since we got up on the soapbox.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.160
You never know.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.160
It could be just around the corner, though.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.720
You can never tell with that soapbox.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.480
It's sometimes it's sometimes lurking.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.480
Well, you're right.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.480
It was very easy.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.480
I've just made a donation now.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
Really?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.600
Once I got past identifying the cars in the capture, of course.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Oh, yeah.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.680
You got to make sure you find the cars.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
Or buses.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
Somebody's got to train that machine.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.680
Let's do a little housekeeping.

17:20.680 --> 17:27.840
Oh, so we went down to Texas, went to a cyber summit, and you may be wondering how that

17:27.840 --> 17:28.840
went.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.680
Well, my friends, I've got just the thing for you.

17:31.680 --> 17:37.860
Elle, Wes, Cheese, and myself did an extra on our trip to Texas Cyber Summit extras dot

17:37.860 --> 17:40.560
show slash 24.

17:40.560 --> 17:46.400
Nice little wrap up of not just what it's like for some Linux people to go to a cyber

17:46.400 --> 17:51.440
summit, but also good details on the great food that Carl took us to.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
Oh, boy.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.880
So don't listen if you're hungry.

17:53.880 --> 17:54.880
I can't help it.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.760
You know, I just got Carl, you might want to listen to that.

17:56.760 --> 18:01.180
I think you get name dropped a couple of times in that one.

18:01.180 --> 18:07.920
And also, to go along with that, Elle wrote up a fantastic write up wrote up write up

18:07.920 --> 18:10.080
blogged blog post.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.080
Don't call it a blog.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.080
It's an article.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.360
Article post that will link in the show notes.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.680
It has some descriptions, some pictures, some some of the characters I was talking about

18:18.680 --> 18:20.280
in that extra.

18:20.280 --> 18:24.580
And then if you want even more than that, cheese is popping off like crazy in that Jupiter

18:24.580 --> 18:25.580
gallery.

18:25.580 --> 18:26.580
Jupiter.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.580
So good.

18:27.580 --> 18:28.580
Dot gallery.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.580
How about that?

18:29.580 --> 18:30.580
Jupiter dot gallery.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.580
Chris, what's this?

18:31.580 --> 18:34.580
You say you say, well, here we go out to these things like these Linux fests.

18:34.580 --> 18:40.120
Or maybe you heard about Alex and I taking a road trip to go see Wendell recently or

18:40.120 --> 18:44.800
Texas Linux Fest or Red Hat Summit or Linux Fest Northwest and you wonder, are there any

18:44.800 --> 18:46.720
pictures from this event?

18:46.720 --> 18:50.760
Well, friends, cheese bacon has the answer for you.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
That's right.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.240
And if you have any pictures from these events that you'd like to submit, you can do so by

18:55.240 --> 19:00.860
emailing me at cheese at Jupiter broadcasting dot com and that's CHZ at Jupiter broadcasting

19:00.860 --> 19:05.160
dot com and I'll be happy to put them on the gallery.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.400
That's the best part is as that happens, when I go back and check, there's like more pictures.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
There's new stuff.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
I haven't seen.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.400
Yeah.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Yeah.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
Jupiter dot gallery.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.480
What else do I got to say?

19:14.480 --> 19:19.120
We'll just keep updating that throughout the next year and stuff as we go to events and

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
whatnot.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.680
Well, we'll have that up there and check out extras.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.840
Extras dot show slash 24.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.380
But not just that one.

19:25.380 --> 19:29.120
For goodness sake, go over there and and look at the what is a container listen to the what

19:29.120 --> 19:31.380
is a container episode.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.380
It's just 20 19.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.200
I mean, you don't want to be behind.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.200
You don't.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.900
And it's 24 minutes.

19:36.900 --> 19:40.240
And Alex, you did a great job explaining this stuff.

19:40.240 --> 19:45.200
You and I talk about how we use these in practical setups that are approachable by people that

19:45.200 --> 19:50.260
are either beginners or using this in an enterprise because we you know, we've really we've talked

19:50.260 --> 19:51.260
about these things a lot.

19:51.260 --> 19:54.000
We've taken all of the experience we have talking about these and Alex talks about them

19:54.000 --> 19:55.640
all day for his day job.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.040
And we've put it into this episode.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.360
So I think it's helpful for people.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.640
And it's a great companion for the new self hosted show.

20:03.640 --> 20:04.800
Check that out.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.420
Extras dot show.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.780
And also recently, some brunches just got posted.

20:09.780 --> 20:13.920
So got to go get so many good brunches, especially that one there with Alan Jude mentioned that

20:13.920 --> 20:14.920
last week.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.000
You got to go get that Alan Jude brunch, you know, he's gonna be talking about BSD and

20:18.000 --> 20:19.480
making your question your Linux faith.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.360
You don't want to miss that.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.520
And then come back to Linux on plug and we'll set you straight.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
It's true, though.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.520
All right.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.360
That's the housekeeping for this week.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.920
I mean, speaking of Linux, right?

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
Mm hmm.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.040
Let's get into this 1910 in more detail.

20:34.040 --> 20:38.080
There is a lot to talk about with this release, but we're gonna actually put some of it aside

20:38.080 --> 20:39.720
and just wait for 2004.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.560
And just focus on a few details for you this week that drew our attention.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.480
And one that I know cheese and I have been talking about, and I think West you and I

20:48.480 --> 20:53.440
talked about a little bit is I'm noticing more than I thought I would that there's a

20:53.440 --> 20:56.860
lot of apps in the software center that are actually snaps.

20:56.860 --> 21:01.440
It seems to be with the way it works is if there is a snap version of an application,

21:01.440 --> 21:04.320
the software center prefers that and installs that first.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.380
Now, maybe we should be clear.

21:06.380 --> 21:09.520
How are you noticing this right because Oh, they clearly label it right.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
But would you have noticed right?

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
Isn't that the test?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.240
You know, is it detrimental if you're a regular user?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.240
Do you care?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.280
Because you're investigating, you know, we're doing a review here.

21:17.280 --> 21:21.880
The only two ways in which I notice it is startup time.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.800
And when I sometimes go to edit something on my local file system, it's like a couple

21:26.800 --> 21:27.800
clicks.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.800
Right.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.800
There's the confinement comes into play.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.800
Yeah.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.480
And so there's a couple of instances where I'm like, well, the job of this application

21:33.480 --> 21:35.560
is to be like all over my file system.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.520
So I don't actually want the snap version.

21:38.520 --> 21:43.160
And the way I've just worked around that is I just didn't go to the terminal, I apt install

21:43.160 --> 21:44.680
and I got the debt.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.680
Right.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.680
But to your point, for the most part, no, not really actually an issue.

21:48.680 --> 21:53.200
And in the case of VS code seems to have been a net benefit because it just like self updated

21:53.200 --> 21:55.360
and got the latest VS code and it was good to go.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.360
Right.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.360
Yeah.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.360
Yeah.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.360
Yeah.

21:59.360 --> 22:03.600
And it does seem like they've gotten better, you know, I mean, the, the, the theming, the

22:03.600 --> 22:06.760
system integration, that stuff is a lot better than the last time I used these.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.760
Yes.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.760
Yes.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.760
That has been, that has gotten a lot better.

22:09.760 --> 22:15.640
So cheese, you had a chance to not just only use stock 1910, but also Mate 1910 over the

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
week, trying out different systems.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.440
And what was your extra week with 1910 like?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.440
Overall it was great.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.960
So I started with the beta, then the dailies, and then the final.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.680
I tried it on three different machines.

22:27.680 --> 22:35.360
I tried it on my desktop, which is a rise in 2600, 16 gigs of Ram, 256 gigabyte NVME

22:35.360 --> 22:43.520
and an Nvidia 1060, an older Dell and Spearion and this new ThinkPad 440 S T 440 S that I've

22:43.520 --> 22:44.840
recently picked up.

22:44.840 --> 22:52.660
I will say that out of the box whenever I try to Ubuntu, I installed steam immediately

22:52.660 --> 23:00.080
went to CSGO, dropped in and was playing some games, some deathmatch there in CSGO and I

23:00.080 --> 23:03.920
was averaging around, you know, 200 frames per second, something like that.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.920
What?

23:04.920 --> 23:05.920
Yeah.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.920
200 frames per second.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.840
What do you normally get on that box?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.240
Under windows, it was right around the same.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.720
So I mean, there was really no difference.

23:13.720 --> 23:21.080
It would peak up to like 230 frames a second, which was about average for what windows was

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
doing as well.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.360
Oh, so this was your, uh, the last windows box, the gaming rig.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.360
Yes.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.520
So this was the gaming rig that I ditched.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.760
Um, I had an extra NVME tossed in there and I ditched the SSD.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.800
Are you telling me 1910 killed windows for you?

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
Uh, yeah.

23:36.800 --> 23:42.080
I mean, I really, the desk, this desktop was only ever really used for gaming anyway.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.640
So, um, I decided just to make that, make that jump.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.040
I do have the fallback SSD if I want to toss it back in the box.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.900
I physically removed it though, so it would take some effort.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.380
You go take this victory lap, geez.

23:53.380 --> 23:56.240
This is a big moment and Wes and I are proud of you.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.240
Thank you guys.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.240
God.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
So good.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.720
So it sounds like performance is comparable.

24:00.720 --> 24:05.160
You haven't taken like a Linux tax for switching.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
No, not at all.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.680
And I was using the Nvidia, uh, which one thing that's awesome about 1910 is it comes

24:10.680 --> 24:12.220
bundled with the Nvidia driver.

24:12.220 --> 24:18.640
So I was using, um, the 435, uh, Nvidia driver, uh, worked great.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.920
Um, whenever I flipped over to Monte though, I did notice a performance hit.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.560
Uh, I was averaging about a hundred frames per second.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.640
I'm not sure exactly what's going on there.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.680
Again, this was just kind of out of the box testing.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.320
I didn't do any additional stuff.

24:31.320 --> 24:35.120
So you're saying you had a hundred frames per second switch that there must be something

24:35.120 --> 24:36.120
there.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.640
There that's gotta be a bug or comp is issue or something probably worth troubleshooting

24:39.640 --> 24:44.080
or the fact that Linux and Nvidia aren't best friends could be a thing too.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
I don't know.

24:45.080 --> 24:50.400
So, um, I had some PI problems in my week with 1910.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.680
I mean, we primarily, the rest of the episode, we're going to talk about the ZFS and extended

24:54.680 --> 24:57.640
four and comparing that in low memory and regular memory.

24:57.640 --> 25:04.520
But I just want to take a moment and say that they sneaky included support for the PI four

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
in 1910.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
It was sneaky.

25:06.520 --> 25:11.600
They did list it in their official, like a canonical.com.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.600
Not much before.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
Yeah.

25:13.600 --> 25:19.440
So PI four supports not easy and it's something that distributions are slowly getting to.

25:19.440 --> 25:23.040
There are architectural changes that are pretty significant.

25:23.040 --> 25:30.080
I heard it described as the PI four is in appearance in similarity only to the previous

25:30.080 --> 25:34.480
PI's like there's all, there's total differences for the USB stack for the, for the way that

25:34.480 --> 25:37.920
the PCI bus is addressed for the video card.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.480
Like there's just major changes.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.120
Isn't it great that we don't have to care about that at all?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
I mean, once it's fixed.

25:42.120 --> 25:46.000
And if you're using Raspbian and you don't even think about it, they just did it.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.720
Which yeah, that's the point of Raspbian, but they got, they got like the bulk of everything

25:50.720 --> 25:56.120
in 1910 to their credit, which is great because people like to use that Raspberry PI's for

25:56.120 --> 25:58.880
like Kubernetes training and things like that.

25:58.880 --> 26:04.740
And I threw it on there and they spun two images, a 32 bit and a 64 bit.

26:04.740 --> 26:11.840
As we record, although this is very rapidly in progress, the 64 bit image has an issue

26:11.840 --> 26:15.640
where USB devices don't work.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.200
And there's a couple other limitations of it.

26:18.200 --> 26:25.280
It's an issue once you go over like three gigs of RAM ish, like 348 I think is the magical

26:25.280 --> 26:26.280
number.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.020
And the USB quits working.

26:30.020 --> 26:33.680
And so if you use the 32 bit image, it's totally fine and no issues.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.480
So you get to play around with 1910 on a Raspberry PI if you're okay with 32.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.120
But you've been hoping to escape 32.

26:38.120 --> 26:40.440
Come on, 32 bit, everybody knows it's going away.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.680
I mean, you're using all the bits.

26:42.680 --> 26:46.760
I will mention to the 64 bit and 32 bit images have SSH turned on by default.

26:46.760 --> 26:51.800
So even if you can't use the USB to like plug in a keyboard, if you got the ethernet plugged

26:51.800 --> 26:53.480
in, you can still SSH it.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.480
Perfect.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.920
They already have it in progress though.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.320
I did a little, you know, I did my part in the bug report because I was a good boy this

27:00.320 --> 27:02.680
time and went in there and said, here's my system information.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.360
Here's my, you know, I can reproduce the bug.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.480
And they seem to have identified the, all the issues and fixes are in progress right

27:08.480 --> 27:10.480
now as we record.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.840
So they'll probably, I don't know, maybe they'll spin a new image, I would hope.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.840
Yeah, hopefully so.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.560
Hopefully it just works in the future.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.560
Yeah.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
Now what about you?

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
How's your week been on 1910?

27:18.560 --> 27:21.160
Any updates to your initial impressions last week?

27:21.160 --> 27:24.720
Honestly, I mean, it's just been pretty smooth.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.480
I had to, you know, make a few changes here, there.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.080
There's an app armor was still enabled on this system, which I mean, I left it enabled,

27:31.080 --> 27:35.720
but you know, I did some tweaks, got all my regular tooling working.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.840
Really it's kind of just nice.

27:37.840 --> 27:43.960
I mean, I've been enjoying neon and I do miss plasma sometimes there's little, little pieces

27:43.960 --> 27:49.400
of my workflow that I just haven't really adapted over, but I have surprisingly few

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
complaints.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
Like there's no weird oddities.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.600
I haven't had any glitches.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.940
There's been no surprising reboots or programs not working.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.640
And I was doing a bunch of testing, sort of messing around with some of the bootloader

27:58.640 --> 28:01.940
stuff and modifying the system.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.200
It's just resilient.

28:03.200 --> 28:07.920
My past experiences with gnome shell tell me that this may be subject to change, but

28:07.920 --> 28:10.760
right now I haven't had any shell stability issues.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.920
It's all been very solid, very reliable, and I'm very happy to report that I had a chance

28:14.920 --> 28:16.200
to try out pop as well.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.960
I think we all did.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
Most of us.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.480
Boy, did I see a lot of excitement online about this.

28:21.480 --> 28:25.520
I wasn't even positive I was going to try it out, but then I was getting so much like,

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
Hey, Chris, you got to try this.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.920
Hey, Chris, have you tried pop?

28:27.920 --> 28:28.920
It's really good.

28:28.920 --> 28:29.920
Yeah.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.920
Talking about the release.

28:30.920 --> 28:31.920
Yes.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.440
So we did some digging into what, why are people so happy about this?

28:35.440 --> 28:36.640
Like what's going on?

28:36.640 --> 28:43.080
And there's a few things that I think a system 76 has done here, but the one that like a

28:43.080 --> 28:49.560
lot of people were talking about on day one and two for obvious reasons was how buttery

28:49.560 --> 28:55.360
smooth the upgrade process was from the previous version of pop.

28:55.360 --> 29:00.120
And they appear to have done some custom engineering around this.

29:00.120 --> 29:05.280
And so I emailed Carl, the CEO of system 76 and asked him, what have you guys done to

29:05.280 --> 29:06.760
change the upgrade process?

29:06.760 --> 29:09.880
And why is it, why is everybody saying it's so much better?

29:09.880 --> 29:15.940
Carl wrote back and he said, the Ubuntu updates weren't well integrated into gnome and we

29:15.940 --> 29:20.660
found that live upgrades while in the user session can be unreliable.

29:20.660 --> 29:25.040
We also had no way to communicate the upgrade and changes to the user through the product.

29:25.040 --> 29:29.760
Instead users learned about the available upgrades through news or social media or like

29:29.760 --> 29:31.440
an email campaign or whatever.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.540
Now customers receive a notification when there's a new OS upgrade and they click a

29:35.540 --> 29:37.260
button to start the process.

29:37.260 --> 29:41.220
The pop upgrade first prepares the system for upgrade, ensuring that all the required

29:41.220 --> 29:45.360
dependencies and upgrades are in place and then downloads the new packages.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.660
If there are conflicts, the upgrade is automatically rolled back.

29:48.660 --> 29:53.040
The customer can go off and do other work while the upgrade is being prepared and downloaded.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.840
They'll receive a second notification when the upgrade is ready to be installed.

29:56.840 --> 30:02.760
The tracking upgrade prompts to reboot where the offline upgrade will then take place.

30:02.760 --> 30:08.420
And with the pop upgrade, customers will be able to upgrade from an LTS to any release.

30:08.420 --> 30:14.260
So for example, if you decide you don't want to be stuck on pop 1804 until 2004, you could

30:14.260 --> 30:15.600
go to 1910.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.540
You'll be able to jump directly from 1804 to 1910.

30:19.540 --> 30:22.240
That's coming in early November.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.880
So they've done some really interesting engineering there.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.760
So I love some of the other things.

30:27.760 --> 30:32.400
He says to him, the most striking change in 1910 is the new aesthetic.

30:32.400 --> 30:38.000
The team, Kate himself, Ian, they started working together on a new color palette and

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
contrast.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.880
He says they measured the contrast ratios between elements and text to achieve a high

30:42.880 --> 30:47.240
contrast by default rather than requiring a separate theme.

30:47.240 --> 30:52.520
He says the difference is noticeable throughout, but especially in the shell menus.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.520
He's right about that.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.240
He says, I love the new dark color palette.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.240
It's incredible.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.560
It's like candy, like a luxurious kind of candy.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.840
I think they're very proud of it.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
It does look very nice.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.080
I mean, I enjoyed using it.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.080
Yeah.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.180
Also worth mentioning their work around Tensor Man.

31:07.180 --> 31:11.440
I didn't really appreciate what a pain in the butt apparently TensorFlow is to set up.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
I love this.

31:12.440 --> 31:17.280
Packaging TensorFlow for Linux distributions is notoriously difficult, if not impossible.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
That's the first line of the GitHub.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
Yeah.

31:19.280 --> 31:23.440
And I guess even like using the Docker container is still a huge pain in the butt.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.280
You've got all kinds of different versions depending on quite what you're doing or how

31:26.280 --> 31:28.880
you need TensorFlow configured.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.000
And I mean, if you're running these just off the command line in Docker, it's not a lot

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
of fun.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.840
So Tensor Man, which is a little Rust daemon, of course, it just sits there and makes this

31:37.840 --> 31:42.120
easy for you and kind of orchestrates on top of Docker to get you all the stuff you need

31:42.120 --> 31:44.000
and smooth out the process.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
That's pretty great.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.120
And it seems to me like they've keyed in on a good customer demo there because what do

31:51.120 --> 31:52.120
they do?

31:52.120 --> 31:57.680
They use powerful systems and like laptops and desktops that people buy to use TensorFlow.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.000
Like that must be a decent customer base.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Right.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I mean, that could be pretty useful.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.040
And if it just gets you out of the gate with the standard technology you want to use on

32:05.040 --> 32:08.040
Linux faster, that's superb.

32:08.040 --> 32:15.120
The thing that I have to acknowledge before we go any further is I was skeptical of PopOS.

32:15.120 --> 32:19.020
In fact, I was pretty vocal about thinking it was a bad idea that they had limited resources

32:19.020 --> 32:22.560
and it could be better spent in other places.

32:22.560 --> 32:27.760
We're several releases in now, and thankfully I left myself a little bit of wiggle room

32:27.760 --> 32:28.760
on this.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.720
And I said, you know, if they add value and they make it something that's a true differentiator,

32:32.720 --> 32:34.240
then I'll reconsider.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.400
They've done that.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.840
They've done that with the installer.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.360
They've done that with the upgrade process.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.440
They've done that with the theme.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.040
It's truly one of the best themes on Linux.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.280
And now they've done it.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.400
There's a couple other things that are in there, like the pop shop that are really nice.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.000
Like they've opted to keep Chromium as a deb.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.200
They can make that choice as they do with their platform.

32:54.200 --> 32:59.440
They've integrated their system firmware updater into no shell settings now, just built right

32:59.440 --> 33:00.440
in.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
You don't have to go find it.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.080
And even on a non-System 76 machine, I appreciate that.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.180
That's I think what has stood out to me is it hasn't felt like Pop was some walled off

33:08.180 --> 33:10.320
garden, hidden away, totally different.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.360
It is its own thing.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.880
But a lot of the stuff you can still take, right?

33:13.880 --> 33:17.520
If I want to use Tensor Man, I can just go get that from GitHub and use it.

33:17.520 --> 33:21.480
Or if I want to use the theme, but not all of Pop OS, that's possible too.

33:21.480 --> 33:27.680
I think Pop OS, because it's not tied to System 76's hardware, you get benefits by using

33:27.680 --> 33:31.000
it as I experienced in my recent laptop review.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.680
But you don't really have any downsides.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.980
There's like not any negatives to it.

33:35.980 --> 33:40.520
And it's not so derivative of Ubuntu that it's totally different.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.080
Mint is kind of its own thing.

33:42.080 --> 33:46.480
You can still skirt by by following some Ubuntu tutorials or getting a PPA and it's probably

33:46.480 --> 33:48.400
going to be fine.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.880
But with Pop, there's no like probably about it.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
It's going to be fine.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.880
It just works.

33:52.880 --> 33:53.880
And it's 1910.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.880
They want it to work.

33:54.880 --> 33:55.880
Exactly.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.840
So there's not a penalty really for using it.

33:58.840 --> 34:04.580
There's an upside if you like their aesthetic and the value add that they've contributed.

34:04.580 --> 34:08.420
And you're not running something that's so foreign that you can't just treat it like

34:08.420 --> 34:09.420
an Ubuntu system.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.420
Exactly.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.640
So I really nailed a sweet spot.

34:12.640 --> 34:18.240
And because of that, when I do one more reload for some testing upstairs, when I'm on my

34:18.240 --> 34:25.420
final build for my daily driver workstation, I'm going with Pop 1910.

34:25.420 --> 34:31.160
And the reason for me is I'm going to take Carl at his word about that upgrade system.

34:31.160 --> 34:34.720
Because this is my got to get shit done workstation.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.400
And I was after all of this going to just reload it back to an LTS.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.560
I don't got time to play around on that thing.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.960
When we reinstall all the other machines in the studio, you got to have one you know is

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
working.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
Right.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.680
And I honestly was not looking forward to it because the new gnome shell has kind of

34:49.680 --> 34:50.680
broken me.

34:50.680 --> 34:51.680
It's very fast.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.240
It's very nice.

34:53.240 --> 34:56.560
And I hate to go back to slower.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.200
Cannot stand to downgrade.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.440
And I was really hemming and hawing putting it off.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.600
And this gives me an opportunity here.

35:04.600 --> 35:12.000
I can I can get the latest and greatest and have a pretty solid chance it's going to upgrade

35:12.000 --> 35:13.640
as smoothly as say a fedora system will.

35:13.640 --> 35:17.600
I mean, I'm already looking forward to finding out how that goes.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.600
So I'm going to put it on my main workstation upstairs.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
Hooey Wes.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
Here I go.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.400
You know, my dad used to have a saying, I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
sure.

35:26.400 --> 35:31.160
I think that applies to you in desktop environments.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.800
You know, hey, if they keep making it better, I'm not going to ignore it.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.800
I'm no fool.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.080
I'm going to acknowledge it.

35:37.080 --> 35:44.120
Plus, I mean, you'll already be set up for making all those deep fakes.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.120
You know, that's my new hobby.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.760
I'm going to set up a side hustle where I just do deep fakes for hire.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.880
I probably should have said that on air.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.880
Damn it.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.320
Well, I can I can attest to pop us being pretty solid, man.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.280
I mean, I've been using it since March.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.560
The upgrade process was super.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.760
I mean, it was just painless.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.480
It did, in fact, pop up, say that there's a new version available.

36:04.480 --> 36:09.680
So what I did there, it popped up, hey, oh, it did say there was a new version available.

36:09.680 --> 36:16.540
It pulled everything down, asked me to reboot, you know, installed the update perfectly right

36:16.540 --> 36:17.580
back into it.

36:17.580 --> 36:18.580
The new contrast.

36:18.580 --> 36:22.640
I mean, immediately, you know, I could notice a difference.

36:22.640 --> 36:27.020
And it was overall a really great experience for me.

36:27.020 --> 36:30.560
I'm installing this on an older 2015 MacBook Pro.

36:30.560 --> 36:35.440
And I really I really have no reason to to go with another distro on that machine, because

36:35.440 --> 36:40.200
very much like you, it's just the get shit done type machine, you know, and it works

36:40.200 --> 36:41.200
great.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.160
I really have no reason to move anywhere else on it.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.600
It was almost good enough to give me to give up fedora on the ThinkPad.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.100
I got close.

36:49.100 --> 36:53.720
And what I ended up doing to compromise is I went through and just beautied up my fedora

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
install.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.720
Oh, it does.

36:55.720 --> 36:56.720
It does look pretty nice.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.120
I got my dash to doc more dialed in.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.240
I got my theme dialed in.

36:59.240 --> 37:04.320
I went and got the pop theme.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.600
You know, something to note here, too.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.840
There is no ZFS on route in the installer for pop OS.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.900
So let's talk about ZFS on route.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.680
The promise is huge.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.100
Eventually one day you have a file system that protects you from bit rot.

37:18.100 --> 37:21.040
It can do incremental snapshots that are elegant.

37:21.040 --> 37:24.660
You could potentially have boot environments, you could move data around, you could over

37:24.660 --> 37:26.120
commit storage.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.280
It integrates with container platforms.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.600
I mean, it's it's truly worth all of the hype.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.600
Right.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
I mean, the advantages are clear.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.960
Now, is it worth it on route, especially if maybe you don't have an MVD drive or maybe

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
you don't have 32 gigs of RAM?

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
Right.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.540
Oftentimes we're thinking about, you know, big systems, maybe custom server builds that

37:44.540 --> 37:47.760
you've designed to be running this file system with a lot of data.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.000
The old myth was you can't use ZFS without ECC RAM.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Right.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
And what about a laptop?

37:53.000 --> 37:57.840
What about kind of not the newest laptop with run of the mill hardware?

37:57.840 --> 38:02.240
Maybe you got a Samsung Evo in there, maybe you got 16 gigs of RAM and you got a few apps

38:02.240 --> 38:07.460
you're using every single day and you don't have a bunch of available memory.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.680
Is this still a good idea?

38:09.680 --> 38:12.320
Genuinely did not know the answer to this question.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.740
And now I'm feeling like we have figured it out.

38:14.740 --> 38:16.720
So Wes and I, I'll give you I'll give you a little bit of basics.

38:16.720 --> 38:23.720
So Wes and I took the Librem 15 with a Evo 850 drive, 512 gigabyte capacity and 16 gigabytes

38:23.720 --> 38:24.720
of RAM.

38:24.720 --> 38:33.640
And I think it's a Skylake processor and we installed Ubuntu 1910 fresh latest spun ISOs

38:33.640 --> 38:38.960
and did one install with extended four and one install with ZFS on route.

38:38.960 --> 38:45.280
Ran the same exact software setup, same exact steps, same exact benchmarks.

38:45.280 --> 38:51.640
Then we did it all over again, but this time we robbed the system of RAM to create and

38:51.640 --> 38:55.320
simulate a very exact amount on both of them.

38:55.320 --> 39:00.440
We took out a chunk of RAM so both of them had to operate in a low memory environment.

39:00.440 --> 39:04.720
And then we started a user session with a terminal and a web browser with some complicated,

39:04.720 --> 39:09.360
but not overly complicated work in there that was reproducible in both environments.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.360
Right.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.100
You know, model something like maybe you're running a bunch of virtual machines or doing

39:13.100 --> 39:17.440
other work or possibly just have a, you know, more low end computer available.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.440
Right.

39:18.440 --> 39:22.540
And so we did things like we threw some compile jobs at the hard disk.

39:22.540 --> 39:27.680
We threw some SQL work, creating lots of little files, creating large files, creating small

39:27.680 --> 39:28.680
files.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.440
We did it with as much RAM as the system could eat and we did it in a more memory pressure

39:32.440 --> 39:33.440
environment.

39:33.440 --> 39:39.000
So we essentially operated the system as if we were using about 60 percent of that 16

39:39.000 --> 39:41.800
gigs when we did the low memory test.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.680
Because then the way we got to this number is we took several of our systems here in

39:44.680 --> 39:49.000
the studio and we loaded them up with our daily driver applications.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.960
Couple of electron apps, some cute apps, some GTK apps, a web browser, a couple of terminals,

39:53.960 --> 39:55.680
you know, that kind of stuff.

39:55.680 --> 40:00.400
And then we came to an average memory usage after they'd been running for a while and

40:00.400 --> 40:05.540
determined, all right, this is what it costs us in memory to run our workstations.

40:05.540 --> 40:10.540
And then we allocated that for this test and ate that up virtually by just slicing it off

40:10.540 --> 40:16.160
from the kernel saying you can't have it and let it go.

40:16.160 --> 40:22.000
And what we found in some ways really surprised the heck out of me.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.120
It's the answer on the broad perspective is it depends on your workload.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
Of course.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.300
Of course it does.

40:28.300 --> 40:35.140
But there's some areas where even in low memory situations, ZFS pulled ahead.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.140
Not in all areas.

40:36.140 --> 40:37.140
No, certainly not.

40:37.140 --> 40:41.400
Because there's many categories where EXE4 is just going to be faster, it's doing less.

40:41.400 --> 40:48.320
If you were to attribute performance failures in a high memory pressure environment, it

40:48.320 --> 40:52.600
was actually extended for the demonstrated most of the variance.

40:52.600 --> 40:56.660
Yeah, that's what kind of surprised us the most is even test where maybe it was already

40:56.660 --> 41:02.200
slower or already faster, the change between having more memory available and it was like

41:02.200 --> 41:03.200
nothing in ZFS.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.680
I mean, you know, it got a little bit worse, but not much.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.160
There was some degradation, but not much.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.640
And then much more for EXE4.

41:07.640 --> 41:13.160
Yeah, you got like an entirely different box in some benchmarks with extended for now in

41:13.160 --> 41:16.840
some situations, extended for may have still performed better than ZFS.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.660
I'll give you an example.

41:18.660 --> 41:22.700
Say you're unzipping a project and you're assembling it and getting it ready to compile.

41:22.700 --> 41:29.640
In that situation, in a low memory or a regular memory situation, extended for is simply faster.

41:29.640 --> 41:32.720
ZFS, though, remains consistent.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.580
And then once you begin to actually build the project, and this could be attributed

41:36.580 --> 41:42.080
to how ZFS caches files, ZFS is actually significantly faster than extended for.

41:42.080 --> 41:47.040
Yeah, you know, it was a pretty healthy competition here between what EXE4 was better at and what

41:47.040 --> 41:48.040
ZFS.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.720
Certainly not one sided in favor of EXE4.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
No.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.520
Michael Lerbal did some of his own benchmarks over at Phyronix, which we'll have linked.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.760
On some higher end hardware.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.000
Yeah, and our results are pretty consistent.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.040
Now he also had a bunch of other more like server applications, stuff like various databases.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.120
And of course, those were faster with EXE4.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.080
And I mean, that's kind of expected.

42:07.080 --> 42:13.720
I was just surprised how similar things were just in the everyday use case and how resilient

42:13.720 --> 42:15.100
ZFS was to memory pressure.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.240
It doesn't really make sense to me if I didn't have the data here.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.320
And we will publish all of this.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.280
And you can compare it to your own systems.

42:22.280 --> 42:25.680
If you are familiar with how to use the Phyronix test suite, actually comparing your system

42:25.680 --> 42:29.060
to our benchmark is one of the easiest things to do with the test suite.

42:29.060 --> 42:32.840
If you're just curious to see how your system would perform.

42:32.840 --> 42:36.880
So we'll publish all of our data with the charts in the show notes.

42:36.880 --> 42:43.280
But by going with this, I have to say, I would advise you're perfectly fine using ZFS.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.640
When you add the benefits.

42:45.640 --> 42:46.640
Right.

42:46.640 --> 42:50.340
Yes, you're probably going to need to be taking care of the benefits and things may still

42:50.340 --> 42:53.160
change here and how Ubuntu is using it.

42:53.160 --> 42:58.120
And one time we did run into a little snag where grub wasn't quite updating properly

42:58.120 --> 43:00.600
after, you know, and that only happened on the ZFS side.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.080
So totally worth doing.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.480
It does seems like it's very usable day to day.

43:05.480 --> 43:08.480
Be aware, you may need to learn a few things about ZFS administration.

43:08.480 --> 43:12.440
That is a good red flag to bring up because I'm only talking about it from a performance

43:12.440 --> 43:15.960
penalty standpoint, not yet from an implementation standpoint.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.320
That's still in flux.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.900
And it's, as they label, experimental.

43:19.900 --> 43:26.140
And you need to consider it as such because ZFS won't protect you from like a total different

43:26.140 --> 43:28.900
scheme of layout change that's incompatible with what you got set up.

43:28.900 --> 43:33.020
Like there's just nothing that's going to or like we ran into grub not updating properly

43:33.020 --> 43:36.520
when we were trying to do a couple of small little things to reduce memory and increase

43:36.520 --> 43:37.520
pressure.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.000
Thankfully, we were just going to reinstall anyway.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Yeah.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, true.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.200
So I do want to make sure it's clear at this point in time as we record, we are talking

43:45.200 --> 43:50.000
about performance and not necessarily about implementation, but in a performance sense,

43:50.000 --> 43:57.440
when you look at all of the crap ZFS does from snapshots to write verification to ZFS

43:57.440 --> 44:02.640
send, which once you wrap your head around what you can do with ZFS send, Extended4 is

44:02.640 --> 44:05.200
going to look like a child's file system.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.640
And when you think about all of this, it just comes with ZFS and it's so big and it's got

44:09.640 --> 44:19.240
all this stuff, the fact that it is competitive on a three-year-old laptop where we intentionally

44:19.240 --> 44:24.480
drain the thing of RAM to give it a real world heavily used system condition.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.480
I mean, we were monitoring too.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
I mean, it was busy.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.040
It was working hard.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.040
It was working really hard.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.040
It was great.

44:30.040 --> 44:35.640
And I'm just damn impressed with what the ZFS project has managed.

44:35.640 --> 44:39.640
I mean, ZFS on Linux, open ZFS in general, it's just fantastic.

44:39.640 --> 44:45.400
And having it available, ready to go without messing around with DKMS, which by and large

44:45.400 --> 44:50.520
is pretty reliable, but I still find myself running into issues and not having that, it

44:50.520 --> 44:53.560
just feels so much more reliable and professional.

44:53.560 --> 44:59.360
I thought what we'd do is I thought we'd come on the show and say, if you just need all-out

44:59.360 --> 45:03.960
performance and you don't care about data integrity, snapshots or any of the other features,

45:03.960 --> 45:08.600
compression, encryption, which by the way, we did not have compression turned on.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.920
Compression may have significantly changed the game here.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.920
We were just using defaults on both.

45:12.920 --> 45:16.880
If we had used compression, ZFS may have kicked ass on this.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.600
It would be really interesting to run it again actually now that I think about it.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.280
Oh boy, there's always more benchmarks.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.520
But anyways, I honestly thought at the end of all this, we'd come here and say, if you

45:25.520 --> 45:30.340
just want full, nothing but performance, go with Extended 4.

45:30.340 --> 45:35.240
But the reality is, depending on your use case, you may actually get higher performance

45:35.240 --> 45:39.160
even in low memory conditions with ZFS, depending on your use case.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.440
We have a few links in the show notes.

45:41.440 --> 45:47.000
The one that I think would be really interesting for you to check out are the low memory versus

45:47.000 --> 45:54.520
regular memory tests and the low memory Extended 4 versus low memory ZFS.

45:54.520 --> 45:58.440
And then it's really easy to compare all of them actually, but we'll have the links in

45:58.440 --> 45:59.440
the show notes.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.360
There's some interesting data.

46:02.360 --> 46:08.120
I walk away from this thinking, it's safe from a performance standpoint to use ZFS,

46:08.120 --> 46:11.240
and even if it's on a system that you want to have high performance from.

46:11.240 --> 46:17.360
And then there's additional benefits as you go up the hardware scale, like when you start

46:17.360 --> 46:22.040
going to MV and E drives, there's additional benefits to going with ZFS.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.040
It just gets better.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.800
And when you start wanting to use multiple disks and pool them together, there's a lot

46:26.800 --> 46:31.960
more benefits to going with ZFS that Extended 4 can't offer without having to strap on LVM

46:31.960 --> 46:36.560
or other management tools, whereas ZFS brings it all in one suite of tools.

46:36.560 --> 46:41.600
So this is really fascinating for me because what the data says is even in a worst case

46:41.600 --> 46:47.600
ZFS scenario, old SSD, three-year-old system, limited memory, it's still very competitive.

46:47.600 --> 46:51.760
And then when you put it in a situation where you have a lot more hardware to throw at it

46:51.760 --> 46:56.200
and you have a lot more disks to throw at it, the benefits just really get bigger.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.200
All right.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
Well, then I think it's prediction time.

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
What do you think?

46:59.200 --> 47:04.240
Does this pave the way to ZFS on root by default in a future Ubuntu release?

47:04.240 --> 47:05.520
Can you see it?

47:05.520 --> 47:09.600
I mean, it would make a lot of sense, especially on the server side when you want to protect

47:09.600 --> 47:12.880
from bogus updates or configuration mistakes.

47:12.880 --> 47:13.880
Right.

47:13.880 --> 47:17.520
And it would be a big advertising point if you had that integrated into that Ubuntu tooling,

47:17.520 --> 47:18.520
right?

47:18.520 --> 47:21.280
Ubuntu is a great choice because look, you can just roll back.

47:21.280 --> 47:26.160
If we could properly get boot environment support at grub, it'd be worth it just to annoy

47:26.160 --> 47:28.040
the BSD crowd that already has it.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.760
You know what I mean?

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
Look, we caught up.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.760
Yeah.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.520
But we talk about it like it's the first time we've got to pretend we've never heard that

47:34.520 --> 47:35.520
they've done it.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.520
Yeah.

47:36.520 --> 47:37.520
They hate that.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.520
Because they hate that.

47:38.520 --> 47:39.520
They hate that.

47:39.520 --> 47:40.520
And so that would really make it perfect.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.080
And that's what I hope for.

47:42.080 --> 47:49.960
Do you think that they would ever shift and do ZFS on the Ubuntu server while ext4 on

47:49.960 --> 47:50.960
the desktop?

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
Could do.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.280
You know, on my machine upstairs when I reload it, I'm not going with CFS on my root.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.280
I'm still waiting.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.480
Again, because that's an implementation thing.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.600
Also likely go pop and they don't have it in the installer.

48:02.600 --> 48:07.800
However, I have three disks that I pooled together and I am absolutely going to move

48:07.800 --> 48:09.360
them over from XFS to ZFS.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
Right.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
That's the other nice thing here.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.960
Even if you don't do it on root, well, if you're running Ubuntu, it's at hand.

48:13.960 --> 48:17.720
I may be near the end of ever really using LVM again.

48:17.720 --> 48:23.560
Although LVM has been great and solid and I've got nothing against it, I like the ZFS

48:23.560 --> 48:24.560
tools better.

48:24.560 --> 48:27.680
And as I learn them more, I think they seem to be more complete.

48:27.680 --> 48:32.520
And the whole idea of bringing it all together where the file system is aware of the hardware

48:32.520 --> 48:38.520
and aware of the RAID and aware of what the user space is doing brings so many advantages.

48:38.520 --> 48:42.120
So it's a bright future either way, because you can still pick whichever file system floats

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
your boat.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.880
But you could also go with something new and furniture.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.440
Chris, if you say it out loud, you know, the BSD folks might hear you.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.240
Are they listening?

48:50.240 --> 48:52.680
Have you done any ZFS experimentation over there?

48:52.680 --> 48:53.680
I have.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.680
Yeah.

48:54.680 --> 49:00.200
So I moved from Debian to Ubuntu for my primary server simply to get the ZFS support.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.200
Oh, really?

49:01.200 --> 49:02.200
Why?

49:02.200 --> 49:03.240
What was so like, gotta have?

49:03.240 --> 49:06.280
Because you've had what, various solutions in the past?

49:06.280 --> 49:12.040
I went to a talk by Jim Salter at Lennox Fest Northwest, and then Alan Jude gave me one

49:12.040 --> 49:14.000
of his books for free and that was that.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.360
That's having two devils on your shoulder in that case, Tanya.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.080
It's really compelling, you know, all the checksumming stuff.

49:20.080 --> 49:25.600
So the use case I use it for is I just have a pair of drives mirrored that store all of

49:25.600 --> 49:26.920
the irreplaceable data.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.880
So my drone footage, my photos and stuff like that.

49:29.880 --> 49:34.360
You know, the stuff that is irreplaceable, genuinely irreplaceable.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.480
And then I use ZFS Send to send that to England and then Duplicati does a bunch of other stuff

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
with it as well.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.120
But I've really been enjoying it.

49:42.120 --> 49:46.480
And yes, there's a lot to learn and there's some monitoring stuff with how like DF handles

49:46.480 --> 49:51.720
monitoring free space and there are some things to learn, but I don't mind learning stuff.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.200
That's part of the fun for me.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.680
Yeah, it does have a learning overhead.

49:54.680 --> 49:57.360
Yeah, but that's true for, you know, anytime you kind of step out of the box, right?

49:57.360 --> 49:58.360
Even with ThunderFest.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
True.

49:59.360 --> 50:00.360
Okay.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.360
Yeah, very fair.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.840
Brent, you had a question about CFS capabilities.

50:02.840 --> 50:08.120
Yeah, well, I often tend to like default to using encryption in many places as a way of

50:08.120 --> 50:10.280
forcing myself to learn it.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.080
But I wondered about ZFS and encryption.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.520
Does anybody have any experience with that or has done any research?

50:15.520 --> 50:20.120
I haven't played with it too much yet, but they do now have it natively inside CFS.

50:20.120 --> 50:24.880
I think before I usually would, you know, kind of to layer it on, but that would sidestep

50:24.880 --> 50:28.600
some of the direct, give CFS direct access to the disk benefits.

50:28.600 --> 50:30.240
I haven't played too much with it though.

50:30.240 --> 50:35.560
Yeah, so it, I think just recently landed in the last couple of point releases for CFS

50:35.560 --> 50:36.600
on Linux.

50:36.600 --> 50:42.880
Rebsd has had some solutions for a little while, but it's pretty nice.

50:42.880 --> 50:46.920
One of the things that I'll probably look at doing in the future is you can, in CFS,

50:46.920 --> 50:48.800
you can have these concepts of pools of disks.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.560
So you can have like a media pool and like a documents pool and stuff like that.

50:53.560 --> 50:58.600
And you can do partitions across them or whatnot, but you can also just say encrypt everything

50:58.600 --> 50:59.720
in this pool.

50:59.720 --> 51:04.720
So if you have, if you want to have like a documents folder in your home folder, that

51:04.720 --> 51:06.960
could actually be mapped to an entire storage pool.

51:06.960 --> 51:11.480
That one folder could be mapped to the documents pool and you could just say anything I put,

51:11.480 --> 51:15.400
which just looks like a folder to you, but it's actually an entire pool of disks.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.520
Anything I put in this folder encrypted.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.400
And then once you set it, it's done.

51:19.400 --> 51:20.400
You don't worry about it.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.400
You're exciting me.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.240
I think, you know, it's not quite there.

51:23.240 --> 51:28.480
It's not daily driver yet, but we've got such great potential where the desktop environments

51:28.480 --> 51:32.040
and the toolkits around them, because like we haven't given a lot of attention to plasma

51:32.040 --> 51:38.400
on this release, but also just still doing great, still doing great, very solid and working

51:38.400 --> 51:44.200
away at their Wayland support, making it, making it a top priority for Kwin.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.840
It's really gotten to a good spot.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.640
So, and this is just another part of it.

51:47.640 --> 51:52.720
This is just, this is a part of the stack that we get to enjoy as free software users.

51:52.720 --> 51:57.720
We just get this stuff for free and a whole team of people worked on packaging this all

51:57.720 --> 52:03.080
up for us and then one day an arbitrary date, they decide you now get this thing and it,

52:03.080 --> 52:04.080
it can change your life.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.640
It can like, it can save your precious memories.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.600
It can change how you back up and move data around the world.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.580
It can provide features that you've never thought possible with your computer before.

52:12.580 --> 52:15.840
It makes your computer more capable, even if you choose not to use it.

52:15.840 --> 52:16.840
That's awesome.

52:16.840 --> 52:17.840
That's it, right?

52:17.840 --> 52:20.200
Like, I mean, there's no going back if you're like, Oh, I didn't think I'd want those pictures,

52:20.200 --> 52:22.120
but I left them on this old drive here.

52:22.120 --> 52:25.640
I mean, if you have ZFS underneath, you know, better safe than sorry.

52:25.640 --> 52:30.480
Well, and if you just look at it from like an old school, like imagine your, your favorite

52:30.480 --> 52:35.500
Linux distro as a boxed product on the shelf and you know, every year they got to have

52:35.500 --> 52:37.480
new bullet points on that box.

52:37.480 --> 52:44.720
Well, your favorite distro box, if it's Ubuntu based, just got some unbelievable features

52:44.720 --> 52:49.360
that just would, if you're looking at it from like features on a box standpoint, it's just

52:49.360 --> 52:50.360
incredible.

52:50.360 --> 52:54.160
And you combine that with everything else we can do on Linux these days and just, just

52:54.160 --> 52:55.920
blows my mind.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
Just blows my mind.

52:56.920 --> 53:01.620
So check out the links in the show notes for our benchmarks, including the comparison of

53:01.620 --> 53:06.480
low memory versus high memory, them with just, you know, having at the system as much as

53:06.480 --> 53:09.560
they can and then compare it to your system.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.700
Yeah, we'd love to see that.

53:10.700 --> 53:13.000
Maybe let us know if you get some interesting results.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.140
I have a pick for you this week that I think is going to be perfect for you, Mr. Bacon.

53:17.140 --> 53:19.480
It's called ThinkPad Tools.

53:19.480 --> 53:23.220
This is going to be applicable to everybody, but it's pretty nice for those of you that

53:23.220 --> 53:25.360
have a ThinkPad out there and it sounds like you just got one.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.360
Yeah.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.800
So I just recently picked one up.

53:27.800 --> 53:33.360
I picked up the older T440S.

53:33.360 --> 53:38.240
After doing some research, I probably should have got the T440P, but you know, it is what

53:38.240 --> 53:39.240
it is.

53:39.240 --> 53:43.560
170 bucks, 12 gigs of RAM, 256 gig SSD.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.560
I think he just wanted to brag.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.560
That's why he brought this up.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
Shut up.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
This is the biggest humble brag.

53:47.560 --> 53:51.920
Well, I mean, you could find the same deal for a little bit cheaper if you did some digging

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
out there.

53:52.920 --> 54:01.040
But after watching Popey go on his spiel about it, he makes me want to buy used ThinkPads

54:01.040 --> 54:02.040
too.

54:02.040 --> 54:08.880
Well, and then I just given my older ThinkPad to L, so I was jonesing for that track point

54:08.880 --> 54:09.880
again, you know?

54:09.880 --> 54:11.240
Well, welcome back to the club.

54:11.240 --> 54:14.840
You know, like having a ThinkPad, I hadn't experienced this before having one.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.440
It kind of is like a little club.

54:16.440 --> 54:20.680
There's something special about Linux users and ThinkPads, and that's why we get all the

54:20.680 --> 54:24.080
nice toys like the pick this week, ThinkPad tools.

54:24.080 --> 54:28.600
So sorry if you don't have a ThinkPad, although maybe take Jesus advice and go find one near

54:28.600 --> 54:29.600
you.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.400
I can't believe that.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.400
That's a great value.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.400
And that'll be a great test machine.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.360
You know, we've got a nice range now.

54:35.360 --> 54:39.480
We've got a good range of super high end machines that are ridiculous in scale.

54:39.480 --> 54:43.600
And then we've got machines that are real practical daily drivers that people might

54:43.600 --> 54:47.440
be picking up either second hand or just own for a couple of years and don't need to replace

54:47.440 --> 54:48.440
it.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.520
So I think we're going to get a good, with the whole team now, we're getting good representative

54:51.520 --> 54:53.080
sample of people's machines.

54:53.080 --> 54:56.840
The other thing I'd like to add about ThinkPads is that they're super easy to repair.

54:56.840 --> 55:01.120
I swapped out the keyboard on my wife's ThinkPad in about an hour.

55:01.120 --> 55:06.000
You know, so even if you pour water over the thing, it's cheap and easy to repair.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.560
We don't recommend you do that.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.040
We do not recommend you do that.

55:09.040 --> 55:11.320
Anyways, if you're thinking, well, what does it do?

55:11.320 --> 55:14.000
It'll adjust the track point speed and sensitivity.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.360
It'll help you get better battery information and it can help you troubleshoot that under

55:18.360 --> 55:19.360
vaulting CPU issue.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.360
We've talked about before.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.800
I mean, I didn't know that my sensitivity was 128, but now I do.

55:23.800 --> 55:24.800
Now you do, Wes.

55:24.800 --> 55:29.000
Actually, it is like, I mean, the little battery status is nicely displayed in the terminal

55:29.000 --> 55:30.200
and it's just in Python.

55:30.200 --> 55:31.200
So it's easy to install.

55:31.200 --> 55:32.200
Yeah.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.200
So check that out.

55:33.200 --> 55:37.960
Link in the notes for that and all of it's at linuxunplug.com slash three, two, four.

55:37.960 --> 55:42.160
While you're there, you can subscribe to get the show directly every single week at linuxunplug.com

55:42.160 --> 55:43.280
slash subscribe.

55:43.280 --> 55:46.080
But more importantly, if you want to give us your thoughts, your feedback, your take

55:46.080 --> 55:50.560
on the new release of 1910 or anything else we've talked about, linuxunplug.com slash

55:50.560 --> 55:51.560
contact.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.560
That's so easy.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.640
There's just like a form there and it sends an email for you.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.640
Easy, easy.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.680
You could also tweet us at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

55:58.680 --> 55:59.680
Yeah.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.080
And the whole network's at Jupiter Signal.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.080
That guy right there.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.080
At Wes Payne.

56:03.080 --> 56:04.080
I'm at Chris LAS.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.080
Cheesy.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.080
I'm at cheesebacon.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.080
C-H-C-B-A-C-O-N.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.240
Go get some Alex.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.640
At Alex is a K-T-Z on the Twitter.

56:11.640 --> 56:12.640
Ironic Badger.

56:12.640 --> 56:13.640
Oh, that's right.

56:13.640 --> 56:14.640
Ironic Badger.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.640
Yes.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.640
Ironic Badger.

56:16.640 --> 56:17.640
Ironic Badger.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.480
Go get some Alex, too.

56:19.480 --> 56:23.000
It's so ironic that I forgot that, except for that's not ironic.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
That's not ironic at all.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
I know.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
I know.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm sorry.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Anyways, and did I mention mine?

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Probably.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
You did, yeah.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.920
But you didn't mention that you should go get more of you and Alex over at that self-hosted

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
show.

56:33.920 --> 56:34.920
Oh, we should mention that.

56:34.920 --> 56:35.920
Uh-huh.

56:35.920 --> 56:36.920
Yeah.

56:36.920 --> 56:43.520
And while we're just doing plug skis, I should mention TechSnap.Systems slash 414.

56:43.520 --> 56:49.360
Wes and Jim have such a great discussion on ZFS in general, especially like around the

56:49.360 --> 56:50.360
snapshot stuff.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.360
There's so many good points.

56:52.360 --> 56:57.160
But Jim's explanation of snapshots truly made me understand it and appreciate why it can

56:57.160 --> 57:01.600
happen pretty quick, why the snapshots don't take a ton of disk space, and why it's kind

57:01.600 --> 57:04.440
of a big deal that this is landing on such a large Linux distro.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
Yeah.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
Put it all into perspective.

57:06.440 --> 57:11.220
TechSnap.Systems slash 414, and join us next Tuesday over at jblive.tv.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.920
We do this show at 2 p.m. Pacific at jblive.tv.

57:14.920 --> 57:15.920
Got a chat room, the mumble.

57:15.920 --> 57:43.200
See you back here next Tuesday!

57:45.920 --> 57:57.160
Now, we gotta title this thing.

57:57.160 --> 57:58.160
Potato Computing.

57:58.160 --> 57:59.160
I like that.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.520
It's as slow as a potato.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.520
You know what?

58:02.520 --> 58:06.040
Potatoes are great, so let's not throw potatoes under the bus.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.240
Especially them free-range taters.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.880
It's the only ethical kind of tater.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
Of course.

58:09.880 --> 58:10.880
It's a free-range tater.

58:10.880 --> 58:11.880
Be kind to the potatoes.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.200
So, uh, let's go get this thing named.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.440
I'm gonna vote for RamBurglars.

58:16.440 --> 58:21.720
I'm going to, like, try to slam this install on my system, and then be done.

58:21.720 --> 58:26.720
Because in the last three weeks, I got a different phone, I've been loading and reloading systems,

58:26.720 --> 58:28.280
and so, like, nothing's set up.

58:28.280 --> 58:31.360
Like, I gotta log into everything, you know what I'm saying?

58:31.360 --> 58:35.760
Like, it's just been weeks of setting up software, so, like, I'm gonna, after this show's over.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.760
Should we take away your root privileges on there?

58:37.760 --> 58:38.760
Just to be fair.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.760
I'll set a BIOS password.

58:40.760 --> 58:41.760
Right, yes.

58:41.760 --> 58:42.760
No more.

58:42.760 --> 58:48.080
So, after this episode, I'm going upstairs, I'm reloading that box, I'm ordering food,

58:48.080 --> 58:52.360
and I'm not leaving the studio until my basics are logged into.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.360
And I'm calling it good for a while.

58:53.360 --> 58:54.600
It's nice to have that ready to go, though, right?

58:54.600 --> 59:13.600
So, like, tomorrow, you can actually just get work done.
