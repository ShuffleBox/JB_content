1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Okay, boys, how we feeling about the news that Lenart Pottering has ended up at Microsoft. Hey, I hope you got a nice payday

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,020
At least you got a figure right? That's a pretty good get

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,040
There's really no clue as to what he's doing over there. There's been speculation. He's working on WSL

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, do we even know like a title or anything? Oh, I love how this got discovered which was purely by accident, right through an email

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,560
Yeah, yeah, it was just and it was sort of revealed after it happened quite a bit

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,760
you know, of course Lenart famous for creating pulse audio and then later system D huge contributor to the desktop as we know it today and

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,080
Now at Microsoft for reasons we don't know but we do hope you know

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,240
It was a great move for him Lenart. You ought to move up to the Pacific Northwest be in the home base and

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,740
Shoot us a message. We'll take you out and show you some of the best places to eat, right?

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:56,160
Take Lenart out on the town. Ask him all of the secrets about Red Hat and system D

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,980
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes and my name is Brent

12
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,900
Hello guys, welcome on in. We got a big show a big announcement

13
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,420
Announcement this week. We'll have a very special guest to join us to help with our big announcement

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,140
We've been waiting to tell you for weeks. Plus we burnt another night with a big server outage

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,980
We do it. So you don't have to guys. We'll share you what went wrong and we'll share you our attempt to fix it

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,700
That's why we do it. We're doing this intentionally. I think so. That's what I tell myself

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,180
They will or end it all out with some boosts and picks and a whole lot more so before we go any further

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,180
Let's say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug. Hello mumble room

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,760
Hello, what a fantastic showing and hung in there with us through technical challenges today

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,740
We had a power outage before the show started how even it was crazy, right?

21
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,540
And that was even after West put in all those UPS batteries. Well, we forgot the battery part

22
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:13,240
But next time we'll get the batteries. Well, and someone's kind of got to join the circuit by holding both ends, right?

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:21,320
Right. Hey, I want to say a special good morning to tail scale tail scale is a VPN protected by wire guards noise protocol

24
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,120
We love it. We use it

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,700
It will change your game and you can get tail scale up and running in minutes

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,420
Get it on all your machines build your own flat mesh network in minutes. So go say

27
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,680
Good morning to the folks over at tail scale. Go try it on up to 20 devices for free

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,660
Tailscale.com for you can love tail scale. You got to go try it out tailscale

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,140
Com let's get right into this week's episode because Brent has put together a very special treat for us

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,620
We've got two brunches and one of them is on theme today

31
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,820
Yeah, previously if you remember we did a brunch with Quentin Stafford Frazier, which is really great

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,520
Check that out extras dot show slash 86, but this week the real highlight is a brunch

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,500
I did with Tim Canham that's at brunch show 87 you could find it there Tim is a

34
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,720
Fascinating gentleman. We've had him on Linux unplugged previously

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,100
I believe earlier last year he is a senior software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,740
Had a very deep hand on the Mars helicopter project

37
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,140
and so he and I got a chance to sit down earlier and

38
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,020
Talk about all sorts of pretty amazing topics that I think all of you would really enjoy everything from

39
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,420
The software and hardware that's powering NASA's ingenuity helicopter

40
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,100
But also and I think this is the extra juicy stuff what it was like to kind of craft

41
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,420
JPL switch from Solaris to Linux back in the day and

42
00:03:52,420 --> 00:04:00,040
How they're using open source tools and projects and the philosophy over at JPL these days

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
So here's a little snippet

44
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,200
Tim thanks for joining me on season two of brunch with Brent. I really appreciate having you well, thanks

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,460
It's great to be here

46
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:23,100
Tim for those who don't know you joined us early last year on Linux unplugged

47
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,820
could you give us a little bit of an introduction of who you are and

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,740
What you do? Well, I am a software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

49
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,580
In Southern California and for those who might not know you have NASA as a whole

50
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,260
but then there are centers around the country that have various responsibilities and

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,860
The Jet Propulsion Lab their responsibility has always been robotic spacecraft. You know, we don't have a pilot

52
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,180
It's not where you don't do man launches. So all these spacecraft. You've read about over the years like Voyager and Cassini and

53
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,460
the Mars Rovers those were all built and

54
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,100
Launched and operated by the Jet Propulsion Lab. And so I started there in 1991 coming out of school and I've been there ever since

55
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,740
Except for one brief trip out to industry in the mid-90s, but I've been back and doing that ever since and

56
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,780
My background is I'm an electrical engineer

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,180
but I during my studies I also studied computer architectures and

58
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,500
Software so I might much of my career spent living in that

59
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
straddling that world between

60
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
software and hardware and

61
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:39,580
So over the years I worked on a number of projects at JPL. I worked on when I first came out of school that worked in their deep space network for those who

62
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,580
who may not be familiar JPL has three sites around the globe so that as a globe rotates all these deep space

63
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,180
Spacecraft can be in view of the earth. So there are these gigantic antennas. One of them is 70 meters across if you can imagine antenna

64
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,580
That's most most of the width of a football field wide

65
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,580
So when I early in my career, I worked writing software to operate those systems

66
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,580
And then as my career went on I switched to the flight side worked on Cassini for a while worked on the Curiosity rover

67
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,580
The one that's on that's been on the surface for 10 years now much of that software was brought forward to the Perseverance rover

68
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,580
So I have software running on that rover as well. But obviously the most in the last

69
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Five years or so. I've been working on the Mars helicopter, which is a small semi autonomous helicopter

70
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580
That is a companion to the Perseverance rover

71
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:38,580
And so we operate the helicopter via the rover and it does flights around in the vicinity of the rover doing scouting

72
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Taking pictures getting a lot of great flight data

73
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,580
And so that project launched with the rover last year

74
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,580
We landed in February so we're almost coming up on a year of the rover being on the surface

75
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,580
And then during April we did a series of primary flights to prove the concept of flying on Mars

76
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,580
And then they went so well and we got so many awesome pictures that they decided to extend our our mission

77
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,580
So we've been doing an extended mission of flying around and doing scouting for the rover ever since

78
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,580
And it sounds like you were in part let's say in part

79
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,580
But you can you can accept the whole thing if you like in part responsible for some of the Linux adoption

80
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,580
That went into you know, I think this was a deep project where you it's kind of experimental

81
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,580
And you were telling me earlier how Linux was a natural progression from things like Solaris back in the day

82
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,580
How was that transition for you from one to the other?

83
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,580
And why was Linux interesting to you back then? And why is it interesting to you again today?

84
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Well coming from the Linux angle about 15 years ago when we were when JPL was very much a Solaris house was

85
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,580
I saw kind of the democratization of the platform as a good thing

86
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,580
Because with Solaris, you know, it was this big corporate package and you bought their hardware with it

87
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
And it was very much a silo

88
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,580
But the hardware with the software with the services all together and they were also extremely expensive

89
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,580
To rewind like the internal clock, but you know back in the 2002-2003 era

90
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,580
You know one of the one of the standard Sun workstations was anywhere between 15 and 20 thousand dollars a pop

91
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,580
They were very expensive

92
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Back then that was actually even more money than we think about these days, right?

93
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
Exactly

94
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,580
And as I mentioned in I think it was this podcast, you know our previous the Linux unplugged one was

95
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,580
I discovered Linux and I put together a system out of basic parts you can buy from Fry's electronics

96
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,580
May it rest in peace, you know

97
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
I was thinking you were gonna say Radio Shack

98
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,580
But I put together a PC for a couple grand at work and ran Linux on it

99
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,580
And it compiled our code at the time twice as fast as the Sun machine did that cost seven to eight times more

100
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,580
But I'm surprised that that experiment hadn't been done before in a sense like that the Solaris guys weren't like

101
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Oh, we kind of really keep track of of what else is out there

102
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
And and so what was the incentive for you to even give that a try?

103
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Well, I was trying to you know, I saw some of these tool environments that I kind of like that were in Linux

104
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,580
you know build build environments and things like that and not pilers and and

105
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:31,580
I saw it as a way to take advantage of them and also just trying to be a good if you will a good steward of JPL's money

106
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Right if we could have a project where we could sometimes the developers would have to share machines because they were just so expensive

107
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,580
And you know the idea that you could you could have more machines that were more powerful and more people's desks

108
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,580
just kind of was a multiplier of people's efficiency and a better use of JPL's money

109
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,580
And so I that's why I started looking into it for my project

110
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,580
And we essentially turned on a dime at that point and we would switch from Solaris to Linux

111
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,580
And then when I was hired on to do curiosity the rover project

112
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,580
They were still using or were planning on using Sun boxes from the previous project

113
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,580
And I just said, well, let's try this, you know, let's switch and use these Linux machines instead

114
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,580
because they're much more powerful and they're cheaper so we can buy more of them and for more developers

115
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
And you know, they were skeptical at first

116
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,580
But once I made you know, I showed from my trade study that we did that it worked better

117
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:37,580
They pretty much switched to and now it's very pervasive on the flight side of the house of JPL to use Linux for not only development

118
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,580
but the ground systems themselves, they run on Linux

119
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,580
And so back 15 years ago and I don't want to claim sole credit for this because there's other people that were advocating for it

120
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,580
I was just in a position where I could actually do it

121
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:00,580
But what's happened in the last five or 10 years is that there's been a big switch to containerization and cloud tools

122
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:08,580
Right, so I was able to get us to we're actually using Linux on physical boxes, which was a big change

123
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,580
And then in recent years, they've switched to, you know, running a big giant VMware instances

124
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Now they're starting to transition to doing everything on the cloud

125
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:24,580
So there's like this AWS government cloud where the AWS provides services to run containers

126
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,580
And so JPL switching a lot of their infrastructure to use them instead of physical machines

127
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,580
But it's still all living within a Linux world

128
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
And so I'm glad I played a part in that

129
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,580
I don't want to overstate my role, but I think it was it happened at the right time to kind of catch the trend

130
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,580
Well, in many ways, it sounds like you're really just taking the attitude that, you know, new technologies need to be looked at

131
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,580
and considered and implemented if they really make sense

132
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,580
And that I would imagine at a place like JPL is kind of it should be the way to go

133
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,580
And and OK, we rely on what we know

134
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,580
But we need to still stay very current because some of the new technologies allow things like, you know

135
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,580
the Mars helicopter to be as small as it is and to do some of the things it's doing

136
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,580
So I would say kudos to you for keeping your thumb on new technologies

137
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
and not being afraid to continue to dive in

138
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:23,580
Even, you know, even even this far into your experience with with all that stuff to not stagnate is no small thing I'd say

139
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,580
And I don't think it's overt, but it's very likely that JPL getting a lot of institutional experience with Linux

140
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,580
to the point where they trusted it for some of their critical tools for the ground systems or for development

141
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,580
and even some of the enterprise tools that they use, you know, that are business related

142
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:46,580
When it came time just to proffer up the helicopter as a platform running Linux

143
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,580
You know, they at least had some institutional comfort with Linux as an idea

144
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Because back when I was first doing it, it was kind of viewed as this

145
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,580
How do I put it? Like the crazy uncle who's got everything wired up in his basement

146
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,580
You know, the people that were pushing Linux were kind of fringe

147
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,580
You know, that's how they were viewed because they didn't have these enterprise solutions like Sun offered at the time

148
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,580
And so if we had come completely out of the cold and just said, hey, we're going to fly Linux on a helicopter

149
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,580
You know, they there could have been a lot more resistance to it had we already not made the transition

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Linode.com slash unplugged

151
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,580
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show

152
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Let them know you heard about it here

153
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Linode is how we've built everything

154
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,580
A couple of days ago, we were working on an outage of our own making

155
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,580
And it was really nice to have Linode in there as our co-pilot, if you will

156
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
You know, I could go into the dashboard

157
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,580
I could get all the disk information I needed so we could sort things out

158
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:52,580
And I was able to quickly resize the disk which gave us the breathing room we needed to get things back online

159
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,580
It's nice not having to fight Linode's interface or Linode's capabilities

160
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Or having to like trick their customer service into helping

161
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
They have just the best support too

162
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,580
And that's always kind of in the back of our mind if we ever get really stuck

163
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,580
And their S3 compatible object storage has been such a useful tool for us

164
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,580
I think once you wrap your head around it, you're going to love it

165
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Even just for your backups

166
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Of course, I've got cloud firewalls

167
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager

168
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Super fast networking

169
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
They've got 11 data centers around the world

170
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,580
They've been doing MVME PCIe upgrades for their hard drives, AMD EPYC CPUs for their big CPU rigs

171
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,580
And they've got pricing that's going to work for an individual or for a business

172
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,580
It's 30-50% cheaper than those hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy esoteric platform

173
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,580
And Linode has just recently rolled out Kali Linux support

174
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,580
I kid you not guys, at one point when I was back in the quote unquote industry

175
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,580
I almost just laugh at myself just saying it now

176
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,580
But I kid you not, we were seriously investigating building a solution like this ourselves and selling it to clients

177
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Because there's real utility in installing Kali Linux in a remote, safe cloud location

178
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
And then checking your network

179
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,580
You know, even if it's just a couple machines or it's an entire business network

180
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
It's such an incredible tool

181
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,580
And they have it in their app marketplace too, so you can get it up and going in just seconds

182
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,580
That's Linode, it's powerful, it's fast

183
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
It's Linux to the core

184
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,580
And they support some of your favorite shows and some of your favorite community projects and events too

185
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,580
So go say hello, get $100 in 60-day credit and support the show

186
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Go sign up and see why we love it so much

187
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Linode.com slash unplugged

188
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Brent, that was a fantastic talk with Tim

189
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,580
And the entire conversation is available at extras.show

190
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,580
We've already published it, so we'll drop a link in the show notes for that as well

191
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,580
But one of the reasons we wanted to play that chat

192
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,580
Is because it ties in with an announcement that we have here on the show

193
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,580
So, let's start this off because there's a lot to it

194
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,580
We have a very special meetup that we're planning at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

195
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
On September 29th at 12.30pm

196
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
It's a special tour from our friends at JPL

197
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,580
They do have some restrictions in notes, so we'll link to their public tours page

198
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,580
And it's going to be limited to 20 audience members

199
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,580
So it's going to be a little bit tricky to figure out how we do this

200
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Now don't worry, this is not the only meetup that we'll be doing

201
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Oh no

202
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,580
No, we're going all the way in and we're doing a west coast tour

203
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
And so we'll probably do something like half a dozen meetups in that route

204
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
But we need to know where you're at

205
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,580
And we need to be able to plan and be smart about our fuel usage

206
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,580
So we have spun up a west coast crew matrix room

207
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Where we're hoping that if you are on the west coast

208
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,580
And you'd be interested in a JB meetup in your area

209
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,580
You'll let us know you're out there so we can start getting some data

210
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
So we can start planning this route

211
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,580
We're also going to need some local experts to help us pick out locations

212
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,580
That we could go for a meetup or maybe a spot JOOPS could park

213
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,580
Especially, I know immediately we're going to need to know a dinner place near JPL

214
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Since we can only fit 20 audience members at JPL for the tour

215
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,580
We want to do a meetup nearby maybe like the next day or something like that

216
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Where we can all sit down and do dinner

217
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,580
So if you're in the area that could be really helpful if you get in that matrix chat room

218
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
We'll have that linked in the chat room

219
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,580
I also made a short URL out of it to make it easy

220
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,580
It's just bit.ly slash west coast crew

221
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,580
And that'll take you to our matrix chat room

222
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,580
Tips via email and boosts are great too

223
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,580
But we're hoping really to build a long term community in that matrix chat room

224
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,580
So if you join us in there we'll have a link for that in the show notes

225
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,580
But this is something very awesome that we are very excited about

226
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,580
And very grateful that Tim has extended this opportunity to us

227
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
No kidding

228
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,580
And we're huge space nerds so to be able to go down to JPL

229
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,580
And see all of it down there is going to be

230
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Well it's an opportunity of a lifetime for us

231
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Linode is on board for another Linode on the road road trip to help us get down there

232
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
So we're going to make a whole tour out of it

233
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,580
And we're just getting it all figured out right now

234
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,580
We will have meetup details and locations as we figure them out at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

235
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,580
But phase one is really we're just trying to get some signal of if you're out there

236
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,580
So if you're out there and you want to do a meetup in your area on the west coast

237
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,580
And I include basically Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California that general area

238
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
We almost never stop in the Portland area

239
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
We almost always just blast right on through

240
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
So if you're out there let us know

241
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
You can send us a boost and say you're in the area

242
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Or you could join that matrix chat room that'd be great

243
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Or send us an email and we can start figuring it out

244
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,580
But we know ultimately our end destination will be the jet propulsion laboratory

245
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Where we will meet up do a small tour there

246
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
And then we'll have you know subsequent meetups

247
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
It's just super exciting it's a great opportunity

248
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,580
And it's really nice because there's not a lot of events going on

249
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,580
We're starting to see more starting to come back

250
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,580
But there still hasn't been like the full return of events

251
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,580
And we've been missing it we've been missing the audience you know

252
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,580
Especially after what a great time we had in Raleigh recently

253
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Yeah which

254
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,580
And we're feeling a little jealous we don't get to go to the London meetup I know I am

255
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,580
We may have a Raleigh matrix chat room soon as well

256
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Because Brent's going to be in the area

257
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
And maybe doing some micro meetups

258
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,580
It's true while Alex is in London I'm going to be at his place

259
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
That West Coast crew matrix room

260
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,580
That again is bit.ly slash west coast crew

261
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,580
And we'd just like to get an idea if you're out there where you're at

262
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,580
If you've got any suggestions that could hold

263
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
You know 30 40 people or something like that

264
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,580
And the near JPL too would be really helpful

265
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Super excited about that

266
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,580
We'll have more details to share as well as planning that will happen in office hours

267
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
So stay tuned

268
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Just a quick spot of housekeeping I want to mention that you can become a member

269
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,580
You get an ad free copy of all of the shows at Jupiter.party

270
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Of course you can become just an unplugged core contributor at unpluggedcore.com

271
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,580
You also get access as an option to the live show feed which is like twice the show

272
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,580
Usually it's a lot of Brent cussing but other than that

273
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Mostly

274
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
But you got to listen to find out really

275
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Yeah Brent you potty mouth

276
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,580
But yeah Jupiter.party to become a network member and support the independent podcast here

277
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,580
I mean the reality is guys we do a niche you know

278
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,580
We're never going to we're never going to get like a million views on YouTube

279
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Or go viral on Twitter talking about

280
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,580
No matter how many ridiculous faces you make I mean you keep trying

281
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
I try yeah I try

282
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,580
We really really thrive on direct audience support

283
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,580
And so your membership is a great way to do that at Jupiter.party

284
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,580
All right we have a bit of a tale of woe this week

285
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Here here I was 10 p.m. Thursday minding my own business

286
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Making myself a snack before kind of getting ready for bed you know the usual usual evening

287
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,580
I see a message on my phone from Brent nothing nothing too unusual you know he

288
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
We've been chatting a lot lately

289
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
And we tend to stay up late too

290
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,580
We sure do but there was something about this message

291
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Sounded simple

292
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Hey is Matrix down for you

293
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,580
But I had a sinking feeling that was going to change the course of my evening

294
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I even paused for a moment because I was like surely it's me

295
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,580
You know I have I have pretty terrible Internet over here and stuff

296
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,580
So usually the problem is just like I gotta wait a half an hour

297
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,580
And so I did and things didn't change and I just thought is it too late

298
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,580
No I'll just try it'll be fine it'll be fine

299
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,580
And so well I asked and the answer kind of surprised me

300
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
I didn't go figure

301
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,580
We all were kind of doing something different in the Matrix rooms at different times

302
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,580
So one of us would inevitably going to notice but it's always Brent

303
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,580
You know I was sitting down to contribute again

304
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,580
I've gotten this routine this week of sitting down late at night and contributing to our new website

305
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Which has been really great

306
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,580
And so I sat down as usual as I had the last you know four nights before then

307
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,580
And I was just kind of looking at my phone

308
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Four nights before then and I was just going to check our little Matrix chat room

309
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
We have a little website Matrix chat room

310
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Everybody keeps in tabs of what's happening there

311
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,580
And I couldn't update people

312
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
And that's really how it started

313
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
I sat down just to get started

314
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,580
And then I couldn't I couldn't do step number one

315
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
And so I looped both of you guys

316
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
And I mean we can't have a sad Brent

317
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
No and of course there I am right

318
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,580
By this point I got one kid down

319
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,580
I'm managing two other kids

320
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,580
My wife Adia is out that evening

321
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,580
She's hanging out with her lady friends

322
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm literally just like trying to get everything settled down for the night

323
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,580
And well we decide we all got to jump on a call

324
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I'm just doing dishes while we take care of the Matrix server

325
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
Oh that's nice

326
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Yeah

327
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
So I'm sitting there doing that stuff

328
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
One kid falls asleep while we're on the phone

329
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
Two other kids still missing

330
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,580
We got to track them down because it's way past the time they're supposed to be out

331
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
But of course now the Matrix server is down

332
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
And Wes like the pro that he is

333
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,580
He kind of gives us like a good solid like stand up meeting recap of the situation

334
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Before we ended up down this route of you know dumping our entire database

335
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
And restoring it somewhere else

336
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,580
We realized that our Matrix server had gone offline

337
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:35,580
And then it turned out that we had eaten up all the extra disk space that we'd given it just a few months ago

338
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Oh yeah okay

339
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,580
We were able to allocate a little extra disk space by reclaiming the stuff that ext4 auto reserves for root

340
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Which is quite handy

341
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,580
And that was enough to allow us to bring the database back online

342
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,580
And Postgres is pretty good about you know it's got its write ahead log and stuff

343
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,580
So it can restore itself pretty well from that kind of failure usually

344
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
And it seemed to restore just fine in our case

345
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,580
But we did have enough room to do a preliminary run of this Rust program

346
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,580
That compresses the state groups

347
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
So we did get that to run

348
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,580
They hopefully provide a repo that has a Docker file

349
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,580
So you could just if you already have Docker compose going for Synapse

350
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,580
You can just tell it to go build this and then run it

351
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,580
And then they the first time I used it they only had that like a manual tool

352
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,580
Which we can look at and maybe see like that might be a way to figure out how to do more

353
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
What it auto did wasn't sufficient

354
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,580
But now they have an auto tool that will go through all of your all the state groups for the various rooms and stuff

355
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,580
And compress the ones that thinks it needs to compress

356
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,580
So we can do future rounds of that as well

357
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Assuming it works

358
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
But once again our matrix server was down

359
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,580
And we just a couple of months ago scrambled and really upgraded this box

360
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
But what gets us is the database growth

361
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,580
And it's the state tables too which is not what you'd expect right

362
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,580
You'd think it'd be people's conversations or you think it'd be images

363
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,580
But it's the state's table that's growing and growing and growing

364
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,580
And you came across a cool little utility that actually helps us do some proper maintenance on this thing

365
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
And what was that written in there?

366
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,580
Oh it's written in Rust

367
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,580
This is great I wish this was built in to be honest with you

368
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Yeah that would be nice perhaps in a future version some someday

369
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,580
But yeah it kind of goes in and it looks at some of this the state group cache that they're using

370
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,580
To be able to quickly answer questions about the state of various rooms

371
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,580
And then you can just compress some of those entries so they don't need as many individual rows

372
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,580
And kind of shrink that giant table

373
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Because I think right now that's by far the biggest table in the database

374
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,580
And it's something like a hundred gigs

375
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,580
More than that

376
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Maybe now it's a hundred gigs

377
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
Yeah it was more before

378
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
It didn't start that way

379
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
So we had to get the box back up online

380
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,580
I mean you fill up your disk, services crash, things go offline

381
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,580
And then you kind of sit there with options

382
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Like do we want to migrate this to Linode's managed Postgres

383
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
So we're just not worried about a Postgres server anymore

384
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
We've been tempted I mean it's a recent offering

385
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
We've been hoping to see it and it's great that they offer that now

386
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Do we want to maybe change data centers

387
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Because maybe this isn't in the best location

388
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
Because we kind of spun it up on a lark

389
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,580
So maybe we should do you know like all these questions kind of came up

390
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,580
And we had to answer which technical debt are we going to solve

391
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
To get this system back up and online

392
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,580
And can we play around with the storage sizes to give us a little flexibility

393
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
So once we had that conversation

394
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Of course as things are going on

395
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
As you know Wes's dogs need to go out

396
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,580
And I'm doing dishes

397
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
We kind of sort all of this out

398
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
And so Wes gives us a recap, again

399
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Not some professional

400
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,580
I see, so are you thinking of moving it to a disk that has more room

401
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Or can we avoid doing that?

402
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
So I think first things first

403
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,580
We shut off the server

404
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Then we do a dump of the database to a file

405
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
And then from that

406
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,580
We can import it into our new shiny hosted database

407
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,580
But we want to get that process started because that's probably going to take some time

408
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,580
Because we have a painfully large database at the moment

409
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,580
And even just moving it to that hosted system would take forever at its current size

410
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Which was one of the issues right

411
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,580
This thing was like nearly 300 gigabytes when you included all the different tables and everything in there

412
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,580
So like moving it around

413
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Not necessarily an easy job

414
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Most of the rest of the database was a reasonable size though

415
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
Templates are built in

416
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Postgres is the internal one

417
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
And Synapse

418
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
So yeah Synapse is the only thing we care about

419
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
And as we see here with 223 gigs

420
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Right that's the one

421
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
That's the problem child

422
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,580
I think the 7000 KB is probably not too big of a deal

423
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
At one time it was

424
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
At one time it was indeed

425
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Actually it looks like kind of like a minimum

426
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Because they all seem to have that

427
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
There's really a lot to this

428
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
And most people wouldn't run into this

429
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,580
If you didn't have thousands of users that were coming in from all these different matrix servers across the federation

430
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Right if you just set up yourself a home server

431
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
With a small community

432
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
You'd be fine

433
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Yeah we've gotten ourselves in a somewhat particular situation

434
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Yeah and as we were debating like how do we want to do this

435
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Do we want to move rigs

436
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Do we want to change things up

437
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
We kind of realized this is all our own fault

438
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
So I suppose the thing to do would be to put it in the same data center

439
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,580
At the

440
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Yeah it looks like we've got everything in Fremont

441
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
At the moment

442
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
California

443
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
That doesn't seem like the best place

444
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
No that's probably a consequence of us

445
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
Spinning this up on Alarc a few years ago

446
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
And we're like well we should make it close to us

447
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Wes I feel like this very call

448
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Right now is the consequence

449
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Of us spinning it up on Alarc

450
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
A couple years ago

451
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Touche, touche

452
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
One crazy night and we're still paying the consequences

453
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
For it

454
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
And speaking of crazy nights

455
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I'm literally like

456
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
Trying to figure out where my kids are at

457
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
Because I know they're at a birthday party but they were supposed to be home already

458
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
This is crazy over here

459
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
As we're talking on another device

460
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
I'm getting a call from my daughter letting me know

461
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
That there's being cake served over at a friend's house

462
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
For a birthday party

463
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
And you're not there?

464
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Wow

465
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
Don't they know we have a matrix server issue

466
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Well they're just trying to make you feel better

467
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Well they weren't offering cake

468
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Oh I see, I got it all wrong

469
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
I don't know exactly what went wrong but I guess the mom went out

470
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
9 hours ago to pick up the cake

471
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
And just got back now at 10 o'clock at night

472
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
And so now they're serving cake

473
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
At 10 o'clock at night

474
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
My kids are supposed to be asleep

475
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
They're supposed to be over there having a sleepover and now they're getting

476
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
And of course my daughter thinks this is so great

477
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
She's gotta call me to let me know

478
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Dylan wants to get out of bed

479
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
And walk over there in the dark

480
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Aww, cake at 10 o'clock at night

481
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
I think it's cute that you think people

482
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Sleep at sleepovers

483
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Gosh darn serving cake at 10 o'clock at night

484
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
That's just crazy

485
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Save it for the morning

486
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Yeah breakfast cake right?

487
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
So we realize okay I gotta go take care of kids stuff

488
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
Wes has gotta walk his dogs

489
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Brent's gotta get back to watching Star Trek Discovery

490
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
That's the most important one

491
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
So really clearly the thing to do

492
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Is for Brent and I to piss off and leave Wes

493
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
With all of the work

494
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
And so we left the call

495
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Not knowing how things were going to go

496
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Alright well I don't know that we need to hang around

497
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
It seems it's gonna keep going on both fronts

498
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
For a little while

499
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
It is compressing this? I don't know how big it's gonna be compressed

500
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
But

501
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Well I guess we could

502
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
I guess

503
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
I guess we could leave it as a cliffhanger for Brent and I

504
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
And then you could tell us

505
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Oh true

506
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Yeah you have to set up and then

507
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Should I close my Matrix client then?

508
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Oh that's right

509
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
Yeah I guess you'll see

510
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
We'll know if it's online

511
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
But we won't necessarily know if it's on its own server

512
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Or if it's on

513
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
The hosted thing

514
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Or how late Wes stayed out

515
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I know a little bit because I increased the disk size

516
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
For the Linode

517
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Bless you

518
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
And then we upgraded it for our Matrix server

519
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Mostly because we're still figuring out how to optimize it

520
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
And then we're planning to shrink it back down

521
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
When we upgraded

522
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
An additional amount of storage

523
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Was allocated to us

524
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
That we could actually resize our disk to

525
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
That we never took advantage of

526
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
When we upgraded the RAM and the CPU cores

527
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
And we didn't realize that at first because

528
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
In the previous setup we were using all of the

529
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Fast disk we had available to us

530
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Yeah and so when that part clicked

531
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
It was like oh man

532
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I need to bring the database

533
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Get the database back online

534
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
And then that's where I

535
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
That's all I know

536
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
So what happened after we resized the disk?

537
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
And what did you do to get the server back online?

538
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
I mean not much really

539
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
At that point we just had to bring the database

540
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,580
We just kind of had to start things up again

541
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,580
We had thought about much more

542
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Dramatic migration plans

543
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
But once we realized that we just had more

544
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Fast disk right there

545
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Locally

546
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
That's just how it came to us so we just sort of

547
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Resized that file system on the now

548
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Much bigger partition and

549
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
Spun things back up. That was one thing you did have to do

550
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
After we did the resize in the Linux dashboard

551
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
You have to go in and resize the file system but

552
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
I was actually giving you an opportunity to mention

553
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
That you can run that tool

554
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
And we were actually able to get the database down

555
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
About 150 gigs in size

556
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
After running that. I think there's more we could

557
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Do. Oh definitely yeah yeah

558
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
And we're in a better position now. We've actually been planning

559
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Sort of a little matrix

560
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Sprint to shore up some of the matrix stuff that's been on our

561
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Bucket list. We just weren't planning it for

562
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
This week. You and I was

563
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
It the day before two days before we're just

564
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Like yeah we better get that matrix sprint scheduled

565
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
We really got to get some of that taken care of and

566
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Then like the next day this happened

567
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
In a part it's like every time something

568
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Like this happens we learn there's a new set

569
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Of tooling that we can take advantage of

570
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
And I think our matrix

571
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Instance is the size where it's not

572
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
It's not considered like a huge instance

573
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
So there are people just

574
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Ahead of us that are discovering these

575
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Problems and creating solutions

576
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Like this rust tool or like the synapse

577
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
Admin interface or you know

578
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Trying out workers at scale

579
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
And then our instance being a little

580
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Bit smaller we kind of we eventually

581
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
Get to these problems after they have

582
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
And so we're taking advantage of

583
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
All of the upstream work that's being done to solve

584
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
These problems before we hit them

585
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
And then when we hit them there's almost

586
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Always a tool available now like that's been

587
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
The upshot or there's almost always a solution

588
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Or legitimately like twice in a row

589
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
They've just added

590
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
That feature or just changed that

591
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Default in the synapse server like a release

592
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Or two before we needed it yeah

593
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Really that keeps happening the docs

594
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Have also gotten a lot better for like the administration

595
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Side of running a synapse server so

596
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
It's really nice to see I think that's one of

597
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
The benefits of all the pain that we do put

598
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
Ourselves through the benefits we get to watch

599
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
That growth and how the community is developed

600
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
And I think you know each time we kind of dive back

601
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
In like this time we you know we know

602
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Way more about sort of the internals of

603
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
The database schemas and how that's working

604
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
And so I think we have more confidence in that side of things

605
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Even if you know it took a late night

606
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Another thing about it is it's a bit of practicing

607
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
What we preach like I really have been on this

608
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
Whole decentralization I think

609
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Is key for free software long term

610
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Matrix is part of that

611
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
And there are upsides and downsides to decentralization

612
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
And choosing to self host

613
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
And it would be unfair

614
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
For us to come on here and only ever

615
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
Represent the good things and never

616
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Represent the bad things and

617
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
If anything I think maybe we could represent

618
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
Some of the better things probably

619
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
A little more often because one of the reasons

620
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
We're willing to go through this is there's a really great

621
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Community on there and there's a growing

622
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Network effect with other free software projects

623
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
And communities that are happening all the time

624
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
And it's getting better and you know the various

625
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Clients are getting better over time as well

626
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
And so in one sense it's quite impressive what

627
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
You know what they've built there and all the capabilities

628
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
Especially compared to other platforms like

629
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
It's getting much closer. I have

630
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
A final question for you both. We

631
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
We seem to kind of dive into the Matrix server

632
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Either by choice or not every

633
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
What was it? Every two months

634
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Or so? Yeah it was right before Raleigh

635
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
So it's been a bit. Do you have any predictions

636
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
On what will happen in the next two months

637
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
And what will bring us to doing another

638
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
Late night session? Well maybe

639
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Migrating out of Fremont perhaps. Maybe

640
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
I know something else we want to do is we want to

641
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Get the Synapse admin backend up and running

642
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
I don't think that will cause an outage other than

643
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
Us restarting services and stuff

644
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
I know that's next. Some more database optimizations

645
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Are next. We definitely have some more

646
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Performance gains to get. It's a lot better

647
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
But there's clearly more work to be done

648
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
I think that's sort of

649
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Going to be the target of the next sprint and now that we have

650
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Some disk space and we've reduced the size of the database

651
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
We can focus more on maybe

652
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Some of the performance side of things and less

653
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
On the keeping things running side of things

654
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Which would be nice. Also shout out

655
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
You know we've been getting various tips both on the Matrix

656
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Server itself but then also very from boosts

657
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
And feedback from audience members who

658
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Have way more experience and understanding

659
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
Of Matrix and Synapse than we do and that is always

660
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Super helpful. Yeah we get tips in and that is

661
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Super great. Thank you everybody.

00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
Or an individual. It's Bitwarden.com

667
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Slash Linux. This is

668
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
The easiest way to store and share and sync

669
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Sensitive data.

670
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Bitwarden is open source and trusted by millions

671
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Of individuals, teams and organizations.

672
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
It's a tool you've got

673
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
To have. And a good password manager

674
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
That's great but Bitwarden is more

675
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Than that. It's really a secrets manager.

676
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,580
It'll help generate user names.

677
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
It'll store one time authorization tokens

678
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,580
For two factor.

679
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
And of course if you're in the enterprise it's fully

680
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Customizable. You can turn features on

681
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
And off using enterprise policies

682
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
To adapt it to your business needs.

683
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
And if you're an individual user like me who

684
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,580
Likes to know there's a

685
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Self hosted option as well.

686
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Well Bitwarden contributes upstream

687
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
To the Vaultwarden project to help make

688
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,580
Sure they stick around and help that community

689
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Thrive. And they've got incredible

690
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Support in their apps for just all kinds of great

691
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
Power user features and

692
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
User friendly features for people

693
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
That are just learning how to use software like this.

694
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
Some of my favorites are

695
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,580
Like the fast user account switching.

696
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
It's so easy now to switch between maybe

697
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
Like a personal account or

698
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Your business account or maybe you have an account for

699
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
An open source project you're working with.

700
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
When you're auto filling now

701
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
It'll just let you switch between

702
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
User accounts. And on iOS

703
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
The face ID integration

704
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Is killer. It's like

705
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
You're living in the future. It just scans

706
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Your face opens up the password database gets the

707
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
Right password auto fills it.

708
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
The reason why I think that's super critical

709
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Is it means maybe I signed up on a website

710
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Or maybe I signed up using the app. But I can take

711
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
That sensitive data across

712
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
My desktop and my mobile

713
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
And I can use complex

714
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Rich passwords on mobile and

715
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Stay safe using Bitwarden.

716
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
And with the username generator too now I'm using a unique

717
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
Username at every site and service

718
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
I sign up for. I should have always been doing that.

719
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
Bitwarden's always thinking of that

720
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Kind of stuff. That's their job.

721
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
So go try it out.

722
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
It's easy to get started. Visit Bitwarden.com

723
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Slash Linux. Try it for yourself or

724
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Your business. Maybe you know someone

725
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
A friend, a family, a colleague

726
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
That could use a little bit of help in this

727
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
Department. Send them over there.

728
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Nudge them in the right direction.

729
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Bitwarden.com slash

730
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
Linux.

731
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
We got some amazing

732
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
Feedback again this week. Thank you everyone. We did get

733
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
A few songs in

734
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
For our pump up song.

735
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
What would you call that?

736
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
We're trying to find a great pump up song.

737
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Our pre pre show starter song.

738
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
It's true.

739
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
You can hear those if you're a

740
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Member and you get the extra long feed

741
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Or on PeerTube. You can check it out there. It's a lot of fun.

742
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Pre show mantra maybe?

743
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Hey! I like that.

744
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
And so thank you Justin and Andrew

745
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
And Jeff sent one in as well.

746
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Keep them coming. I think we'll

747
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
We'll find one in time. Right guys?

748
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I think. Yeah I think

749
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
So. That implies there's a dead

750
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Loan. Which I'm not sure we have.

751
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
I don't want to put like a time on this. I feel like a song

752
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Commitment is a big commitment. It's a long term

753
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Relationship and I don't want you to rush things.

754
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
It might be the most important relationship any of us have.

755
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
It might be. Well Levi.

756
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Yeah.

757
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
But we also got other feedback which

758
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Has been really great. And I think Wes

759
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
This one's right up your alley.

760
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
Well maybe both of us since we've been talking about it.

761
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
Casey wrote in and says

762
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
I heard on office hours

763
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
That Wes was giving Brent some

764
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
Python tips. A specific

765
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Example Brent gave was a Python REPL.

766
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
I know Wes does some Clojure

767
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
Which has one of the best REPL

768
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Experiences. So if he's recommending

769
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
A REPL for Python that's something I want to

770
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Know about. As much as

771
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I wish I could write Clojure all day

772
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Python still pays more of the bills.

773
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Care to spill the beans on this

774
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
REPL recommendation?

775
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Yeah. Okay. I think a REPL

776
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Is just super handy because it

777
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Recreates this feeling of being really

778
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
Connected immediately with the computer. It's much

779
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Like using a command prompt. Right? Like

780
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
Bash. It's like having a conversation with the machine

781
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Where you sort of you can you can touch the data

782
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
Structures. You can feel them right there. You don't have to construct

783
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
An artificial test environment or something.

784
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Not that that's bad but it's just I think when you're

785
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Especially when you're exploring a new API or you're trying

786
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
To learn and you know you don't have a lot of previous

787
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Understanding on how a new mechanism works

788
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
Or something. It's just it's a great way to learn.

789
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Totally true Casey that

790
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Clojure has an amazing REPL experience. Python

791
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Can't quite compete for a lot of reasons.

792
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
One of them being sort of the culture

793
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,580
Isn't there as much. Especially now with

794
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Type hinting and stuff. There's been more focus

795
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
On the static analysis side of things

796
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
Which don't get me wrong it's also great and wonderful and

797
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,580
There's a lot of good tools around that now.

798
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
But there's less interest in

799
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
Building APIs that are REPL friendly necessarily.

800
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
That said B Python is

801
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
A nice one. It doesn't have as many

802
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Fancy features but it's got great tab complete

803
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
And a nice little pop up menu.

804
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
So it's friendly to interact with and then

805
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
IPython or

806
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Jupyter notebooks as well. It can be one thing but if you just

807
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Want it in like a terminal IPython works great.

808
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
They've also got a auto reload

809
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Extension which is one way to get a decent REPL

810
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Experience anytime you input

811
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
A new expression or statement on the command line

812
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
It'll load reload all the

813
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Stuff that you've imported. I also

814
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Have rigged up with an

815
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Async file watching library

816
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
To kind of do the same thing and just do like a hot

817
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Reload anytime I rewrite

818
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
Any of the files on my disk.

819
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
It's not perfect but it works pretty well and then if you

820
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Kind of design things stay

821
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Away from classes and objects if you can and just have

822
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Sort of functions and pass

823
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
In all of your state explicitly so

824
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
That you don't have to like rebuild your classes you

825
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Just have some dictionaries and other things like that data

826
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Classes etc. That makes things

827
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
A little bit better in the REPL environment.

828
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
This is super super fascinating.

829
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Wes I got to say thank you for

830
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Having long late night

831
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
Conversations with me about all of this stuff.

832
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
If someone was just learning

833
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Python would you recommend just diving

834
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Into this right away or is this more of an experts tool?

835
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
I mean it could certainly be both

836
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
But yeah I think

837
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Having a REPL available you can just use the built

838
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
In Python one but if you use something like

839
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
IPython you get just a lot more of a friendly environment

840
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
With things like auto complete and tab complete and

841
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Read line support and

842
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
Yeah it can be a way to just sort of type in stuff you see

843
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
From tutorials without having to set up a complicated

844
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
Environment to get it all to run.

845
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
I mean you will need to figure that out too and you'll want to figure out how to get

846
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
A test runner going and all those things but

847
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
Just be able to type IPython

848
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
On the command line and start playing is super nice

849
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
And also shout out here

850
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Gigatexel in the IRC room mentions

851
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
PT Python which is another great choice.

852
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
And of course I'm sure the next thing Gigatexel

853
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Was going to mention that coder.show

854
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
For Coderadio where we talk about Python quite a bit.

855
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Casey mentions too yeah

856
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Jupiter notebooks are a fantastic way because

857
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,580
They're quite visual and interactive

858
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
And there's plenty of places to go use

859
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Those for free online so

860
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Yeah check out Jupiter notebooks if you haven't.

861
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
And of course we're not going to get out of the feedback section

862
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
Without a little discussion about Merkle trees.

863
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
Of course seems like a popular

864
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Topic around here these days.

865
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Joe wrote in was great

866
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
To hear you talk about Merkle trees on the last

867
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
Linux Unplugged. They're my favorite most

868
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,580
Underrated data structure.

869
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
They're incredibly simple to implement since

870
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
It's basically just a big key value store

871
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
And they're great for syncing because

872
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
You can just rsync the key value stores around

873
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
And then atomically update a few

874
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
References or branches.

875
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
I once also wrote a minimal

876
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Implementation of git in about

877
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
300 lines of code which he links

878
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
To. That sounds fascinating.

879
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Awesome.

880
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
And now

881
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
It is time for the boost.

882
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Well our first boost of the day

883
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
Is from Purple Hummingbird

884
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
5 days ago with

885
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
2222 sets.

886
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
I'm a duck. D-U-K Duck.

887
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Loaded with talent.

888
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
Hey guys I just got my steam deck.

889
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Sending you a row of ducks for your coverage

890
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
So far. Is there a gadget or new tech

891
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
Each of you are looking forward to?

892
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
Thanks for the show. Hmm I bet this is a hard

893
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,580
Question for you to answer. You're not really

894
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,580
You don't covet much in terms of tech.

895
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,580
You're very practical when it comes to this stuff.

896
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
I'm really curious to see what like the next generation

897
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
Framework stuff. Oh yeah

898
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,580
The framework laptop. Yes.

899
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,580
It's a little nebulous but that's on my

900
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,580
Radar. I think that would be a really good work machine

901
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
For you. Right.

902
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
What about you Brent? You got a gadget or a device?

903
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
Maybe the dev one?

904
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
The new dev one waiting for you?

905
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Oh yeah I almost forgot about that.

906
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,580
Apparently it's being

907
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,580
Held hot sausage somewhere. I gotta figure that out.

908
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
I'm gonna get to that soon I'm sure. But yeah

909
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,580
I'm sure. You'll enjoy that.

910
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
I think almost immediately on my list is actually

911
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
Some hardware that Jeff sent me.

912
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
Thank you very much again. He sent me some

913
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Equipment to boost my local

914
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,580
Wireless network here. From one building

915
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
To another. And I

916
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,580
It's been a great cat pillow so far.

917
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
I hesitate to remove it from that

918
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Use but I'm

919
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Looking forward to setting it up real soon and

920
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Jumping into iperf and giving it

921
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
A bunch of testing and seeing how

922
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
Optimized I can get it. Yeah I am

923
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Looking forward to hearing how that goes too.

924
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
Purple I

925
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
I just got my confirmation

926
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,580
And I said yes to the

927
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
Steam Deck. So like I've done the

928
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,580
Payment thing now. I got

929
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,580
My your things coming soon email.

930
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
So I think I'm gonna answer Steam Deck

931
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Because I had a realization last

932
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,580
Week even I was kind of on

933
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,580
The fence about oh

934
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
Do I really want one anymore?

935
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
You know maybe I'd rather have a dev one

936
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,580
But I realized in my

937
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Situation in the RV

938
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
Having a portable gaming

939
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,580
Device is freaking perfect

940
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
Because I sometimes need to be up front or sometimes I need

941
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
To be in the back or sometimes I want to be outside

942
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,580
A console hasn't

943
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Served me super well because of that

944
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
And I just realized that that's exactly

945
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,580
What I've been needing and I've been wanting to game at

946
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Home in the evenings but

947
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
It just hasn't worked out because maybe like that's the evening

948
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
I have my ThinkPad and that just has an Intel graphics

949
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
Card in it or whatever and you know so I've never

950
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
Gotten around to it I think I will now

951
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
I'm actually pretty excited about the Steam Deck coming in

952
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,580
And of course I'll share my thoughts and

953
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
What nots on it when I

954
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
Have a chance to look at it and play around

955
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
With it for a bit. Gene Bean wrote in

956
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Three days ago with a thousand sats thank you

957
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,580
Very much. Boost

958
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
They wrote don't forget the newer

959
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Raspberry Pi imaging tool will also

960
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
Let you set all of your Wi-Fi info

961
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
And user info on the GUI

962
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
So Wes I think that's

963
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
A little shout out to your adventures

964
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
There last week. Yeah hey that does

965
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,580
Sound handy. Yeah that is actually

966
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,580
Something that I forget because I don't use it

967
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,580
Very often but when you're trying to get people introduced

968
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,580
To the Raspberry Pi the Raspberry Pi

969
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Imaging tool is very legitimate

970
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
Try it probably will do

971
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,580
What they need. Don't do it the hard way like I do

972
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
For some reason. Quantum

973
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Boosted in with 500 sats

974
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
And I wanted to

975
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
Read this because well

976
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,580
First of all I think it's important this gets

977
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,580
Talked about. Second of all

978
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,580
I think there's a little bit of shenanigans going on here

979
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,580
They write when trying to order the dev

980
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,580
One machine for my dev team

981
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Last week we were told by HP that

982
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,580
The dev one is not for quote professional developers

983
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,580
And available only in their consumer

984
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
Division. We were also told by

985
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,580
HP they have no plan to offer a similar experience

986
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,580
For professionals in their

987
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
Commercial line. Why do you

988
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,580
Think they would make a developer laptop and then not

989
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,580
Offer to developers where they work. First

990
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,580
Of all that does sound really silly and

991
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,580
Anybody who's ever worked in a medium to large

992
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Company can probably already do the math

993
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,580
In their head and go oh yeah

994
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
Yeah you got the enterprise sales team and this

995
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,580
Has been marked as a consumer laptop

996
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,580
So those two shall not pass right like

997
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
You already know where this is going

998
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,580
What's weird and it's silly right

999
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,580
Maybe HP should take care of that

1000
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
So that's why I wanted to read the boost but what's

1001
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Interesting about Quantum's boost here

1002
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,580
Is this exact

1003
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,580
Message for Betam was sent to Coda Radio

1004
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,580
Maybe three weeks ago only I note

1005
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,580
That they don't say three weeks ago in this boost they

1006
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,580
Say last week this email was

1007
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
Also sent into Destination Linux

1008
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,580
And now it has been boosted into us

1009
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,580
All verbatim somebody

1010
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,580
Has a bit of a mission

1011
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
Out there to try to

1012
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,580
Take things down a

1013
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Notch not

1014
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,580
Necessarily an invalid point

1015
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,580
But just saying that I've noticed this

1016
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
Go around and I want the listeners to be

1017
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Aware somebody is trying

1018
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,580
To manipulate an emotional reaction from

1019
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
People on this subject should

1020
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
They fix it yeah HP should probably fix

1021
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
That is it surprising that there's

1022
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,580
Divisions between enterprise sales business

1023
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,580
Sales and consumer sales no

1024
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,580
Not at all

1025
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,580
Welcome to corporate America

1026
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
I think what is surprising to me

1027
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
In a way is that system 76

1028
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
They really pride themselves

1029
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
On on on building all of their stuff

1030
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,580
For professional developers

1031
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,580
And so it's kind of

1032
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,580
Odd to me that this happened I hope it's not

1033
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,580
Happening more often but

1034
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,580
Maybe they got a fix for it it

1035
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,580
Seems like a great laptop I haven't touched it yet

1036
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,580
You guys would definitely know

1037
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,580
But would you would you say it's

1038
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,580
Ready for the kind of quote unquote

1039
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,580
Professional developers Chris

1040
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,580
I mean I could see maybe

1041
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
HP only views enterprise sales

1042
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,580
As maybe laptops that have

1043
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,580
Like the HP pro management stuff in it

1044
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,580
I mean there's probably some sort of division

1045
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,580
Where they check yes this is an

1046
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
Enterprise box or not but yeah right it's

1047
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,580
Got to be more like that or the how the support contracts

1048
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,580
Work out or how they you know they get you parts

1049
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,580
Or whatever it's not it's not about the actual experience

1050
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,580
Of the laptop in the hands of the developer and

1051
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,580
Also I will point out

1052
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,580
It's it's also

1053
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
It's a commentary on the company

1054
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,580
That this person supposedly works for that they

1055
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
Are so inconceivably inflexible

1056
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,580
That they can't come up with another way to order these

1057
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,580
Laptops like that stuff's also

1058
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Very typical for companies but so

1059
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,580
Annoying because you know like the finance guy

1060
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
Could put it on the credit card or maybe they you

1061
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
Know like there's a way they can

1062
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Fix this and they could order these laptops

1063
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
As you know anyone

1064
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
Else can but their company

1065
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Is also super inflexible apparently

1066
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
Was this just a I called my rep

1067
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
He looked in his catalog it wasn't there sorry

1068
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
Sorry if we can't do the PO process we can't

1069
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,580
Order the machine right and meanwhile they're angry HP

1070
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,580
Is like sorry this isn't a consumer machine we can't

1071
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,580
Sell it to business it's like both companies

1072
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
Are being typical companies

1073
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
And it's really silly

1074
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,580
I just want to give you money for your laptop

1075
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,580
Right and it's like this is one of the things I really appreciate

1076
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
About being a small business is this just you go to the website

1077
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,580
And you order the laptop it's not really a big

1078
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Deal

1079
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,580
Another boost from DL

1080
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,580
0 7 0 2 days ago

1081
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
10,000 sets

1082
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Boost just wanted to

1083
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,580
Say hi from Australia and

1084
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,580
Thanks for all your hard work you chose to give me

1085
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Many ideas to try and further my Linux

1086
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,580
Knowledge hey that's great

1087
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
Thanks for the boost and that's exactly what we're going

1088
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,580
And I love the check in from Australia and

1089
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,580
It really is great because also

1090
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Lightning is a global network

1091
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,580
Sats are

1092
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
Sats here in Washington and there in Australia

1093
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
A sat is a sat yeah once you like

1094
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,580
Get the onboarding stuff it doesn't matter where you are

1095
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
Right the internet has needed its own native

1096
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,580
Money and it's just really cool so thank you

1097
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,580
An Australian boost it's great

1098
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Exception boosted

1099
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
In as well two days ago with one two three

1100
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Seven sets that must

1101
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,580
Mean that must mean something

1102
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,580
You got me with all this next

1103
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,580
Stuff looking for a spare laptop

1104
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,580
To play around kind of remind

1105
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,580
You of the arch challenge from forever ago oh

1106
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,580
Yeah it does

1107
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,580
Little bit or gosh that weird gentoo experiment

1108
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,580
Where we had that long tail of like

1109
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,580
Well all right I'll give it a go okay I'll give it

1110
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,580
A go talking about it for so long now I

1111
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,580
Guess I have to and to be fair we are

1112
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
Trying to like dial it down because we know

1113
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,580
Not everybody cares about Nix but we

1114
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
Are really it's probably the most excited I've

1115
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,580
Been about Linux in a few years

1116
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
Right it's really very impressive stuff

1117
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
And what's also so fun about it

1118
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,580
Is it's a major rethinking

1119
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,580
Of the way a distro works so it's

1120
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,580
Like a it's like you got to be willing to go for a big

1121
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,580
Shift right yeah that's just it it's like a whole

1122
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,580
New paradigm in some ways but if you're willing to

1123
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
And you've got nothing really on the line so why not try like

1124
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,580
It has been my last thing then I'll stop

1125
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Because I could just go on and on I have

1126
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,580
Been surprised how great it has been

1127
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,580
On my ThinkPad I thought when we started

1128
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,580
This thing okay this is great

1129
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,580
For servers but I'm never going to want to have

1130
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,580
A prescribed laptop like this

1131
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,580
No man like it's now

1132
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,580
Made me rethink like how I want to do the studio systems

1133
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Because I want them rock solid right

1134
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
So one of the great things I love about using

1135
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,580
Nix as a workstation or perhaps

1136
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,580
Studio equipment is the

1137
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,580
Updates all have to like pass

1138
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,580
And everything has to be good before it gets applied

1139
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
So you do a build

1140
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,580
And it checks everything and then you make sure

1141
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
There's no like weird conflicts

1142
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,580
Or any crazy config changes

1143
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
And if something like you know your bootloader breaks

1144
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,580
Or something like that it airs out

1145
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
And you don't switch to a broken

1146
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,580
System you only switch to

1147
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,580
That new updated system after

1148
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
It's passed all the tests

1149
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,580
And then you reboot into this new clean

1150
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,580
Environment and it's just it's

1151
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,580
So solid it's so solid for a

1152
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
Workstation or for a production system

1153
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
I loves it so much yeah because

1154
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
We got another boost in here

1155
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
This is something of a special boost though

1156
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
It's from su cd two days

1157
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,580
Ago twenty nine thousand

1158
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,580
Two hundred and eighty seven

1159
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,580
That's our baller boost

1160
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,580
That's a baller in our parts

1161
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
Yeah especially because this was a manual

1162
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,580
Boost sent via the blockchain and then a

1163
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,580
Message to you via matrix yeah

1164
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,580
Hello from Portland I've been

1165
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Listening to Jupiter broadcasting for about

1166
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Ten years well you were asking for a Portland

1167
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
Check-in and we've got one yeah

1168
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,580
All right well there's one

1169
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,580
Now we need to know if there are more

1170
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,580
The Portland signal is up y'all

1171
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,580
But as you check out the West

1172
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
Coast crew we do have a West Coast

1173
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,580
Crew matrix room now jump in there

1174
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,580
And maybe give us some hot tips

1175
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
On where we should take things we have a couple of

1176
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
Thank you boost to get into or at least one

1177
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,580
Five hundred stats from 412

1178
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,580
Linux wishing Brent safe travels Brent's going

1179
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,580
To be traveling to Alex's house

1180
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
In the near future and then eventually

1181
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,580
At some point he'll be making

1182
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
The trek to the studio either by

1183
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Car train or something we don't

1184
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Know yet but we have Brent's

1185
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,580
Node now online he has

1186
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,580
Participating in the split

1187
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
For the next we were doing it for the

1188
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
Month of July so far I guess three more

1189
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,580
Episodes we're gonna do a 50-50

1190
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,580
Split of the boosts with

1191
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,580
Brent so that way we can build up

1192
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,580
A little bit of a fuel travel fund

1193
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,580
So when he's done at Alex's he's gonna come

1194
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,580
Here he's gonna he's gonna do it he's gonna

1195
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
Do it he's threatening me no we'll just guilt

1196
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,580
You into it'll be real easy you know can we use some of that

1197
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,580
Fun to like get a tracker we can put on them to verify

1198
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,580
He's oh that's a great idea it's

1199
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
Built into the dev one I think

1200
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,580
But really you know what it was it was fun setting

1201
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,580
All that up that node in the community opening up

1202
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580
Channels it's just yeah you were impressed

1203
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,580
Too by how much liquidity

1204
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,580
Came in on the node

1205
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,580
In a very very short amount of time

1206
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,580
I can you speak a little bit more to that well

1207
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,580
About 400,000 stats of it came from

1208
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,580
Me so a lot of that liquidity was me

1209
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,580
Sending you some stats but then

1210
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,580
Yeah we definitely had some community community members

1211
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,580
Step up and open up channels and so the way it works

1212
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,580
And lightning is you have people who

1213
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,580
Put some stats on each end of the channel and then you can

1214
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,580
Move Bitcoin or sats in between

1215
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,580
They're really super quick and that's why it's so

1216
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,580
Dang quick and then it only really has to settle

1217
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,580
On the blockchain when you close those channels and

1218
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,580
So you get super fast lightning payments

1219
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,580
And so people open up the channels and it's a peer to peer

1220
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
Network and

1221
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,580
You think about it you just kind of peer with

1222
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,580
With who you're gonna be getting boosts from

1223
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,580
But necessarily or lightning messages from so like

1224
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,580
I appeared that node

1225
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,580
With the fountain app and with the podcast

1226
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
Index and with Jupiter Broadcasting's node

1227
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,580
And then if you are a peer with

1228
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,580
One of those nodes the clients can find routes

1229
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,580
To you it's so much fun

1230
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,580
To work with and watch it kind of the network

1231
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,580
Discover itself and build out

1232
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
So it's online and we'll be

1233
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,580
Doing the boost splits for a bit to help with the travel fund

1234
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
For Brentley so we can come to the studio and we can engage

1235
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,580
In projects and now prepare

1236
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,580
For our September road trip too because I think it'll be getting close

1237
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
To that oh yeah you know Chris

1238
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,580
I have also been keeping helipad

1239
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,580
Up so I can watch the boos come in as they

1240
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,580
People send them in that is so fun

1241
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,580
You've been talking about

1242
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,580
How that like

1243
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,580
Basically drives your

1244
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,580
Your mood all day and

1245
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,580
Just pumps it up whenever you need it and

1246
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,580
I gotta totally agree it's really great

1247
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
It's yeah it's my it's exactly

1248
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,580
It's my top off when I'm feeling kind of like

1249
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,580
Frustrated I'll be like I'll open up I'll open up

1250
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
Helipad and it is so great for that

1251
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
You gotta get on that let's put you in there too

1252
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,580
If you'd like to send in a boost

1253
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
Go go just go get a new podcast app

1254
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
Go do it why not try it out for a little bit

1255
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,580
I've been using fountain pod

1256
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
Versus great as well cast-o-matic if you're on

1257
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,580
IOS and if you don't want to switch podcast

1258
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Apps breeze b-r-e-e-z

1259
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,580
Dot technology or boost

1260
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
CLI you can boost from the command line

1261
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
They're all listed new podcast apps dot com

1262
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,580
Hey you know looks like the most recent antenna

1263
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,580
Pod update added podcasting

1264
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,580
2.0 chapter support so yeah that's

1265
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,580
Come on along nicely as well that's

1266
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,580
That's a number now that's a several

1267
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,580
Several pack I don't know how many but I think

1268
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,580
It's a handful of the podcasting 2.0 features

1269
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,580
That have been added to antenna pod now it's

1270
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,580
Really great to see that because we've got about a 30

1271
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
Percent audience share with antenna

1272
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,580
Pod probably one of the more popular ones

1273
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580
And it's a it's a great client and

1274
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,580
You can combo that with breeze

1275
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,580
So you can keep using antenna pod

1276
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,580
And then you can use breeze to send the boost in

1277
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,580
And then there are some patches out there

1278
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,580
Already to kind of integrate those two apps

1279
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
It's not done yet

1280
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,580
I also want to say we did

1281
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,580
Get a postcard in the mailbag this

1282
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,580
Week mentioning that

1283
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,580
Hey we shouldn't forget about those

1284
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Who are members we talk

1285
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,580
About boost a heck of a lot and

1286
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,580
Sometimes we forget to thank the members so

1287
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,580
I just want to say to all the members

1288
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,580
Thank you for continuing to support us

1289
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,580
I know you guys are getting tons of benefits over

1290
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,580
There too so I just want to say

1291
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,580
Thank you thank you for

1292
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,580
Being a friend

1293
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,580
Yeah unplugged core dot com

1294
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,580
You get an ad free version you get the live stream

1295
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Hey what do you say we do a little pick skis

1296
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,580
This is fun what did you find Wes

1297
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Well you know as we were having some disk

1298
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
Space problems you need some

1299
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,580
Disk space tools sometimes

1300
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
And see do is an old favor of mine that

1301
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,580
I use all the time but I thought

1302
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
We love rust picks what else was

1303
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,580
Out there right surely someone's made some of this stuff

1304
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,580
In rust and oh yeah

1305
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:39,580
Dua dash CLI

1306
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,580
Disk usage analyzer

1307
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,580
As a tool to conveniently

1308
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,580
Learn about the usage of disk space of a given

1309
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,580
Directory and yes it's parallel by default

1310
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,580
And will max out your SSD

1311
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,580
Awesome it's also got that nice little

1312
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
Support to optionally just delete right from

1313
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,580
That interface which I like about and see do as well

1314
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,580
Oh that is super

1315
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,580
Handy but you know what there's

1316
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,580
A few more links in there and we have a very

1317
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,580
Special bonus pick that Brent threw in

1318
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,580
Yeah this is maybe a really

1319
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,580
Nerdy pick but from

1320
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,580
The brunch that I did with

1321
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,580
Tim he

1322
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,580
A long time ago

1323
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,580
Wrote a framework

1324
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,580
That has been open source for a long time

1325
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,580
Now and it's a flight

1326
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,580
Software and embedded systems

1327
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,580
Framework called F prime

1328
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,580
And it's directly straight from

1329
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,580
NASA and is

1330
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,580
Available to anybody it even runs on

1331
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,580
The Raspberry Pi they have it

1332
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,580
They have it tested on the Raspberry Pi

1333
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,580
Their nightly build is

1334
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Is piped into a Raspberry Pi so they can

1335
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,580
Test it every night it's really it's super

1336
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,580
Fascinating so it's so great

1337
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,580
Okay what what if we built

1338
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,580
A really janky

1339
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,580
Drone I mean right like

1340
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,580
Like a Linux unblocked it won't work very well

1341
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,580
Probably crash immediately but

1342
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,580
I mean I'm down can we just

1343
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,580
Absorb for like a hot

1344
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,580
Second here this thing is a

1345
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,580
Linux copter right

1346
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
And then on top of that the framework

1347
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
It's using to be semi-autonomous is

1348
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,580
Also open source

1349
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,580
And we're about

1350
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,580
To go down and meet the folks that put

1351
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,580
All this together and we're going to

1352
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,580
Get a tour that's all about

1353
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,580
To happen right now how great

1354
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,580
Is that my head is going to explode it's so neat

1355
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,580
Sony it's worth even if you're never going to

1356
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,580
Use it go check it out we'll have a link in the show notes right

1357
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,580
Because it's pretty cool

1358
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Yeah I know Tim's a fan of the show

1359
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,580
He's probably listening so thank you Tim for all that wonderful

1360
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,580
Insight and it's actually his brother

1361
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,580
That got him hooked

1362
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,580
On to listening to Linux unplugged so

1363
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,580
Thank you to Tim's brother too

1364
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,580
We owe his brother a serious couple of beers

1365
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,580
Right it's a reminder too of just

1366
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,580
The power of word of mouth it's very true that's

1367
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,580
What I really that's that is what makes

1368
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,580
Podcasts grow it's not you know

1369
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,580
It's not really like

1370
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,580
Practical for somebody to invest an hour

1371
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,580
Of their life into something that

1372
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,580
Nobody's recommended to them it just doesn't happen

1373
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,580
Very often so it's a great example and then the

1374
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,580
Connections that that creates right

1375
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,580
The second order effects of your recommendations

1376
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,580
You never know where it's going to go

1377
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,580
It helps that we just have a really badass audience

1378
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
That's exactly it that's exactly it

1379
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,580
So let's wrap it up

1380
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,580
But I am so excited

1381
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,580
About this West Coast meetup I

1382
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
Have missed you guys I love doing these meetups

1383
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,580
It really recharges us it's a great opportunity

1384
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,580
To connect with the audience to get a sense of what people

1385
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,580
Out there are thinking about that isn't from the social

1386
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,580
Media bubble

1387
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,580
It's just so intensely valuable for

1388
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,580
Us in terms of just like

1389
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,580
Getting signal from the audience and it really

1390
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,580
Is yeah getting an idea of what's on people's minds

1391
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,580
And getting a really good picture

1392
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,580
I'm just getting a different slice and

1393
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,580
Yeah verse info from y'all

1394
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,580
So right now we have

1395
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,580
The matrix room link for that's in the show notes

1396
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,580
Bit.ly slash

1397
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,580
West Coast crew and

1398
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,580
We will then begin

1399
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
To build out the meetup page as we start

1400
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,580
To get signal from the audience and we start to get

1401
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,580
An idea of where we're going to go and we'll start talking

1402
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
About that in office hours as well so

1403
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,580
It's a lot there but it's

1404
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,580
Going to be so much fun and of course we're

1405
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,580
Extremely grateful to Linode to helping make

1406
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,580
All of this road trip stuff possible

1407
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
It's not like this is a cheap time

1408
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,580
To do a road trip on the West Coast

1409
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,580
In fact you could not figure

1410
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,580
Out of more expensive time to do a road

1411
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Trip on the West Coast like we should be like

1412
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,580
Taking a road trip to like Central America

1413
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,580
To the plane because it's a lot

1414
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
Cheaper to drive but

1415
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,580
You know we just did an East Coast meetup

1416
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,580
We just did a Denver meetup

1417
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,580
We have a London meetup coming up in just a few

1418
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,580
Weeks it just seems like it's time

1419
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,580
To revisit the West Coast

1420
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,580
And what an opportunity to go to JPL

1421
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,580
So we're going to do it

1422
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,580

Week's episode of the unplugged program

1448
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:41,580
See you right back here next Sunday

1449
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:19,580
You know Chris you made me so happy just there because it's taken six months and I've been pretty quiet about this but you're starting to say next Sunday the way you used to say next Tuesday and I have been waiting for that for so long you know

1450
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,580
I understand it had to like settle in

1451
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,580
For a bit but I'm

1452
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,580
Encouraging it yeah it had to be its

1453
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,580
Own thing you mourn the loss

1454
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,580
And yeah right too early I

1455
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,580
Loved saying see you next Tuesday that

1456
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,580
Was the highlight of the end of the show

1457
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,580
For me right there right and you

1458
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,580
Know we switched to some days and it just didn't feel

1459
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,580
The same I felt like I had to give it time before I moved

1460
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,580
On and started you know

1461
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Building relationships with new

1462
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,580
Ways of ending the show but I felt like that

1463
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,580
Was one of our better endings you know

1464
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,580
Mostly also you notice

1465
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,580
I switched to just I'm just gonna start mentioning the

1466
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,580
Jupiter tube in fact I think maybe

1467
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,580
At some point we should just redirect jblive.tv

1468
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,580
To Jupiter tube

1469
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,580
I know that's crazy but we got big

1470
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,580
Things in the works we talked

1471
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,580
To Alex Gates the podcasting to do

1472
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,580
Consulting consultant on office

1473
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,580
Hours this last week and

1474
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,580
Chatted with how he's modifying

1475
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,580
PeerTube to make it work with podcasting

1476
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,580
To those standards but also to make it work

1477
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,580
With more live streaming options build a few

1478
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Things that are just really small things that are missing

1479
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,580
Like in the RSS XML file

1480
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,580
And whatnot to make it like totally

1481
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,580
Usable for podcasters and it's

1482
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,580
All just it's all coming

1483
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,580
Together it's so freaking exciting

1484
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,580
There's like work being done by

1485
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,580
Dozens of different community members

1486
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,580
Adding these different features

1487
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,580
At different areas of the podcasting stack

1488
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,580
And it's really impressive to see it all kind of

1489
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,580
Come together and so that was

1490
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,580
That's why I reached out to Alex is like will you come on

1491
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,580
So we can just geek out about this because I'm back

1492
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Into PeerTube again and I know you're making these changes

1493
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,580
And I wanted to find out is he planning

1494
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,580
To upstream them and all that stuff yeah

1495
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,580
It's a good interview there was a well thank you

1496
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,580
Thank you I thought

1497
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,580
Brent really made it though it was it was a good Brent

1498
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,580
Episode oh well on average

1499
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,580
Yeah well thanks I mean

1500
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,580
It takes two doesn't it well

1501
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,580
At least a tango it's been neat seeing

1502
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,580
PeerTube you know developing

1503
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,580
To like looks like there was a release just 12 days

1504
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,580
Ago oh oh

1505
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,580
Well it's time to upgrade that yeah

1506
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,580
We should also there's some important upgrade notes

1507
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,580
I note here so let's uh well it's not even

1508
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,580
Let's just skip that Wes what

1509
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,580
Could go wrong is one of the

1510
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,580
Upgrades like maybe the view counts I know

1511
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,580
I know Chris you've had some

1512
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,580
Yeah I can't don't get his hopes

1513
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
I try not to grouse about that but it is

1514
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,580
Slightly annoying that the view counts aren't accurate

1515
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,580
Because it's like under representing

1516
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,580
The views and the other thing that's kind of

1517
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,580
Annoying is like when you drop when you stop

1518
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,580
Live streaming it loses

1519
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,580
Those numbers too and then you start all over

1520
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,580
And like but I but I

1521
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,580
Okay but you know then you're not

1522
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,580
Supposed to care right because there's no algorithm

1523
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,580
Right it doesn't really matter

1524
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,580
We don't even have comments it's true

1525
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,580
So we don't put those numbers anywhere

1526
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,580
The whole thing is supposed to be a practice in me

1527
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,580
Not caring right so I try not to

1528
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,580
But as like as a

1529
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,580
But as a content creator who

1530
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Wants a signal on what's working and not

1531
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,580
Working it would also be nice if

1532
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,580
It was accurate that's all yeah that's fair

1533
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,580
Can I ask you gentlemen since

1534
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,580
It's kind of on point for this episode how

1535
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,580
Is the PeerTube server doing do we know

1536
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,580
Is it performing fine is it

1537
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,580
Oh yeah yeah because

1538
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,580
We're doing the so right now we're doing the minimum

1539
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,580
Viable PeerTube where we're just using it for

1540
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,580
Our live stream archive and we're not like

1541
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Creating channels for every show and

1542
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,580
Uploading the edited versions and we're not

1543
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,580
Having community members contribute videos

1544
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,580
It is a really solid little rock

1545
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
Solid instance the only thing we got to do is make sure

1546
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
That we got the storage back end all tied up

1547
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,580
But that's pretty quick change

1548
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,580
Yeah we should do that yeah well I'm sure once it runs

1549
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,580
Out of disk space we will obviously

1550
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,580
It'll be an unplanned sprint

1551
01:06:41,580 --> 01:07:09,580
That's how we do it
