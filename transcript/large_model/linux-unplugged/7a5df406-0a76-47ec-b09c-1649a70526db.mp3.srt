1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
It's a Linux-unplugged birthday party.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,800
Slackware has turned 25.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,660
No, no, no, they didn't turn 25 before.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,320
I know, we all thought so, but it was originally released,

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,500
version 1.0, on July 17th, 1993,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,620
and its founder, Patrick, originally never intended

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,480
to do a Linux distribution.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,100
He just wanted to help out Softlanding Linux,

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,820
but you know how things go in the open source community.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,700
It's the oldest distro around,

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,740
and it's been very influential.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,420
The earliest releases of Soos Linux were based on Slackware.

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,260
Distributions such as Arch Linux can see their

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,580
philosophical heritage back into Slackware.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,360
It's been around for a long time.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,820
So for this episode only,

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,120
Wes and I are running exclusively on Slackware.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,540
I mean, since we did that whole Slackware experiment,

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,980
I just have never gotten rid of it.

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,960
It has its own little place on my hard drive.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,580
We've never gone back.

22
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,660
Right next to Gen 2, no doubt.

23
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,500
Ooh.

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

25
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,300
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 258 for July 17th,

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,700
2018.

27
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,700
your weekly Linux talk show

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,820
that's loaded for bear this week.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,860
And I'm not so sure if that's a good thing,

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,320
but we have so much to get into

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
that maybe you won't even notice.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,620
We'll come around to how SSH got its port number.

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,820
We'll talk about Chrome using a little more memory,

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,980
but then we'll dig in to some crazy projects

36
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,940
that are going down this week.

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,380
I'm talking stuff that we've been meaning to get to

38
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,900
for months now that are finally making it into the show.

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,020
Plus some ideas that I'm not so sure are fully cooked,

40
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,300
but we'll run them past you guys and see what you think.

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,780
We've got an update on the Atari VCS and the Librem 5.

42
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,800
And then towards the end of the show,

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,820
after we've gotten through some app picks

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,740
and some community news, we have a question.

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,000
This is in light of Python's benevolent dictator

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,060
for life stepping down.

47
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,420
We covered that on Linux Action News this week.

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,780
And I thought maybe we could use the context

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,560
of that situation to talk about a broader topic.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,380
What happens when Linus steps down?

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,180
What happens to Linux?

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,460
What happens to the structure?

53
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,820
Where does that go?

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,020
Does it go to Greg KH?

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,620
Does it go to the Linux Foundation?

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,900
We'll talk about that.

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,420
And then we'll also discuss maybe

58
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,260
how other open source projects could learn

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,380
from what happened with Python.

60
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,460
We'll do a quick recap too, just in case you didn't hear that.

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,500
So Mr. West, we're fully loaded.

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
It's just you and I this week.

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,180
No, no Brent.

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,620
No Brent, he's ditched us.

65
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,220
But I think he might've been intimidated

66
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,300
by just how much show we've packed in here.

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,620
I was scared myself.

68
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,660
Yeah, it was either that or it was the man eating clams.

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,900
I'm not sure, it was something to that effect.

70
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,020
But I think after the show, we'll head out

71
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
and see if we can't find him and save him

72
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,180
so we can make it back.

73
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,820
But we do have a mumble room and they're here.

74
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,660
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

75
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,820
What's up?

76
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,180
Good evening.

77
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,220
Hello, oh, you stop it you guys, you stop it.

78
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,900
There's so much to get into this week.

79
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,220
I don't even know where to start with it.

80
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,700
We have a bunch of community news.

81
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,980
It's good to see some familiar faces in the mumble room.

82
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,620
Daniel Foray made it back, even though,

83
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,660
I mean, I thought he's busy working on elementary OS.

84
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,700
Dan, how'd you make it here?

85
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,100
Aren't you supposed to be busy?

86
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh, you know, taking a break.

87
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,980
That's my nice way of thanking you for being here really.

88
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,660
You know, I'm nice to my guests, what can I say?

89
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,740
All right, so we have much to get into, so much to talk about.

90
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,820
So let's start with the one that I thought

91
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,420
was kind of just the most interesting.

92
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,420
I'd never really known the story about how SSH got its port

93
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,060
and the author wrote it up.

94
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,660
And I wanted to relay it to you guys

95
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,700
because it's fascinating how SSH received

96
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,500
its port in the spring of 1995.

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,460
The author starts with, I designed SSH to replace

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,300
both Telnet and FTP, Telnet being on port 23

99
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,100
and FTP being on port 21.

100
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,740
Port 22 was free at the time, and it sat conveniently

101
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
between ports for Telnet and FTP.

102
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,500
I figured having that port number

103
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,660
might be one of those small things that would give

104
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,660
some extra credibility to SSH.

105
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,260
But how could I get that port number, he writes.

106
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,780
I had never allocated one, but I knew somebody who

107
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,740
had allocated a port before.

108
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,620
The basic process for port allocation

109
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
was fairly simple at that time.

110
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,740
The internet was smaller, and we were in the very early stages

111
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,620
of the internet boom.

112
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,060
Port numbers were allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers

113
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,260
Authority, which really at that time,

114
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,580
run by John Postel and Joyce K. Reynolds.

115
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,460
Among other things, John had been the editor

116
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,060
of some minor protocol standards you may have heard,

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,500
such as IP, ICMP, and TCP.

118
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,460
And he was a little intimidated by that fact,

119
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,460
but he built up the courage, and he wrote an email to John.

120
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,100
And he wrote in July of 1995, dear sir, just before,

121
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,580
just like a week before the announcement of SSH,

122
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,300
dear sir, I have written a program

123
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,700
to securely log from one machine onto another

124
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,580
over an insecure network.

125
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,100
It provides major improvements in security and functionality

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,740
over existing Telnet and R login protocols

127
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,860
and implementations.

128
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,700
In particular, it prevents IP, DNS, and routing spoofing.

129
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,940
My plan is to distribute the software freely on the internet

130
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,900
and to get it as wide of use as possible.

131
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,220
I would like to get a registered privileged port

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,580
number for the software.

133
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,820
The number should preferably be in the range of 1 to 255.

134
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,740
And then he goes on to notice, I am currently

135
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,540
using port 22 in the latest beta test,

136
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,180
and it would just be great if I could just keep using that.

137
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,780
The service software name is called

138
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,220
SSH for Secure Shell, sincerely yours.

139
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,900
And then it looks like the next day, almost within just

140
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,060
a couple of hours, but I think it was a different time zone,

141
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,780
Joyce writes back, we have assigned port number 22 to SSH,

142
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,540
and we've marked your email address

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,380
as the point of contact, Joyce.

144
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,460
And that's it.

145
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,100
On July 12, 1995, at 2 AM, the final beta of SSH

146
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,660
was announced using port 22, and it

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,780
was one of those small touches that he believes

148
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,340
helped it gain credibility.

149
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,620
And it's such a simple, easy, elegant story.

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,220
Like, it's not this big corporate explanation.

151
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,620
I guess I always thought it was like a big standards body, Wes.

152
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,580
I made that assumption.

153
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,340
Where are the forms filled out in triplicate

154
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,140
and the months of procedures before you

155
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,660
can get anything approved?

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,340
I don't see that here, and it's very confusing and kind

157
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,100
of heartening.

158
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,620
Yeah, it's just a simple email.

159
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Dear sir or ma'am, to whom it may be concerned.

160
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,820
And the response email is so short, too.

161
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,220
Just like, yeah, no problem, 22 is yours.

162
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,620
And we just added your email address, no big deal.

163
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,220
Makes me think of the Steve Jobs quote in Steve Jobs' book,

164
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,900
that when you realize the world around you

165
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,780
is just made by people, it's just two people emailing,

166
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,580
and yeah, that's fine, let's do that.

167
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,820
Yeah, yeah, everybody's just as smart as you.

168
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,260
I think it also sort of harkens back

169
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,740
to that era of the internet when if you were on the internet,

170
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,260
you probably had an email and you

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,140
used it to correspond with real humans,

172
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,900
not just receive junk mail or ads in your inbox.

173
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
So it's kind of quaint in that respect,

174
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,900
like that you don't have to be all your guards up.

175
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,020
You can actually communicate.

176
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,660
Yeah, quaint is a good way to put it.

177
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,740
It's like, aw, it's a simpler time.

178
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,780
It was so easy back then.

179
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,460
And it's fascinating, the launch of projects

180
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,100
like Linux and SSH and many, many others, the just blatantly

181
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,140
humbleness of the like, I think this could be a good thing.

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,340
Maybe it'll replace our login and telnet.

183
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,820
You know, it helps fight against DNS spoofing.

184
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,500
And I think that's kind of a good thing.

185
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,460
And now it's like the underpinnings

186
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,540
of how we administer all of these systems.

187
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,420
Like SSH is so pivotal to what we do now.

188
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,900
It starts so humble.

189
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,260
I think that's fascinating, just like Linux itself.

190
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,220
We have some books we could talk about.

191
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,540
Maybe mention those right here at the top of the show.

192
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,500
The Humble Bundle folks have a Humble Book Bundle.

193
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,580
And it's the Linux Geek Bundle by Non-Starch Press.

194
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,620
So they have a whole bunch in here that you might

195
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,380
want to go check out, including Perl one-liners,

196
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,020
The Art of Debugging, The Book of GIMP.

197
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,220
That's kind of cool.

198
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,220
The Book of Inkscape, that's also very cool.

199
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,900
Blender Masterclass, oh, I might just

200
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,300
have to pop on over there.

201
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,820
How Linux Works is probably just a good one to page.

202
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,700
Oh, Absolute OpenBSD, who would ever want that?

203
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
I don't know about that.

204
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,060
Think Like a Programmer, the Linux Programming Interface,

205
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,740
that's awesome.

206
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,900
So there you go.

207
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,580
Humble Bundle, I'll have a link in the show notes

208
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,420
if you want to check that out.

209
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
It's got 12 days as we record this.

210
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,660
You know, we think a little bit too much about our desktops,

211
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,620
things that we have like bookshelves in our home.

212
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,100
Make sure you have a robust e-bookshelf, too, though.

213
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,500
And these will really stack the deck

214
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,860
when you want to open up your browser

215
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,980
and look really smart in front of your friends.

216
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,940
Yeah, when you want to open up the browser

217
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,020
in front of your friends, because that's something

218
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,980
you do all the time.

219
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,820
Well, I don't know about you, Chris.

220
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,020
Hey, guys, come over here and look at my browser real quick.

221
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,820
You know, just get a really big monitor.

222
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
If only the e-book market wasn't taken over

223
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,020
by one single proprietary source, RIP.

224
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,060
RIP.

225
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,100
Now, I wanted to just give a quick mention, just

226
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,700
an update on everybody.

227
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,900
I am still down here in the Tejas, Texas.

228
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,060
And boy, was that a mistake.

229
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,900
Holy crap.

230
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,940
I have learned a new kind of hot.

231
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,180
112 degrees outside right now.

232
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,740
The National Weather Service has just

233
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,460
issued a warning for the next two days.

234
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,140
The dead of night, it's going to be like 86 degrees.

235
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,980
It's intense.

236
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,740
But boy, have I been having a blast.

237
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,260
So Linux Academy has been doing these live streams

238
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,980
where they're like doing giveaways and launching

239
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,740
new content.

240
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,700
So I've been hanging out for that.

241
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,820
They put me up in a hotel.

242
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,700
So it's not like I'm not having to pay for it out

243
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,140
of my pocket or anything.

244
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,140
So they put me up in a nice hotel.

245
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,940
And I decided to stay here because they just

246
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,620
had me give a talk a bit ago at their summit.

247
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,100
They have a company-wide summit here

248
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
that most of the company is at, and had

249
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,780
me give a talk on community and leadership

250
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,100
and contributing upstream.

251
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,380
They're working on something that I probably

252
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,300
can't say what it is that will be a big code

253
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,380
project that they're going to start contributing

254
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,460
to open source upstream.

255
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,540
And they're getting ready to try to figure out,

256
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,300
try to learn how to do that, and how to position it,

257
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,900
and all of that.

258
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,740
Wow.

259
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,060
That's really exciting.

260
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,580
It is.

261
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,060
It's really neat to see them do that.

262
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,700
They've, the other thing that they've talked a lot about

263
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,260
at the summit is they've had a program in place

264
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,300
where it's like choose your own weapon.

265
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,820
So you come in and you say, I'd like a Chromebook.

266
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,780
Or hi, I'd like a MacBook.

267
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,860
Or hi, I'd like a Linux box.

268
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,140
And you just picked whatever worked best for you.

269
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,700
But now what they're doing is to try

270
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,740
to encourage people to pick more Linux boxes.

271
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,220
They're setting up a little Linux support group,

272
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,220
like people that are also, not like support in terms

273
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,820
of technical support, but like support group.

274
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,460
And like, hey, I'm switching and I don't know how to do this.

275
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,060
So they have a little internal group that helps everybody

276
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,020
figure that stuff out.

277
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
And so that's pretty neat.

278
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,100
Seen a lot of gnome shell here at Linux Academy,

279
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,540
which I'm not too surprised by.

280
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,740
I don't think I've seen any Plasma desktop yet.

281
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,520
So I don't know if I can leave just yet.

282
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,140
I may have to stick around until I've converted a few people

283
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,860
over to the Plasma desktop.

284
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,780
Yeah, if you join that group, you can just sort of be like,

285
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,580
oh, no, that's just a gnome problem.

286
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,100
If you install this other shell, it works way better.

287
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,020
Oh, man, that's so insidious.

288
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,100
You troll, you.

289
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I'm trying from the top.

290
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,780
So I'm trying to get the CEO switched over to Kubuntu 18.04.

291
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,920
And then once I get Anthony on Kubuntu,

292
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm going to set him up with LatteDoc.

293
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,140
Because the other thing I've noticed

294
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,060
is when people see my Plasma desktop setup,

295
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,260
they are, you know, it's like the old days when

296
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,140
I used to have Compiz and Barrel.

297
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,980
People used to be like, oh, what's that?

298
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,640
And in my IT department, then they started trying out Linux.

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,820
And it's why I actually became a big fan of desktop effects,

300
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,580
not because they had any practical effect

301
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,660
other than they helped me switch people to Linux.

302
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,860
And so I was all for it.

303
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,300
Same thing now with my Plasma desktop setup,

304
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,940
which does look good on that XPS 13 with the Infinity

305
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,780
edge-to-edge display.

306
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,900
It's 4K.

307
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,600
And I got a high-res background.

308
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,220
And then I got LatteDoc going.

309
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,820
And I got a dark theme going.

310
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,940
And so I was showing Anthony, I'm like, yeah,

311
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,300
this is how you can make it look.

312
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,660
And this is pretty nice, right?

313
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,980
I'm like, this is LatteDoc here?

314
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,500
He's like, I'm doing that.

315
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,740
So you'll see.

316
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,180
I'm beginning to spread my tentacles.

317
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,300
And I don't know, it's like, it's not good enough

318
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,620
just to get them on Linux anymore?

319
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,140
No, no.

320
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,820
No, I must go all the way.

321
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,260
But actually, the folks that are running Gnome, they love it.

322
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
It's great for them.

323
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,840
So it's been pretty cool to see that.

324
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,220
It's been cool to see people that come in

325
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,260
from different organizations.

326
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,060
There's some folks that they hired recently from Rackspace

327
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,100
and brought them in here.

328
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,620
And Rackspace was all Macs.

329
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,900
And so they came in here, and they wanted a Mac.

330
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,340
But then they started seeing other people's Linux desktops,

331
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,460
and started working here at Linux Academy for a while.

332
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,260
And now they're trying to figure out

333
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,420
how to switch over to Linux.

334
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,940
And there's people that are like,

335
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,340
how do I run Linux on a touch bar Macbook?

336
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
I'm like, oh.

337
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,820
Don't even start.

338
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
That's been a thing.

339
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,540
It's been a real thing watching that.

340
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,060
I'd be curious to keep tabs on how that goes

341
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,700
throughout the company as they kind of make that shift.

342
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,140
Yeah, it's unique to see.

343
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,220
It's not like you're a secret group hiding around like,

344
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,360
oh, yeah, we use Linux.

345
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
We don't really talk about it much,

346
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,660
and don't tell desktop support.

347
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,900
But here's some tips.

348
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,060
It's out in the open.

349
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,380
It's even almost sponsored.

350
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,540
That is awesome.

351
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,780
I know that if I was an employee,

352
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,220
I would much prefer a you choose your system policy

353
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,260
than you have to use X, Y, Z, regardless of whatever it is.

354
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Because it's never going to be perfect.

355
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,180
And one year, maybe I'd like to use Kubuntu.

356
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,220
And then maybe the next year, I'd like to use KDE Neon

357
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,620
or something.

358
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,280
And I want to be able to move around,

359
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,020
and I want to be able to change.

360
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,060
And so I like that.

361
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,860
I would like that.

362
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,620
If I wanted to use Windows 10, I think I should be able to.

363
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
So I think that's kind of a cool policy.

364
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,140
It feels a little bit, too, like if you were a master carpenter

365
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,460
and you came into a job, and they're like, no,

366
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,220
we only use this brand of hammer.

367
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,380
So here you go.

368
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,260
Throw away any tools that you know and love.

369
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
And I think from the security side, it's good.

370
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
If you have to deal with whatever operating systems are

371
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,420
going to be on your network, you have

372
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,880
to have a better level of security

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,900
than if you're just going to trust whatever crappy programs

374
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,580
you force on the Windows desktop.

375
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,940
I think this is probably the most prolonged time I've

376
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,300
spent at a company that is a Linux shop,

377
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,820
and what they do is Linux.

378
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,700
You know what I mean?

379
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,120
Like, I've definitely been at lots

380
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
of places that use Linux, lots of places that use Linux.

381
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,220
But the product is all based around Linux,

382
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,340
and the people are using Linux, and the server side's

383
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,980
all Linux.

384
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,420
And like, it's not like a thing.

385
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,620
It's just normal.

386
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,420
It's not like this weird thing.

387
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,540
It's just, well, yeah, it's Linux.

388
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,740
Of course I'm using it.

389
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,980
I started a job as a developer a few years ago,

390
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,420
and the first day, the girl who was doing my mentoring said,

391
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,220
here's your laptop.

392
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,100
It's running Windows.

393
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,800
What I do is I run Ubuntu in a VM

394
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,420
and do all my dev work in a VM.

395
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm like, why couldn't you just erase it

396
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,940
and put Linux straight on it?

397
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh, it's too complicated.

398
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,660
Yeah, I mean, sometimes there's an advantage

399
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,700
to having your dev environment in a VM, for sure.

400
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
But I could just never live with the performance.

401
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,460
I've tried.

402
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,340
It's just no good.

403
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah, it's been pretty interesting to sort of be

404
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,540
around where it's, I was trying to come up with a term for it.

405
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,380
This isn't a great term, but what it feels like

406
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,740
is just ambient Linux.

407
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,380
Like, Linux is just an assumed.

408
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,520
It's just like this normal, not this edge thing.

409
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,660
It's just this normal thing.

410
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,860
It's just Linux isn't assumed.

411
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,340
It's just ambient Linux, and that's not a big deal.

412
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,060
It's never been a big deal here, so it's not part of the cult.

413
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,860
It's just so weird, though, because it's always

414
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,220
been other companies I go to, it's

415
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,260
like maybe they have a product that runs on Linux or something.

416
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,140
And then there have been companies like System76

417
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,180
that are all Linux, but it's 20 people, where

418
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,380
this is over 100 people.

419
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,460
And it's a huge summit and all that kind of stuff.

420
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,660
It's a big group of people.

421
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,700
So it's an experience to be inside a corporation,

422
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,940
like an actual legitimate corporation

423
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,780
with over 100 employees.

424
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,980
But they're all geeks.

425
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,420
It's just a very strange experience to me,

426
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,300
but a good one, but one that the younger version of me,

427
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,060
who fought the good old wars of Microsoft and Linux

428
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,820
and trying to get people to use Linux all the time

429
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,260
and trying to convince people that open source didn't mean

430
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,420
it was bad quality and fighting all of those fights

431
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,620
that I used to get in the middle of to try

432
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,060
to get clients to switch their systems over to Linux.

433
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,460
That version of me now seeing this

434
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,780
is still having a hard time accepting what I'm seeing.

435
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,380
You mean people besides my little social group

436
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,620
use this now?

437
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,540
It really is a thing.

438
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,900
You're no longer a cool outsider, right?

439
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,940
There's no fight to win.

440
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,580
You just can get work done now.

441
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,860
In the best way possible, in the best way possible.

442
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,540
The fight is so over that the Earth is no longer warm

443
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,780
from the bombs even.

444
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,780
They've rebuilt and repaved the roads

445
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,500
and now life just goes on.

446
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,540
You've mourned for the dead, you're moving on.

447
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,380
Yeah, exactly.

448
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,260
Yeah, and I'm like the old war vet going,

449
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,780
I remember how it used to be though.

450
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,540
We're all okay with this now?

451
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,340
It's where the latent distrust of Microsoft is still there

452
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,260
and we have all these wounds deep in our psyches.

453
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,740
And it's just kind of bringing some of that up.

454
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,020
So that's the thing is like,

455
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,700
there's a couple of people here running Windows

456
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,100
but they're Azure administrators.

457
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,460
That's what they do, is they write Azure courseware.

458
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,140
And then it makes whatever, then you can be,

459
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
there's no judgment on either of the sides.

460
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,820
I don't mind if you use Windows,

461
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,980
if that is what helped you get your job done

462
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,860
and you don't care if I use Linux to get my job done

463
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,260
and we can all be happy and everyone gets stuff done.

464
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,660
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool.

465
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,460
It's pretty neat and I'm really glad

466
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,620
I stuck around a little bit longer

467
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,700
even though the heat is, it is now a heat death.

468
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,740
It is a massive, massive heat death right now.

469
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,900
So in fact, this, I'll move on,

470
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,580
but just something I've never witnessed before,

471
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,380
but grasshoppers like get paralyzed by the heat down here.

472
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,300
So they, when you walk around the sidewalks in some places,

473
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,020
there's grasshoppers everywhere.

474
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,620
Like you're crunching them as you're walking around

475
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,820
because they jump out of the bushes

476
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,860
and they land on the cement and then they paralyzed.

477
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,140
Oh, it's so hot.

478
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,460
And so you have these grasshoppers all over the ground

479
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,860
in some areas all day long until the evening

480
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,340
when the sun sets and the ground starts to cool

481
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,900
and then they come back to life

482
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,260
and they hop back in the bushes and it's super gross.

483
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,780
Oh, that sounds like a really useful trait.

484
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
Yeah, it's great for harvesting

485
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,540
if you wanna cook some grasshoppers.

486
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Just go get some sun-dried grasshoppers.

487
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,020
All right, well, let's talk about Linux.

488
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,660
I just wanted to update you guys

489
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,740
and while I'm still down here roasting my balls,

490
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,300
but it's been a really good eye-opening experience

491
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,180
to just spend some time around a largish,

492
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,340
or to me, 100 plus organizations getting there.

493
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,340
It's obviously not a big, it's still a small business,

494
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,340
but it's been really kind of a good experience

495
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,740
to just be around a whole bunch of Linux users

496
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,100
for an extended period of time

497
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,700
and where it's not like, oh, we're fighting a good fight.

498
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,940
It's just, this is life, this is how we do our work

499
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
and it's not even a big deal.

500
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,020
Let's talk about Fedora though

501
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,300
because speaking of Fedora,

502
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,460
that seems to be one of the more popular ones around here.

503
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,340
Fedora 29 isn't eliminating Yum as we reported recently.

504
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,180
It looks like it was up for debate

505
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,100
and at Fedora's engineering and steering committee meeting,

506
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,940
the plan to drop Yum for Fedora 29 was rejected

507
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,980
when the council realized it was still shipping in RHEL.

508
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,820
No, I'm kidding.

509
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
When they realized that it was connected

510
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,120
to a bunch of other components in the infrastructure

511
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,620
that would cause major logistic issues

512
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,540
if they wanted to pull it out.

513
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,500
So if when I said recently that Fedora was losing Yum

514
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,420
and you panicked, well, now don't you feel silly.

515
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,820
Because I was just wrong and they hadn't decided yet

516
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,860
and now they have decided.

517
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
I did panic.

518
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,780
I just, sometimes I get a little worked up,

519
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,140
especially on these Tuesdays that are so intense

520
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,340
with all the Linux news.

521
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,180
I know.

522
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,460
But I think actually it's a pretty mature choice,

523
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,500
especially, I don't know,

524
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,100
I certainly do get that itch for spring cleaning

525
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,020
and I don't want any extra binaries floating around,

526
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,420
but in the world of open source

527
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,020
where you really wanna make things compatible

528
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,980
and you want things that worked on Fedora 27

529
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,180
to work on Fedora 28 and you want it to work on 29

530
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,120
and 30 and 31, just keeping these things around

531
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,700
for a little longer than feels necessary,

532
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,060
sometimes can make a good subset of users' lives

533
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,160
that much easier and it's probably worth it

534
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,900
for one megabyte of disk space.

535
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah, these seem to be fitting in line

536
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,780
with a series of decisions that I feel like

537
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,720
I've witnessed the Fedora project make recently

538
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,660
that conservative is the wrong label,

539
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,540
but it's not as breakneck pace

540
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,060
as it once was in some regards.

541
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,880
Like they're still hall and button innovating,

542
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,420
but there was a time where they would ship stuff

543
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,300
just way early as almost like a point of pride.

544
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,340
And it seems like they've sort of dialed it back a bit

545
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,660
where they're trying to find a balance there

546
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,980
where people can get a little more predictability

547
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,580
and experience like a little bit more,

548
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,200
I don't know, is consistency the word

549
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm looking here for, Wes?

550
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,660
Yeah, I mean, it seems like there's a little more intent.

551
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,620
It's no longer just the sort of bleeding edge proving ground

552
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,260
for things that might make it into RHEL later,

553
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,140
it is actually sort of shipped and marketed

554
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,380
as something that an end user could and should use.

555
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, you still have to be the right end user,

556
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,500
but that doesn't mean that you grab some,

557
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,460
like it's not like getting a random snapshot of Arch

558
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,080
and just hoping things are all working nicely together.

559
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,420
There's actually been a lot of intent

560
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,660
and design put into it.

561
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,020
Yeah, speaking of a lot of intent and design,

562
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,340
Mir, yeah, Canonical's Mir, still kicking,

563
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,180
still rocking with version 0.321 coming out recently,

564
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,760
and it's looking really good.

565
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,820
Think of it as an abstraction layer,

566
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,940
and it's more than just a Wayland client now,

567
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,380
but of course, they've been rewriting it,

568
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,020
I suppose you could say, in a way, for Wayland support,

569
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,420
and the Mir AL shell, which has reinstated the spinner

570
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,660
when you're starting the Wayland shell,

571
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,300
so now you'll have somewhat of a status indicator

572
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,620
when the shell's launching,

573
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,100
and the developers are working on support for XDG shell,

574
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,920
as well as supporting the Wayland extensions

575
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,980
and other upcoming work.

576
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,300
So this was, oh, I thought, okay, that's kind of interesting.

577
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,340
It was like following a trail,

578
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,100
so then after I read that, I thought, well,

579
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,660
what is Canonical really envisioning the use of Mir?

580
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,020
Like, really?

581
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Like, why are they actually spending real money?

582
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, it's funny money,

583
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,160
but I mean, their version of real money on Mir.

584
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,860
Like, what's the, why, and the individual,

585
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,800
at least that I have met, and there's probably more than one,

586
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,060
but the individual I've met that's working on Mir

587
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,440
has gotta be one of the more talented developers

588
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,360
I've ever met.

589
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,860
So it's like real money they're probably spending.

590
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,460
At least I hope he's getting real money.

591
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,440
And it's an implementation of something

592
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,420
that we are starting to see other solutions for,

593
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,780
especially when it comes to stuff sitting on top of Wayland.

594
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,380
So I really was trying to grok where it fit in.

595
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,620
And it appears that the Mir graphical stack

596
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,500
is really being positioned down the road

597
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
for IoT devices by Canonical.

598
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,660
They say, when we first conceived of it six years ago

599
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,380
as part of an initiative to unify the graphical environments

600
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,860
across desktops, TV, and mobile devices,

601
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,140
we continue to move it forward into modern standards

602
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,740
like the Wayland protocol.

603
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,260
The thing is, is Mir is designed with low memory

604
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,740
and disk space and CPU usage baked in.

605
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,020
So memory and disk space is much lower than other solutions,

606
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,020
and they've also tried to build it with security in mind.

607
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,140
If you, for example, were setting up an Ubuntu Core

608
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,360
distro, Mir, and a small LCD display server

609
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,060
with a low-cost sensor and a Raspberry Pi 3,

610
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,500
the next thing you know, you have a 24-7 monitoring solution

611
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,100
which could graph information with Mir and Ubuntu

612
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,260
at the core.

613
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,980
And I thought to myself, I said, self?

614
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,580
That sounds like a very specific example

615
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,980
that they just gave there.

616
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,460
Why that specific example?

617
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,060
So Jamie is the author.

618
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,220
He's a developer over at Canonical

619
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,100
and is involved in their IoT efforts.

620
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,740
So I started digging around a little bit.

621
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,460
I saw he has a blog post, which I'll

622
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,360
have a link in the show notes, about setting up

623
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,100
an Ubuntu-powered greenhouse monitoring system on his home.

624
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,780
In one of my favorite areas in the UK,

625
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,740
it's a town or an area, I don't know, a village.

626
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,060
I don't know what you guys call them over there, called Bath.

627
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,800
It's a city.

628
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,060
It's a city, OK.

629
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,440
Bath.

630
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,940
I love it.

631
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
That's so awesome.

632
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,000
It's so awesome.

633
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,140
And over in Bath, he's got a greenhouse.

634
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,980
And he's been looking at different solutions

635
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,760
on the market to monitor his greenhouse.

636
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,860
And so many of them are consumer products.

637
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,340
They only work with iOS or Android.

638
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,540
They don't really let you get to the data.

639
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,060
You know what?

640
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,620
You and I have talked about this quite a bit,

641
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,960
sort of off-air more, but like sensor data and things

642
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,340
like that that I've wanted to track.

643
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,380
Yeah, very much so.

644
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,860
And he was looking at some different solutions.

645
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,420
He came across, by the way, his greenhouse

646
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,620
is a pretty cool little greenhouse.

647
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,860
He says that he's cooking, or he's

648
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,360
cooking, growing in their chilies, tomatoes, cucumbers,

649
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,220
strawberries, probably cannabis.

650
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,080
Although he doesn't say that.

651
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,740
I'm just assuming.

652
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,100
Lemons and things like that.

653
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,340
The UK exports more cannabis than any other country.

654
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,300
Just saying.

655
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,460
No way.

656
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,500
Is that true?

657
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,780
Yeah, apparently so.

658
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,060
You guys.

659
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,020
And also, our minister for drug controls, husband,

660
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,300
also works for the largest medical cannabis company

661
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,140
in the world, apparently, or something like that.

662
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,660
Jeez.

663
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,340
You stoners, you.

664
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Yeah, really.

665
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,460
Gosh, get to work, you slackers.

666
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,140
So after a bit of research, Jamie came across the YaoMei

667
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,100
temperature sensor, which does temperature and humidity

668
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,620
for like nine funny dollars.

669
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,780
And you just get it from a Chinese reseller.

670
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,420
The sensor itself is small, ZigBee based.

671
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,380
It's powered by just a little cell watch battery kind

672
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,660
of thing.

673
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,180
And it has a range of negative 20 to 60 Celsius,

674
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,140
as well as bringing in the humidity.

675
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,380
And he can get access to it.

676
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,340
Now, YaoMei, they provide an Android and iOS application.

677
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,240
But he wanted something where he could get the data elsewhere.

678
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,900
So his initial idea was to put together

679
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,060
a small, dedicated, low-powered device, like a Raspberry Pi 3,

680
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,540
running Ubuntu MATE.

681
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,220
Ah, that's awesome.

682
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,260
Set up SSH.

683
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,860
Ding.

684
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,780
Boy, we're hitting all of the points today.

685
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,260
And then from there, he had a fresh Ubuntu environment.

686
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,140
He also installed a MQTT messaging system

687
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,700
in the form of Mosquito, which is an open source,

688
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,180
I guess, message gateway would be the way to put that,

689
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
where you can send messages between applications.

690
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,740
Not like text messages, like data messages.

691
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,500
He also loaded some Python on there,

692
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,260
and Wes's favorite, Grafina, to visualize the whole thing

693
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,860
into some beautiful charts, which is pretty cool.

694
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,360
I know when you see the charts, you're really like, oh, yeah,

695
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,740
this was all totally worth it.

696
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,040
Just like looking at the temperature

697
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,620
in the greenhouse over multiple days,

698
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,900
as you can see the cycles of the sun, it's just so cool.

699
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,620
Yeah.

700
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,460
Yeah, and the weather's been hot over there recently, too.

701
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,460
So it's actually been pretty great to have this.

702
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,660
So he puts all of that into an InfluxDB,

703
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,340
and then Grafina looks at that.

704
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
He generates two charts, one for the temperature

705
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,580
and one for the humidity.

706
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,080
And he points out that then you could

707
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,540
put Mir in kiosk mode with a nice little display

708
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,780
on there, a little small LCD cheapo,

709
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,560
and have it visualizing 24-7 in real time a view of the data.

710
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,900
And you can do all of this on small ARM devices

711
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,380
with Ubuntu Core, and then using Mir to generate the displays.

712
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,500
Grafina, which is another open source project.

713
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,340
It's pretty nice how you can build all this.

714
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,020
It should all scale pretty well.

715
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,100
You invest a little bit of money in the sensors,

716
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,380
a little bit of money in the pie.

717
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,880
If you're like me, you probably have pies just floating around

718
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,820
that you haven't yet found a use for anyway.

719
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,940
So you need to stick it out there.

720
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,660
And then as you go, if you want more sensors,

721
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,380
you find more sensors to buy, you add them on there.

722
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,420
They can all just send data to the same back end

723
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,660
you already have.

724
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,980
So boy, this is a fun project.

725
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,860
Poby, before we move off of the Mir topic,

726
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,620
is there anything we're missing about this subject

727
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,100
that you've heard in the hallways,

728
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,740
the virtual hallways of Canonical about Mir?

729
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,420
No, you've got it about right there.

730
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,140
I personally have it running on a laptop here.

731
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I've got an Ubuntu Core laptop.

732
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,020
So it's only Ubuntu Core, like super minimal install

733
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,180
with a bunch of snaps on top.

734
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,140
And I've got the Mir kiosk on top

735
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,500
to test out delivering graphical applications

736
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,060
as snaps for Ubuntu Core, which should be fun.

737
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,020
But that's something we're just playing with.

738
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,500
Have you looked at what the total install

739
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,660
size of that setup is?

740
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,100
It's got to be not much.

741
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,620
Yeah, it's not a lot.

742
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,420
It's not much at all.

743
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,740
That's neat.

744
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,260
Well, cool.

745
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,620
And I'm glad to see that Mir's chugging along.

746
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,140
It sounds like it may be just digging itself out

747
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,980
a little niche that it could serve quite well.

748
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,620
So I'll keep tabs on that.

749
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,460
Let's move up the stack a bit.

750
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,020
And let's talk about Mutter.

751
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,380
Big, big performance improvements

752
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,900
coming to Mutter because it's going

753
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
to be doing a lot less math.

754
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,620
This is going to be landing if all things go as planned

755
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,780
in GNOME 3.3.0.

756
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,740
And it looks like, aside also from just other little things

757
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,460
like, I don't know, dependencies on X11,

758
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,140
there's going to be performance optimizations.

759
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,860
A GitLab request was merged about reusing paint volumes.

760
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,700
Now, that sounds like a simple thing.

761
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,900
But it cuts down approximately all paint volume calculations,

762
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,580
all of them, any time it has to redraw a window.

763
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,100
And particularly, there is massive improvements

764
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,020
if there's a window for some reason that needs to be redrawn

765
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,220
but hasn't moved.

766
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,100
In the past, essentially, Mutter would do all of the math

767
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,420
and repaint that entire thing and recalculate all of it

768
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,420
every time constantly.

769
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,940
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

770
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,780
It's that way faster than that.

771
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,060
And this, instead, essentially will just

772
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,380
keep a cheat sheet of the math answer

773
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,420
and just keep referring to that until it

774
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,980
has a reason to change things and redraw,

775
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,940
like the window's been moved.

776
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,420
That could be a big improvement for Gnome.

777
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,180
And I think I've witnessed this issue, perhaps,

778
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,660
although it could be way wrong with my terminal window.

779
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,540
So if you've been a Gnome user and all of this Plasma talk

780
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,980
has really been kind of tempting you,

781
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,740
maybe don't disrupt the whole workflow yet.

782
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,020
Maybe stick it out for Gnome 3.30.

783
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,860
Maybe, although things are getting

784
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,500
good on the Plasma side, too.

785
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,140
I was just talking to Wes on the pre-show

786
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,020
about how we're still kind of like going back and forth

787
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
on just the perfect laptop.

788
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,340
And Alex in the Mumble Room has been sort of convincing me

789
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,900
that perhaps a Lenovo T480 would be the way to go.

790
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,460
14-inch, 2K display.

791
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,180
And it's got an i7 four-core processor.

792
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,420
It's got Thunderbolt 3.

793
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,020
It's got a 512 megabyte MVD drive.

794
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,060
It's $2,000.

795
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,140
Now, that sounds like a lot of money,

796
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,820
but this is a machine to do live media production.

797
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,340
And it's cheaper than an equivalently priced MacBook.

798
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,300
It's really tempting.

799
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,880
And when I think about that, the reason

800
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,620
why I bring all that up is when I think about when I get

801
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,980
a new piece of hardware, I really, really, really

802
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,340
can start to understand why some people do these super

803
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,460
minimal desktops.

804
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,220
Because the idea that the fact that Mudder is sitting there

805
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,100
redoing this math every time it has to repaint a window

806
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,100
from scratch every single time is disappointing.

807
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,220
It was really, really disappointing.

808
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,100
It sort of makes me think like I'm

809
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,620
wasting some of that horsepower.

810
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,740
I'm wasting my money when I try to get something that powerful.

811
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,260
So I say all that with I really, I can really kind of,

812
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,500
even though I'm never going to be like an awesome window

813
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,780
manager guy or an ex-monad, I can completely appreciate

814
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,340
some of the logic behind it.

815
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,100
I thought you were just running OBS straight on top of X11

816
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,900
these days.

817
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,140
You know, that's what I should be doing.

818
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,740
That's what I should be doing, shouldn't I?

819
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,700
It takes all the things.

820
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,060
Yeah, it did.

821
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,100
Oh, I have in the day.

822
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,540
We also have ourselves GTK 4 coming in the spring of 2019,

823
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,700
it looks like at this point.

824
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,220
Of course, all of that is possibly to change.

825
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,060
And we're going to be getting, just as a reminder,

826
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,900
GTK Plus 3.24, which is a minor feature update, very soon.

827
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,060
It looks like there will be some things we are hoping

828
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,860
for that won't land in GTK 4.

829
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,340
They're going to be postponed until GTK 5,

830
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,420
like constraint-based layout support,

831
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,140
shader compilers, application-provided shader

832
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,940
support, and the UI designer support.

833
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,420
It also looks like GTK 4, with the Mac OS Quartz back end,

834
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,500
is in a pretty bad state.

835
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,380
But they think that they can probably get it cleaned up

836
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,980
soon.

837
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,100
So there you go.

838
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,060
How's that for a little gnome corner?

839
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,940
Little gnome corner.

840
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,500
Look at you.

841
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,820
I mean, we all know that you're secretly forever plasma biased,

842
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,860
but you're really doing a good job of pretending

843
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,300
that you're not.

844
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,260
But plasma's really good, though, Wes.

845
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,940
Come on.

846
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,380
That's true.

847
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
We've got to turn the show into The Plasma Hour

848
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
at this rate.

849
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,460
Hey, that's a cool title.

850
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:00,820
Hold on.

851
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,300
Hold on.

852
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,980
I know, right?

853
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,620
Yeah, go ahead and suggest that.

854
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,140
Our next story is really probably,

855
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,580
I should just defer to Poby, because he

856
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,700
is an expert on all things Bitcoin and blockchain.

857
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,020
And he is our resident expert.

858
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,940
So I don't know.

859
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,740
I'm sure you're probably aware of this,

860
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,440
but there is a very fancy phone.

861
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,340
I think you pronounce it SerenLabs.

862
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
They're the folks, you may have heard it.

863
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,300
They once had this celebrity phone that was $16,000.

864
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,860
They call it the world's most secure phone.

865
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,980
And they're out with their next product.

866
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,340
They call it the Finney.

867
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,620
And this time, it's only $1,000.

868
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,180
And it's got blockchain built in.

869
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,460
It costs much less than that $16,000 too,

870
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,700
so it's already a great deal.

871
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,500
And it's got the world's best security.

872
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,740
Just ask them.

873
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,540
They've included phrases like decentralized economy

874
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,740
in the advertising, decentralized apps, clouds,

875
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,060
or I'm sorry, cold storage wallets,

876
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,700
and a decentralized app store, as well as

877
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,620
their own cryptocurrency.

878
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,500
And that's right, it doesn't use Bitcoin,

879
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
doesn't use any actual established cryptocurrency.

880
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,380
It uses their own tokens.

881
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,500
And then users can trade tokens on their own blockchain.

882
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,500
It has a dedicated firmware for verifying wallet transactions.

883
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,860
It has supposedly intrusion protection.

884
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,180
It has a decent Qualcomm chip with six gigs of RAM

885
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,380
and 120 gigs of storage.

886
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,020
But the most interesting thing about this blockchain powered

887
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,620
phone is it has a secondary two inch display, which

888
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,340
slides up from the body of the phone,

889
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,380
like some of those new cameras we've seen on a few phones,

890
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,260
that is your wallet display.

891
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,220
So you can check your balances in your wallet

892
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,980
without having to wake up your entire phone.

893
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,300
Oh my, wow.

894
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,140
Maybe it's just an extra heat sink

895
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,340
when it does all the crypto mining in the background

896
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,860
for you.

897
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,300
It's definitely an extra heater.

898
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,860
That little screen probably, I could just

899
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,300
see it sliding down and failing to turn off and warming up

900
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,860
the back of your phone, which warms your battery

901
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,980
and decreases battery life.

902
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,180
It's a brilliant idea.

903
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,180
You also didn't mention that it has a notch every once.

904
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,980
So don't worry, the notch is there.

905
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,620
Yes, it does.

906
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,540
I somehow missed that.

907
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,820
I must have blacked that out.

908
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,740
So HTC might be the ones to pull this off then.

909
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,460
So they're coming out with the Exodus.

910
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,140
And no, it's not an Exodus of HTC's customer base.

911
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,260
It's the name of their next smartphone.

912
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,860
And they really, really need this thing to pay off.

913
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,460
They announced it back in May.

914
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,780
And I kind of made a little murmur about it.

915
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,140
But now, this week, we've got some details.

916
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,180
And it's not looking good, in my opinion.

917
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,900
It appears we can expect their blockchain-powered phone

918
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,380
from HTC at the end of this year.

919
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,620
And the price, although they wouldn't commit,

920
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,460
will probably be around $1,000 for this, too.

921
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,260
They envision a phone where you hold your own keys,

922
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,860
your own identity and data.

923
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,940
Your phone is the hub.

924
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,740
That was what they said back in May.

925
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,340
But now, they're kind of walking that back a little bit,

926
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,940
that whole stuff about your identity and keys.

927
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,220
That's not so much in the first model.

928
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,060
But the first model will have a wallet.

929
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,540
And it'll come with CryptoKitties, a crypto game

930
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,620
where you play with crypto cats on your screen.

931
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,940
Can I ask a question?

932
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,420
What does blockchain-powered actually mean?

933
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,260
Oh, yeah, that's a completely reasonable question, Alex,

934
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,300
and one that you would think that they

935
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,880
would have a very solid answer to,

936
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,860
since they're basing the entire messaging around that.

937
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,940
Well, you see, it's going to have a cryptocurrency wallet

938
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,020
that will, quote, be the most secure hardware

939
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,460
wallet out there.

940
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,700
He also hopes that by trading virtual cats,

941
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,660
it'll encourage gamers and people

942
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,100
who are less familiar with cryptocurrency

943
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,300
to try out the phone.

944
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,460
They think it's going to be the most approachable thing

945
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,940
on mobile for the non-crypto crowd,

946
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,020
even though the crypto crowd is the only people that

947
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,340
ever be interested in buying this.

948
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,220
So they don't really talk about how it's a blockchain phone,

949
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,860
other than it can have a wallet on it.

950
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,980
They wanted it to be like the storage of your driver's

951
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,340
license or whatever, like whatever identity information

952
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,500
you'd have.

953
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,000
But of course, that would take wide-ranging government

954
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,700
support, and nobody's going to do that for HTC.

955
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,100
I'll tell you what blockchain-powered means.

956
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,740
It means we go high up in the Google search results.

957
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,660
That's what it means.

958
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
This is so sad.

959
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,780
This is really sad to see this happening.

960
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,720
And there's a trend.

961
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,100
A lot of companies are just relaunching and just

962
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,660
putting blockchain in the name.

963
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,340
And like Kodak did that.

964
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,920
Obviously, now Kodak's pulling back on their plans.

965
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,420
That's kind of one of the famous ones.

966
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,620
And just today, I saw a news story

967
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,580
go by saying that Kodak's basically

968
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,660
screwing the pooch on that.

969
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,140
So here's their idea.

970
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,780
It's a conflicted message.

971
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,260
HTC hopes to build an Android phone with all of this Bitcoin

972
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,020
wallet stuff baked in.

973
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,820
But of course, I would fundamentally argue

974
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,900
that if you're shipping Android, especially with the Google

975
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,940
apps pre-installed, that automatically disqualifies it

976
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,220
as the world's most secure hardware wallet,

977
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,820
automatically, especially when it

978
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:09,020
has a hardware wallet with an always-on cellular modem that

979
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,380
runs a firmware that we have no control, no insights, no even

980
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,020
insights into what it's doing at all, not even,

981
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,940
let alone source code.

982
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,700
Just you're not even aware of what it's doing at any point.

983
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,780
That, by its very definition, makes

984
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,340
this an insecure hardware wallet.

985
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,260
So they're blowing it.

986
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,920
They're blowing the very premise.

987
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,500
And then they have this mixed message.

988
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,100
Like Chen here says that they think

989
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,720
that the niche market of 30 million Bitcoin wallet users

990
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,180
is their demo.

991
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,740
But then early on, he says, but we're

992
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,340
bundling CryptoKitties because we're

993
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,940
hoping to convince gamers to try out a Bitcoin blockchain

994
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,700
wallet phone.

995
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,900
So are they targeting gamers?

996
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,840
Or are they targeting Bitcoin users?

997
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,420
Because neither group is going to take this thing seriously.

998
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,620
Nobody gives two shits about CryptoKitties.

999
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,420
And no Bitcoin enthusiast is dumb enough

1000
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,940
to think that an always-on, Google-connected,

1001
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,900
cellular modem-powered hardware wallet is secure.

1002
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,780
No Bitcoin enthusiast is going to buy that.

1003
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,240
Don't print out your keys anymore

1004
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,540
and put them in secure storage.

1005
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,580
Just use your phone.

1006
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,860
It's fine.

1007
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,300
I'd love to think that after the craziness that

1008
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,740
was last December, January, that people

1009
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,420
have learned their lessons about crypto and blockchain.

1010
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,460
And it's not a way to make a quick buck.

1011
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,460
But things like this makes me think

1012
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,500
that maybe people are more gullible than we

1013
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
give them credit for.

1014
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,340
Yeah, I think also it's just one more way

1015
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,620
they can try to get you to buy into their, oh,

1016
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,440
use our currency on our chain to buy media from our apps

1017
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,100
and purchase things in this weird little private community.

1018
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,780
Right, yeah.

1019
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,460
Who is the target market?

1020
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,180
People with money, that's who.

1021
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,620
I'm really, I am such a hypocrite about this topic.

1022
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,140
Because I completely agree, creating their own cryptocurrency

1023
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,340
feels so cheap.

1024
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,100
It feels so basic.

1025
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,620
But then at the same time, I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

1026
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,940
man, I really wish cryptocurrencies had gotten

1027
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,820
more traction in some ways.

1028
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,420
I don't mean Bitcoin should be $20,000 a coin.

1029
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,300
But I wish there was a healthy, legitimate cryptocurrency

1030
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,500
ecosystem.

1031
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,980
Because the idea of open source money is a good one.

1032
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,140
Well, it's coming.

1033
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,020
There are some customers that I'm

1034
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,780
aware of that are working on all sorts of blockchain things.

1035
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,220
And there was a house sale ledgers in Northeast US

1036
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,300
somewhere that someone sold a house

1037
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,260
and recorded those house sales on the ledgers.

1038
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,380
So they're coming.

1039
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,940
But it's just not as crazy as we've all thought.

1040
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
I agree, it is coming.

1041
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,700
And what we're seeing right now is the leg

1042
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,380
as businesses build their products and research markets

1043
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,140
and stuff like that.

1044
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,780
We're just in the leg of that, I think.

1045
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,900
But just it'll take time for legitimate, trusting brands

1046
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,000
to build products around this technology

1047
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,780
and then market in a way that customers will accept.

1048
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,000
But where I was going with that is

1049
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,140
I think it could have gotten better traction faster and more

1050
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,100
usable amongst open source projects.

1051
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,500
I really saw there was a potential avenue there

1052
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,300
where there could have been a way for,

1053
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,700
I mean, this is really dumb.

1054
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
But just because this is off the top of my head,

1055
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,200
so I hadn't really thought this out.

1056
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,420
But I imagine if, I don't know, let's just pick Solus.

1057
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,180
Let's say Solus had a package in their app center.

1058
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,660
And it was the Solus donate package.

1059
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,540
And I click that.

1060
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,500
And I install it.

1061
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,140
And it spends the evening.

1062
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,660
And I set it a small, minimal, but approachable

1063
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,060
UI where I have a little slider.

1064
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,940
And I say, dedicate three hours of CPU time a day to Solus.

1065
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,300
And I run it.

1066
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,940
And it keeps a little system tray icon.

1067
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,180
It lights up when it's going.

1068
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,600
It lets me know what's happening.

1069
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,660
And maybe back, bake in even some cool stats there, maybe.

1070
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,260
So I can see some chart numbers, make a pool,

1071
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,500
and have a Solus pool, and have all of the Solus distribution

1072
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,220
users who go into the app center and choose to install this,

1073
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,260
and choose to dedicate a certain amount of CPU time

1074
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,380
to the project, all automatically join a pool,

1075
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,900
and have that revenue go towards the project.

1076
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,420
It could be a sustainable model that

1077
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,180
scales with the distribution as it grows.

1078
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,900
And it could be something that they promote.

1079
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,020
They say, hey, if you want to support Solus,

1080
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,500
install it, and launch that miner for us,

1081
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,580
and be completely upfront.

1082
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,500
But instead, it has a negative connotation now.

1083
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,980
It's seen as more like spyware and malware,

1084
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,780
like a browser toolbar.

1085
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,100
And I think that was a really missed opportunity,

1086
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,660
because it's something that a technical audience would grok.

1087
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,260
It's something that one thing that people are experimenting

1088
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,540
with is crypto mining in the web browser.

1089
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,060
But legitimately, you go to a project's website,

1090
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,500
and you press a button.

1091
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,900
And you say, donate some time.

1092
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,220
And it just runs while you have the browser open.

1093
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,620
It's not hidden.

1094
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,060
It's not sneaky.

1095
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,900
It's a user opt-in thing.

1096
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,100
And then all of a sudden, you're donating something

1097
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,020
to the project.

1098
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,260
I really don't feel like it's any different than people

1099
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,980
who seed torrents for weeks at a time,

1100
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,780
and donate gigs and gigs of bandwidth to projects

1101
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,660
by seeding torrents.

1102
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,500
Or they mirror infrastructure, and set up FTP mirrors,

1103
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,320
and donate their server bandwidth.

1104
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,100
I see it as a similar thing.

1105
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,820
But it could have been that.

1106
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,020
But instead, it's turning like this negative association.

1107
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,380
Am I crazy, Wes?

1108
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,180
No, I mean, it seems like another symptom of all the hype

1109
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,500
before things are very useful.

1110
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
Because I think this discussion has been pretty spot on.

1111
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,500
It's not there yet.

1112
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,980
We've seen a lot of false claims.

1113
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,700
But the technology itself is interesting,

1114
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,620
and certainly does have some use cases,

1115
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,900
and will probably lead to some exciting things in the future.

1116
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,980
But everyone's just soured.

1117
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,360
Everyone's burnt out on like, I've

1118
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,020
been overly hyped, I've had all of these web pages trying

1119
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,220
to steal my CPU time.

1120
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,260
I just don't want to have anything to do with it.

1121
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,380
And I think it's a long, slow march of showing real deliverables

1122
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,340
before people's attitudes start to turn around again.

1123
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,540
Maybe it will over time.

1124
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,300
A lot of people lost a lot of money.

1125
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,500
That's one way to get burnout.

1126
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,540
Yeah, that sours people too.

1127
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,580
Right.

1128
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,740
All right, well, let's talk about the Atari VCS.

1129
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,100
It's sort of struggling for credibility right now as well,

1130
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,140
especially after a pretty brutal trolling by the register.

1131
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,180
So Rob Wyatt, the system architect for the Atari VCS

1132
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,300
project, did a FAQ.

1133
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,020
And I want to go through just a couple of them.

1134
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,540
Real quick reminder, Atari VCS is a Linux powered Atari console

1135
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,580
that's coming out next year.

1136
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,180
And I backed it.

1137
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,840
I backed it so that way I can talk about it on the shows.

1138
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,340
I backed it because after going through it,

1139
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,980
I think they have something here.

1140
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,720
And I think what they're trying to pull off

1141
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,740
is not insurmountable.

1142
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,860
And one of the things that I really

1143
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,700
appreciate about the Atari VCS project

1144
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,340
is they looked at the Ouya specifically,

1145
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,740
that little Android cube, and said, well, how did that fail?

1146
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,860
And why did that fail?

1147
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,820
And then they said, OK, let's not do that.

1148
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,180
And I think that is, I think, a really good starting

1149
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,220
point of lessons learned.

1150
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,780
So Rob here answers various questions

1151
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,100
that I can only presume he created himself and then

1152
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
asked himself, which is always a little awkward.

1153
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,480
Or maybe they were really legitimately frequently asked.

1154
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,020
But he gives us some details on the VCS hardware specs.

1155
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,060
The Atari VCS hardware will be powered by an AMD Bristol Ridge

1156
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,420
family APU with Radeon R7 graphics.

1157
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,860
And they're going to add eight gigabytes of RAM, which

1158
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,180
is more than the original amount they're going to add.

1159
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,580
And he does note, yes, that means

1160
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,500
this is not going to be a Ryzen family board.

1161
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,700
But they did the math.

1162
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,380
They ran the tests.

1163
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,260
And they said increasing the cost

1164
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,740
and increasing the thermal ceiling for a Ryzen

1165
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,940
APU that couldn't run at full performance because

1166
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,300
of the thermal ceiling didn't net an appropriate amount

1167
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,720
of performance increase.

1168
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,020
It was a marginal improvement.

1169
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,560
And so they figured that cost would

1170
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,900
be better spent on adding more RAM to maximize bandwidth.

1171
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,780
And then that benefits everybody all the time

1172
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,780
because now the RAM, I believe, is,

1173
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,500
I guess you call it unified.

1174
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,000
And I know some people were upset about that.

1175
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,660
That seems completely reasonable to me,

1176
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,700
especially for the types of games

1177
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,460
you're going to be playing on this thing.

1178
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,460
So that leads the question then to development.

1179
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,980
So will there be development hardware?

1180
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,940
And he answers, you won't need development hardware.

1181
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,380
Any Atari VCS device will be a development kit.

1182
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,060
To get an application in the Atari store,

1183
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,220
there will be a few technical requirements and rules

1184
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,460
as to what is permissible, as with other curated stores.

1185
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,780
Atari is a neutral partner.

1186
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,580
And we have no say in what applications get developed

1187
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,120
or when an application gets released.

1188
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,460
You are free to develop any application you like,

1189
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,260
as long as it fits the guidelines.

1190
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,740
There is no developer program that is open yet.

1191
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,380
But there will be one that comes online in the coming months.

1192
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,880
And if you have an application in mind, you can start today.

1193
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,820
And I love this part by making sure it runs on Linux

1194
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:56,780
at a high resolution using a standard runtime libraries.

1195
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,740
And then you're pretty much good to go.

1196
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,740
The changes from that to what they

1197
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,980
are going to be calling Atari OS will

1198
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,980
be minimal and mostly related to application startup

1199
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,740
and packaging.

1200
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,780
So Atari OS will be based on Linux

1201
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,700
with a modified Linux kernel.

1202
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Now, you remember, they're also going

1203
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,940
to allow you to load your own OS, they claim.

1204
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,260
They have an open platform and a sandbox for that.

1205
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,380
So say you want to run XBMC, something like that.

1206
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,340
They specifically talk about this in the FAQ and mention

1207
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,140
that.

1208
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,560
So the way they're going to do this

1209
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,420
is they're going to have the Atari Secure

1210
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,040
Hypervisor, which is probably KVM.

1211
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,900
And they'll have all this stuff, all of the core stuff

1212
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,060
for this in flash memory.

1213
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,660
And before the Atari loads, any external storage device

1214
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,340
that is checked for a bootloader file, if it's bootable,

1215
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,860
the Atari VCS will boot that device instead.

1216
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,300
So you can hook up external USB storage.

1217
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,980
And if it detects it and it's got the right type of boot setup,

1218
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,660
it'll work.

1219
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,860
They don't have a typical bootloader like Grub

1220
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,580
because they have the CPU in protected mode

1221
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,100
and they have their own firmware to check

1222
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,700
for the other OS drive.

1223
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,660
And they're going to release example code on how

1224
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,340
to do all of this, they say.

1225
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,620
And they're going to release a demo OS, the boots

1226
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,460
on the Atari VCS, that's based on a standard Ubuntu image.

1227
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,900
So how is this thing going to compare to the NVIDIA Shield

1228
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,700
TV, in terms of power and everything else?

1229
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,460
Well, the NVIDIA Shield is an ARM platform, right?

1230
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,540
So this is an i6-86 platform, so there's that aspect to it.

1231
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,260
So that's kind of nice.

1232
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,340
But yeah, and it's going to have newer graphics, more

1233
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,660
capable graphics.

1234
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,380
So it should be, in some ways, more competent.

1235
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,860
But of course, the NVIDIA Shield now

1236
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,380
has multiple years on the market.

1237
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,660
If they do even half as good of a job as NVIDIA have done,

1238
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,700
then they're on to a winner.

1239
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,820
And that box, damn, is beautiful.

1240
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,460
Yeah, it looks good, right?

1241
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:57,960
Yeah.

1242
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,420
And by the way, when you load the, quote, other OS,

1243
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,380
you'll get access to the hardware.

1244
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,300
The hypervisor setup in a way where you get raw access

1245
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,740
to CPU, GPU, memory, audio, USB.

1246
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,060
Oh, wow.

1247
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,340
So that's not bad.

1248
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,860
And then you just reboot, unplug it,

1249
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,580
and you're back in Atari OS.

1250
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,500
They say they have test hardware running.

1251
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,880
They have different prototypes.

1252
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,740
So they have crazy, ugly, wires everywhere,

1253
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,620
doesn't fit in a box prototypes.

1254
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,660
And then they have prototypes of the hardware mold,

1255
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,540
but with no motherboard in there and stuff.

1256
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,260
But I think it's pretty cool.

1257
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,020
I think it's a decent solution.

1258
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,580
I know there's a lot of skepticism around this.

1259
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,900
People really think they've screwed the pooch here.

1260
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,280
But I think what they're trying to pull off is achievable.

1261
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,960
The hardest job they have, outside from the hardware,

1262
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,700
which is achievable, because they're

1263
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,580
working with all known good quantities here.

1264
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,460
They know the thermals and all this stuff.

1265
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,420
They're working with the Linux kernel.

1266
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,620
They've got all of that that they bring with it,

1267
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,500
including all of the networking, all of that

1268
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,420
that they don't have to invent themselves.

1269
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,720
Now they just have to manage to stuff a Bristol Ridge APU

1270
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,180
into this little case, which they've already figured out

1271
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,680
the thermals.

1272
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,860
That's why they rejected the Vega or the Ryzen stuff.

1273
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,540
So they're obviously monitoring that.

1274
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,140
And then they've got to write their UI, which they've already

1275
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,180
got art mockups for.

1276
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,980
And I'm not saying writing a UI is hard.

1277
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,820
But let's be honest.

1278
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,820
It's writing a television UI is, as far as UIs goes,

1279
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,260
much simpler than creating a desktop UI or even a phone UI.

1280
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,620
All this is achievable.

1281
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,740
No, I think you're right.

1282
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,300
They have a lot of the basics there.

1283
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,900
They just have to actually deliver on all the goods.

1284
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,100
I wonder, too, is there any chance

1285
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,300
that this will be something people who haven't heard

1286
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,100
of Atari would be at all interested in?

1287
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,180
Or is it really only a retro market

1288
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,980
for those of us old enough to have fond remembrances

1289
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,780
and who also are interested in open source technology?

1290
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,520
To anybody listening, I highly recommend

1291
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,500
going and reading the Medium article on this in the show

1292
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,260
notes.

1293
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,780
There's a wonderful description about how

1294
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,900
Sony made loads of missteps not giving people GPU access,

1295
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,860
how Microsoft made missteps allowing XBMC to be installed

1296
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,060
on the original Xbox.

1297
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,780
It's fascinating.

1298
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,420
I highly recommend going and reading that.

1299
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,340
Yeah, I agree.

1300
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,680
We have a link, linuxunplugged.com, slash 258.

1301
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,700
And I hope Atari pulls it off, not just because I backed it,

1302
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,700
but because every time somebody's tried to do this,

1303
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,780
like I just mentioned the Ouya, but there's been others.

1304
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,360
I mean, going back to the Boxee Box,

1305
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,100
really, every time somebody's tried to do this,

1306
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,300
they've gotten so close and just missed the mark.

1307
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,540
And I'm not saying that they are hitting the mark,

1308
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,020
but I think they're close.

1309
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,020
They're like really close to hitting the mark.

1310
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,540
And I think the fundamentals are there.

1311
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,260
And the stuff where they're going to miss

1312
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,580
is going to be content partnerships

1313
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,880
or the applications.

1314
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,700
But all of that can be added after the core product ships.

1315
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,200
It has a lot of potential, especially

1316
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,060
because what you get these days for a decent price

1317
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,460
is fully capable of playing HD video.

1318
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,260
It's fully capable of playing HD games.

1319
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,340
I mean, most people are going to be hooking this up

1320
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,460
to a 1080p display.

1321
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,700
Right, exactly.

1322
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,620
So I think if they get all the other little bits right,

1323
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,180
it could work.

1324
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,420
Speaking of a lot of bits to get right,

1325
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,520
Purism has an update on the Librem 5.

1326
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,580
This is their 15th progress report.

1327
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,420
And so this is not looking good as far as I'm concerned.

1328
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,020
I really appreciate their hard work.

1329
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,180
I think their laptops are really banging these days.

1330
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,460
And I'm really glad they're keeping us updated.

1331
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,500
But every red light is going off that I could possibly

1332
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,220
think of for this.

1333
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,780
So this is kind of understandable.

1334
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,460
But let's start with this one.

1335
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,100
The dev boards have slipped.

1336
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,500
They were supposed to ship in June.

1337
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,580
That was the projected ship date.

1338
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,260
And the current rough estimate they have now is August,

1339
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,060
so next month as we record this.

1340
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,220
But they're going to have more details as that firms up.

1341
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,060
When these things happen, there's red flags, though.

1342
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,540
They had certain issues, like getting

1343
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,460
all the information available to what

1344
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,860
appears to be possible builders, information like the camera,

1345
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,420
wireless, the battery, how the buttons work,

1346
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,380
those kinds of things.

1347
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,020
So those weren't finalized and ready yet.

1348
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,140
But that's understandable.

1349
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,660
Yeah, that's early days, and you got to get things rolling.

1350
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,020
The other thing that I'm pretty concerned about

1351
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,200
is if you remember from the specs, for those of you who

1352
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,940
don't, they promised to build in around the iMX8 development

1353
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,440
board.

1354
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,520
That's the actual phone.

1355
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,460
It's got a little bit faster of a processor.

1356
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,940
Still a MediaTek, but it's a little bit of a faster one.

1357
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,900
However, after some experimentation,

1358
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,020
they've learned that there's basically

1359
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,940
very little support for getting actual Linux working

1360
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,780
on the iMX8 board right now.

1361
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,620
Very basic mainline Linux kernel is possible,

1362
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,780
but drivers, like display driver and all that stuff,

1363
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,220
it's not happening right now.

1364
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,340
So all of their development images

1365
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,740
are based around an older board, the iMX6.

1366
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,340
That's what's in the hardware team.

1367
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,100
That's what the image they've built around.

1368
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,980
Now, they believe that they can use this

1369
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,380
to kind of get things rolling.

1370
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,440
And then once the iMX8 boards are onboard and working

1371
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,500
with the Linux kernel a little better and the drivers,

1372
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,980
they can do work to shore up the gap between the iMX6 and the 8.

1373
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,860
But I don't know, Wes, building all of this stuff

1374
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,940
around one version of the CPU and board

1375
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,780
and then trying to up right before a release or something,

1376
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,940
doesn't that sound like potentially disastrous?

1377
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,820
What do I know, though?

1378
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,900
It's a hard game.

1379
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,420
I mean, this is just a hard space

1380
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,780
to be in in trying to get this all right

1381
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,700
and still make a good release time

1382
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,860
and have something that is really well battle tested.

1383
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,360
You're right.

1384
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,780
I think that's a tall order.

1385
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,200
I don't know that it's impossible.

1386
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,620
And I think the people over at Purism

1387
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,820
have done some pretty incredible things in the past.

1388
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,460
So I wouldn't put it past them.

1389
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,620
It does make me a little nervous.

1390
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,300
Yeah.

1391
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,260
Yeah, maybe they can pull a real rabbit out of their hat.

1392
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,180
You might be right.

1393
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,180
I really want Purism to succeed.

1394
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,620
But wasn't Purism the one where you

1395
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,420
had a laptop without a fan that worked and all the rest of it?

1396
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,300
The fan worked.

1397
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,140
The fan just never stopped working.

1398
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,900
And they did a make good.

1399
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,580
And they sent me a working one.

1400
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,420
And that's one thing that gives me a little hope,

1401
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,140
to tell you the truth, is I had a really early version

1402
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,900
of their laptops.

1403
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,220
And then I had the third crack at it.

1404
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,820
And there is noticeable improvement in the unit.

1405
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,340
Right.

1406
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,460
I mean, it seems like they care about this stuff a lot

1407
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,620
and take it very seriously.

1408
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,460
It's really just the limitations of physics and the universe

1409
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,920
that are the most threatening here.

1410
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,420
Yeah.

1411
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,300
Plus, then there's the software stack,

1412
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,140
which I'm really uncomfortable with.

1413
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,800
If they had me in there as a consultant,

1414
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,340
I would be pushing hard against this.

1415
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,100
Because they're writing to, well, they're

1416
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,940
writing or contributing, trying to contribute code upstream,

1417
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,340
to create their own whaling client.

1418
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,540
So you have Posh, or however you say it, Posh.

1419
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,300
And you have WL Roots.

1420
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,740
WL Roots comes from Sway, which that's good heritage there.

1421
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,940
But they are trying to contribute things to that,

1422
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,980
too, to make it work.

1423
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,980
And Posh, or Posh, is sort of their creation.

1424
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,500
That's the shell that will be running on top of Whalen.

1425
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,660
Their GTK shell is Posh, or Plosh,

1426
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,180
however you freaking pronounce it.

1427
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,820
Because they've made up a word.

1428
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,320
Now I'm just sitting here, and I'm a dumbass on a microphone,

1429
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,740
trying to say it for the first time.

1430
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,940
So this is all getting work to try to support the D-Bus API.

1431
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,140
They're trying to get Redshift to work.

1432
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,620
They're doing a bunch of groundwork

1433
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,300
that would already be done if they

1434
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,860
were, say, using Plasma Mobile.

1435
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,740
And so they're having to create work.

1436
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,820
Epiphany is going to be the phone's default web browser.

1437
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,140
I couldn't think of a browser I'd least

1438
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,060
like to have on my mobile phone.

1439
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,860
But I guess they don't have any other choice.

1440
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:41,420
They've kind of got an XMPP mobile messenger working.

1441
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,140
And they say down here in a footnote

1442
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,740
that their collaboration with the Plasma community

1443
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,980
continues.

1444
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,900
They have some flat packs of Plasma software

1445
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,620
for their architecture now.

1446
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,700
And they're actively investigating a Plasma image

1447
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,460
for the iMX6 board as well.

1448
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,180
So what gets me, the real red light here is,

1449
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,780
if in case it wasn't clear, is they're building things

1450
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,800
like libhandy-gtk.

1451
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,980
They're creating a keyboard and a phone dialer in GTK,

1452
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,660
like a full phone interface.

1453
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,540
They're trying to patch a version of Mutter

1454
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,180
to work on their phone.

1455
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,420
And they're creating their own GTK-based shell.

1456
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,900
They're not using Gnome shell.

1457
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,140
They're creating their own.

1458
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,820
And they're using a CPU and board

1459
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,860
that will not be the final CPU and board that they ship.

1460
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,180
None of this is unbelievable and just completely untolerable.

1461
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,420
It's like, OK, I can kind of see the logical reasons

1462
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,140
for all of this.

1463
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,580
The hardware wasn't ready.

1464
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,460
You don't think the other software stacks it.

1465
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,100
You want to build something you own.

1466
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,100
I can kind of get all of it.

1467
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,780
But I'm thinking that Q1 2019 ship date

1468
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,460
is slipping at this point.

1469
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,740
This is a massive investment.

1470
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,480
And Wes, I suspect it's one of those things

1471
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,700
where you don't know what you don't know until you start it.

1472
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,300
If I knew how much work it was to do podcasts

1473
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,220
and to do broadcasting and live shows,

1474
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,460
I never would have done it.

1475
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,020
You don't know until you start.

1476
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,940
And it's always those last minute details

1477
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,140
that suddenly you couldn't have planned for because you

1478
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,660
didn't think or couldn't have known

1479
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,060
that it was going to be a problem.

1480
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,720
And then it's three days before you need to happen.

1481
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,220
And you realize, oh, yeah, no, this

1482
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,240
has a higher failure rate than we expected, or whatever it is.

1483
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,340
And suddenly, the whole world falls to pieces.

1484
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,380
Yeah, I really want this to succeed.

1485
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,220
And I wonder, and I kind of want to toss this

1486
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,500
to the Mumble Room.

1487
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,140
Popey, I'm going to maybe ask you.

1488
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,740
Dan, I'd like to ask you too.

1489
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,060
Alex, I'd like to get your take on this.

1490
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,580
If this bombs, maybe they ship something,

1491
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,620
but it never takes off, or they never even ship it.

1492
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,740
If this doesn't work, is this concept

1493
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,620
of a crowdfunded, all-free phone dead?

1494
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,860
Does it die here?

1495
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,440
Well, speaking as someone who worked for a company who tried

1496
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,420
to do this, the whole concept of building on one device

1497
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,180
and then switching to another device later in the cycle,

1498
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,260
fingers crossed that it'll work.

1499
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,940
It will take way more time to do that switch

1500
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,020
than they can possibly imagine.

1501
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,820
And they will need a long lead time

1502
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,000
to do all the necessary hardware enablement and conversion

1503
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,460
to this new device.

1504
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,340
It won't be like sticking a USB key in a new laptop,

1505
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,820
and the same software will just work on this.

1506
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,100
History has taught us that does not work.

1507
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:30,020
And so when we were building on the lowest end hardware

1508
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:34,300
that we could, like the Nexus 4 and the BQ 4.5,

1509
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,840
we had an eye to the future, and we

1510
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,340
knew there were other devices coming.

1511
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:43,780
And we had those on site flashed with Ubuntu Touch.

1512
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:49,300
So we had access to the devices, and we couldn't make that work.

1513
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,140
Now, neither could Firefox with Firefox OS.

1514
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,020
And Tizen isn't a blazing success on phone.

1515
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,340
It's certainly way more successful than Firefox

1516
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,620
or Ubuntu Touch ever was.

1517
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,380
So maybe Purism aren't the right people to do this.

1518
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,700
I don't know who is.

1519
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,580
Yeah, that's why we need this to work.

1520
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,940
Dan, what do you think about this from a project standpoint

1521
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,820
even?

1522
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,320
I started looking at this from a project management standpoint,

1523
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,980
and it starts to make me cry a little bit.

1524
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,620
I don't know.

1525
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,340
I talked to some of these guys at WADEC,

1526
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,820
and I think, like you said, they have

1527
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,860
a lot of reasons for the things that they're doing,

1528
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:31,100
especially stuff with, like, GNOME Shell isn't really set up

1529
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,020
to work as a mobile shell.

1530
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,300
But they're actually making a lot of headway

1531
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,560
as far as trying to make GNOME applications more responsively

1532
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,300
designed, doing some interesting things there.

1533
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,660
And actually, we're showing off some concepts they have

1534
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,940
and talking to different people, and there's designs

1535
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,420
they're trying to push upstream.

1536
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,620
And I've seen some patches landing in Epiphany

1537
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,180
to this end.

1538
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:01,780
So like you said, I don't know how realistic Q1 2019 is,

1539
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,460
because I could tell you out of anybody

1540
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,260
that deadlines are hard.

1541
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:06,940
Yeah.

1542
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,140
It's totally unrealistic.

1543
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,820
They're not Google.

1544
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,500
They're not Apple.

1545
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,420
They're not Microsoft.

1546
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,500
They don't have enough.

1547
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,240
I mean, you look at what Microsoft did,

1548
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,860
and they failed spectacularly with Nokia.

1549
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,780
They just don't have enough clout, I'm afraid.

1550
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,540
Is the goal mark here maybe not a successful phone

1551
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,500
in the market, but is perhaps the goal post for us

1552
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:34,260
improvements to GTK and making GNOME and the GNOME desktop

1553
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,860
even more modern?

1554
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,060
Some of this may remain.

1555
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,460
This upstream work they're doing may

1556
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,200
persist regardless of the success of the phone.

1557
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,860
And either way, we'll have purism to thank for that.

1558
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,300
I'm not sure.

1559
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,980
We got a lot of flack when we got

1560
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,380
innovative commerce distracted by Ubuntu phone,

1561
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,180
and the desktop took a backseat.

1562
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:02,220
I don't see how GNOME can improve by being,

1563
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,860
I'm not saying core GNOME developers are

1564
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,540
going to get diverted by this, but I

1565
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,460
don't see how core GNOME can get made better

1566
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,260
by a phone project that may not even come to fruition.

1567
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,980
They're going to come back to the desktop

1568
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,540
again after that, are they?

1569
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,580
Quick question, Popey.

1570
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,140
How many people worked on a Ubuntu phone versus,

1571
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,060
I don't know if anybody knows, how many people

1572
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,500
were working on this Librem project?

1573
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,300
Well, a significant chunk of the company, at the time

1574
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,060
the company was, I don't know, 800 people.

1575
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,420
So there was a fair chunk of people

1576
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:41,180
across many disciplines, like Harbor Enablement, Qt, OpenGL,

1577
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,460
QML, Qt, like people with many, and then

1578
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,380
the general infrastructure stuff,

1579
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,700
people building build systems.

1580
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,860
There was a ton of people.

1581
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,660
It was more than 100 people working on it at its height.

1582
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,780
That's a lot of people.

1583
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,540
Wow.

1584
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,580
Yep.

1585
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,980
I think that a phone is just such a high bar for just

1586
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,100
an even minimum viable product that people will even consider

1587
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,780
putting in their pockets.

1588
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,540
And even if you get all the pieces right

1589
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,140
and build a perfect mobile OS, then you

1590
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,300
don't have an app ecosystem.

1591
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,620
And what are people going to do on this phone?

1592
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,820
Look at the Essential phone.

1593
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,860
That was a beautiful piece of hardware,

1594
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,780
but it went nowhere.

1595
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,620
Yeah, if you're not in every carrier store,

1596
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,620
you're never going to get mass market adoption.

1597
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,300
Now, maybe that's not the goal.

1598
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,620
And even if you get just the tech audience,

1599
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,340
I don't mind having a couple of extra, maybe less useful

1600
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,660
devices at home, but I'm not going

1601
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,580
to carry a second phone around if it

1602
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,820
doesn't meet all of my needs.

1603
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,980
That's what I was thinking is, how fricking

1604
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,820
bad ass would this be if we were just dominating some tablet?

1605
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,140
We had a great tablet workflow.

1606
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,700
I hear a lot of Apple users talking

1607
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,660
about using the iPad Pro, and there was talk

1608
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,380
of convergence forever ago.

1609
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,220
But I just would love to be able to pick up,

1610
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,060
say, three or four market tablets out there

1611
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,860
that I could go get, like you would

1612
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,220
get from a community project that's supporting

1613
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,860
a small range of hardware.

1614
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,900
And what I get is a complete kickass hardware and tablet

1615
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
experience where I have multiple windows.

1616
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:13,900
I can multitask.

1617
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,820
I can do real work, and I could even maybe hook up

1618
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,660
a USB device somehow to this thing,

1619
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,580
and it's got the whole Linux USB stack inside there.

1620
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,260
Really, I think what I'd kind of like,

1621
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,340
the more I talk about this, is just a really, really great

1622
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,900
Surface Book-focused Linux distribution

1623
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,540
where you could just go get the latest Surface Book.

1624
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,740
Isn't that just a laptop, what you've just described?

1625
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,460
Yeah, yeah.

1626
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,460
The tablet thing is there is something

1627
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:43,020
about when you're at home, you're watching TV,

1628
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,100
or it's the weekend, and you want

1629
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,580
to consider yourself not working,

1630
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,080
but you just want to stay connected.

1631
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,180
A tablet is that extra level of casualness.

1632
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,300
And the ARM processor and its long battery life

1633
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,860
contribute to that, so I don't know if a Surface Book would

1634
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,180
actually do it.

1635
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,300
And I'd like it to be Linux-based.

1636
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,740
I'd like it to have a bash terminal.

1637
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,460
But I really have no interest in a phone.

1638
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,260
I really don't.

1639
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,740
I would be more likely to go get a basic bitch, no feature

1640
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,900
phone, and some flip phone with a week-long battery life,

1641
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:18,460
and then just have a tablet and a laptop.

1642
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,260
And I know that's not a huge market,

1643
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,500
but I feel like there's probably a few people listening

1644
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,940
nodding their head right now, probably going,

1645
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,660
that's how I do it.

1646
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,420
I just do it with Android, or I just do it with iOS already.

1647
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,260
And I tried when I went to System76

1648
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,260
for their Superfan event.

1649
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,180
I tried only bringing a tablet, and I

1650
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,100
ended up having to use computers at System76.

1651
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,340
It's interesting.

1652
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,460
My boss often turns up to work with only a tablet,

1653
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
and will do everything just for the tablet.

1654
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,140
Won't even have a Bluetooth keyboard.

1655
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,020
He will just have a tablet and does everything,

1656
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,620
from documents to joining us on Slack

1657
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:01,500
to having meetings with people in Hangouts, everything.

1658
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,900
He just uses a tablet.

1659
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,020
Must have some fast thumbs over there.

1660
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,380
He dictates to us.

1661
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,300
He delegates.

1662
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,860
Oh, OK.

1663
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,700
We have minions.

1664
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,900
Maybe that could work too.

1665
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,140
That's what I got to do, Wes.

1666
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,580
That's just what I got to do.

1667
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,580
I'll have somebody else use my Android phone.

1668
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,860
I thought you were training Dylan

1669
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,100
to fill that role for you.

1670
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,980
Right.

1671
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,820
Yeah, I need Dylan following me around carrying my phone for me

1672
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,700
and then relaying messages.

1673
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,340
You know what?

1674
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,980
That's probably the solution I need.

1675
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,520
Well, while we're talking about phones,

1676
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,780
why don't we take a break and thank

1677
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,780
Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1678
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,460
You can go to linux.ting.com to take $25 off a device

1679
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,260
or get $25 in service credit.

1680
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,940
Ting would work great for this solution

1681
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,460
that we were just talking about, by the way,

1682
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,060
because you can just buy a SIM card.

1683
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,700
Sometimes they have crazy deals too.

1684
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,980
Right now, even when they're just like regular price,

1685
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,700
they're $9.

1686
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,020
And there's no contract.

1687
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,180
So why not?

1688
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,500
It's like you can buy it and then

1689
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,700
activate it when you need it.

1690
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,740
So for example, we had an Android tablet

1691
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,180
that had just been sitting around forever.

1692
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,500
And I had a SIM.

1693
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,060
And I just thought, you know what?

1694
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,460
We're going on a trip.

1695
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,300
Why not pop it in there and have it?

1696
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,980
Why not?

1697
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,840
Then it's one less Wi-Fi situation

1698
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,620
I have to worry about when I'm traveling.

1699
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,740
Why not do that?

1700
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,700
And then when I get home, I can log in and turn it off.

1701
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,340
And then we have to talk to a human being.

1702
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,700
You just pay for however much you talk, text, and data

1703
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,380
you use with nationwide coverage.

1704
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:27,180
And they have CDMA and a GSM network and no contracts,

1705
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,100
no other termination fees.

1706
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:33,340
The average Ting bill is like $23 per phone per month.

1707
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,060
That's it.

1708
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,140
And they've got a great control panel.

1709
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,460
They've got a ton of devices.

1710
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,460
You can bring your own.

1711
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,260
Or you can go get a device directly from them.

1712
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,820
They've got a bunch of the really good Moto phones, those

1713
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,740
ones that are like a super great value

1714
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,780
and have pretty much a clean Android implementation

1715
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,460
with just a couple little actually kind of nice tweaks.

1716
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,940
Those Moto phones, I think, don't get talked about enough.

1717
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,840
And so Ting, though, Ting knows what's up.

1718
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,740
So they've been expanding their lineup.

1719
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,580
So go check that out.

1720
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,540
If you go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off.

1721
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,620
They're also giving away a Moto Z2 Play

1722
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:08,300
with the attachable camera that basically turns it into a DSLR.

1723
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,200
And they're also giving away a Sony Alpha A6000.

1724
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,120
I have details linked in the show notes

1725
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,420
if you want to check that out.

1726
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,940
Or just go to linux.ting.com and then visit their blog.

1727
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,420
They're doing a Ting Summer Giveaway.

1728
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,500
It's pretty sweet.

1729
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,940
So big thank you to Ting for a long time support.

1730
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:27,620
Actually, you know what I just realized?

1731
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,420
And I don't know if I've ever mentioned it.

1732
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,560
Ting has been such a big supporter

1733
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,060
of the Unplugged program.

1734
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,900
Ting became a sponsor before we ever

1735
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,980
launched our first episode.

1736
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,540
They said, you know what?

1737
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,580
We love what you guys do.

1738
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,940
We love being on the Linux stuff.

1739
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,980
We love the Linux audience because they're smart

1740
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,060
and they get the value of Ting.

1741
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,420
Where they have to really educate average consumers that

1742
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,380
just buy into the duopoly stuff all the time,

1743
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,700
they really have to teach them.

1744
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,500
That's a big part of their marketing effort.

1745
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,820
But with the Linux crowd, you guys

1746
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,740
understand what a text message is and data is.

1747
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,180
So it's a great audience.

1748
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,340
They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll sponsor.

1749
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,220
Yeah, absolutely.

1750
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:02,820
We'll sponsor.

1751
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:05,020
So they've been a sponsor on the Unplugged program

1752
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,060
from the very beginning.

1753
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,180
And we really appreciate it.

1754
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,900
Go to linux.ting.com to keep them going and keep us going.

1755
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,860
And also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean,

1756
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,140
do.co slash unplugged.

1757
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,620
do.co slash unplugged is where you

1758
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:22,100
go to get a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account.

1759
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,700
do.co slash unplugged.

1760
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,060
You've got to go there to get the $100 credit

1761
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,620
and then try out DigitalOcean.

1762
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,580
You can use it for 60 days with that credit.

1763
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,260
They have industry-leading price to performance.

1764
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,820
They have machines that are killer.

1765
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,980
My favorite system has 4 gigs of RAM, two CPUs,

1766
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,220
80 gigabytes of space, 3 terabytes of transfer,

1767
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,780
and it's $0.03 an hour.

1768
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,900
It's just crazy.

1769
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,140
They got optimized droplets.

1770
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,600
It's what we're using for our PeerTube instance, which

1771
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,900
is crushing it.

1772
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,340
Also, we've run a lot of our backend stuff

1773
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,660
up on DigitalOcean because they just have great uptime.

1774
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,180
They have a 99.99% uptime.

1775
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,340
That's fantastic.

1776
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,380
They got Cloud Firewalls.

1777
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,140
I was just seeing on Reddit some noob was having a hard time

1778
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,060
with his DO droplet.

1779
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:01,620
He's like, I don't understand.

1780
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,340
I'm getting this traffic here.

1781
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,540
I'm like, go to the Cloud Firewall and just block it.

1782
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,740
It just blocks it at the network level

1783
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,040
before it even hits your droplet.

1784
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,860
It's sweet.

1785
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,540
They have monitoring and alerting baked in

1786
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:10,780
that you can turn on.

1787
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,300
Great DNS management.

1788
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,340
You point the name servers to DigitalOcean,

1789
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,180
and then you can just start assigning subdomains

1790
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:16,980
to your droplets.

1791
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,420
And I have a whole system.

1792
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,340
I've got subdomains and domain names

1793
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,860
for my personal droplets.

1794
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,160
Of course, I've got a system for the Jupyter broadcasting.

1795
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,940
Droplets, and they're crazy fast.

1796
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:30,460
They got 40 gigabit connections coming into those hypervisors.

1797
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,340
Data centers all over the world, and then

1798
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,940
every single instance, regardless

1799
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,340
of the $0.03 an hour or the one that's

1800
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:45,180
like a monster with like 64 gigs of RAM, 32 dedicated CPU cores,

1801
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:48,500
9 terabytes of transfer, you know that one?

1802
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
They're also all enterprise-grade SSDs,

1803
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,700
from the $0.03 an hour up to that guy.

1804
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,980
In fact, you can even go in there

1805
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,620
and do the, they have these new flexible droplets.

1806
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,900
You can tweak and mix and match resources.

1807
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,660
You can go crazy with the RAM.

1808
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,060
They have even more configurations than that.

1809
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:04,740
Let's see here.

1810
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,060
Do they list on the website?

1811
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,940
Yeah, so here's a droplet for you.

1812
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,740
196 gigabytes of RAM.

1813
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,700
How about that one?

1814
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,380
32 CPU cores.

1815
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,260
Oh my god.

1816
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,540
Maybe that will run Gnome.

1817
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,220
Yeah.

1818
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,780
Yeah, Mudder's going to repaint real quick on that one.

1819
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,660
Oh boy, isn't that something?

1820
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,820
So they've got a whole range of hardware.

1821
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,060
And they've just recently launched tons of updates

1822
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,260
to the tutorial section.

1823
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,860
I mean, for days and days now, they've

1824
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,060
been releasing new tutorials.

1825
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,660
So there's tons of new docs, which you don't have

1826
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,060
to be a customer to read it.

1827
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,980
I don't know if Crazy Digital Ocean knows this,

1828
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,820
but they're giving this stuff away for free.

1829
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:50,180
And they just posted a great VPN setup guide using StrongSwan.

1830
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,660
And StrongSwan is an IK2 VPN server

1831
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,060
that gives you a whole UI to manage users and revoke keys.

1832
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,140
And it's slick.

1833
01:11:59,140 --> 01:11:59,900
StrongSwan.

1834
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,700
And they have an introduction to setting up

1835
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,500
StrongSwan on 18.04 and then getting your clients set up.

1836
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,300
They walk through.

1837
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,580
It's a seven-step process.

1838
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,260
But by the end of it, you've configured the VPN client

1839
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:14,300
on a Windows or Mac or phone and connected it

1840
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,540
to your droplet running StrongSwan IPsec VPN.

1841
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,620
This is killer.

1842
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,940
I love their documentation.

1843
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,060
It's so well done.

1844
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:28,020
Everything Digital Ocean does has a bit of a design touch

1845
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,780
to it, from their dashboard to their marketing

1846
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,900
to even the guides.

1847
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,460
It's just so clean.

1848
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,260
And they also release something every quarter

1849
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,760
called Digital Ocean Currents, where

1850
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,180
they surveil their customers without them knowing.

1851
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,100
No, actually, they just were sent out a survey

1852
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,760
and say, hey, what programming languages are you using?

1853
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,380
What desktop environment are you using?

1854
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,140
What server technologies are you using?

1855
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,740
And then they answer, and then Digital Ocean takes all

1856
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,260
the results, collates them, and puts them in their currents.

1857
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:52,900
And it's great.

1858
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,700
And I covered it recently on Coda Radio,

1859
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,860
and you can find it on their website, too,

1860
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,860
if you're curious about trends and containers and programming

1861
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,780
languages and just sort of where the market is going.

1862
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:04,100
Because Digital Ocean customers, again,

1863
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,020
are a little more cutting edge.

1864
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,580
So they are a good indicator audience.

1865
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,460
And that's why I really appreciate those currents.

1866
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,620
And then last but not least, another from the beginning.

1867
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,660
Linux Academy has been a sponsor of Jupyter Broadcasting

1868
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,940
since 2014.

1869
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,140
That is a really long time in this business.

1870
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,220
I'm really proud of that, because it's a great fit.

1871
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,180
The Linux Academy goals and our audience

1872
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,940
are like a perfect lineup, because they

1873
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:39,300
are so dedicated to the students, it's obnoxious.

1874
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,600
So much of what they talk about around here, it's great.

1875
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,980
It really is great to hear it.

1876
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,900
It's one thing to see it online, but then it's

1877
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,700
been a totally another thing to be here and be at that summit.

1878
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,900
The effort and the expense of flying all these people out

1879
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,460
and putting them up in the hotel room is enormous.

1880
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,660
And the reason they're doing it is to keep a remote team working

1881
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,420
well and cohesive and help people build relationships,

1882
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:04,940
which is massive to a functional setup like this,

1883
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,620
where people are all remote.

1884
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,380
They really invest in these people.

1885
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,980
But what I've learned being down here,

1886
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,980
and you've never asked me to tell you about this,

1887
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,140
but it is the truth, is there is a ginormous staff

1888
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,620
of real experts in this stuff.

1889
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,900
These people that are here, the Azure people

1890
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,020
are from Microsoft.

1891
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:27,540
The OpenStack people are from Red Hat, on and on.

1892
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:31,300
The AWS folks are coming in from all over the place, really.

1893
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,460
But they've got people here from Amazon.

1894
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,620
And it's interesting.

1895
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,560
It's a very competitive environment for the folks

1896
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,420
that work here, because when you are really high up

1897
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:47,180
in those fields, your skill sets are in demand.

1898
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,220
So that has been an interesting thing to watch, too.

1899
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,340
And so Linux Academy tries to treat their people really well

1900
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,940
here, because some of these course authors

1901
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,660
are really in demand.

1902
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,260
And that is a massive investment they

1903
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,820
have made to keep these people happy,

1904
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,420
keep their team working together,

1905
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,820
and keep them turning out content, which

1906
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,580
is a massive job.

1907
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,620
These last two weeks, they've launched over 75 new courses

1908
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,900
and challenges and learning activities.

1909
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:12,980
And they're not done yet.

1910
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,220
That's one of the reasons I'm still down here,

1911
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,620
is we're doing another little release this week.

1912
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,380
And then there's two more, which I don't know if I'll stay for,

1913
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,340
next week.

1914
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:26,940
Plus, they're doing a hardware giveaway of this Ansatel 1,

1915
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:31,380
which is this monstrous red, like rocket red,

1916
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,500
box that you can take cloud images and run them locally,

1917
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,740
and then send them up to different cloud instances,

1918
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,060
like AWS and Digital Ocean.

1919
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,340
It links it all up, and it's a super cool learning tool.

1920
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,700
And it's going to fit really well

1921
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,740
with a new feature the Linux Academy has in development

1922
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,740
right now, that once it's done, we

1923
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,860
will be obvious why this is such a cool box.

1924
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,440
And so they're doing a giveaway on their live stream next week.

1925
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,100
I may or may not be here for that one,

1926
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,220
but you can go to linuxacademy.com slash live

1927
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,420
if you want to learn more about that.

1928
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,060
That is just a thing, man.

1929
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,940
I tell you, that box is this really neat appliance idea

1930
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,060
that I've seen different companies take a crack at.

1931
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,980
And the Ansatel 1, you can go look it up.

1932
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,820
It's like a $700 box, but it's great for learning.

1933
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,180
It's just so awesome.

1934
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:19,660
Also, I don't know what Anthony's Twitter handle is.

1935
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,820
Off the top of my head, I'll go look it up for you.

1936
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,900
He's giving away exam vouchers on Twitter.

1937
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,500
And that is, you don't have to be a Linux Academy subscriber

1938
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,380
to get those.

1939
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,940
He's just Anthony D. James on Twitter

1940
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,100
if you want to follow him.

1941
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,540
He's doing giveaways from time to time, Anthony D. James,

1942
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,460
at Anthony D. James on Twitter.

1943
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:45,340
And he's giving out LPIC exam vouchers and things like that.

1944
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,980
So also not a bad way.

1945
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,260
Because really, think about it.

1946
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,260
You're not competing with thousands of people.

1947
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,220
You're competing with a couple hundred at most,

1948
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,640
maybe 30, 40, 50 people, depending on when he does it.

1949
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,140
So if that's something that would maybe be a break for you

1950
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,940
and really help you out, go follow him.

1951
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,500
Because I think he's got like 40 of them to give away

1952
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,180
or something.

1953
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,660
He's got a lot.

1954
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,740
I don't know how many he's going to give away on Twitter.

1955
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,140
But he's just got a whole batch of them

1956
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,460
that he's going to be giving away.

1957
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,460
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged is

1958
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:12,700
where you go to learn more about them and support the show

1959
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,980
and get a free seven-day trial.

1960
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,500
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

1961
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,540
And yeah, thank you, Wes, for posting that there in the IRC.

1962
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,180
That's a good deal.

1963
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,100
Those are not cheap, those exam vouchers.

1964
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,620
So it's a pretty nice deal.

1965
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:28,140
Yeah, that's awesome, especially if you're just getting started

1966
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,940
or want to really come in back to the field

1967
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,020
and want to really feel like you know what you're doing.

1968
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,220
That's a great way to start.

1969
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,820
So a couple of app picks.

1970
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,260
Everybody loves command line apps.

1971
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,100
So how about an RSS reader for the command line?

1972
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,460
It's called NewsBoat.

1973
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,360
And it's a pretty snazzy text-based RSS reader.

1974
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,500
It's sleek.

1975
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,340
It also supports Atom feeds, of course.

1976
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:47,940
And it's meant to run in the console.

1977
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:52,860
And it is a fork of newsbateur, which

1978
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,980
is how I used to pronounce it.

1979
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,500
So that's how I pronounce it now.

1980
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,740
And it looks pretty nice.

1981
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,980
It's pretty straightforward.

1982
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,420
It's kind of what you'd expect.

1983
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,300
And it has a configuration file that's easy.

1984
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,580
And it's in the Debian repo.

1985
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,220
If you want to install it on vanilla 1804, it's NewsBoat.

1986
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,060
So just apt install NewsBoat.

1987
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,700
And you can read news articles on the command line.

1988
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,900
Actually, not as ridiculous as it sounds.

1989
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,020
Actually, no.

1990
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,780
I was going to say, I've kind of shied away

1991
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,940
from RSS readers in recent months.

1992
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:24,820
Really?

1993
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,860
But really?

1994
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,820
I mean, I don't know that I would use it for everything.

1995
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:30,440
But this could really be sort of useful,

1996
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,980
especially I think I'm like, oh, yeah, I've got some tests running.

1997
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,140
And I'm waiting on some output of some program.

1998
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,780
I'll just pop this open real quick, check on a couple things,

1999
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,940
do some show research.

2000
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:39,860
Might be handy.

2001
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:42,300
Actually, it's also got an additional feature.

2002
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,540
It can download podcasts.

2003
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,220
Oh, good catch.

2004
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,020
Really?

2005
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,780
Nice.

2006
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,460
Yeah.

2007
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,300
Good catch.

2008
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,420
You know, where I really hit my power stroke

2009
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,060
with automated messages from servers

2010
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:55,900
was when I came up with different systems

2011
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,160
to dump it all into RSS feeds.

2012
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,860
And I got them out of my inbox.

2013
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,140
You know, like cron jobs that have output or a backup report

2014
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,060
and stuff like that?

2015
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,540
Got them into different systems that

2016
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,140
would convert them into an RSS feed

2017
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,900
and then put them in an RSS reader

2018
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,540
so I could just check on all of my cron job

2019
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:16,140
reports and backup reports as part of my daily news routine.

2020
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,820
And that was a next level hack I did.

2021
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,860
I really liked that.

2022
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,780
Oh, that's clever.

2023
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,180
I imagine that would help you kind of see things that stood out

2024
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,880
as well, rather than having to sort through an inbox.

2025
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,240
You get like legitimate chains of related content.

2026
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,160
I was trying to keep this to be a short episode,

2027
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:32,340
but I got to side rail us here because you don't use RSS.

2028
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,500
You cast a pretty wide news net.

2029
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,060
Like when we do our link dump, you got a big list of links.

2030
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,860
I thought for sure you must be doing RSS to collect all that.

2031
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,420
You know what?

2032
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,380
Surprisingly not.

2033
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,460
I mean, it's not like I haven't ever done RSS.

2034
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,460
Just lately, I haven't been that happy with any

2035
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,460
of the particular readers.

2036
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,760
So I've just kind of fallen off.

2037
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,100
And I obviously have indexes and other lists

2038
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,940
I keep of places to check.

2039
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,380
So it's sort of just a hacky manual system.

2040
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,460
It's really in need of some more automation.

2041
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,660
Well, to keep us on the tech space train,

2042
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:06,220
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu calls out Browse, I guess,

2043
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:06,940
is how you say it.

2044
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:12,660
Browse, B-R-O-W-S-H. And it is a modern tech space browser

2045
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,500
built for the command line.

2046
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,620
And it's pretty great because unlike links,

2047
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,440
it supports JavaScript.

2048
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,580
It supports WebGL content.

2049
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,340
It supports photos.

2050
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,060
The only hard requirement is you do

2051
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,860
have to have a version of Firefox on your system.

2052
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,780
Browse uses Firefox to fetch the web pages

2053
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:37,500
and then passes the necessary bits via a web extension

2054
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,780
so it can then render it in low-fi glory in the terminal.

2055
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,540
So I guess you just got to leave Firefox

2056
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,200
for on somewhere, Wes, and then set this all up,

2057
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,080
and you're good to go.

2058
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,940
Have you seen the images it renders?

2059
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,860
It's pretty rough.

2060
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,380
It is pretty rough.

2061
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,960
But one interesting thing I saw, too,

2062
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,060
is they have a way that you can actually

2063
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,180
view it on the web as well.

2064
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,720
So you could almost just use it as a way

2065
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,220
to take some sites that were way too complicated

2066
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,580
or full modern web and turn it into something a little older.

2067
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,100
Yeah.

2068
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,100
Yeah, it's great.

2069
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,300
I kind of want to do that.

2070
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,660
That's sort of a cool look.

2071
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,820
That's pretty awesome, though.

2072
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,860
I mean, I think that's probably we're

2073
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,440
not going to be able to beat that for AppPix for the day.

2074
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,320
So we'll stop there.

2075
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,460
But Browse.

2076
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:21,500
And you can get it at brow.sh, B-R-O-W-S-H.

2077
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,340
I will also say they have a call out here.

2078
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,340
It's early days for the project, so you're probably

2079
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,040
going to find some pages that don't work.

2080
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,540
But don't despair.

2081
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,540
I think if this is going to ever get really good,

2082
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,500
it's important for people to go submit URLs.

2083
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,960
They have a way to do that on their GitHub repo

2084
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,660
so you can get better support for the sites

2085
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:37,820
that you actually want to visit.

2086
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,420
Nice.

2087
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,840
I would say we could end it there,

2088
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,500
but I do have to ask the question, what

2089
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,820
happens when Linus quits?

2090
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,660
This got on my mind because after Joe and I finished

2091
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,100
Linux Action News, where we covered Python's leader

2092
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,860
stepping down and sort of what led to that,

2093
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,580
Joe and I were talking off mic.

2094
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:58,220
And afterwards, they're off recording and still on mic.

2095
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:02,140
What happens if Linus rage quits one day?

2096
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,260
I mean, you can tell the job is stressful at times.

2097
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:08,700
And you've got to figure he's going

2098
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,060
to get to a point where he's going to put his hands up and go

2099
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,940
either very happily say, I'm done.

2100
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,740
Thank you, everybody.

2101
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,460
I've had a great time.

2102
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,420
I'm passing the torch.

2103
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,860
I wish you all the best.

2104
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,880
Or there could be a time where he tells everybody

2105
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,060
to go F themselves, and he signs off the internet

2106
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,380
and never comes back.

2107
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,180
But either way, what happens when Linus retires?

2108
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:38,580
And where does that role shift?

2109
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:42,440
And is that something that we even need to worry about?

2110
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,940
These are all the questions that have been floating in my head.

2111
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,540
So let's break it down a little bit.

2112
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,200
Does anybody in the Mumber Room actually

2113
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,140
know what the official handover process is for the Linux kernel

2114
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,580
when Linus moves on, when he retires?

2115
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,660
We're not saying he dies.

2116
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,460
He retires.

2117
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,980
Maybe he gets acquired.

2118
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:05,180
Yeah, Microsoft buys Linus out.

2119
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,740
I mean, right now, he's employed by the Linux Foundation.

2120
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:13,060
So my assumption has been that the Linux Foundation would

2121
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,180
sort of manage that.

2122
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,980
So I did a little research, because I didn't

2123
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,420
know the answer to this.

2124
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,980
So I did a little digging around.

2125
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:27,340
And what I found is a post by Linus on the mailing list

2126
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,100
forever ago.

2127
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,460
And he says, not everybody reads every post in the Linux kernel

2128
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,020
mailing list.

2129
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,500
In fact, nobody expects to have time left over

2130
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,720
to actually do any real kernel work.

2131
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,660
We'll even read half of it, except for maybe Alan Cox.

2132
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,100
But he's actually not human.

2133
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,500
But 1,000 gnomes working in underground caves

2134
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,660
are powering Alex Cox.

2135
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,260
None of the individual gnomes read all the postings either.

2136
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,980
They just work together very well.

2137
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:53,060
So if there's one person he might pass the role to,

2138
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:56,940
people speculate it could be Alan Cox.

2139
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,180
There's also been discussions, I found, online

2140
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,900
where there's a group of people that they would probably

2141
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,660
pass the torch to.

2142
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:07,860
It looks like someone had asked Linus at an event.

2143
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,180
And the way that Linus described,

2144
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,420
although there isn't a transcript of it, at the event,

2145
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,220
was that over time, he would start

2146
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,060
to make a slow transition to different people.

2147
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,780
So he would essentially break his role out.

2148
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:23,620
And then others would begin sort of filling those spots.

2149
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,540
And then they would start vetting other people.

2150
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,660
And it would just sort of spread out from there.

2151
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,180
In the end, he said the result would be better

2152
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,460
for Linux in the long term.

2153
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,500
Rather than having one person who gets overwhelmed

2154
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,180
by vetting everything, it would be spread out

2155
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:39,860
into a process that could scale, which would probably

2156
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,580
be better for Linux in the long term.

2157
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,620
So Linus himself didn't seem to be too worried about it.

2158
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,500
As long as there's the case that he doesn't get hit by a bus

2159
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,460
and then we're left in a little more chaos,

2160
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,260
I imagine it'll be kind of like what Guido seems to have done,

2161
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,580
and an announcement of retirement or whatever else,

2162
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,220
and then a slow fade as things are doled out.

2163
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,720
And the community, I imagine, would naturally sort of step up

2164
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,660
and some rules would be established.

2165
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,460
Maybe it starts off with one person doing most of it,

2166
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,760
and that gets further delegated.

2167
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,100
Maybe it's eight people that are all just taking it piecemeal.

2168
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,260
Now, it might be a good idea, as that gets closer,

2169
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:14,820
to have some more formalized stuff.

2170
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,540
I do really like the way, for instance,

2171
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,940
the FreeBSD project is managed and have

2172
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,300
an actual organization responsible for this.

2173
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,980
Maybe it'll go that way long term.

2174
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,560
It would be nice to have some maturity,

2175
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,980
even if it's not really a problem

2176
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,940
that we expect to have right now.

2177
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,620
I have a question.

2178
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,140
On a day-to-day basis, I mean, this

2179
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,660
might be an obvious question, but what does Linus actually

2180
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,380
do?

2181
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:39,640
He did a recent interview where they asked him what he did,

2182
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,740
and he said, my job is mostly very boring.

2183
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:46,540
And he says they're reading emails and processing

2184
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,460
pull requests and doing admin.

2185
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,020
So it's mostly admin.

2186
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,900
Yeah, exactly, and facilitating communications.

2187
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,700
My vote would be go to Greg KH.

2188
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,660
I've only had two opportunities ever to talk to the man,

2189
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,660
but really just really respect him.

2190
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,580
And I think he's really level-headed,

2191
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,580
and he really seems to stick with stuff.

2192
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,240
So Greg KH would be high on my list.

2193
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,580
Somebody better step in, though.

2194
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,900
I think we do need a leadership role.

2195
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,660
I feel like you do sort of need somebody to sometimes push

2196
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,280
things through.

2197
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,300
And if it's not Greg or Alan Cox,

2198
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,140
you know it's going to be Lenard Pottering,

2199
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,580
and you know it's going to be Colonel D.

2200
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,540
And he'll announce a fork.

2201
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,580
It'll be Colonel D. It'll be System D, Colonel D,

2202
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,260
and Lenard will control the entire stack.

2203
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,700
Oh, finally, a unified stack of the future.

2204
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,620
Yeah, you know what?

2205
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,380
Lenard, I love you.

2206
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,060
I'm just kidding.

2207
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:34,860
It would be great.

2208
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,780
It would probably be a good stack,

2209
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,780
and we'd finally, finally have a decent API.

2210
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:43,500
Go get more Mr. Popey over at the Ubuntu podcast.

2211
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,740
He's over there doing his thing.

2212
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,700
A new episode is just around the corner.

2213
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,260
Go get more Wes.

2214
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:52,660
He's on the TechSnap program at TechSnap.systems.

2215
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,700
Shout out to the Mumble Room for making it this week.

2216
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,820
Really appreciate you guys.

2217
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,500
If you'd like to join the Mumble Room,

2218
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,740
go to irc.geekshed.net, and you can do pound mumble in there,

2219
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,900
and you'll get all the info.

2220
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,000
Or just Google search Jupiter colony mumble setup,

2221
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,220
and you'll find a guy.

2222
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,780
It's absolutely magic.

2223
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,620
Hey, did you know this show is live on Tuesdays,

2224
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,420
and you can join us.

2225
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,500
Get it converted in your local time zone

2226
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,580
at jupiterbroadcasting.com.calendar

2227
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,700
and jblive.tv for the live stream.

2228
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,060
Saying thanks for being here, and you know what?

2229
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,060
See you next Tuesday.

2230
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:40,680
Bye!

2231
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:59,740
You know, the real question, Chris, is what happens when you, when you resign?

2232
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,740
That's the real question.

2233
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,940
I'm going to, are you kidding?

2234
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,220
I'm going to be broadcasting until the day my mouth quits working.

2235
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,660
I can't help myself.

2236
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,500
I get antsy if I take a couple of days off.

2237
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,460
It's good for my sanity to keep going.

2238
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:21,500
Unless, unless I could go live on a big piece of land, maybe a ranch somewhere, park the

2239
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,500
RV.

2240
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Oh, ranch style.

2241
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,700
And then just start a small colony there.

2242
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:44,860
And then I, and then I, and then I might be happy to.
