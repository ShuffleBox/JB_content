1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you listening?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,740
Introducing sound beaming you hear the audio others don't without headphones

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:15,320
When you are inside of the bubble you get the sound the volume the immersiveness of it and where you outside of it

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,240
You can you cannot get it. Sometimes you can hear a little bit of noise

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,880
Sometimes you you hear there's something going on beside you

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,080
But you don't get the volume and don't get the immersiveness of the sound experience. You don't need

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,580
To tell the device where you are. It's not streaming to like one exact place. It it follows you wherever you go

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,420
So it's personally for you follows you place what you want

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,080
inside your head

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,140
It's sound beaming West and it's just as cool as it possibly could be

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,780
It's a futuristic audio technologies from Novito systems and on Friday

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,100
They'll debut a full-fledged desktop device. It sits right there on your desk and

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,300
Beam sound into your head noodle from wherever you are without headphones

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,780
Yeah

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,780
It uses a 3d sensing module and locates and tracks your ear position sending audio via

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,860
Ultrasonic waves to create sound pockets right by your ears

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:23,340
What's interesting is you can make me heard in stereo or a spatial 3d mode that creates 360 degree sound around the listener

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,340
So it's like headphones with surround sound. I think this is something you're gonna have to hear to believe but it it is so Star Trek

19
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,200
It's awesome. You should try listening to Linux some plugs

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Hello friends and welcome in to episode

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,920
380 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,520
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,620
Thousands of hands-on labs get certified get higher get learning at a cloud guru

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,960
Dot-com episode 380 is up

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,280
It's fresh and it's another Sunday edition of the show where West and I for the last time for at least

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,160
For the foreseeable future are recording ahead and we have kind of a special show for you today

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,600
This is one of those episodes where we attended some events and took notes

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,320
So you don't have to and we'll come back with a fresh report on some Linux events from over the weekend

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,160
We're gonna tell you what's going on with a Mac story and how it impacts Linux users and why it makes Linux the best

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,800
OS ever of course and then right here. I've been working on it. Oh gosh, it's big

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,400
It's really it's a huge machine, but beautiful

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,840
I had to wait until the honeymoon period was over so I could give you the full honest review of the Dell Precision

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
5750 mobile

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
workstation

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,280
People say this kind of stuff all the time, but this is legitimately a Macbook killer

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,320
this is Dell going right after the Macbook with chamfered edges and everything and I'll tell you how it stacks up and

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,440
What you need to know about it and how much it costs for a configuration like this and while you're distracted

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm gonna sneak it into my bag. I don't blame you one bit

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,240
But before we get into the community news the pics that we have and all of that

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,100
I want to say time appropriate greetings to our mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello. Hello

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,480
We got 14 folks in there today because it's a Sunday and they had a huge

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Love blog going earlier today with some jellyfin developers in there and we'll tell you more about that in a little bit

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,720
This is like the this is the post show to the love plug this week. Really it is

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,200
Yeah

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,660
So this weekend and late last week two pretty significant

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Linux community events were going on the Linux application summit and

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,960
Seagull did you get a chance to go to Seagull much? Yeah, just a little bit

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll probably check out more talks after the fact. There was just too much going on

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,900
Yeah, and Seagull had like a three track thing going on too. So I kind of had to pick and choose constantly

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah, a lot of good talks. Yeah, it was nice to see it

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,600
You know, they've this has been a which we'll talk more about in a little bit

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
but this has been a real thing this year is

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
how the heck to move all these

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
events virtual and

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,280
Various degrees of success for different ones and the Linux application summit has been building and building now for a few years

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,480
So this is when we were watching with interest took place November 12th through the 14th 2020 and there's lots of talks

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,520
We'll link you to as much as we can

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,840
For Onyx also has a rundown but to give you a kind of a taste a sense of the flavor

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,880
This is Alexi poll who we have had on the show before. It's the keys the KDEV president and he was he was talking about Wayland

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,800
but he's talking about it from not an end-users perspective, but he's talking about it from a

61
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,280
Developers perspective how developers can target their applications and write applications for Linux that use Wayland

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,960
Everyone please give a warm virtual round of applause for Alish who will be talking to us about Wayland for app developers

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,880
There's no applause. So insert applause here. Okay, thank thanks everyone for the virtual round of applause. It was virtually great

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,120
All right. So for the talk today, I thought that

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Instead of talking about

66
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,280
Things that are happening, which is what I generally talked about because I am a developer. I thought

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
well

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,260
What will developers care about when they start developing their applications?

69
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,320
And he goes through a lot of the different history and things to consider there

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,940
But I think I'm gonna jump right to my favorite talk if you'll allow please do permit

71
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,160
My favorite talk like a lot of these talks did unfortunately, but it's how these virtual events go right now

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,640
My favorite talk does start with a bit of an awkward

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,180
Introduction. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening and namaste everyone

74
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:57,780
My name is Dakshit Vaishnavi Dogra and now I invite mr. Greg Hartman who goes by at GregKH on Twitter

75
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm definitely sure that is that there is no need for an introduction

76
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,900
So ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for mr. Greg Hartman. All the best

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Okay, is that working now I

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Hope so

79
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm doing great. I have construction happening right below me

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,180
So we might hear some drilling in the background, but hey, this is the joy of working from home in the situation

81
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,820
These virtual conferences. They're always a bit, you know, like a zoom meeting and there's no way around that

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,060
In some sense you feel a little closer and in other senses, it's a little harder to watch

83
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,900
Yeah, it is. So Greg gives his own introduction, which is probably a little bit better than my introduction

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,020
I like to introduce him as the commander Riker of Linux. A little bit about me since they didn't introduce me

85
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,120
I've been a kernel developer for way too long. I used to be a embedded developer before that. I maintain stable kernels

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I have done a lot of user space work

87
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,520
But at the low level I also maintain some user space packages

88
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,820
I will make fun of gnome later

89
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,240
But let me tell you I have been an advisory board for them for many years and I'm still a foundation member

90
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,920
And I've worked on lots and lots of different districts. We'll get to that gnome stuff in a little bit because I actually thought it

91
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Was pretty poignant but he wanted to bring lessons that they've learned as a kernel team

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,560
To the app summit audience, which is all made up of a lot of developers what you do and how you act on

93
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,620
Creating code depends on who you are and I'll break everything down into about three different groups here. I'm kernel developers

94
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,840
um, this audience is not kernel developers, but since I am one I'll talk about what we've learned and how we've made mistakes and what

95
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,480
We've learned from that and how to apply it again to library developers and application developers

96
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Which is the primary audience here now the full talk has some really good insights

97
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,020
But I think you probably agree with me West because I know you watch this one, too

98
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,440
There was one thing he really wanted to drive home with this talk and that is never ever

99
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,880
Ever break user space whenever possible. It's the kernels number one rule. You've probably heard it before he lays it out a little bit here

100
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,880
So first off kernel developers is easy thing

101
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,820
We only have really one rule and Linus gets mad at this whenever you see rants in the press or whatnot

102
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,960
this is when we do not we break this rule and the rule is we cannot break user space and

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Cannot break user space on purpose

104
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,160
Um break it accidentally. We'll fix it. Whatever. We break user space if nobody notices

105
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,240
That's fine because we're we take advantage of things that when you don't notice different functionalities or stuff

106
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,640
But you just can't break user space. It's such a developer thing to say we break it when no one notices

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,960
So he he's mentioned this before you've heard probably Linus say this or read it if if you've been around for a little while

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
You know, this is a big rule of theirs

109
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,280
but I bet you may not know why they're why they believe it so strongly and I'll tell you what it wasn't exactly what I

110
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,240
Was expecting and Greg explains and we make this rule and other operating systems have this rules

111
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,560
Well, it's a very solid rule because we always want you to operate

112
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
And we want you to upgrade without worrying about it

113
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,880
We don't want you to feel scared if we got a new you see in the release and we say hey this fixes a bunch of

114
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,480
Problems, we don't want you to feel worried about taking that and that's really really important

115
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,400
Especially with security you want people to take all these fixes you want people to be able to upgrade you want them to also take

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,760
advantage of the new features and if you have them even hesitate about updating to your latest version

117
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,980
Because they you've broken functionality for them. They won't and that's not okay. So that's why

118
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,360
Because he want they the kernel developers want you to feel confident in upgrading

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,280
Yeah, I think he really hits on you know, there's a lot of trust here

120
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,440
You're only gonna keep using something and keep getting the latest versions if it has a history of working and you feel like there's respect

121
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,080
On the developer side for what you're trying to do and not just what's easy for the developers

122
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,200
It's a it's a hard learned lesson for the kernel team, too

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,560
I mean

124
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,160
There's only a few Linux users out there and when you have the rapid pace of development that Linux does you really do have to be

125
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,840
thinking about

126
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:12,240
What makes it safe for the users to upgrade what prevents them from upgrading and you see this in some commercial spaces, too

127
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
where

128
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,840
There is sort of this mean that goes around that iOS users always update and iOS's

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,340
Users are based or stay current place compared to Android, right?

130
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,720
But the reality is Wes because I seem to recall that actually took quite a hit when they released

131
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
I think it was iOS 7. I can't remember. It was a pretty dramatic UI change and

132
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,120
their upgrade rate dropped

133
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,320
Significantly dropped way off and then it's slowly slowly slowly rebuilt over time

134
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,400
Same for me with fedora, right?

135
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,040
I over time after after about 10 releases of having a successful upgrade

136
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,560
I'd pretty much just upgrade immediately now. I feel pretty safe about it. Right? You've built that trust with them over the time

137
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,300
Yeah, and so I connected with what he was saying there

138
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,620
But that just wasn't what I expected the reason for that number one rule of never breaking user space now

139
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,640
What can developers do when they need to make change because sometimes you're in a situation where your users don't want change

140
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,060
But for whatever reason change has to happen

141
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, Greg has advice for that too

142
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,840
But what we can do is we can evolve things over time so that nobody actually notices

143
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,920
We can move to different ways things happen. We can do different things how stuff that

144
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,000
Works and we can provide new ways of doing things and we provide new ways of doing things

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Hopefully people will migrate over time in reality. They don't they stick to the old stuff, which is fine

146
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,800
but we can provide new ways and this is how we constantly evolve and how we constantly move forward and

147
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,600
This is how you survive because you have to change with the world. So you have to provide new functionality a lot of people

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I get this complaint a lot from a number of people have been in the IT and the computer industry for a long time saying

149
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Well, how is Linux succeeding? It's an old model. The old Unix POSIX model is obsolete

150
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,840
We shouldn't be doing this anymore. And the problem is

151
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,880
In one way Linux supports that they support your binaries from 20 years ago from 25 years ago

152
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
You can still run really old

153
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
BSD

154
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,800
Applications you rebuild them and they work or you can run your application that was built 20 years ago and it still works

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
So people think Linux is stagnated

156
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,080
but in reality we've created new functionalities right next to the old functionalities and

157
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,840
That you can do different things. You can take advantage of stuff. We have eBPF which is taking over the world

158
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,560
It's a microkernel like architecture. You can run user space programs on the kernel

159
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,820
You can do all this fancy stuff proven that you can't lock up the kernel wonderful stuff

160
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,600
IOU ring is fast asynchronous IO in a different way that has ever been done before and it's again sitting right next to the old

161
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,760
POSIX model so that your old programs can work just fine

162
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,640
But new programs can take advantage of stuff and take advantage of speed increases

163
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Of course Linux now is a real-time operating system

164
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,960
It's been real-time operating system for a while without a tree patch

165
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,720
Those changes are almost all merged. That's something people said could never possibly be done

166
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,160
But yet we did it right next to the existing operating system and nobody noticed

167
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,880
That's how you do it. You evolve and add new functionality

168
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,840
Without breaking anything. I think when I heard this it was sort of triggering a bias in my head

169
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,000
And that is you can't you can't have an old system an old subsystem and a new subsystem and have them coexist

170
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
that just adds bloat and

171
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,500
Bloat equals slowdown and security issues and that equals bad

172
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,140
But that's I think a bit of a novice understanding when I when I gave it a little more consideration. I

173
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
realized

174
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Well Linux is kind of

175
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,620
Uniquely suited for this you have to get the balance, right?

176
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:48,140
but the reality is you can have somebody who maintains the current IO subsystem and you can have somebody else that comes along and

177
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,780
maintains the new IO ring subsystem and

178
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,180
There isn't some beam counter saying well, we can't afford to invest in two subsystems at the same time

179
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,740
This is open source development. So it can absolutely happen in parallel

180
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,300
But additionally having two subsystems that do similar things doesn't make one of the other

181
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,340
Slower that code path just doesn't get activated unless somebody writes for it

182
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,140
So there's really not as long as it's maintained. There's not really like a performance hit from it, right?

183
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,540
I mean if you ever call into that code, it's never gonna get loaded and run it just sits there

184
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,940
And so Greg's core point with all of this was is as much as you can

185
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:34,080
Keep support for existing features and slowly build in new features. If you have to make really really radical change

186
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,760
Maybe it's time to call it something new

187
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
And he brought us back

188
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,040
To the good old genome days to really kind of help sink this in for the developers that were listening

189
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,520
The biggest thing to do is don't take away things at work

190
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,760
If somebody's using this feature and using this functionality keep it there. It's that simple

191
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,680
It's being it was there you provided for somebody don't think by removing it. You're doing them a favor

192
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,880
You might be doing yourself a favor because you think it can be done a different way

193
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,960
But don't because it's not gonna work and the biggest example of this and the most public example this happened many many years ago

194
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,000
2011 the big day. A number of people here know what that date was

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,240
I have heard it talked to by as this date and this was the gnome 3 introduction

196
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,680
Everybody's system instantly when the distro switched it over it looked totally and completely different

197
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,080
That was a major major break. This was the day the gnome project realized that they had real users

198
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,280
Based on the feedback they got they always thought they had users. They always thought they were doing the right thing

199
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,200
They wanted to make a change. They wanted to do something different

200
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,360
But this was the day that they really broke all their users trust because all of a sudden they impose a totally different model

201
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,960
Onto them on to what they were currently using to do used to doing getting the workflow and it broke them

202
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,680
It just caused a number of major major pain. It was horrible. Um

203
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,240
Then ldn.net review of gnome 3 was actually really good. It was very comprehensive

204
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,120
It was very comprehensive. Um, but and the comments of course were horrible

205
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,040
But read this if you're an application developer and you are considering rewriting how you do everything in a totally different way

206
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,600
look at this you are seeing people mad because you took something that they were using and

207
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,440
Using to get their real work done. Their real work isn't to create a

208
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:34,240
Interface or application environment their real work is to do something else and you made it harder to get them to do their real work

209
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,720
You broke their trust and that was a long way and the known developers clawed back from that

210
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,000
It took them many many many years to do that. I think they're there now. I know myself

211
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,840
I switched away and came back many years. They've gotten better since 2011. They realize having a clean break doesn't work and

212
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,880
That was not the best idea. Please don't in your application do the same thing. I see this happen a lot

213
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,080
people

214
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Evolve applications to do something totally different different UI. That's not a good idea

215
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Please don't do that. And I I don't know if I completely agree that their reputation has recovered. I mean, I like

216
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Like Greg stopped using it for a while same here

217
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah, and now I'm back on it and I'm pretty dang happy with it

218
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,720
But I think that's also at the same time plasma has gotten gotten really really sharp

219
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,520
He also he does cite plasma desktop as an example of getting it, right, right?

220
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,360
And you know, I'm immediately made to think of the systems we have in the studio and that I have at home running KDE neon

221
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
And it's just slow

222
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,760
Evolutionary change and I don't worry even if I'm getting updates every single week that my desktop suddenly gonna change out from underneath

223
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
yeah, I remember when I was an IT support and

224
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,480
A new version of Windows came along and it wasn't even a significant change

225
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,480
but it might have been like from XP to 7 or something like that and I was working with people getting them set up and I

226
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I remember the comment that somebody made to me and it just really stuck out and he said to me he said to me

227
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,520
You know, I just don't understand why they keep moving the gas pedal on this thing and that's how he saw

228
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,760
It's like I learned how to drive this Windows XP and now you gave me Windows 7 and they moved the gas pedal on me

229
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,200
I think that's a common viewpoint, right?

230
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,500
You didn't have the problems that the developers seem to think needed to get fixed or changed or you know

231
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,600
Trying to make more revenue with and so why change it? Meanwhile, I'm often like hmm. Where can I stick the gas pedal?

232
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,520
You know, can I put it over in this corner? I want like three of them and I want them all shiny

233
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,960
But he underscores this point by saying, you know, look at the mate and cinnamon projects. They're still here

234
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,800
They're still going this really underscores the size of this change of this event that gnome was as a result

235
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Everybody here knows made in cinnamon sprung up. They fill a real need

236
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,920
These are real desktops that are with lots and lots of users because they were used to before or they're used to that common paradigm

237
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Um, that's fine. But this is an example that kind of shows that what the known developers did

238
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,760
Was major and was really big because there's two separate projects just to fill that void

239
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,640
That's fine. If the known developers want to do that they did

240
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,160
That was their decision to do again. We're writing software for free. You're giving it over throwing it over the wall

241
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,360
I would say that maybe that wasn't the best decision to do

242
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,260
But hey, maybe you should call it a different project gone off in different way, but like software development

243
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,920
Sometimes there is a reason to introduce real change you have to provide enough reason and enough

244
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,640
goodness

245
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:38,480
To force somebody to take the time to learn to do something else. That's very rare. It happens very rarely in an application space

246
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Sometimes in library spaces as does

247
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,640
Um, I'll call that system D as a good example of how this they did it, right? They provide all the functionality

248
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,800
They solved a real problem that was there that unified all these existing

249
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,640
tools and problems in such a way that it was just so much better to use and

250
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,560
It provided enough impetus that everybody was willing to do the do the work to modify their own stuff and move to the new model

251
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,840
That it worked people still complain about it, but it worked everybody switched

252
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,440
Everybody updated the new stuff the kiddies doing with a system D on how it launches better is very nice

253
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,520
Gnome was integrated with a very from the beginning from very early. It works. Well, it solves a real problem again

254
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:25,160
That was a example of how you can provide a compelling reason to move on and make the change, you know

255
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
It reminds me that

256
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,360
We have some really intelligent people that are running the kernel

257
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,240
And that's one I think Linux is best strengths of the people closest to the core of it

258
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,040
They know what the hell they're talking about what they're doing

259
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,080
well, and you can see that this is really, you know, great got an understanding of being in the open-source space where you know

260
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,520
no one's required to use Linux necessarily like you have to

261
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,280
Work and have a value proposition to your audience to make sure that they use it and don't just fork you and do whatever else

262
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,040
They want to do or use one of your many competitors right in a corporate environment

263
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,960
If I'm writing some software

264
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,280
You might just be told that you have to use it or if I need to make a change I can force you into a zoom

265
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,720
Meeting tell you you got to fix your software by X date

266
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,040
But in the larger world of open-source software, you can't do that. And that is when he cited system D there

267
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,280
You know

268
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,720
You absolutely could have your qualms with system D and many people do and they still love to talk about it

269
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,680
but at the end of the day it was immensely successful in getting adoption and

270
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,120
In a way that we don't normally see with a disrupter in open source

271
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,440
And so it was kind of a rare case because usually it has to be slow progressive change

272
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,680
And maybe it is a good example too in that I think a lot of the folks who you know didn't like system D for

273
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,080
Them that change wasn't as well justified right there are reasons that they didn't have the same problems or that system D

274
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,160
Didn't feel like it was necessarily solving for them. So there was less incentive to move on. So the whole talk is worth

275
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Listening to it's about 30 minutes long and you know, we got you, you know a few minutes worth of clips here

276
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,320
So it's worth checking it out

277
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,600
but at the end in the Q&A he was asked a question about what new technology coming to Linux at the kernel level and

278
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,680
Around it that he's the most excited about and so I'm gonna play that for you

279
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,800
And then we'll quiz West Payne to see if he knows what it is

280
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
Any current technology you just pay steps? Yes

281
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,360
I owe you ring you space developers who care about IO should pay attention to that

282
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,680
I know the Postgres developers are you looking at it now database other database developers that is asynchronous. I owe no system call overhead

283
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Very very fast. I owe you can throw things into a ring and you get notified in user space when your data is there

284
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,560
Very very good. If you care about IO, I recommend looking at that

285
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
All right, West Payne

286
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,240
For the last chicken little in the kitchen

287
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,600
with cheese

288
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,600
What is IO ring? Well, it's IO underscore you ring Chris and it's a mechanism per for performing

289
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Asynchronous IO. Oh, oh

290
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,400
Well, that's enough. That's it. That's all you got. Hmm judges. What more did you want? Well, what makes it so special?

291
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,440
It's new and faster and better you heard him talk about, you know less system call overhead

292
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,040
Yeah, it's no one's really been happy with the existing asynchronous IO subsystem options in Linux and classic Unix

293
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,280
IO is inherently synchronous. So this is a new faster method that's becoming very popular. All right, I'm gonna give it to you West Payne

294
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,960
You are correct. Yeah, there's actually one other technologies

295
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,520
He cited two technologies that he's very excited about IO ring was one of them. I owe you ring

296
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,840
Ha the second one though. I'm gonna say you have to go listen to Linux action news episode

297
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,160
163 to hear that one

298
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Oh, you know, there's also some interesting talk about a breaking change coming to system D

299
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,360
Which I think is right on point for today's discussion. Yes, very much. So as a matter of fact

300
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,020
So go check out linuxactionnews.com slash one six three

301
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,700
Linode comm slash unplugged go there to get a one hundred dollar 60-day credit towards your new account

302
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,940
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers. They are our server provider. Not only do they offer servers

303
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,720
They offer node balancers. They have object storage if you want some static storage up in the cloud and they've been around

304
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,640
Three years before AWS. That's when they got their start. They're like they're in this for like the long haul was that's for sure

305
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,440
And that gave them some very early opportunities in infrastructure and in private networking

306
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,480
They have 11 data centers around the world

307
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,840
They have a crazy fast network that they just recently made a blog post about that. I encourage you to go read

308
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,400
If they're my cloud hosting provider and they host all of our new infrastructure here

309
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,920
They have native SSD storage 40 gigabit connections at the hypervisors a really nice easy to use cloud manager to do all of this

310
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,440
Plus they also plug in with the orchestration management tools

311
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,760
So that's just like a slam dunk plus Linode costs 30 to 50 percent less than the major cloud providers like AWS

312
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,680
They're independently owned like you're like you're humble podcast network right here

313
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,600
And so that that that I really like

314
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,160
but additionally Linode was one of the first sponsors to step up and

315
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Make us make Jupiter broadcasting going independent actually happen and possible there

316
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,400
They were one of the OG sponsors that came in when things were brand new and I was just a few days out from going

317
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,760
On air and I didn't have anything lined up and Linode stepped up

318
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,000
So they they have been they have been part of the community for a long time like they're they're also backers of

319
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,680
Linux fest Northwest they've sponsored projects like Kubuntu and they do lots of hackathons and meetups

320
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,960
Although I don't know how much these days, but I've been going to events for years and seeing Linode there

321
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,420
So I'd always wanted to try them out. So a couple of years ago. I had my opportunity and I've never gone back

322
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,200
See check them out. See what they can do for you. See what you can build Linode calm

323
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,680
Unplugged go there get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account and support the show

324
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,120
See why they're our hosting provider and why we love them so dang much a couple of weeks ago

325
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,460
I did a custom rig that I swear you could only do at Linode because they get it

326
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,040
Unlike entry-level service providers that lock you down and prevent you from being able to do some of the back-end stuff

327
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,380
Let know that you have at it. Check it out Linode calm slash unplugged big

328
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:08,260
Thank you Linode for sponsoring the unplug program and thanks to everybody who listens and goes to Linode calm slash unplugged

329
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,880
To check them out to support the show and let them know you heard about it here and get that

330
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,560
$100 60-day credit towards your new account

331
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,840
All right Wes this week there was a story that kind of reminds us why a lot of us choose to use Linux on our

332
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,440
Workstation set the scene. It's a rainy Pacific Northwest morning

333
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,000
I've lazily gotten out of bed wandered downstairs

334
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,360
Got the laptop rebooted set up ready to get to work or at least drink some coffee and start going that way

335
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Think about getting ready for work

336
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
It's a multi-step process

337
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,720
And I notice you know, I'm using my my work Mac, okay

338
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,200
Apps are taking a while to load. All right, I thought at first that just this must be you know Mac OS doing something

339
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,440
Maybe it's rebuilding some caches in the background or had perhaps done some updates after I'd rebooted it, but it just kept persisting. Hmm

340
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,360
Really and and was it just during application load time just load time the apps would launch eventually and then run just fine

341
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,440
Yeah, I think a lot of people ran into this on November 12th when

342
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,800
Big Sur was released. Uh-huh. Big Sur came out and

343
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
hours after the initial release

344
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,560
Somewhere in Apple's infrastructure their online certificate status protocol servers just started crawling and

345
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
Part of the problem actually was that they didn't go completely offline

346
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,860
They just got really really slow and what could be happening in your case and some of these other individual cases

347
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,520
is that Mac OS in the background has this gatekeeper technology and it checks to see if the

348
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,720
Developer certificate is valid of the application before it runs

349
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,240
So say you have do you remember one of the apps like slack perhaps? Yep. So slack when they submit to the

350
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,360
Apple app stores all of them part of that process they they they actually like become an Apple developer

351
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
They pay for that they get an account for that

352
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,960
They they submit to these different app stores and their build has to be signed with their certificate

353
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,880
Apple signs the application and then they sign it with the developer certificate too and this all happens on the on the back end

354
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
the application when it runs

355
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,160
It generally just runs but every now and like if you haven't run it for a while or maybe it's like a fresh boot

356
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
it will check to see if that

357
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,260
Developer certificate is active if it's still valid and here's where the drama came in because yes, that means, you know

358
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,480
I'm launching an application. I'm doing stuff on my computer and suddenly we're sending a response to some servers over controlled in Apple's cloud

359
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,360
Checking to make sure that I can in fact launch this program. I've asked it to run

360
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,760
this is something Apple rolled out quite a while ago in Mac OS and they've evolved it over time and

361
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,740
ultimately the idea being that they could revoke slack certificate or anybody and

362
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,080
That application would then fail to launch on Macs or I devices, right? Let's say, you know, I've been publishing stuff

363
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,200
I just put out a new version of my application people are running it and I noticed that oh

364
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,040
I've been compromised and someone put some you know malicious crypto miner in my software and now it's out there

365
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Well, I might not be able to do anything except in this case

366
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
I can I can ask I can tell Apple about it and

367
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,800
They can make sure that any new launches from there on won't work

368
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,720
So this is why it's built in there, but it also has the flip side

369
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
There's an evil side to this

370
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,880
If you wanted to implement your own app store in your app and Apple decided they didn't want you to do that

371
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
They could turn your account off

372
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,860
Additionally it means that these Macs have to check in semi frequently with Apple servers

373
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,000
Before they'll run an application think about that network activity has to occur

374
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,080
Before the application runs

375
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,920
So if you have a bad route if you've got some weird latency if you're on a my fi and it's just going a little

376
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Slow that day you could have a ten thousand dollar Mac Pro tower and it will still

377
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,780
Wait to launch the application. Now. There is provisions in there for if it's offline, but when it's totally online

378
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:03,100
It won't you know, it'll just launch but when it's actually responding guess what it it slows the entire thing down and I

379
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,820
Really think Apple as this company that positions themselves as a privacy first company needs to be really super clear when they're doing something like this

380
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,740
Because you kind of get a sense of a person's

381
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,780
Basic meta metadata about the use of their machine application launch times IP address

382
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,020
I believe it's also sent in HTTP. Is that true? Yeah

383
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:29,100
That's a common thing in these scenarios and yeah looking at some wire shark logs that folks have been investigating this from it does seem

384
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,580
Like there's some information

385
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
transmitted over plain text now

386
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,940
That seems to be just information about the particular development

387
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,860
developers certificate and usually that certificate could sign multiple apps say in the case of Mozilla for both Firefox and Thunderbird, but

388
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,820
That's kind of a personal choice of how do you feel about that?

389
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,180
And as you say right there's you know, these are associated with time with your activity with perhaps your location. Yeah. Yeah, there's so there's

390
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,820
A couple of issues here the first issue

391
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,220
I'd say is this a system that people are comfortable with?

392
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,140
Because it gives Apple a lot of metadata and it gives them a lot of control

393
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,900
I I would argue if you buy a Mac you kind of already conceding to trusting Apple

394
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,480
And so this that probably doesn't bother you as much but then you have the implementation here

395
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:18,000
Even though this touches Akamai which is by the way a third party now getting in the mix part of this will touch Akamai's

396
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,320
CDN network part of it goes directly to Apple

397
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,080
I'd like some real clarity on what information is being collected and sent along because what has been

398
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
deduced by the community is

399
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,360
Kind of damning. It seems like a lot of information. I wouldn't want out there

400
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,200
Well, and I think a lot of you know, but for for being proprietary

401
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,760
I think there's still a lot of folks even in our community in the Linux users that

402
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,440
You know Apple isn't Google. They're not just trying to sell you ads and necessarily mine all your personal data

403
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,880
And they've tried to build a brand on that but not being clear here

404
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,120
I think is hurting that at least among say the developer crowd and there's that whole privacy aspect of it

405
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,660
But I I think this conversation so far as we've heard it because we're recording this on a Sunday

406
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,040
Hasn't really included the fact that iOS behaves exactly the same way, right?

407
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,200
I think that's this is this is the Apple ecosystem exactly how it works, right?

408
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,080
All right, the same fundamentals and and and in their ecosystem, they're king

409
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,100
Yes, and that may be part of the value proposition, right?

410
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,140
Like how often do you really worry about a bunch of iOS malware? Yeah, I suppose not really ever and

411
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,260
Most users aren't really capable of you know evaluating that do you maintain a list of trusted and untrusted software?

412
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,560
I mean, you know Apple does and they don't get security reports

413
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,760
They have whole teams of people that can monitor and keep these things up-to-date true

414
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,520
I give you that and if you're just downloading some random software and running it who knows what could happen

415
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,360
it also feels like it's potentially surveillance like it could be utilized for surveillance if you had somebody on your network who was

416
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:44,520
I don't know wanted to surveil you but I think I'm just gonna slow down requests to that specific domain all the time on all my

417
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,840
No, this is the third issue. No, really. I think this is so

418
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,660
You you literally have a system designed and such that it could slow down the operation of a Mac

419
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,780
And if I was using a Mac that day and I was trying to get work done and I was in a rush

420
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,600
Maybe I was trying to get down to the studio really quick or I had to take off. I

421
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,920
Would be very incensed. I I think I would be enraged that

422
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:15,120
That they designed a network system in such a way that it could slow down my local computer on my LAN, right?

423
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,000
And of course, you know

424
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Like we talk a lot about the various trade-offs and security and I think it just underscores that

425
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,400
They've made the choice of where to fall in those trade-offs

426
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,800
You don't really have a lot of input so many Mac the way I put this in our show notes is it's really about who?

427
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,240
Owns your computer and Linux users. I think are the only ones who can who can really confidently say I own my system

428
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,640
Do you see this like it is is that overstating it? No, I don't think it is

429
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,160
I mean it comes down to these questions. Do I own my computer or does the company that?

430
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,040
Owns the computer. So does Apple own my computer?

431
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,400
Can I do whatever I want with my computer or does Apple decide what I do with my computer and in the end?

432
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,200
We Linux users say or ask themselves do I want that or not and we don't want that?

433
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,520
So we choose another system, right?

434
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,760
And I think the other problem is is it's going to encourage people who are concerned about this

435
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,000
Just to disable all code signing checks and that's not a good user behavior either, right?

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,080
Especially for folks who maybe don't know that much about security like most users and can't really weigh the pros and cons

437
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:27,240
So then there is a yet another wrinkle to this story. It is it's really something is in macOS Big Sur

438
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
They have designed it such that

439
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
certain set of the core system

440
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
bypasses VPNs and

441
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,480
Other types of things like maybe you have a popular Mac app as little snitch of an outbound firewall, right?

442
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,280
And that relies on some hooks that the kernel the Apple's kernel provides them to you know

443
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,560
I'd be able to make these choices and they've just said no our programs they do what they want

444
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,640
so that means that Macs are essentially

445
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,280
Leaky on VPNs now out of the box and now this is all provisional as you said

446
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,320
It's it's a Sunday right now, but at least from looking at Twitter

447
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,320
It seems like maybe some other third-party apps can start start taking advantage of that too at least right now

448
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,000
And it is still you know in beta. Yeah, but from what we do see on Twitter

449
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,600
It seems like someone else was able to essentially create a malicious app that took advantage of this new system

450
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,360
And it's it's ludicrous because again there I would expect as an end-user if I'm if I'm establishing a VPN

451
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:26,420
I would never think that Mike's my kernel and other parts of my OS are sneaky sending data to other servers

452
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,160
Outside my network level VPN. That's why I created a VPN something tells me there'll be some network

453
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,640
IT administrators who are none too happy about this. I hope that's a bug could be a bug. We will see

454
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,400
um the other thing that I I wanted to kind of just know in all of this is

455
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,040
It may not all be bad news there could actually be a little potentially good news here

456
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,760
It seems that there will be a way for users to bless

457
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,280
Their own kernels on these new arm max say what yes

458
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,000
So while yes, there is a secure boot like environment on these arm max

459
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,120
And you have to have a sign kernel before it will boot

460
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,920
We've now found out that there will be a process where you can

461
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,080
Manually sign a kernel and the developer of pongo OS one of the developers

462
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,920
Was getting pretty far on actually getting this to boot and it may actually be possible using the same approach to bless a Linux kernel and

463
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:31,480
And then potentially boot a second stage bootloader like this pongo OS and then load Linux from that right the pongo OS bits there

464
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,800
Because you're in kind of a weird environment that like say the Linux kernel wouldn't expect to be booted from so you need a little

465
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,960
Shim to get it going. This is interesting right this is kind of on the side of okay

466
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,000
Maybe you do still own it. Yes, we are going to enforce that you do it in a secure way

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah, but if you can you know add your own blessed signed systems and boot it

468
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,760
That's a step in the right direction

469
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,320
So maybe maybe it's not totally locked out there you know Apple give it an apple taketh away

470
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,160
But this story when I looked at this. I thought all of this combined together

471
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,880
I thought this is this is why I think

472
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,880
There will be a portion of of Apple users that are in the professional end that

473
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:14,440
Expect to be able to control their computer the people who noticed these things right they're good candidates for Linux

474
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,280
They seriously are for the Linux workstation like this laptop. We're going to review today

475
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,880
They are they are the exact target demo for this Dell Precision set them up on you know fedora 33

476
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,560
With a nice shiny GNOME setup all right all right you that may be too much

477
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,080
I don't know they may have to go Ubuntu. You know they they need a soft landing

478
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,600
But really like seriously it is it is how when you're talking about the differences between a Linux

479
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,160
Workstation and a Mac workstation how do you quantify something like this?

480
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,020
Because we'll often talk about telemetry or we'll talk about spying and privacy

481
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:59,180
but this is a this is a multiple layer cake here where you've got the privacy implications of metadata tracking of

482
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,260
When and what developers you're using you've got then the other aspect of this of course that Apple is able to turn

483
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:11,140
applications off which you may or may not be comfortable with that's a decision you have to make but then lastly you have the

484
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,160
Network effect where because Apple is not particularly good so far developing online services

485
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,300
They've designed this thing in a way where when they release the new OS that day

486
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,980
It can cause all of the Macs all of the Macs not just the Big Sur Macs all of the Macs to slow down

487
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,540
that to me is is a line that should not ever be crossed and

488
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,820
You know these things are never gonna impact your Linux distro, right?

489
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,420
It's just not gonna happen there was a time

490
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,220
Maybe where an Amazon referral search would be conducted when you'd searched in the launcher

491
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,340
But this kind of stuff is just not gonna happen on the Linux box the funny part that struck me too was all the very interesting

492
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,780
Good investigative work going on to figure out just what was sent and what was happening

493
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,380
That's all you know in the Linux world. That's open-source

494
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:59,020
Just go point me at the GitHub and you have to wonder with this move to arm Apple silicon really? Yeah, right

495
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,740
Thank you. It's true the m1 chip

496
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:06,540
The reality is is that we they really are closer and closer to a world where nothing runs unless it's signed

497
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
Today they allow you to bypass gatekeeper

498
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,340
but why why really go to the effort of having a

499
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:19,580
Ecosystem and a and a hardware and a software stack that you own top to bottom and you are the sole kingmaker

500
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:26,580
With if you're not gonna make that move and if you look where Apple is going where they're seeking revenue now is services and these app

501
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,580
Stores they they count them as services for the reports to Wall Street

502
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,740
And it just seems very likely that now that you've got Macs that can run

503
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,660
iOS apps and they're on their own custom silicon and

504
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,700
They have this all the pieces in place like gatekeeper the App Store

505
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,700
It's probably only a few years from now where they flip that switch and everything has to run through gatekeeper and there will be absolutely

506
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Nothing you can do like you can't run

507
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,580
Anything but Big Sur or later on these m1 Macs just can't so there's just do you have no option and I?

508
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,100
Think that also is gonna make Linux more and more of a compelling platform for high-end professionals tech savvy professionals

509
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm not saying you know for everybody, but it's just making it fall more and more I think into less and less

510
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,980
I should say in the general purpose computing category and more and more as a niche thing

511
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Maybe you have it for your as your video editing utility

512
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,860
You know it's just a box in the corner that you need because it has the best applications for that purpose

513
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,180
But it's not a general purpose computer. Yeah, I could see that sure. I mean it's that's a pretty expensive

514
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,580
Non general purpose computer when you're spending that kind of money. You'd like it to be able to do everything

515
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,340
but

516
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,380
Yeah, I mean, maybe maybe what happens is if Apple goes crazy

517
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,580
Maybe you'll but maybe you can load Linux on those ARM Macs one day. Maybe it'll happen something tells me you're gonna try

518
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,980
Well let's talk about this Macbook killer that I've had in-house for a few weeks now

519
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,940
I really had to put it through its paces, but first I do have a little housekeeping

520
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,620
You should definitely join the le plug

521
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,940
We have a virtual Linux users group that gets together every Sunday in our mumble room in the lobby

522
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,660
It's really easy to get started go to Linux unplug calm. We have the mumble info in there now

523
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Next Sunday is the jellyfin bug-a-thon the developers will be joining our our lug

524
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,380
they were actually there earlier today to doing a presentation and

525
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,660
we're gonna help them try to just

526
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,660
Stamp out any of the bugs we can find in the 10.7 release jellyfin is a open source Plex alternative

527
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:30,780
And we want to do anything we can here at the show to push that forward and so the virtual lug has extended an invitation

528
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,220
To the jellyfin developers to join them next Sunday at noon Pacific

529
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,620
And you can get that converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and help them out

530
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:44,340
Hey, I'm excited and I'm a big jellyfin user myself. So the more bugs we find better for me. That's right, man

531
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,700
Also, I want to recommend you grab the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed

532
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,380
You never know what could be coming up and these days all the shows are really great Coder radios back

533
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,020
West has joined me on Linux action news

534
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,660
It's a nice type production self-hosted be coming out later this week

535
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,860
And if you have the all shows feed you just get it all so you can search in your podcast app or or get it

536
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,260
From the website. I think it's a good way. It's like the pro. It's like the pro user move

537
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,500
Well or the lazy user move where you don't want to bother checking and making sure you got all the ones in the right spots

538
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,620
And in your feeds, that's a really good just one feed that it's the lazy and easy way

539
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,500
But also the pro way see sometimes sometimes the easy way is the pro way. That's right

540
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,520
You know you want to just you want sustainable podcasting West. All right, that's all the housekeeping for this week

541
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,820
So let's talk about this Linux MacBook killer a bold claim mr. Fisher it really is

542
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:44,180
This is the precision 57 50 and this is this is a really a pretty new beast from Dell

543
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,740
They've they really stepped it up. They manage to get this thing 10% thinner

544
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,380
So if you've seen the old edition, it's kind of got like some big fan gaps on the sides and whatnot

545
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
all that's gone with this one and now

546
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:01,700
With with this is really something I had to double-check this but now Dell can claim the world's smallest

547
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:08,800
17 inch mobile workstation it is quite a thing to look at. Yeah, really handsome shiny

548
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:16,600
Professional. Yeah, it's it's that same metal and sort of carbon fiber like mix that Dell uses on the XPS

549
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,800
but brought up to the professional precision line and

550
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,960
They've they've also done another pass at the edge to edge infinity display with just blow

551
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
This thing is it's really something

552
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
the the screen on this is

553
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:39,160
Well, it's I mean, it's always tops but it's a 16 by 10 aspect ratio. It has HDR 400 support

554
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,840
It's 3840 by 2400 resolution with touch support and it's edge to edge glass

555
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,880
I didn't even try the touch support and the webcams back up at the top now, which is which is pretty nice

556
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,760
So this precision as it's configured is really meant for a workstation replacement

557
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
It's meant to stomp a MacBook

558
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,080
It has the Xeon mobile processors in it that run at a base clock of 2.4 gigahertz

559
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,760
But can actually go all the way up to 5.3 gigahertz Wow eight cores 16 threads

560
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,360
Isn't that something I'm not used to type an n-proc and seeing 16 on my laptop 32 gigs of RAM in this particular one

561
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,720
Although I think you can go even further

562
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,000
This one has a quadro RTX 3000 with six gigs of video RAM

563
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,200
I'll tell you more about that in a little bit as an m.2 one terabyte PCIe MVM

564
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
It doesn't have a spinning rust

565
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,160
Sorry, I think you can actually put up to two terabytes of PCIe storage in it

566
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,880
But this is one terabyte 6l 97 watt hour lithium ion battery

567
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,600
So the maximum you could take this thing on a plane with and then they Dell does this and I really like it is

568
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,080
They've done a really beefy USB

569
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,360
C charger a hundred and thirty watts. Yeah

570
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,320
Yeah, so you can really dump power into this thing and it's or you just use any standard USB C charger

571
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,760
I like, you know in any of the ports any of the ports on the thing. It's really nice

572
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,280
So that that I really appreciate it because when you needed to throw power into it

573
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,320
They had such 130 watt, but when I wasn't doing much with it, I could just use like the 65 one

574
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,800
I can whatever you have. Yeah, like I was 65 watt that

575
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,920
Was pretty easy to use this one also features a much larger trackpad

576
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,880
I mean look at the trackpad compared to our ThinkPad trackpads. I mean, it's puny

577
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,680
Yeah, it's if this trackpad is it's MacBook style

578
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,400
It's massive and it's it's got a very nice. It's it's the best

579
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,120
It's the best touchpad I've ever used on a Linux laptop easily, which might not still be saying much but it's pretty good

580
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,880
I really have zero complaints

581
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,400
The other thing that's nice about this laptop is you can load it up with ECC memory if you like

582
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,280
If your workload calls for that, oh and I was wrong

583
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,800
You can get up to four terabytes of PCIe storage and you can get it in raid one or zero options, too

584
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,000
It's I did not see this

585
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,640
Also, they've worked on this to reduce the amount of blue light that the panel blasts in your face to reduce eye strain

586
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:06,040
This has an updated keyboard with a slightly longer travel distance. I'll be curious for your take on that particular detail

587
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,300
Yeah, I actually don't really find the keyboard much different. It's not offensive

588
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,680
Um, I am I find myself not to be a very good keyboard critic

589
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,040
I'm I definitely appreciate a nice keyboard and the better the keyboard the more I appreciate it

590
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,840
But I I can go on anything between the butterfly keyboard like that. I can't use that right?

591
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,140
That's the upper limit there right and then like a really nice custom mechanical keyboard like I I'm but I liked it

592
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,220
I found that when I did start to use it

593
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,860
It took my brain about a minute to really adjust to the layout and then I had it it was really no big deal

594
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,600
And then there's something that is really special about this laptop

595
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
this this laptop

596
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,840
has

597
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,480
What has got to be maybe the future of where where Dell is going on thermal management?

598
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,600
Get ready for this. So Dell wanted a solution where that you could really run this thing GPU and CPU go right and otherwise

599
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,360
But why are you filling it with so much beefy hardware totally doable in a desktop tower?

600
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,000
Yes, not very doable in a laptop in a thin laptop. Yeah, and a really thin laptop

601
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,800
So they've done some secret sauce work. It's patented

602
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,560
So it's not that secret, but they've done some secret sauce work on the fans

603
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,920
So they have these really kind of big special fatty fans in there

604
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,920
But then they also have something called dual opposite outlet where they have a pressurized air chamber and fans to really move the air

605
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,840
in this thing

606
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:30,680
So this thing manages with a combo of fan upgrades the dual air flow and the pressurization

607
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,520
They do in there to move a ton of air without a lot of noise

608
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
in fact, I'll say

609
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:44,360
Without really any audible noise even under some really significant loads. I know they also

610
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,280
Have done and in the little controller a machine

611
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,720
Learning dynamic tuning technology that actually comes from Intel

612
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:00,160
But Dell's the first to actually ship with this and it's a code based solution that automatically adjusts the performance based on

613
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:07,800
Application load what parts of the system the applications are hitting and it also can anticipate based on your previous performance

614
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,800
When like you start a CPU load and it might in the past

615
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,520
Maybe it's gonna attempt to avoid ramping up cooling because it's gonna see it's gonna try to wait as long as possible before it

616
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:23,640
Ramps cooling, but now with this adaptive workload system if it knows when you run this particular workload that the CPU runs for a long time

617
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,280
Oh, he's training another model. Yeah, it just ramps right up the cooling and it just gets right on it

618
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,800
But here's where they bring it all together and this is

619
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,560
ridiculous

620
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,560
Dell has built in a series of vapor chambers

621
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,240
Which are thinner than heat pipes and they can spread the heat out better and more efficiently and they allow for

622
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,560
Larger heat rejection paths, which is great for like your skin temperature stuff

623
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,040
And it really moves the heat and so they have the they have this thing

624
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,560
The vapor chamber stuff bolted on to both the CPU and the GPU and so you can

625
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,200
Crank this. I mean I'm throwing benchmark after benchmark at this thing for like a solid day

626
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,080
And it's just sitting there quietly chugging right along. Um, and then

627
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,000
I I hope this I hope this makes it into other models in the future

628
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,280
They have a graphite layer between the hot components and the outside of the laptop

629
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,880
So that way your hands and your wrist and stuff like burning my legs. No

630
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,480
Wow, yeah, and so they disperse the heat strategically throughout the system to prevent hot spots from affecting the user's comfort level

631
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,960
Yeah, i'm sold. Isn't that something? Um, so let's be real here

632
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,040
um

633
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,880
As configured. Yeah, what what is this gonna send me back? This is a 4800 review unit

634
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,400
4800 us greenbacks. Okay, but

635
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,880
um, I mean you got to think about really who is this laptop for right? That's the question here

636
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,320
Is this is for a professional. This is not my uh watching youtube on the couch laptop. This is our laptop

637
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,560
Watching youtube on the couch laptop. This is i've been using macs for years

638
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,520
I don't like where they're going and I want something that replaces my macbook

639
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,520
This is somebody who has a very gpu intensive workload

640
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,360
Perhaps they're messing with tensorflow like this is this is a particular type

641
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,320
These are several types, but these are particular types of users

642
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,280
I'd also say also people who like to treat themselves to the very best because

643
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,800
Uh, the reason why I waited so long to do this review is I really wanted to see if there was downsides to this

644
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,620
laptop because I just

645
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:35,560
Immediately fell in love with it and I knew I needed to like catch my catch my breath balance it out figure it out

646
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,520
You know use it for a while. And so I took an extended review with this one to the grace of dell. Thank you very much

647
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,600
um, and I walked away realizing that even if you're

648
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,800
Not in like this particular professional category

649
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,080
If you like a quiet laptop a fast laptop a beautiful laptop a laptop pre-loaded with linux

650
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,600
And you just kind of like the very best right? You've got you've got money to spare not an object and you just want the best

651
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,080
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because you know, it's got it's got

652
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,000
Thunderbolts, you can hook it up to a dock. You can have a bunch of monitors

653
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,640
This graphics card had no problem powering external screens and internal screens

654
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,080
Um, there is something to be aware of though, and I think this is maybe the biggest caveat

655
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:22,220
I knew it couldn't all be perfect but in this sentence. Yeah, it currently requires and only fully works with ubuntu 1804

656
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,960
We haven't seen this for a while. So I called up dell and I said like what's going on?

657
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,480
Why why can I only use 1804? I tried fedora. I tried pop os. I tried 2010. I tried 2004, right?

658
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,840
That's kind of the standard thing right anytime

659
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,080
There's an xbs in here really any laptop running linux

660
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,520
Let's throw all the distros at it

661
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,000
See what it does because you know, I figure a lot of people in our audience

662
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,160
They're gonna run whatever they want to run. They're gonna reload it

663
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:48,040
So the thing is is the thing has some super fancy sound and um that sound max card required a lot of custom work

664
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,360
And they are targeting support for 2004 in january

665
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,000
But don't yet have it and the way this process works is dell is working with canonical

666
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,600
And then when there's an update for hardware support those updates shipped to the dell laptop

667
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,800
Through a canonical repository interesting. So it's part of just the system update process. There is an oem

668
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,600
Repo at canonical that contains the software

669
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,040
And this is how this partnership works is dell engages with canonical to do this custom work for them

670
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,520
So it's not like dell's doing this weird hacky work and then like just dropping a you know

671
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,560
A big blob file on the file system and saying have go at it

672
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,680
They are contracting with canonical who are experts on the operating system and building this out

673
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,480
So they presently are targeting january for rubuntu 2004 support

674
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,480
But you can you're not going to be able to put

675
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:45,720
Manjaro or fedora or whatever else you might want on here at least if you want to have sound and have sound

676
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,440
Yeah, you can use it. It'll work. Great

677
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,680
Performance is excellent. I have you know that um wireless rrf headset that I have that has a usb dongle

678
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,880
That's what I used for the majority of my usage time anyways, and that works just fine

679
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,000
So I ended up for the most part not running

680
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,620
1804 until towards the end of the review where I put it back on there when you first set up the machine dell asks

681
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,300
You if you want to recreate

682
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,780
Create recovery media nice and so I said yes flash that and so I knew at some point

683
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,540
I might want to go back back and I did and it was simple and it was straightforward

684
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,620
One of the things that is pretty well known about dell but worth reminding you is they have that service tag

685
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,620
system, right

686
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,500
And um the nice thing about that is you just go into the website you put the service tag in and you can redownload

687
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,520
The recovery media as well. It's got all this stuff for your specific model and documentation

688
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:42,780
But this thing's about the performance. So let's talk about benchmarks a little bit. I put some uh, i'll put some links in the show notes

689
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:49,180
But I decided to take this dell precision laptop and I decided to put it up against a ryzen

690
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:56,300
Workstation I decided to put it up against my own workstation and I decided to put it up against the macbook pro 16

691
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,740
I like this competition

692
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,060
Yeah, it was it was a really interesting fight because these are all nice computers in their own right?

693
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,180
I mean my workstations from like 2017 2018. So

694
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,900
You know a little old but the dell

695
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,180
Is a modern precision 57 50 so I expected it to stack up pretty well

696
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,140
But I wasn't sure about going up against desktops like a ryzen

697
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,940
The dell came out on top in most all the tests

698
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,300
As you would expect right because it can ramp up to 5 gigahertz 32 gigs of very fast ram brand new machine

699
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,740
Yeah, yeah, the ryzen workstation pulled ahead a few times, but I decided let's put it up against the macbook pro 16

700
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:36,220
Because I felt like that was uh, an interesting comparison and this is this is pretty telling

701
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:36,780
um

702
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,060
I ran a geek bench benchmark on the mac and then I ran geek bench benchmark on the dell because this is a very common

703
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:48,860
Mac benchmark and the macbook pro comes in with a multi-core score of seven thousand three hundred and ninety two

704
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:54,700
The dell laptop comes in with a multi-core score of seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight

705
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:01,900
So several so a few hundred at least a few hundred uh higher on the score from multi-core and also faster on single core

706
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,580
Counts and faster on gpu benchmarks not too surprising there

707
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,780
but

708
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:13,020
When I expect out the macbook pro that macbook pro was almost six thousand dollars. Ouch

709
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,860
Yeah, and of course it doesn't run linux. So there's that too

710
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,460
Um, so I I felt like when you look at it from in that range

711
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,900
It's the the dell stacks up pretty well price and and we've we've seen other laptops that are you know

712
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,460
Should be quite fast, but either don't have the the best thermal management or other issues where you know

713
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,780
A macbook just has those things solved. Yeah, there's that. Um, the dell thermals are they're they're in a class of their own

714
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:43,740
I decided to also throw the old thinkpad at it. Hey thinkpad comes in with a 3500 score. Ouch. Yeah

715
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:50,220
Yeah, it really so the other thing that uh going through all these benchmarks that this test really underscored for me is

716
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:55,980
There is still a pretty clear advantage that a desktop workstation has in some areas over a laptop

717
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,700
even a totally decked out laptop like this precision

718
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,100
but

719
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,820
You can't take the you know, the the desktop. What am I carrying the whole tower? That's awkward

720
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,020
So when you look at those compromises and you look at what dell tried to do here

721
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:13,020
They tried to come up with a mobile workstation where you can max out the gpu and cpu

722
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:19,660
And still get reasonable battery life and get and get reasonable cooling and you don't have the thermal throttling effect

723
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,060
Where you run the machine for a bit and then it just starts really eating on the throttling

724
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,260
that's what they set out to solve with this and they realized that

725
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:33,100
The audience for that were linux users. So while I dislike that it's limited to 1804

726
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,100
It's not really a deal breaker

727
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,500
I think for most people in this class, right especially if you're a professional and want to use a you know

728
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,740
A supported long-term release anyway. Yeah, and you got to remember that this also is because it's a dell

729
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,100
It's an option that's available to a lot of people from a corporate standpoint

730
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,220
And they're not going to be choosing their operating system anyway, right?

731
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:58,940
The other thing I didn't what they're really the only had really two dislikes with this and my second dislike was that

732
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,700
It seemed like sometimes the screen auto dimming logic was hunting for just the right light settings

733
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:11,740
and this seemed to persist across all the distributions I tried and it was really only when I was in a situation where there was

734
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,380
a bright light source behind me and my body was blocking

735
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:22,860
The photo sensor then the system would sit there and try to hunt for the right brightness to kind of a distracting degree

736
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,180
But if you don't sit

737
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,460
Like I was in front of a light don't do what chris does it wasn't so bad

738
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,260
But you know in conclusion, this is a work tool

739
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:37,500
And it is probably one of the nicest tools you could own if this is the type of system that you need for work

740
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:42,220
I mean, there's no doubt about it in my mind if I was rolling with it these days

741
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,260
Uh, i'd probably pick that up for myself. This would probably be my machine because it played the games

742
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,740
I wanted to play at high resolution. It did the workloads. I wanted to throw at it

743
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,340
It never complained from a temperature standpoint and i'm okay with the sound workaround for something

744
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,660
That's this high of quality. He's nice with your e gpu. Yeah. Yes, it does. Um, would I like the sound to work obviously?

745
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,140
But if I was really rolling in it and money was no object

746
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,780
For myself, I would get this personally

747
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,460
Clearly if I was in this work field, this seems like an obvious choice, too

748
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,300
and I think

749
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:20,940
That is a bigger and bigger market the people that need a laptop like this that run linux for tensorflow and other types of work

750
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,020
Um, we decided to also just do a little machine learning testing not just because you know

751
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,460
That's clearly one of the things it's one of the target areas. Yeah, and it's killer

752
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,500
It's just absolutely killer and it's you got to think about it from this standpoint

753
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
It's pre-loaded with linux and ready to go

754
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,900
I think this is a bigger and bigger market and it seems like dell thinks this is a bigger and bigger market

755
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,820
And so they've built this linux macbook killer and it's a moniker that has become cliche

756
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,140
It's one i've used myself in the past

757
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:53,340
But I really truly think this thing is a game changer for corporate linux or for professional developers or high-end game developers

758
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,500
Who want to move over to the linux platform and they want something they can buy from a name brand?

759
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:03,500
That they know or maybe their corporation already has an account with and this thing is just it's such a winner for those people

760
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,580
You can really see how the platform they started building with the xps has evolved and just it's shiny now

761
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,900
It's really impressive and it makes me happy that

762
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,540
Someone other than apple is playing in this space and making computers that can be this good

763
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:21,340
That's it is we now have something that is just top top tier

764
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:26,380
And I hope to see a lot of the awesome tech with the cooling system come down to the xps line

765
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:33,580
That would be right super nice because that's a little more approachable for me. I also I don't need a quadro, right?

766
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:37,180
So i'd like to have something that you do some gaming but nothing crazy, right?

767
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,020
So i'd like to have something maybe a little more in a different tier

768
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:46,300
but I could absolutely understand the people that do want it and um, my time with the

769
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,940
with the dell was

770
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:55,820
It was tricky because I didn't really know what the approach was for a review for a for a computer this powerful

771
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,300
Like I have out in the other room. I have 150 laptop

772
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:06,140
I know how to review 150 laptop, right? I can tell you if the value proposition is there really easily

773
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,220
I just don't know how it works with linux yet

774
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,300
But with this when you're talking something that's 47 48 hundred dollars

775
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,940
How do I come on the air and tell you it's worth your money?

776
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,500
I can't tell you that right because everybody has a different sense of value but what I can tell you

777
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,740
Is this is one of the nicer computers i've ever used and it runs linux out of the box

778
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,340
And when I walk away from it, I'd say they've hit it out of the park

779
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,780
And that's that's what I wanted to come and that's what I wanted to relate to you is what they've done

780
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,500
That's kind of unique and kind of interesting and just the success that we're now seeing with these laptops

781
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,460
Um, i'm really impressed and I wish I could keep it

782
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:44,700
You know, but I will now box it up and send it back to dell and then the review will begin on the 150 laptop

783
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,700
So long you beautiful beast

784
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,980
It was fun while it lasted, uh, and it was a great excuse to load up steam and try a few video games

785
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,420
Now i'm back to my old system

786
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:02,300
All right, mr. Payne moving on from the review. What do we uh, what do we have in the feedback section anything this week?

787
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,700
No, no feedback this week. Well, there is some we just haven't selected it. That's probably in the show

788
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,420
That's probably what it is. Well, then let's plug the feedback so we can get some so we'll do a little more feedback

789
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:17,180
The next episode go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and fill that form out and send us in your thoughts

790
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,900
Yeah, we love your feedback, you know, not all of it can make it to the air

791
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:26,300
There just isn't time and but we still love hearing from you and all the stories the adventures the projects in linux

792
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,940
That stuff's great. I might have a special request

793
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,100
Wouldn't it be great?

794
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,540
just to get like

795
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,580
Somebody's crazy setup. Like do you have a crazy setup? That's like as crazy as this laptop or crazier

796
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,820
Like what weird stuff are you doing? Like yeah, first of all, tell us. Yeah, we yeah

797
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,500
So first of all, tell us what you're running

798
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,340
Like give us an idea of your specs

799
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:49,020
And then tell us why you need that because i'd like to get an idea of what some of those workloads are

800
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,340
And then on the opposite end of the spectrum

801
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,580
If you're running on something

802
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,980
Ridiculously low end and you're making it work. I'd like to hear that too

803
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,100
That's always like I like both ends of the spectrum

804
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:06,940
So give us that at linuxunplug.com slash contact and we may just cover it in a future episode

805
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:12,540
Also, thank you to our unplugged core contributors. You can go to unpluggedcore.com to sign up

806
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,900
You keep the unplugged program independent and you help reduce the ad load needed to make the show profitable

807
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:23,260
Let us be a little more picky with who we work with but you also get some perks first perk is the limited ad feed

808
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:28,060
Which cuts down as many of the ads as possible and just gives you the same great show same production

809
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:33,580
And the second feed is the full show live stream all our screw-ups like one that just happened a moment ago

810
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,900
Uh all the stuff that we don't make it and we don't put in the show that that's in the live feed version

811
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,360
And you get either one when you become a core contributor at unpluggedcore.com

812
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:50,140
Yes, wes yes, it's time for the picks and finally I decided since we didn't have feedback this week

813
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:57,420
We should have two picks. Look at you first one comes in from a listener of the show and it's called yacht

814
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:05,100
Yacht yacht is a graphical interface for managing your containers with a focus on templates and one-click

815
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,540
Deployments and also a dark mode. I like that

816
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:15,020
Uh, it is early. It is a community member who is making this but it's pretty neat and you could try it out right now

817
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:19,280
I mean so far you got your basic container management. You got a template framework

818
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,460
You have an easy approach to updating those templates

819
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,220
and um

820
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,900
Centralized settings for volume management similar to qol functionality, which is neat

821
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,020
You know, I like it

822
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:33,580
I got it running right here on the laptop and it's already giving me a splendid little dashboard of all the containers

823
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:39,420
I'm running now. I don't have any templates or anything, but I can see why you'd want that. Yeah, that's pretty pretty nice

824
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,180
And I mean, can you be in a name like yacht just the nautical theme if it's all right in

825
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,220
So the other pick we have is the reason why another reason why we did too is because you've heard of this one

826
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,020
But they have a nice new update. We wanted to make you aware of a brand new version of lutris is out

827
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:58,080
Zero five dot eight now this the lutris gaming platform

828
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,800
Has been working on importing your steam library and your gog library and third-party libraries into one

829
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,680
Store one ui one place to manage them all one stop shop

830
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:15,280
And they've made some nice strides recently and now steam games are loaded directly from the steam api

831
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,920
You don't have to go manually sync do all that weird stuff you had to do on the website. It just brings it all in

832
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:26,080
And game banners and icons are downloaded from the services themselves. It's it's getting really slick

833
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,480
Even bonus content for gog games like manuals and soundtracks can now be downloaded and stored inside lutris

834
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,440
So if you haven't checked out lutris in a while go do it

835
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,960
It's a pretty great little app and if you've been doing some gamings gaming on linux just gets better and better

836
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,560
It sure does wes. It sure does. Let's give it on. Let's uh, give it a honorable mention. There we go

837
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,560
Get the valve bong in there

838
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,960
Now we'll be back at our regular live time next tuesday over jblive.tv, which is nice because

839
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
Just doing it on sunday thing is getting a little old

840
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,240
Right. Yeah, what happened to tuesdays? What a day that is linux tuesday

841
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:10,160
I know and doing it on sundays is uh, it's a lot because we're also working on linux action news and the same

842
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,800
It's just it's a lot so back to tuesdays for us. It is you can join us though

843
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,140
Yeah, we'd love to have you join us over at jblive.tv

844
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,600
We do the show at noon pacific

845
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,000
We actually tend to get kind of going about a half hour before that all that's converted

846
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,580
In your local time zone at jupitabroadcasting.com

847
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,180
Slash calendar links to everything we talked about today at linuxunplugged.com

848
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,240
Slash 380 the show is at linux unplugged on the twitter. He's at westpane. I'm at chris lass

849
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,540
I don't know anything else we should mention lots of good shows over jupitabroadcasting

850
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
Check them out. Go check them out

851
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,960
Okay, thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program and we'll be right back here not on a sunday

852
01:05:48,960 --> 01:06:12,500
But we'll be back here next tuesday

853
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,960
So

854
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
All right, well you were comparing that laptop

855
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:38,000
Against other laptops, but would you rather have that or for a very similar price a 2006 ponniac vibe?

856
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,720
Probably the vibe to be honest with you

857
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,680
Yeah, when you start getting those prices you really are getting to use car prices, yeah

858
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:52,240
Uh over the weekend carl and I were uh, kind of commiserating about a sense of a bit of virtual

859
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,920
Conference burnout. I kind of implied it there with all they all feel like zoom meetings. Where are you at on it? Carl?

860
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,040
Yeah, I definitely appreciate it. I mean it's better than nothing right?

861
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,000
Right if corona is showing us anything we got to take what we can get

862
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,280
but

863
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,000
at the same time

864
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,560
I mean

865
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,840
It just cannot emulate the feel of a real conference and you know getting to hang out with friends that live far away

866
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,920
You know go out for drinks go out for good food

867
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,920
It's just it's not the same, you know

868
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,960
So at times it just feels like you're sitting there just watching youtube and some of them are even live streaming on youtube

869
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:26,640
Yeah, that's just it. It's a lot of good information. I'm valuable, you know valuable time from the speakers and I really appreciate that

870
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,320
But you're right. It doesn't

871
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,600
Doesn't hit that human connection

872
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,400
I know a lot of cons are trying to mix things up and have you know separate rooms for hallway tracks or other methods and

873
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,080
Chatting in a live stream can be fun. But yeah, and some of these are very

874
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,520
very well attended some of them are very poorly attended and then it kind of looks like a big waste of everyone's time and then

875
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,040
Additionally on top of that and I just i'm not ungrateful

876
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,680
I am very grateful that all of these are happening even and that the information is being relayed

877
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,520
but

878
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,560
As a culture

879
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:00,320
We just haven't gotten really good yet about knowing how to have good audio quality and where to position our cameras

880
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,600
and there's still a lot culturally we're learning and so

881
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,680
So you really kind of get the worst of it when you're watching these virtual events

882
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,080
They tend to have a lot of audio issues. They tend to have a lot of camera problems. There's a lot of dead air

883
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,400
Right. There's not necessarily someone, you know being an mc keeping everything flowing, right?

884
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,880
That's um, yeah can make a big difference. There's sometimes people are accidentally muted all the stuff you get

885
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
In like your worst work conferences

886
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:30,080
Have been at these events too. And so it's almost like someone needs to develop a platform that allows somebody to

887
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,240
You mc it and mute and unmute people and kind of

888
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:40,240
Be the person keeping the stream going and and then making sure that when like it's west pain's time to talk

889
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,960
I can mute and unmute west like that's how we do it here, right?

890
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,440
I don't I don't rely on the individual host to unmute themselves. I mean they can but

891
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,200
You you know the host can do it and then you don't have this weird thing

892
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,120
Like I played that clip of of greg's introduction, which was slightly awkward

893
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,000
But his was actually like one of the best case scenarios

894
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,080
This went smooth compared to almost everybody else and his audio quality was better than almost everybody else

895
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:08,640
One of the big benefits is that it's really opened up the availability for a lot of people that either can't afford travel themselves

896
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,880
Or their work won't pay for it and allows going to conferences all over the world

897
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,000
You know, I missed I tried to attend some of the linux app some app summit, I think

898
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,320
Um, but a lot of it was on european time

899
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,960
So I missed all the morning ones. I got to go back and watch those on youtube

900
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,880
Yeah, but it's just really opened up the availability which is a plus so it's a mixed bag

901
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,720
Yeah, the timing was tricky on that one. That's why I wanted to grab some of the clips from it

902
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,240
um, but I also feel like there has been

903
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,200
a gain and so you gotta wonder if there isn't

904
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,440
some sort of

905
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,880
Maybe middle ground here carl

906
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:47,200
I don't know really what it would be because the the in-person track and the going out and eating in the scene people stuff matters

907
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,120
So you don't want to have something that's only virtual but it could there be

908
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:57,600
Some kind of virtual hybrid conference where part of it's online part of it's physical. Would that be worth doing?

909
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,920
I don't know. I mean that's an interesting idea. I think it'd be really hard to pull off

910
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,400
I mean where everyone that's having to do remote stuff more than they used to now

911
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,120
Uh is probably can probably appreciate that

912
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,600
There's a golden rule for virtual meetings is that if one person's remote everyone's remote because whenever you have

913
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:22,880
You know some people in person you have sidebar conversations going on and it's really just not as not a true a lot worse

914
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,240
Communication so I fear the same thing happening with a mixed conference

915
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,000
it'd be interesting to try and see see if there's ways we can mitigate that because

916
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,280
I mean, even if all it is is just that you have the live in-person conference eventually and then you know

917
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,680
It's just standard that you have to provide a live stream of it. Maybe that'll be the compromise

918
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,160
Maybe I can certainly recall going to conferences and staying in my hotel room and watching the live stream

919
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,160
That sometimes is the better way to go

920
01:10:46,160 --> 01:11:14,480
And then still go out for drinks or whatever right you still get that you're still there. You know, you just
