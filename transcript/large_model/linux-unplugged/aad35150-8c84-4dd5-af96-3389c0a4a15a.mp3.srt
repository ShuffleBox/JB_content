00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 9 for October 8th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast that never shuts down,

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,200
despite what those slackers in Washington are up to. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt,

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,880
welcome to Episode 9, buddy. Thanks for having me. Nine weeks. Ten's cool, man, ten's cool,

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,400
but nine, that's like hipster cool, right? Exactly. Nine weeks in a row is pretty cool,

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,560
and we've gotten a ton of good feedback on the show. People are loving it. I'm really excited.

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,680
I think we're gonna have a good discussion today because there's been something, it's been on my

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,920
mind, Matt, and I can't shake it. It's Ubuntu 13.10. Oh my. Our review's coming up this Sunday on the

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,480
Linux Action Show, and it's a big event. It's a big event, and I gotta tell you, I've been struggling

10
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,600
this week, so I want to talk a little bit about a couple of concepts I'm kicking around that after

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,280
we kind of, I don't know, maybe kind of talk through them, it'll help me inform my review

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,680
for this Sunday. I think I'll be ready after this week's episode. I'm just trying to wrap my brain

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,920
around a few things. Mainly, Ubuntu 13.10 looks almost certainly to be the most boring Ubuntu

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,720
release we've ever seen. We've gotten too comfortable, you know? I wonder if maybe Ubuntu

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,120
is becoming the Windows XP of Linux, but not in the insecure way. Not in the insecure way. I'll

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,720
explain what I mean if it's the XP of Linux, and maybe that's not a bad thing. Maybe that's exactly

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,880
what the market needs. I think there could be an argument for that, too, and we'll bring in the

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,960
mumble room. We'll kick it around and get their opinions, too, because I know we've got some

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Ubuntu users in there and some Ubuntu converts. Oh, yes. Like that. You know, this morning I was

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,480
out getting meat, Matt. You were out getting meat? Okay. Yeah, I went out and went to the local

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,000
Savannah Meats, got a little meat. I don't actually get my bacon there too often, but,

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,840
so, you know, I took my son, and my son Dylan is four years old, and we walked in there, and it was

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,080
kind of early, so they were still kind of setting up in the morning. I wanted to, I like to get in

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,600
there early, because then all of the crew is in a good mood. Oh, sure. You see, when you go to

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,120
Savannah Meats in the afternoon, sometimes they're not in good moods. I guess maybe it's something

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,920
to do with cutting up animals all day, and then, you know, dealing with pain in the butt customers.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm in a cave, man. Yeah, exactly. So, we get there, and they have on big hooks, and with,

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,480
like, a chain conveyor belt system in their ceiling, they're moving, you know, slaughtered

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,080
cows through the back, and my four-year-old son just, like, sees them. It's the first time he's

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,200
ever seen anything like that. I'm sure that's quite a shock. I wasn't sure, like, you know,

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,320
is he gonna, like, get really grossed out, you know, what's gonna happen, but he was more,

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,600
he was fascinated. He's like, you know, are those cows? He asked me, and I just kind of started

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,120
explaining it to him, and the lady behind the counter hears me explaining it to him. She's like,

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,240
would you like to go see our, our, our, she calls me, she said, would you like to go see the cows?

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm thinking, these are live cows, right? I'm thinking, these are cows. Like a Dexter rerun.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,600
Like, maybe somebody just dropped off, like, a shipment of live cows, and, like,

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,800
to have the meat super fresh or something, you know? So, I'm like, okay, let's go look at cows.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Yeah, sure. DIY. So, I hold Dylan by his hand, and she brings us back into the cutter, cut place,

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,080
where they're, you know, cutting up the dead animals, and she opens up the huge freezer.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,160
So, come on in. I'm like, well, this is not looking good. These probably aren't alive,

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,800
and then I'm thinking, are these, you know, we get in there, and it's just this huge room full of

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,240
hanging skinned cows. It was disgusting, but he thought it was fascinating. He thought it was

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,920
so cool, and then, like, he totally was, he totally connected, like, when I bought, like,

44
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,120
some wrapped meat, you know, to butcher's paper. He's like, oh, that's from the cow. I was like,

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,440
oh, well, he doesn't seem to be affected by it, but I was.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, here's what I think's interesting, and I think this translates into the Linux space as

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,120
well, is that if you walk into a situation or an operating system without a preconceived notion,

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,160
a lot of times, the reaction might surprise the people around you.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,600
You know, it's so interesting you say that, because we're going to talk,

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,920
we're going to get a little more into this Ubuntu thing, and, of course,

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,960
Unity is one of the first topics that comes up when you talk about Ubuntu,

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,200
and I think there's so many strong, polarizing opinions. It's such a polarizing topic,

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,200
and there has been a couple circumstances in my personal, you know, experience, but also,

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,960
I was talking with Michael Domic from Coder Radio. He switched a couple people on his team

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:32,360
over to Ubuntu this week, and their immediate response was, like, delight and fascination.

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Like, they didn't have any of the baggage of, well, Unity used to be like this, and then they

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,280
broke it. Like, none of that was there, right? And so they were just enjoying it, which is,

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,720
which was an interesting thing, and so I want to talk about that a little bit, but I thought first

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,840
we should get into some follow-up from last week's show. I like to, we have a mail sack towards the

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,280
end, but I like to do a little follow-up just to kind of keep the thread of continuity between

61
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,360
episodes, and our first plan, thank you, sir, our first one came in from Jameson.

62
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,200
All right. Now, last week, I said that I was managing my photos by using G+, because they

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,080
have a really good photo management system where you just take the picture in the G+,

64
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,600
app, uploads them to Google+, privately, and then Google+, like, has face detection. They

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,760
auto-enhance pictures. They figure out which ones are in the best focus and sort of highlight them.

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,880
Like, there's a whole bunch of, there's a whole array of features that Google+, has. It's really

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,880
nice. Now, Jameson didn't have a replacement for all of that kind of stuff, but he did say,

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm not sure about the management capabilities of G+, but the own cloud Android client does

69
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,160
auto-upload, and you can have it go up to own cloud, then you can view the library,

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,400
the gallery, on your own cloud installation. He says he's completely replaced using Dropbox doing

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,720
that. That's interesting. You know, the more I read about stuff like this, and people that are

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,600
kind of migrating to that, the more I think, what types of own cloud companies and services are out

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,080
there providing services for people that just want that experience, but maybe in a self-contained,

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,320
pre-ready-to-go box. See, this is, I was trying to talk Alan into, now he's just too busy,

75
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,920
so I totally understand why he hasn't done it, but I was telling Alan, like, this could be a

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,560
business for scale engine. Exactly. That's what I was thinking. You toss up a VM, or in his case,

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,440
a jail, of an own cloud instance, because there are downsides to having it on your own connection,

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,360
especially for people who have more restrictive ISPs, bandwidth caps, you know, all the dynamic

79
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,600
IP, all that kind of stuff. That's an excellent point, yes. I really think there could be somebody

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,400
who's just like, here, we'll just roll you an own cloud instance. We'll update the security patches

81
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,480
for you, we'll deploy it for you, we'll give you a login, and then you own it. If only there were

82
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,440
more Linux and BSD administrators out there, right? Only me, Matt. We need more in this world.

83
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,360
All right. Well, Pedro writes in on a little bit of the KDE topic. He says,

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,480
hi, Chris and Matt. I really love the recent shows for both last and unplugged.

85
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Finding in a good alternatives to cloud-based services is something I think many of us will

86
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,600
find very important these days. Now, here's, I feel like there should be a but here. In the last

87
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,720
show, you said that your KDE config broke again, but you are moving, and you are moving to know.

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,600
I've been very happy KDE Plasma user for some months, and won't desktop environment hop again

89
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,760
in the near future. But what you said about the GNOME guys integrating these cool Linux-specific

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,400
technologies got me thinking about how KDE is going to approach these changes. They are also

91
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,480
going to have some pretty significant changes soon with Framework 5 and Plasma Workspaces 2,

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,080
which sound very exciting. I was wondering if you could get somebody from the KDE camp,

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,080
like Aaron or Joss, on the show to discuss it with them, and also the Wayland transition,

94
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,240
maybe even your recent config troubles, ugly defaults, etc. Good luck and keep up the big

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,800
shows, Pedro. I kind of like that idea. One thing I really would love to get the community's help on

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,440
is if anybody out there has experience with, I don't know, with radio or podcast where they have

97
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,080
lined up interviews with folks, we'd love to talk. Certainly. I think Matt and I have great ideas,

98
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
but there's just a lot of things we have to do during the week, and interviews just take up a

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,400
little bit extra time to line up, and I would love to have them much more frequently on the Linux

100
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,040
Action Show. So if anybody out there has some work with that, shoot me an email,

101
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,360
chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com, and we'll chat some more. Maybe there's an arrangement we can

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,680
work out, maybe a few Bitcoins or even a few PayPal dollars we can throw your way if you can

103
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,200
help line up a series of great interviews. And some of them, like Aaron, I'm sure we could probably

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,240
just ping Aaron and just figure out a time that works for him and bring him on, but there's a

105
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,200
whole array of folks that I'd love to have on the Linux Action Show, and I'd love to have more

106
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,680
interviews on that show. Well, and I definitely would echo the whole timing scheme of it is that

107
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,960
I've been trying to track down a couple of people, and it's just trying to make sure that we're on

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,880
the same page as far as date and time and whether that works and whether they have things going on.

109
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,960
Yeah, it definitely could use some help there. Yeah, you know, it's one of those things where

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,280
it's hard to, there's always ways to record it when we're not like doing a regular show,

111
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,200
which is with seven shows now it's hard to find a time when we're not doing another show,

112
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,160
but that's always possible. It'd be great whenever we can. Also, we could do things where people just

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,120
join us on mumble here during this show. You know, they just come on and chat with us. Which is cool.

114
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,360
Yeah, like for example, if you just had a new distro release or if you had something come out,

115
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,840
come on in here and tell us about it. We're not going to yell at you for coming on and

116
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,360
tell us about the cool open source software you're working on. Join our mumble server,

117
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,280
you know, join our mumble server. In fact, if somebody would paste the mumble server info into

118
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,000
the chat room right now, that'd be helpful. All right, so last bit of follow up before we

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,040
move into the meat, as it were, I guess the main course.

120
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,880
Main course. Yeah, I say main course sounds good. Brandon writes in, he says,

121
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,920
Hi, Chris and Matt, I wanted to share some thoughts about the comments you guys had about

122
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,880
these kids these days who don't understand what's going on behind the screen. Now,

123
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,720
we got a lot of feedback about this. So we got one more in the mail sack, but this was a popular

124
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,200
topic. He says, I'm not denying it. You're totally right about it. I just don't necessarily see it as

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,280
a horrible thing. Now, remember what we said is these kids today, the damn kids on our lawn,

126
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,560
didn't know how it works behind the touchscreen. Like they were touching the screens and clicking

127
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,320
the mice, but they had no idea what any of the context behind it. So don't get me wrong,

128
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,840
we obviously need some younger kids to get into computers to keep things going along,

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,120
keep going long term. But there isn't any need for every kid to get into it. Computers these days are

130
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,640
going through the same cycles that all big new technologies in history have over time.

131
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,760
For example, when ancient civilizations first discovered how to create metal items in the

132
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,200
bronze age, they had far more blacksmiths than latter iron age civilizations. For a lot of

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,520
reasons, it was a new amazing technology that was making revolutionary changes in their lives. And

134
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,000
everyone wanted to replace their stone tools with metal ones. In some ancient cultures,

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,800
it was a rite of passage for boys to create their own metal weapons.

136
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,960
Okay. All right. Okay. I see where he's going. That's actually kind of cool to know.

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,080
Yeah. And it also, you know, remember my argument was, is this is more important than your average

138
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,320
passing technology because it's so integrated in all of our lives. Well, you know, what's

139
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
our metals and plastics and things like that. This is true. This is true.

140
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,400
He goes on to say, we live in a very specialized world. Things have grown so advanced and complex

141
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,840
that for everyone to understand how everything they use in their daily life works would be

142
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,920
impossible. For example, sure, you may know how your computer works, but you know how much,

143
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,680
do you know much about how your car or your home air conditioner or your own body work for that

144
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,760
matter? Any of the other dozens of things you use every single day. Sure, these kinds, sure,

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,680
these kids today might not know what's going on behind their computer screens, but they are going

146
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,160
to grow up and learn all kinds of things that you don't know. One of these kids may grow up to become

147
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,480
a general contractor. He won't know how to build a website for his business. So he'll hire someone

148
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,200
that does. In turn, someone that can build a website may hire him to add a deck to the back

149
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,640
of their house. That's just how modern society works. Thanks, Brandon. I would expand on that

150
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,680
with the following. First of all, I totally hear what he's saying as far as, you know,

151
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,640
the kids obviously are going to go into their own specialty and find their own way. And I think

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,080
that's great, but I think it's important to realize myself is a good example of this.

153
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,040
I have worked as a machine operator. I can lay carpet. I can do vinyl. I know how to

154
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,040
change my oil and change my tires. I'm not great at it, but I can do it. And I also know a lot of

155
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,160
this Linux-y stuff that I'm always talking about. And I can also do some minor electrical work as

156
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,720
well. So I've tried to widen my range a little bit, and I think it wouldn't kill kids to perhaps

157
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,520
consider doing the same thing, both in tech and other areas as well, maybe a little carpentry,

158
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,000
maybe a little this, little hands-on stuff, you know, wouldn't kill them. Most kids today can't

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,840
do squat. They can watch, you know, SpongeBob and text on their phone. That's been my experience.

160
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,920
I'm living with one right now, and it's driving me nuts. So it's kind of a – it's frustrating

161
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,800
because I don't see a lot of that – boy, you know –

162
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
Passion or desire to learn.

163
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeah, a lot of the passion and the desire just seems to be like vacuum

164
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,680
packed right out of the room.

165
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
Muhtar Django in our chat room says,

166
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,600
if you don't know how it works, you don't own it. It's interesting. I could see that. I agree

167
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,320
with you. I think there's always – I always strive to – so like the examples you cited,

168
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,400
like I have a pretty good idea how I would change the oil on my truck. I just don't ever want to do

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,720
it.

170
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,440
Oh, same here. No, I assume – I'll pay someone else to do it.

171
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,760
I do know how my air conditioner works. And I also try to, you know, very closely pay

172
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,960
attention to how my body works, even though I suck at it quite badly. It's a learning process.

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
Yeah, I just don't care.

174
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,560
I know what it has to say. I just don't want to listen. But I think at the same time,

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,560
I still want to make the argument, although maybe just less emphatically,

176
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,160
that computers represent a new kind of technology. Because, you see, what I see happening more so

177
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,200
than just not knowing how they work is they're being perverted into consumption driving machines,

178
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,120
right? All of these apps that want you to buy things and Amazon mobile apps and this and that,

179
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,880
they're consumption machines. But they can also be information machines and tools and learning

180
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,360
and empowerment machines, right? I mean, the greatest thing about an Android device is that

181
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,920
it can give you Wikipedia and Google at your fingertips anywhere in the world. And at the

182
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,840
same time, it can also be used to sell you crap you don't need, track you, and all these kinds of

183
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,120
things. And I just I fear that because they are so capable of a broad range of either benefits

184
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,920
or abuses, it becomes incumbent upon the person to have a better understanding so that way they're

185
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,560
not being taken advantage of. It just seems like there's more possibility for abuse.

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,440
And I think also, again, kind of bouncing off of that a little bit. The only way I see

187
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,960
overcoming this is we come up with apps that essentially make Wikipedia some anime thing

188
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,880
that's like lots of flashing and lots of stuff going on. I mean, like turn everything into a-

189
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Like a 3D game.

190
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,760
A 3D game, multiplayer, who can change the oil the fastest, the best?

191
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,240
No, what you need is Wikipedia, you can text, right?

192
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,640
Oh yeah. I just changed my oil. It's like Instagram, your oil change. I mean, I don't

193
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,840
know. I mean, I've got to figure out a way to like sex this up for the kids so they're more

194
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,040
interested, I guess. I don't know.

195
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,720
I think we'll find, I don't know, something in me tells me we might find an equilibrium here

196
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,680
somewhere. The only thing is we're also moving down to a period where it's like my- So I

197
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,400
mentioned I have two vehicles. I mentioned I think I could change the oil in my truck.

198
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,160
I don't think I could change the oil in my car because when I open the hood of my car,

199
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,000
it's got a plastic covering over the whole damn thing.

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,040
No kidding, right?

201
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,160
That's what the smartphone and the tablet is now. It's that same thing.

202
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,200
I think you're exactly it. Yep. That's the plastic cover. And it's like working on cars.

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,720
It's the same thing. I'm not a- My brother's more of a mechanic than I am, but I think that

204
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,280
older cars have always been considered easier versus the newer cars, which have all the computer

205
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,760
crap and all that stuff put into it that takes special certifications and whatnot. Yeah, I think

206
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,600
that definitely presents a challenge, but I think just finding, learning how various things work and

207
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,800
finding a way to make that interesting to kids because you are competing with those media

208
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,680
consumption boxes. How do you- Trying to present it outside of that media consumption box is not

209
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,840
going to happen. I think we've established that. My 16-year-old nephew is going to definitely

210
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,960
testify to that. I've been dealing with that unbelievably because every time I turn around,

211
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,480
he's got his face buried in his phone.

212
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,680
I think as people learn that can be tools to express an opinion or a view or as they become

213
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,720
more communication devices, some of that might change. The flip side of this is that that means

214
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,040
the remaining people who take the time and the trouble and jump through the hoops to educate

215
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,520
themselves. And let's not even talk about today. Let's talk about when my kid is in his 30s,

216
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,360
what's that going to be like? What's the difference going to be like? And if he goes

217
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,160
through all of the hoops to become an expert in these things, he could potentially be a niche

218
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,720
skill. And maybe that means he's got a well-paying gig, that kind of thing. So there's potentially

219
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,600
positives to this too.

220
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,880
Absolutely. I definitely think that centralizing your skill set is definitely it. But I also like

221
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,520
the idea of just knowing how to pull a toilet and replace it. I think that's mandatory.

222
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:28,040
And like Brandon says, when we live in a society where these monkeys without hair

223
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,560
now have 3000 pound vehicles that can go 80 miles per hour, we have all of these things that were

224
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,240
never originally envisioned by evolution. You really can't expect us to keep track of everything.

225
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,720
It's just not in our nature. So you do need technology to sort of relieve the burden

226
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,280
a little bit. So I don't want to sit here and say,

227
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,440
you are worthless if you don't know how this stuff works. I just want to say you need to be aware of

228
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,960
what you could be getting taken advantage of. You need to be aware of the downsides.

229
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,160
Absolutely. How to spot a contractor coming in and saying he's going to give you a quote and

230
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,400
how to call bullshit on it. How to actually know when he's pulling one over your eyes. Just little

231
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,480
things that around the house. Doesn't have to be anything great or extravagant. Even just house

232
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,200
maintenance stuff, like you said with the air conditioner. Little things like that can save

233
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,760
you a lot of heartache.

234
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,600
And I'm going to get controversial here, but I say we have this play out in the medical industry,

235
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,240
right? People like Brandon said, have no idea how their bodies work. They have no idea what role

236
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,640
nutrition plays. They have no idea how to properly take care of themselves. So they go to the doctor

237
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,880
in the costume, you know, the white coat costume that he wears, where he makes a bunch of money

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
and all of the office ladies that he works with are completely scared of him. And then he tells

239
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,640
you what to do and you say, okay, thank you, master. And you go home and you do it because

240
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,120
you've never educated yourself about health. Right? Exactly. This is true. I just don't want

241
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,520
that to happen in computers, but it already has, hasn't it?

242
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,640
It has happened to computers. And I think, you know, coming back full circle, back into the

243
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,200
whole technology side of things is that I think that's what Linux provides us with an opportunity

244
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,320
to have. It allows us to see cause and effect. It allows us to see how our actions can actually

245
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,840
generate an actual reaction that we can visualize, experience and enjoy.

246
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,840
It allows you to go as deep as you want, right? You can grab Ubuntu, burn it to a disk or a USB

247
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,800
drive and install it and maybe go six months before you have to open up the terminal, right?

248
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,680
Or you can do Linux from scratch. Like you've got that whole range or, you know, you can be an end

249
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,600
user or you can create code and develop for it. And actually, you know, so it, it does, again,

250
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,800
I think this is going to be another huge advantage to Linux down the road is.

251
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,440
I think so.

252
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,200
As these, as, as we get mobilized on all of the commercial platforms and everything goes to the

253
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,600
cloud, there's still going to be Linux. And if you want to just learn how something works from top

254
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,480
to bottom, it's like the track you're going to get on, you're not going to go to college and take a

255
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,640
Windows nine course on Metro, right? Cause that's not going to teach you any of the fundamentals.

256
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,280
You're going to go to a class and you're going to, they're going to be using Linux.

257
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
It's just going to become one more use case for Linux.

258
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,680
That's true. And I know Windows admins that are experiencing that now that they're beginning to

259
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,200
find themselves. I, one of them actually had to deal with CentOS here recently. And actually

260
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,560
we talked a little bit about that. And it's interesting that even no matter how hard you try,

261
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,240
even if you're in a Windows world, you're still going to be dealing with it. It's going to happen.

262
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,480
Oh, and more and more so Matt. And we actually get contacts from, you know, a lot of guys,

263
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,040
Hey, I'm a Windows guy. Hey, you know, I need a lot of the, cause you don't want tech snap.

264
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,880
We take a lot of like IT sysadmin questions for people that are trying to solve a problem

265
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,680
with their gig or whatever. And we hear from a lot of people who run Windows shops that are

266
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,000
moving to Linux or moving to BSD because they need X and they need Y. And it's, it seems to

267
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,480
be a trend and ZFS. I mean, this is why I harp on Linux action show and unplug so much about ZFS is

268
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,200
because every week, you know, we get a dozen emails about people switching to BSD because

269
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,800
they want native ZFS support. And I'm not exaggerating at all. It is, I have watched

270
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:51,160
trends happen as I do these shows and the migration to ZFS and BSD too is real and it's

271
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,360
happening and it's happening in the enterprise too. It's happening at the small and medium

272
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,080
business level too. And it's like the ZFS has these wider range of features that Microsoft

273
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,920
is trying to catch up to in Server 2012. And they have some good stuff in Server 2012,

274
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,840
but at the end of the day, it's still NTFS and it's still their black magic and people get

275
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,080
uncomfortable with that. That's true. That's true. But now here's the question I would ask you,

276
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,320
would you gauge this as more of an IT driven thing or is this just a bunch of excited home users?

277
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,760
You know what it is, is that, no, if anything, it's more on the IT side because we actually,

278
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:32,120
we talked about this in last week's TechSnap is ZFS was created really with enterprise in mind.

279
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,680
Like if you want to add a drive, you want to add some space to an array in ZFS in a pool,

280
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,880
you're in two drives minimum before you even are comfortably expanding that array. And really,

281
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,680
you should probably do three or five drives at a time. So I mean, it's a serious production

282
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,440
system and that's why it allows you to get the features and abilities of these massive

283
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:03,800
$50,000, $60,000, $70,000 EMC arrays on your own fiber attached storage that's hanging off the back

284
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,480
of a free BSD box. So it's allowing for this huge set of advantages without all that overhead of

285
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,440
that proprietary enclosure and software. That sounds real. Just from your description,

286
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,120
that's quite appealing. I can definitely see why IT would be jumping all over that.

287
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,280
Yeah. Yeah. And it's just logical. It's like you would be stupid not to.

288
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,800
It's another trend away from sort of the, even in big window shops, because that's where our

289
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,440
emails are coming from too, is guys that, well, we're windows here, we're windows here,

290
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,120
but we're doing a ZFS array here for our storage. How do we integrate these two things?

291
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,560
Oh, wow. Wow.

292
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,240
It's going to be a crazy world.

293
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,440
It's going to be something to watch, I think, in 14. I really do.

294
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,000
All right, Matt. Well, before we jump into our main topic du jour this week, I want to thank

295
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,880
our sponsor. That is Ting.com. And Ting is mobile. It makes sense. Now,

296
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Ting is an MVNO of the Nationwide Sprint Network. So that means if you've got good sprint coverage,

297
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,920
you're going to get great Ting service in your area. And for me, now I'm lucky. I don't know

298
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,400
where this is for everybody, but in my neck of the woods, I get LTE, 3G, and YMAC. So I have like

299
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,040
the pick of the spectrum for myself. And the thing that's beautiful about that is I only pay

300
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,960
for what I use. So I don't have to get into these complicated data programs. I don't have to get

301
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,440
into these complicated contracts. It's no contracts, no early termination, no bundling

302
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,840
or ride-along services. You just pay for what you use at the end of the month. However, minutes,

303
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,800
megabytes, and messages, it all gets added into a bucket. And then pow, Bob's your uncle. That's

304
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,360
what you end up paying. The average Ting bill is like $21. I think I've been using some Waze

305
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,760
this month. Oh, yeah. Good stuff. I think mine's like 18 bucks right now.

306
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Yeah. Yeah. That's not bad. No, for the amount of data. Plus, it's one of those things where like,

307
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,200
oh, I left my Wi-Fi off for a day. Well, no big deal. It's not really a big deal. I don't have to

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,280
worry about it. And with no add-on charges, you get voicemail, caller ID, tethering, hotspot,

309
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,640
three-way calling, call forwarding, and other features that are all just part of the service.

310
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,280
You don't have to have add-on. No mysterious line items on your bill. It's really simple billing.

311
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,880
Fantastic website. Makes it crazy easy to manage. Unlimited devices on one plan. Yeah, go ahead.

312
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,200
Well, I was going to say what's cool is with mine, I oftentimes forget whether I'm on Wi-Fi or I'm

313
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,760
on the 4G network because I set alerts to alert me of anything I care about through the Ting

314
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,000
control panel. So, you know, it's great because I don't have to worry about it. I know my bill's

315
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,440
going to be ridiculously cheap and I'll probably be getting the coin from it from my couch.

316
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,960
Yeah, I know, right? And you know what's so wild about LTE now is, and WiMAX is like this too,

317
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,760
in some areas, it is faster than some folks' broadband. Their physical connection. Yeah.

318
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,200
And like Matt said, that powerful online control panel lets you take control of your account. You

319
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,760
get your usage information, your bills. You can activate and deactivate devices. And of course,

320
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,040
if you get stuck at any time, they have a no-hold customer support. You just call them.

321
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,560
1-855-TING-FTW. And that's any time between 8am or 8pm and a real person answers the phone. You

322
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,000
can also go to help.ting.com if you're a do-it-yourselfer. They've got forms over there.

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,440
Also at ting.com slash hangout or hangouts. I gotta look that up. They do, they do hangouts

324
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,640
and it's just they have an embed spot. So you always go to the same spot on their site, which

325
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,520
I didn't even know you could do that with hangouts. You always go to the same spot on their

326
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,120
website and they have a live Q&A. If you've got some questions, you can ask them. Of course,

327
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,160
they've also got active Twitter and Facebook accounts where they're answering questions,

328
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,760
along with that 1-855-TING-FTW. It's pretty great stuff. I've been rocking an HTC One. First,

329
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,640
I got an Evo with my Ting service. I brought my own Evo. And so that meant my first month of

330
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,120
Ting was totally free because if you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to save $25 off

331
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,640
your first month of service if you bring your own device. If you don't have a device yet,

332
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,200
they're going to take $25 off it when you go to linux.ting.com. So I brought my own. I got my

333
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,000
first month for free. Yeah, even though we're a sponsor, I pay for my service. I just want to put

334
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,960
that up front. I've paid for all my devices and I pay for my service. And much like now,

335
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,600
I make my choice based on the license of a software. I make my choice on if Ting supports

336
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,040
that device because Ting is the carrier that respects their users. Ting is a mobile ISP. You

337
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,120
guys know how those other companies are taking advantage of you and Ting doesn't do that. People

338
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,840
love Ting and you're people. So think about that. It's a match made in heaven. So go over to Linux

339
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,360
dot ting.com, save $25. The sooner you start, the more you will save. And I think you're going to

340
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,600
be really impressed. And you know, they got some great device like the kind of what the Moto X

341
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,680
kind of what the next just a little bit want it. Yeah, you've been like just drooling over it like

342
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,000
fine at your screen. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for the final report from from Mr. Dominic. And if

343
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,600
when he gives me the thumbs up or thumbs down, then it might be a Christmas present. I'm just

344
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,240
kind of waiting to see if the Nexus 5 comes around on the Ting service because it's got to be on

345
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,840
the Ting service because it's got to be on Ting if I'm going to get it because I only use Ting. So

346
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,520
thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Okay, man, I wanted to I was I was trying to

347
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,960
put my thoughts together. And here's what I came up with. So I think last. So the last time we

348
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,200
reviewed Ubuntu, we hadn't tried the arch challenge yet. And I think this might have kind of brought

349
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,320
it on. But we titled Ubuntu 13.04 best but boring. Right now, essentially, it was a big meh, right?

350
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,400
And that was kind of the whole thing of it. It really wasn't anything to speak of that was exciting

351
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,560
or new. Right. But it wasn't horrible. It just it just was. So I would propose to you that perhaps

352
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,400
Ubuntu 13.10 could be the most boring Ubuntu release ever. But that's hard to gauge, right?

353
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Yeah. But boring helped Windows XP become the widest deployed Windows desktop OS in history.

354
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,360
It's still used today by 31 percent of Windows users, according to Wikipedia.

355
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,360
But what's practical? Okay, so let's back up from there. So if I was Miguel Itacasa, I would argue

356
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,920
that Linux could have used more boring back in the day. And because we weren't boring enough,

357
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,760
he believes that a lot of a lot of the changing of the back ends and APIs and things like that

358
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,960
hurt commercial adoption by large scale development shops. Right. I would agree with that. And so,

359
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,920
whereas, you know, if you are a little more steady than the people building apps around you

360
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,440
are able to target you better. But what's the practical cost of being boring? Stagnation,

361
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,880
really. Right. When you're boring, it means you might be stagnating a little bit.

362
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,440
I would say I'm actually beginning to see evidence of that with some of my Ubuntu articles,

363
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,720
the article and also just with articles I've written for other people that we're seeing

364
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,440
tremendous traffic. We've seen huge drops and people aren't searching for it anymore. And I

365
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,960
don't know if that's because this stuff's not a problem or because people are going to other

366
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,960
distros or what exactly is happening. Yeah. I mean, you know, stagnation, you know,

367
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,960
maybe as a platform, stagnation has some benefits. You know, you could argue XP stagnation came at

368
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,440
the time where the Windows market was relatively mature, whereas Windows, you know, that's Linux

369
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,640
is not really in that same space. Ubuntu is not really in that same position. They might not ever

370
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,760
be. So I think, I don't know, I think stagnation, I think stagnation hurts in this case. I think

371
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,560
it's too early for them to be stagnant. I mean, there's a time where you can stagnate for a period

372
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,280
before the next big thing. And that's okay. But I feel like that they stagnated early and it's

373
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,440
happening for a too long, a lengthy of a period of time. And then of course, with the whole mirror

374
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,560
situation in the next release, not happening, that's not really helping either. And of course,

375
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,040
there's all, there's the Nvidia, you know, stuff going back and forth as to what's going on with

376
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,720
that. How's it going to be affecting with others? You know, lots and lots of stuff behind doors.

377
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,520
We don't know what's really going on. Yeah. And I would argue too, like maybe this is the

378
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,920
case for maybe they should have gone rolling. Remember when that whole debate came up and we

379
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,200
were like, ah, I don't know about rolling, but I thought about it, you know, after using, I'm going

380
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,680
to say it, but after using Arch for a while, Linux is a constantly evolving beast. The collective

381
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,000
output, it's the collective output of tens of thousands of developers taking their ideas and

382
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,920
turning it into code. And it happens every single hour of every single day. So stagnation is not

383
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,960
inherent to this evolving beast, right? It is the opposite of what Linux is. It's a whole different

384
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,800
solution to what Linux is. It's a forced solution that's grafted. They're taking an old style, like

385
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,040
sell your software in CDs in the store. And they're trying to graft it on top of an always

386
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,960
moving, evolving beast to make some sort of model from, but the two things are not really that

387
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,960
compatible. And I wonder if, I wonder if now we're seeing like the strain of that model here with,

388
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,480
cause we have these expectations built up around these six month cycles. We have like, you know,

389
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,360
deadline feature that we used to see all the time. And that's the problem is that because they're

390
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,840
dumping so much of the resources into all this, quite frankly, behind the scenes stuff that for

391
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,840
the front end user really isn't all that exciting to hear about. It's more exciting for the geeks

392
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,320
and less exciting for just casual folks. I think they really will need to go to a rolling release

393
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,800
because quite honestly, all the distros that I'm really drawn to, I don't care what it is. You

394
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,960
know, I find myself more excited about a rolling distro than I do a stagnant. Yeah. And to your

395
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:44,680
point. So, um, today I updated my arch installation and I got gnome 310. Ooh, I'll see. There you go.

396
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,560
In 10 minutes on my machine on arch in the morning, in one series of updates, I got more

397
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,760
features and changes than I feel like I'm seeing in a six month product cycle in 1310. I feel like

398
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,640
in one update on arch, I have more of a revolutionary change than, than the collective 1310 entire

399
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,760
distribution. Exactly. And I, I, I wonder if distribution should maybe trans transition to

400
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,880
more to like, instead of being where they snapshot a moment in time and then they quality check and

401
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,960
they roll that all up and they shoot and they ship it. Uh, maybe they could, you know, and each and

402
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,320
you consider this, maybe they could instead just move to like caretakers of a, of a, of a safe

403
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,320
rolling distro. Like each major distro is building up all these sophisticated automated testing

404
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,480
systems. And while they're not perfect, you know, if you have more people using rolling software,

405
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,400
if you have more people using more current open source software, then that's going to make the

406
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,880
upstream software better. And then that has cascading effects across the entire Linux

407
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,880
ecosystem because then everybody is submitting bugs on the same upstream code. Everybody's

408
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,400
getting the patches, everybody's fixing. I know this is a utopia, but it could have a

409
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,080
dramatic adoption improvement on the adoption of fresh open source software, which could,

410
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,320
which could then drive a whole new, you know, momentum around software development.

411
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,200
Well, and there are distros that are already do that. Manjaro is fairly close to that in that you

412
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,480
have your stay. I hate to say, I know I keep plugging it, but it's true. Uh, they, you know,

413
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,320
you have your stable, which is basically very periodic snapshots, probably about once a month,

414
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,600
no big deal. Not really. It's kind of a stagnant rolling kind of thing and it's safe and it's

415
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,680
stable and whatever. And then you've got your, uh, unstable repos that you can go to, which are

416
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,000
quite frequent. Uh, there's a lot going on there. And so if you want to experience more of a, uh,

417
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,720
rapid experience, you can do that too. So I see other distribut- distributions of being, uh,

418
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,560
looking into that. I see Ubuntu should look into something like that. You have your long-term release

419
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,280
that is basically just bam, here it is. It's not changing like it is now. And oh, hey, by the way,

420
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,960
the other one is constantly evolving. That would solve the problem, I think.

421
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,840
Yeah. I kind of feel like maybe there's a bit of like a bias. I feel like people are afraid of

422
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,840
upstream fresh code. Like we have a culture of fear that something's going to break, even if-

423
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,400
It's long term.

424
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,120
And even if something hasn't broken yet, oh, it's going to break. Just you wait, it's going to break.

425
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,720
Um, but I wonder if we couldn't maybe have a discussion around, like, there's gotta be

426
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,760
a middle ground here because it, I don't, I don't think this, well, at least for Canonical,

427
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
it's just not working. I mean, I don't want to-

428
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,800
And even just snapshotting that they don't have to go full art style. They just need to actually

429
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,480
have monthly snapshots. That's all they have to do. Just whatever it is. They can still do a rolling

430
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,640
release in their, in their typical, uh, dynamic, you know, release. And then of course their long-term

431
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,880
releases as it is now, then they're not totally just every single day, new stuff, new stuff,

432
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,400
new stuff. Cause that would just be anarchy on the forums for a bit too big of a change.

433
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,080
But I think snapshots would work for them.

434
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,480
Yeah. Yeah. I'll ask the mumble room. I mean, what do you guys think? Do you think that, uh,

435
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,320
we are sort of seeing the, the end of, we live in a world now where when there's a new version

436
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,160
of Google docs, Google just pushes it to your web browser. When there's a new version of Yahoo mail,

437
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,320
you just log in one day and you get it. Are we now living in a world where we should just be

438
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,160
getting new things, push to our machines from time to time and going with these big snapshots?

439
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,720
Is this awkward? I'm not sure that's a good thing. I think we're looking at this completely wrong.

440
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,840
All right. Give it to me. Google has their own distribution in-house. The government has their

441
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,760
own distribution in-house police departments. Everyone has their own distribution, which they

442
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:14,600
actually maintain themselves. There is actually no need for an upstream distribution to do what

443
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,160
the companies are going to do anyway. So why couldn't then canonical say,

444
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,960
all right, Ubuntu is a rolling release. Here's LTSs. If you want to take those and fork those,

445
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,800
have at it, you know, you go make gubuntu.

446
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,280
Yeah. You're assuming that the rolling releases are by default good and they always work and

447
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,480
they will work. But see, I asked you this, would you use Arch in a production environment

448
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,280
or would you use a more stable distribution like Debian or something?

449
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,000
Well, I do use it for media production. I was considering rolling a home server running it.

450
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,960
I don't know. I like the idea of an LTS for a server.

451
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah. That was my point is that, yeah, it's not going to be appropriate to put that into a big

452
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,200
time important role. But if you have long-term releases that exist as they do now, that literally

453
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,000
has no effect on it. I just feel like we should.

454
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,680
I feel like technology should be good enough that we could all be just be using rolling releases.

455
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,000
Like let's get testing done. Let's write software so that it doesn't break after an update.

456
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,680
It's not the technology, it's the people.

457
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:20,760
I think Arch is fine in a production environment. The only time I've ever had

458
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,200
issues with Arch was something I did, something I screwed up. So if you know what you're doing,

459
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,320
Arch is fine. That said, I mean, that could be said about any distribution. If you don't know

460
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:40,280
what you're doing, you can completely screw up. You also got to realize that Arch is community

461
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,480
driven, right? That there's not a team behind it, really, except for just, you know, the very,

462
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,360
very minimal stuff. But it's mostly community driven.

463
00:34:52,360 --> 00:35:04,280
There is a very horrible bug in KDE which does not copy files and doesn't tell you about it. And

464
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,080
this has been a bug for five years, meaning if you copy from one location to another,

465
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,320
it will create the folders, but it won't actually copy the files. This has been a bug for five

466
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,560
years. This is one of the biggest projects in Linux. And this is a very critical bug.

467
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,360
And it has not been even addressed in three or four years. Now, imagine this. Imagine if this

468
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:36,200
bug is not an exception. Imagine if such bugs exist in all big projects, like GNOME, Ubuntu,

469
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,080
Unity, KDE, so on and so forth. Now, if we are ignoring such horrible bugs in favor of new

470
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,120
features, I don't actually personally believe that that's a good way forward. You know, yes,

471
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:53,960
the idea of a rolling release and new updates is very nice. On the other hand, if there's still

472
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,640
a lot of serious work to be done on older releases, maybe that should be the focus.

473
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:08,040
Well, so your point is sort of what I was... So one of the reasons I like using Arch is because

474
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,720
I want to... Because there are a lot of open source programs are missing some features that

475
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,880
I would consider fundamental. I know I shouldn't get on this soapbox, but let's look at Smuxy.

476
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:25,000
I love Smuxy IRC client. It's great. It just needs one checkbox, one checkbox, and that's

477
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,280
hide join and part messages. I know I can set up a filter. I shouldn't have to custom design a

478
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,080
filter where I go Google search the syntax to put into a filter so I don't have to see the

479
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,600
join and part messages. Every other IRC client on the planet can hide join and part messages.

480
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,640
So maybe one day the Smuxy guy is going to add that. So here's my thought. I want to be on a

481
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,320
distribution that the moment that Smuxy gets updated, I got it. So the other last week when

482
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,120
VLC got an update, I saw the headline and you know what? I did an update on my system and I

483
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:04,040
had it. I had that new VLC that had those new features. I had it immediately. And as I sit here

484
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,680
and I set up an Ubuntu box and I download a dab and I downloaded dab and I have six or seven

485
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,360
dabs downloaded so I can get something installed and I think, well, great. Now I'm just going to

486
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,760
sit at these crappy versions that probably have some sort of bug. It's stupid. It's a system that

487
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,080
doesn't work anymore. It's not taking advantage of the fact that we have thousands of people out

488
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,200
there creating grand features for us every single hour and we never get any of them. We never get

489
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,280
any of them when we have these snapshots. I think a rolling release would be perfect

490
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,560
because it's stable, but it still could be bleeding edge as you want. The only problem

491
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:49,800
with that, it's very hard to get used to. But I know it is good for companies and the family.

492
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,680
You know, you're going to have to teach them how to keep their system updated or you can just give

493
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:04,520
them one that is, you know, ready to go. You guys got to get your mics worked out.

494
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,760
Jesus, that was awful. It sounds like speaker and mic. Yeah. All right. So anyways, you know,

495
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,120
my conclusion is that we kind of just have to adjust our expectations on some of this stuff and

496
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:24,120
it's becoming maybe less about the flash and it's going to become more about what can get done,

497
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:31,000
right? And how you do it and what you can do. Like, you know, so I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 this week

498
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,320
to give us, to get, you know, my just so I am living in it. And there's been a couple of things

499
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,520
that have worked for me that didn't work under Arch. And there are certain benefits to having

500
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,480
something that's a little more targetable. F.Lux is a program I use that automatically adjusts the

501
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,800
color temperature of my screens when the sun sets. It's kind of, oh yes, it's neat, right?

502
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Never works under Arch for me. It just never works. I've never had it work under Arch or

503
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:03,240
Manjaro. Yeah. Works just fine under Ubuntu. Just fine. Works just fine. Super Frog HD from Steam

504
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,440
never even starts under Arch. I don't know why I've deleted and reinstalled it. I've,

505
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,720
I've Googled around to see if like I need some libraries that I don't know about.

506
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,000
Never could get it working under Arch. I install it one click under Ubuntu starts right up. First

507
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,720
try. Interesting. Yeah. It's, it's fascinating. And you know, and going back to what we were

508
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,160
talking about, uh, just, you know, what works where and how all that sort of stuff,

509
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,520
I think the big picture stuff here is that, and I want to make sure everybody understands that

510
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,920
we're not saying that you should get rid of long-term releases and just go nothing but

511
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,440
rolling, at least I'm not. And we're not going with nothing but rolling releases. I'm saying

512
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,840
have the option of either or so that you've got your regular folks actually using the rolling

513
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,600
releases, finding the bugs, being active in that environment. But the enterprise folks,

514
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,960
if they choose to still have a long-term release from which to work with, and then everybody wins.

515
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,240
That's all I'm saying. Cause the current model right now on Ubuntu sucks. It sucks hard and it

516
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,480
needs to be fixed. I mean, that's just reality. I think it's suffering from the focus on mobile. So

517
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,760
one of the things that I was going to mention was that there was a post in the development

518
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,200
mailing list that got a lot of people upset and we didn't really get a chance to talk about it

519
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,000
on last, but I thought maybe I'd bring it up here just because it's sort of, it's sort of,

520
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,880
it fits with what we're talking about in terms of focus. So, uh, there was a post that was made by

521
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,640
Sebastian Basher. I don't know how you say the last name. I'm going to give it a shot. Okay. And

522
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,840
he noted that in, uh, they're planning in 1404. So we're talking post 1310, 1404, uh, they plan to

523
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,040
stick with GTK, Gnome 3.8. Now that he lists several reasons for this. Cause now if you figure

524
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,560
3.10 is hitting now, right? Right. And it includes introduces a lot of nice new features, but they're

525
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,000
going to stick with 3.8 even in 1404, which that means. So it's going to be like a five-year

526
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,760
release that they're going to be using this older version of GTK. Number one reason we, uh, Ubuntu

527
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,160
desktop are currently most happy with what we have. Okay. That's a good reason actually. All right.

528
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,920
Number two reason the focus on Ubuntu desktop team is likely to continue to be Ubuntu touch

529
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,760
slash phone next cycle. Yeah. Shocker due to the previous factor, we're going to be limited in

530
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,960
resources to do desktop work. Now he goes on to say there's some other good things too. Uh,

531
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,400
the 310, 3.10 depocates of several things that they need. Uh, and it looks like red hat enterprise

532
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,160
edition might also be going with Gnome 3.8. So that way they'd be kind of compatible with the

533
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,080
other long-term support guy in the business. That's good. Uh, so there's other, there's other

534
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,560
logistical reasons too, but I sure don't like those, uh, first, uh, those first ones there

535
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,200
where they say it's because the desktop team is likely to be continued to focus on touch.

536
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,600
I know this is a horse that I beat, but I think this is a tactical error. And I know they think

537
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,520
they have a purpose and a mission and an opportunity to seize. And I think they're

538
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,640
completely missing the purpose and admission and the opportunity to seize that is actually

539
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,600
happening all around them right now. It's like, I believe canonicals grand vision of having a

540
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,040
boon to be like this, this island of salvation, whereas all of the rats flee windows and Mac,

541
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,120
they finally are there. And it is, I am seeing a boon to deployed in them craziest. Like there

542
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,440
was a thread in our subreddit that guy started a job at a amazon.com and he walks into amazon.com

543
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,160
and all of the machines in his department run a bone to 1204, which is crazy, right?

544
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,760
It's happening everywhere, but there it is. It's the longterm release. And I think the reason for

545
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,240
that and the whole known three, uh, three dot eight thing too, is that the big picture stuff

546
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,320
we got to remember is that people are in these environments looking for a stable and stable

547
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,400
situation. And so I think that if we do continue to see people distro hop and they will, and we'll

548
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,440
see less regular people using, uh, Linux and probably more of the enterprise and more of the

549
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,720
schools and such jumping onto the boon to situation. I don't know. I, it's going to be

550
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,400
interesting as to where it all plays out, but I think in the long run it's, it's not necessarily

551
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,760
a bad thing. I think it's just a shift in viewership or users. So here's what I think. I

552
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,000
think, and I'm, you know, I, I'm going to have a lot to say on Sunday about 1310. There's a lot of

553
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,600
things I've picked up on. We're going to, we're going to cover that, but I think the, the, the

554
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,280
release to really watch will be 1404 because if they just nail it as another good steady release,

555
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,680
folks can use that for years while they work out the mirror stuff, the unity eight stuff that they

556
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,840
are, you know, all this kind of all these hitches they're going to have. They can work those out for

557
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,760
a few years with an L with a good LTS release out there. And then maybe things will work,

558
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,920
work out for them. I don't know. I'm, I still think it's, I think it's damn risky. I think

559
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,320
they're playing it. They have, they have a huge gamble here and I think 1310 is going to suffer

560
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,120
from it. I don't want to blow the review because I, you know, I'm trying to change my set of

561
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,080
parameters in which that I look at it. I'm trying to, I'm trying to adjust that and look at it from

562
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,360
a different angle. And that'll be my attempt for the review on Sunday, but I don't know.

563
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Well, you know, I don't know. I mean, for me, it's like I have, you know, I have both my cutting

564
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,840
edge bleeding edge desktop. And then I also have my aboon two desktop on a separate computer that

565
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,080
I use for a very stable environment. And I think that speaks a lot to it. I think at the end of the

566
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,960
day, different strokes for different folks for myself, if they come out with a really boring,

567
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,560
stable release, I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing, but I do think it's going to

568
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,160
lose its news line appeal. I think that's probably where it's going to hit the most,

569
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,680
but I think we're still going to see a lot of people, especially with all the NSA garbage

570
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,040
going on. I think we're going to see a lot of people off shore adopting a boon too, and perhaps

571
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,200
jumping onto other distros as well. So interesting. You know, you mentioned you see it too, in terms

572
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,400
of like article traffic and things like that. Oh yeah. Big time. Huge. Yeah. I wonder what that

573
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,320
might be something to dig into. Well, uh, before we get into the mail sack this week, we've got

574
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,760
some good emails. I just want to mention an affiliate that we had joined the Jupiter broadcast.

575
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,960
We've mentioned them once before on the Unplugged show, and that is ProXPN. Now, ProXPN is a VPN

576
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,360
service provider. They support open VPN, and they also have an Android app that makes it pretty

577
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,680
convenient to get a VPN with your, with your Android apps. And if you go to ProXPN, they've

578
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,720
got a deal where if you use the code JBLIVE, you're going to save 20% off the ProXPN service

579
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,760
for life. 20% off ProXPN service for life. Now, I'm not going to tell you why you might need a

580
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,720
VPN. I've got, I got a few ideas and suggestions why you might need a VPN. I know we have folks

581
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,880
that live outside the US that would like to get access to US services. We also have people who

582
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,240
just like to use Wi-Fi a lot at public locations, and there's plenty of legitimate reasons to use

583
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,440
a VPN there. In fact, I would recommend you use a VPN, and I believe the ProXPN prices are pretty

584
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,840
outrageously low. Like, I couldn't believe it when I saw it, and they have some, they have like a

585
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,040
free trial you can sign up for too. The, the 100% free though, they, they don't support PPTP. So if

586
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,600
you need the PPTP, you're going to have to, also the app, but I just kid about the PPTP.

587
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,640
And it's fun to say that.

588
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,360
The premium is $6.25 a month.

589
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,760
Okay.

590
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,760
And our deal is going to give you 25% off for life when you use the code JBLIVE.

591
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,160
How about that?

592
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,920
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

593
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,920
That's ProXPN and use the code JBLIVE to get 20% off.

594
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,360
Good stuff.

595
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,680
All right. So let's move on to the emails now. So you can email us linuxactionshow

596
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,520
at jupiterbroadcasting.com. Or if you want to send it specifically for the unplugged show,

597
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,920
which we've been getting more of those, you can just email, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

598
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,080
and click on the contact link at the top of our website and then choose unplugged

599
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,280
from the dropdown. Or you can also join our mumble, but if you join our mumble server,

600
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,560
wear headphones. That way we don't have horrible echo and then have to hang up on the room.

601
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,120
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

602
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,600
All right. Our first email today came in for our, I guess not their first,

603
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,560
but our first email in the email section from Noah. He says,

604
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,960
I'm one of the few young Linux users. I'm 14. I've been using Linux for about a year.

605
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,400
It's amazing how little my generation knows about computers.

606
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,240
Oh, ouch, ouch.

607
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,280
He's right. And good for you, Noah. And thank you on two fronts for using Linux

608
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,320
and acknowledging that.

609
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,240
Yeah. And for writing in when he's 14. That's cool too.

610
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,200
Yeah. Awesome.

611
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,240
So Noah goes on to say that I've been following Jupiter Broadcasting for a little while and I

612
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,920
really enjoy your videos. I remember you talking about how kids really don't know computers,

613
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,160
cloud services, servers, networks, et cetera. He says, this is true and not, and this is true,

614
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,440
and not many want to learn, but I want to know more about these things myself. Oftentimes on

615
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,520
the show when you start talking about servers or something, I really get lost. I was wondering if

616
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,840
you could do a show or give some pointers to young people that want to expand their knowledge on

617
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Linux servers and networking. I would love to know more about these things. Even if you could

618
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,840
give a website or advice, that would be great. Can't wait till the roll your own email server

619
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,200
episode. Thanks, Noah.

620
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,760
Awesome. What a great question and what a great point. I think that's an excellent point that

621
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,080
maybe we do need to touch on that more, you know?

622
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,360
Let's ask the mumble room. Do you guys have any tips for kids that want to learn

623
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,960
computers and networking and Linux? What's a good way they could get started preferably online?

624
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,360
As a 15 year old on Linux, just jump into it.

625
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,520
There you go.

626
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,440
Look for a free PDF. There are some out there that will basically start with the essentials

627
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:46,120
and then start reading that and then use your own distribution. Use it and start using it and

628
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,440
keep using it and then just throw away Windows.

629
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,800
No one's going to say listen to podcasts?

630
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,160
Well, there is that.

631
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,480
Of course, that's a given.

632
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,360
But then again, your podcast doesn't really go into the how to do it like BSD does.

633
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,560
Right. Yeah. Well, I've always kind of had the philosophy of

634
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,760
so our audience is so diverse. There's people who don't know anything.

635
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,320
And then there's people who know way, way, way more than we do.

636
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,240
So I've always felt like try to cut it down the middle and give people enough information

637
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,920
that if they care, they're inspired to go out and learn. And if they don't care,

638
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,480
they've at least picked up a little bit about something they didn't know about.

639
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,520
And they can just move on.

640
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,560
So I kind of try to walk out.

641
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,080
But last isn't really about, you know, the technical side of things, is it?

642
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,600
Yeah. Well, it can be, you know, it can be like I gave you the API call names of WebRTC last week.

643
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,480
That's pretty technical.

644
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,240
Well, the way I tell them to get into something is to rip open an old computer,

645
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,600
because way back in the day, we always used to have to mod probe our own modules into our kernels.

646
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,560
That's right.

647
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,200
We have to know what our hardware is in order to get our kernels to run correctly.

648
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,600
A good way, it's hands on, is to just rip apart a computer and just get Linux running on that.

649
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,640
Yeah, you know, when I installed Gentoo, I sure learned a heck of a lot back in the day.

650
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:08,520
Here's how I started. I started with just a year of Ubuntu.

651
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,920
And then after a while, I decided, hey, let's try Arch.

652
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,120
So I switched to Arch.

653
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,240
And I haven't looked back since.

654
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,000
But that's the way I learned that as far as it comes to networking and computers.

655
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,720
I was part of a class back in high school. Of course, we're talking mid 90s here.

656
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:30,040
And it really helps to learn the hardware and the software and not only that,

657
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,760
but I really got my first look at Linux at the time, too.

658
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,240
Of course, that was Slackware at an early age.

659
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,280
But at the same time, if you start networking with people you know, you're going to find out.

660
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,680
There's a lot of people out there who know this stuff who'd be willing to take you under their wing.

661
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,200
That's exactly what I did.

662
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,160
Yeah, I think the Arch wiki actually has a lot of good stuff in networking, too.

663
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,520
And so does the GenC wiki if you're actually looking at the right sections.

664
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,120
Yeah, the software is directly related to the hardware.

665
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,960
If you want to know exactly how the disks use their blocks or file systems function,

666
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,840
or how the network file system does its protocols,

667
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,560
or how the kernel has locking or has rings to do virtual machines,

668
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:19,080
it's all based on the hardware and you can do CPU extensions, RAM,

669
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,960
it's all software is built on top of the hardware to make the hardware.

670
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:30,600
You know what, I think this generation has it.

671
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,800
I mean, thing is, when I was 17, like five, six years ago, and I was using

672
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,640
Soos 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.04. Now, those were very, I mean, for me, they were very unstable.

673
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,600
They had a lot of problems for me, and so getting into it was a lot harder than it is now.

674
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:54,520
That ties into the whole stability conversation where if you have a stable distro,

675
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,200
if you have something that someone can rely on, someone can trust, someone new

676
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:07,000
can actually play with and get used to, then maybe they can learn more about it much easier than they could before.

677
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,600
Yeah, instead of throwing them into the fire of a rolling distro.

678
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,080
You know, you touch on something that I kind of didn't really end cap that conversation with,

679
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,840
but you mentioned it made me realize, like, I called Ubuntu, is it the XP of Linux?

680
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,440
But I actually think Windows XP, while it had all of its problems,

681
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:33,400
it was, like, a huge, huge advantage for Windows because it, like, it allowed so many people to target one thing.

682
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,120
And I wonder if, like, maybe when we talk about Ubuntu and we talk about average users,

683
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,280
we shouldn't even talk about the dot releases. Maybe we should only be talking in the context of LTS releases.

684
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Good point. Yeah, that's a very good point.

685
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,480
Because if somebody can't trust their computer to work when something is critical,

686
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,480
or somebody can't rely on a computer to be stable, they can't really be interested in learning it now, can they?

687
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,440
Hmm.

688
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,920
Ask Ubuntu, it was a great help.

689
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:07,320
Personally, I wouldn't see Ubuntu as the XP of Linux. I'd see it more as the Windows 8.

690
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:07,960
Hmm.

691
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,560
What do you think of that?

692
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,480
I don't know, I feel like that's being a little hard.

693
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,680
I like it.

694
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,400
It is, because it is trying to use the whole touch interface, and it's like,

695
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,720
yeah, it doesn't work on desktops, and come on.

696
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:26,920
That's why I'm interested in that. Are we still talking about a teenager learning about computers, or have we moved on from that?

697
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,440
It seems like we've kind of branched out.

698
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,280
I want to move on. Yeah, I want to move on from that.

699
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:37,160
The point was, like the chairman pointed out, there's howtoforge, commandlinefu.com,

700
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,560
but I think what the room has touched on is, you know, dig in, and if you want to learn the application,

701
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,800
so if you want to learn the lower level stuff, there's lots of ways to do that, there's wikis to dig into,

702
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,040
but if you want to learn the application level stuff, what the mumble room is saying, and I agree with them,

703
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:59,160
is stick to a stable distro, that way you're not fighting quirks, you're just able to focus on the learning experience of it.

704
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,480
I would add on one last thing, and then I'll let it go, and that's something that's not been touched on yet,

705
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,560
is create a problem, find a solution.

706
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,040
Figure out what task you're trying to do, I want to make a mail server, I want to set up a web server,

707
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,720
I want to play with, you know, it's not so much about just diving into what,

708
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,120
I mean, they have to have an identifiable thing to dive into.

709
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,960
And then you'll figure out the pieces in between.

710
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,160
Bingo, that's it.

711
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,040
I think using Linux gave me a whole new outlook on how to do things,

712
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,320
I mean, it's a whole new thought process to try to solve my own problems.

713
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,280
Right, yeah.

714
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,680
You know, there are very good YouTube videos about this, Dan's courses, for example,

715
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:38,360
Eli, the computer guy, they have really, really good Linux introductions, especially for beginners.

716
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah, yeah.

717
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,680
I was going to say, if you're doing something on Windows, and you move up to Linux,

718
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,160
try and find the Linux version of whatever it was you were doing,

719
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,360
bingo.

720
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,800
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,080
All right, good stuff.

722
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,960
Stand by, we'll read the next email, then we'll see if we need to get any.

723
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,120
Oh, well, this one, I'm just getting beat up a little bit, came in from G, says,

724
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,480
Hey, Chris and Matt.

725
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,440
Well, hey, G.

726
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,640
He says, I'm liking the new show and the format.

727
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,800
Well, I'm not sure if it was intentional.

728
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,640
It seems that Linux Unplugged can be where you all, pardon my Texas speak,

729
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,920
editorialize and take it out of last.

730
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,120
Now, with the pleasantries done, I must share some constructive feedback.

731
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,880
Chris, you have bitched about how you nuked your KDE configuration.

732
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,720
As a credible system administrator, you blasted KDE with no backups?

733
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,400
No backups?

734
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,680
I say, shame on you, sir.

735
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,080
No matter the application, you should have backups.

736
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,480
Even a responsible end user knows you need backups.

737
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,400
I have to admit that I have been burned by a lack of backups, so I can't be too critical.

738
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,120
I started taking daily backups with the following script,

739
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,360
and I've even started to adopt them on my laptop.

740
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,760
So he provided the bash script that he uses, using some rsync foo.

741
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,240
And he says, I'm sure several other ways, and better ways to do it than I have in this script.

742
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,040
I do it like a com- I don't like the compliment sandwich,

743
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,000
but keep up the great work.

744
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,240
Thanks for all the hard work, G7.

745
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,280
So I admitted to that, that I should have had backups.

746
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,000
I do admit.

747
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,480
Well, and I pointed that out to you, Walter, twice myself.

748
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,920
But I also know that you have a lot going on, and truly, you know,

749
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,200
you do have other things going on.

750
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,160
Right, and I even said, like, during the ramp up to the arch challenges,

751
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,560
like, well, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to take snapshots.

752
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,840
That's why I went butter FS.

753
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,280
And I- and I agree.

754
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:12,760
I agree.

755
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,120
I really have no defense other than- other than- other than-

756
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,320
I- I didn't intend to do anything.

757
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,640
Like, I- all I was doing was I logged out.

758
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,000
I logged into GNOME.

759
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,360
I thought, hmm, I'm going to- I'm going to launch my Plasma Active widgets here,

760
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,840
and just see how that looks, because I've read you can do that.

761
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,960
And all they did was type in Plasma Active, or whatever the command was,

762
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,880
ran it, and that's what destroyed my KDE configuration.

763
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,640
Didn't even cross my mind that I should run a backup before I do that, right?

764
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,120
Because it wasn't true- because you weren't running an update.

765
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,600
You literally just changed desktops and ran Plasma Active.

766
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,960
Yeah, and I've- like, I logged into KDE and ran Nautilus a million times.

767
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,400
So to me, it just- I didn't really appreciate it, I guess.

768
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,840
I didn't appreciate what I was doing, and I had a backup,

769
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:00,040
but it was, like, two weeks old, and I just felt like, you know, it just wasn't worth it.

770
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,640
And that's why I don't use KDE at all.

771
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,000
I just put that out there.

772
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,320
I- I mean, I admit it was my bad.

773
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,040
It was my bad.

774
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm a bad person, I guess.

775
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,040
I should be punished.

776
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,200
But I am really enjoying, uh, Gnome 3.10.

777
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,960
And I'll have my thoughts on Unity, too, which, uh, I won't say anything more.

778
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,520
Because I've already said too much.

779
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,720
No, you gotta save that.

780
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,520
Save that for the big show.

781
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,160
I've already said too much.

782
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,200
I've said too much.

783
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,560
All right, our last email for the day comes in from Mirko.

784
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,360
Mirko, dear Chris and Matt, I'm a longtime fan of LAS.

785
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,880
A Linux user, I use Arch with XFCE and a developer of the game, Boss Constructor,

786
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,080
which is about building and flying your own spaceship.

787
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,120
Based on the games you have covered so far and your sci-fi preferences,

788
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,760
I thought you guys might like this and be interested in the game.

789
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,760
It'd be fantastic if you could mention a link to my Greenlight campaign on the show.

790
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,000
The page includes screenshots and the trailer video.

791
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,320
So, uh, this- how cool is this?

792
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,960
So here's what I love.

793
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,520
Wow.

794
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,480
I love- I'm loving these guys getting their stuff in the Greenlight.

795
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,080
Because it gives these guys a chance to- to, uh, you know, make something that, uh,

796
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,760
it's not- it's not like Kickstarter.

797
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,840
I actually kind of like it better than Kickstarter in some ways.

798
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,320
Oh, yeah?

799
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,360
Uh, because you get- you- uh, and depending on how it works,

800
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,320
you get early access to the game as a contributor.

801
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,800
So it's sort of like the game's already been in development.

802
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,480
So it's not like you're- I don't believe you're funding it from Inception.

803
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,440
You're funding it when it's at a work enough point that Valve says,

804
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,400
all right, put this on here.

805
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,400
And then if it gets Greenlit, I think if you Greenlight the campaign and you fund it,

806
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,920
you get access to the game.

807
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,040
Oh, that's interesting.

808
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,560
And I'm watching this video here of you putting together what looks like a, uh-

809
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,200
Spaceship.

810
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah.

811
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,320
It looks cool.

812
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,600
It looks cool, doesn't it?

813
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,480
Looks very cool.

814
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,720
Yeah.

815
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,120
This is- this is his, uh, game, Boss Constructor.

816
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,760
It's going to be available, of course, for Linux.

817
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,360
And it looks like as you, uh, build it and the- depending on how you build it,

818
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,840
of course, affects its performance, its ability to fly and whatnot.

819
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,400
That's cool.

820
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:43,640
Yeah.

821
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,120
Yeah.

822
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,520
Yeah.

823
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,480
Uh, oh, cool.

824
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,800
Void- uh, Bowtide Dynamite in the chat room says he voted for this game last night.

825
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,440
Nice.

826
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,680
Yeah.

827
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,920
So guys, go look for Boss Constructor.

828
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,520
Uh, one of our fellow last audience members is creating it and just got on Greenlight.

829
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,880
That- that must be really exciting when you've been working on something and it hits that.

830
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,280
Because if it hits Greenlight and you actually get Greenlit,

831
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,000
then it ends up on Steam and then it's available for sale on the Steam store.

832
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,280
That's got to be really exciting.

833
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,160
Kind of- it reminds me of the, uh, when you end up like with your own infomercial

834
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,880
kind of situation.

835
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,520
It's got to feel like that where you're like, I'm going to be a millionaire.

836
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,880
You know, it's like, how much would you pay for this great game?

837
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,600
Absolutely, right?

838
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,920
Yeah.

839
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,720
I'm not kidding.

840
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,280
So, uh, good luck to you on that one, Mirko.

841
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,440
And, uh, if you guys want to go find, uh, Boss Constructor and give it a- a light.

842
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,800
I guess that's how that works.

843
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,680
I don't- I don't know.

844
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,280
Also, I'll just give a- I'll just give a plug for Super Frog HD, that's a ton of fun.

845
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,360
It's a side-scrolling platformer, so you got to like those.

846
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,480
But, uh, I loaded that up on my machine last night.

847
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,680
And, uh, I totally love that.

848
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,040
All right, I'm going to jump into the mumble channel.

849
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,920
Guys, one last chance.

850
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,480
Anything anybody wants to touch on before we wrap up this episode?

851
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,960
Run down the list.

852
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,520
Last chance.

853
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,240
Clock's running.

854
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,760
No, just the fact that, you know, uh, again, I'd just like to say if there are very, very

855
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,200
serious bugs that you are ignoring in terms of features, then I don't think that should

856
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,960
be something people should do.

857
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:06,040
Meaning, you know, if you want to push, say, uh, own cloud integration, but not work on

858
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,840
a very serious bug that has existed for, like, God knows how long, then that's a long thing

859
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,200
to do, but that's my opinion.

860
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,760
Yeah.

861
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,240
You are- you are butting up against a complex issue, my friend, because it's an open source,

862
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,280
and so you have people working on the things they want to work on, and sometimes the guy

863
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,880
that might have implemented something that has the bug no longer is on the project anymore.

864
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,760
That happens a lot, actually.

865
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,260
Yeah.

866
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:31,820
I would argue about the LTS as well, because LTS is a great idea for stability, but when

867
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:36,940
you take into account the LTS of the apps, that's irrelevant, because there shouldn't

868
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,780
be a lockdown on the apps.

869
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,620
There should be a lockdown on the security, the maintenance, the kernel, stuff like that,

870
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,940
but the app should be freely open.

871
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,220
Yeah, this is what I would think too, Rotten Corps, is I feel like there's a place for

872
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:53,180
LTS at the underlying underpinning stuff, and then, uh, because, I mean, let's be honest,

873
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,540
we can all sit here all day long and talk about LTS releases, but everyone in this room,

874
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,380
if you were stuck with an LTS release, you'd have that thing so PPA'd up in six months

875
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,900
it'd be ridiculous, right?

876
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,340
Half the repos your app get checking would probably fail because they'd all been shut

877
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:05,900
down, right?

878
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:11,580
I mean, I've been on 13.10 literally for, what, three days, and two of the repos already

879
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,020
giving me 404 errors.

880
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,540
It's, I mean-

881
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,040
Wow.

882
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,820
My project- I have a project that's in the Ubuntu Software Center that hasn't been updated

883
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,660
in a year and a half, because they just won't update it for some reason.

884
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,620
That's like-

885
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:31,180
If the 13.10 has the newest version, whereas every other one has, uh, two stable versions

886
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,740
back.

887
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,580
What product is that?

888
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,620
Uh, you get Download Manager.

889
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:47,100
It's, uh, 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04 all have 1.8 stable, and we've been on 1.10 for a year.

890
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,860
The Ubuntu Software Center is a mess on its best day, in my opinion.

891
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,380
It's a terrible, terrible mess.

892
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,580
Has anyone tried AppGrid?

893
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,660
Yeah, I've looked at it.

894
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:58,300
I haven't tried it yet.

895
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:58,860
Have you tried it?

896
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,260
I mean, the performance is great.

897
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,220
It's closed source, but, uh, it works a hell of a lot better than the Ubuntu Software Center.

898
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,980
Isn't AppGrid being created by Canonical?

899
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,380
I don't think so.

900
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,540
Well, I read that it was closed source.

901
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,500
Well, look at that.

902
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,380
Yeah, AppGrid is supposed to be, uh, the replacement for, uh, uh, the software center.

903
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,660
I thought, I thought they were...

904
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,900
So I'm looking at the maintainer is PGG on, uh, on Launchpad.

905
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,060
I'm looking for a license.

906
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,100
Uh, yeah, you're right.

907
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:29,820
Proprietary.

908
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,220
You're right.

909
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,820
It's got a Launchpad 30-day trial commu- uh, commu- commercial license.

910
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,260
Um, the project's license is proprietary.

911
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,860
Oh, man.

912
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:42,700
I wonder if this is beta or something and it's keeping it, uh, closed until it launches.

913
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,500
I hope it goes open source.

914
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:45,980
It's great.

915
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:47,420
Interesting.

916
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,860
Well, I'll give, I'll give AppGrid a check.

917
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,300
Now, what, what, uh, distro are you running?

918
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,820
Are you running on, uh, 1304?

919
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,900
I, uh, used it when I was still on Ubuntu.

920
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,340
Now, uh, based on Matt's recommendation, I'm on Manjaro.

921
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,540
Oh, how do you like Manjaro?

922
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,700
I, I think it's great.

923
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,940
I love, uh, the Arch user repository.

924
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,440
Yeah.

925
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,500
I wouldn't go back.

926
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:08,700
Yeah.

927
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,300
The only piece of advice I have there, it's going to keep you from dealing with a lot of people.

928
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,380
Say it's not stable and it's going to break.

929
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,340
That's crap.

930
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,060
To be honest with you.

931
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,260
Cause I've been running it for no problems.

932
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,460
But the main thing is every time there's an update, go to their blog and check what's

933
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,500
going on before you update.

934
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,700
That's the only piece of advice I have.

935
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,780
Just in case there's something funky you need to be aware of.

936
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,900
But otherwise it's pretty cool.

937
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,780
You know, forms are surprisingly active.

938
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,100
Oh yeah.

939
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,820
They're quite active.

940
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,540
Yeah.

941
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:35,900
You know, I've been using Mint for only a day and now I'm heading back to Arch because it was just

942
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,260
that bad for me.

943
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,020
What, what was, what was rough for you?

944
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,180
Yeah.

945
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,220
You got to be specific.

946
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:40,700
So I understand.

947
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:46,060
It, just the fact that I don't have anything really up to date.

948
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,060
It's very, it's actually slower.

949
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,660
Ways, but way slower.

950
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,620
And it's just, I can't stand it.

951
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,020
I would give you the package age is definitely different because of the freeze releases.

952
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,780
And it's definitely absolutely not bleeding edge by any stretch of the imagination.

953
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,460
But slower.

954
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,340
And I don't know, I can't, I have Arch on another partition.

955
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,740
I've not, I've not noticed that.

956
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,060
Yeah.

957
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,580
No, I meant, I meant Mint as a, Mint is slower.

958
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

959
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:12,540
Mint.

960
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:12,860
Oh yeah.

961
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,380
Mint's a total, total.

962
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,340
So I want to go back.

963
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,260
So this is, this is my thing.

964
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,060
So I guess, you know, one of the things about XP was that you could update all of the

965
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,060
applications, but it was the system that, and see, this is not true.

966
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:31,340
This, this is where the analogy falls down is so much of this stuff is integrated with the

967
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,420
repositories that also don't get updated.

968
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,500
And I think this is really where it falls down for me because I could actually run,

969
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,380
like I wouldn't want to, but like I could run Ubuntu 12.04 if all of the user land stuff

970
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,100
stayed up to date.

971
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:48,860
And I'm talking video driver too in that, in that context, but Chromium, Firefox, they,

972
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,620
those are like really the, some of the things that they do manage to stay up to date.

973
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,700
But I'm talking everything, Pidgin, VLC.

974
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,620
I want everything up to date and then you can keep the lower level stuff.

975
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,500
And, and I wouldn't just argue that might work.

976
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,900
I would argue we've seen that work in the marketplace.

977
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,420
We've seen it work in the enterprise.

978
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,020
We've seen it work all over the place.

979
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,540
We've seen that model work.

980
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:12,380
And I don't understand why we, why maybe we can't break it out a little bit.

981
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,780
You know, break it up, say this, this, this top part of Ubuntu would be rolling.

982
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,340
This lower part would be static and non-changing.

983
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,300
And maybe we'd do service packs and things like that.

984
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,900
Those are exactly my thoughts.

985
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,060
I was thinking the exact same thing.

986
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:31,340
I was thinking keep the core stable and frozen, but roll the drivers and the apps.

987
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,860
That would be a perfect world.

988
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,500
Sadly, I don't see too many Linux distributions doing that.

989
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,460
It seems to be all or nothing.

990
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:42,780
Well, it just doesn't work that way because the issue is just, just look at the kernel

991
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,980
and the kernel guys.

992
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:49,180
And from that point to every other point in the chain up to the desktop, they're all separate

993
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:49,820
projects.

994
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:54,060
They all have their separate agendas and they all have their need to work on the stuff

995
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:54,700
all the time.

996
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,060
You just can't say to them, please stop developing your stuff, make it stable.

997
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:05,100
And next year you can come up with another new version, but please stop developing new

998
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,500
versions.

999
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,780
You just can't do that.

1000
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,260
But see, it'll never work in open source.

1001
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,540
That'll never work because then they'll say, they'll give you the middle finger and they'll

1002
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:12,860
walk.

1003
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:17,980
So what your alternative is, is to hope that in the process forward, they iterate and make

1004
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,540
it better.

1005
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,580
That's kind of our best hope.

1006
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:31,020
Our kernel and Gnome are three great examples of an entire vertical stack, which are almost

1007
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,860
linked and dependent upon each other.

1008
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:42,860
All evolving at the same time to put an old kernel underneath a new Gnome with system

1009
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,500
B.

1010
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,620
It's going to be real tricky.

1011
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,580
Well, that might be a good example of where you have to draw the line.

1012
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:51,980
But then all you really would have to do is say, all right, well, what's the minimum version

1013
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,620
we have to get to?

1014
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,220
And then we stay there.

1015
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,060
Although, I think we should probably bring up click packages as Mika too just said in

1016
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,540
the chat room.

1017
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:06,620
Click packages from Canonical could change up this game a little bit, sort of like PBIs.

1018
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,460
Click packages are the new type of installer that are really right now being designed for

1019
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,140
mobile Ubuntu.

1020
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,140
But eventually, they could become the new type of installation packages on Ubuntu,

1021
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:20,540
where you download a click package, you click it, and it installs a new version of the

1022
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,420
application.

1023
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:29,100
I seem to remember a click package specifically, I think it was KLIK, if I'm not mistaken,

1024
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:29,900
or something like that.

1025
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,740
And basically, it was distro-independent, and it was self-contained packages, basically

1026
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,020
mimicking themselves after the OS X way of doing things.

1027
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,700
And that was pretty old hat.

1028
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,740
And it was dismissed at the time as being stupid, and they were never up to date, and

1029
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,020
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1030
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,740
Is that essentially what we're seeing with Ubuntu adopting?

1031
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,700
I mean, is that kind of what we're...

1032
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but it's pretty old school stuff.

1033
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,860
Yeah, I'm going to try and Google it.

1034
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,060
Yeah, I'm going to try and get a URL for you here, if I can find it.

1035
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,460
It was very popular for a while.

1036
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,100
Let's see, KLIK.

1037
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,540
Oh, that package is already almost like that.

1038
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:10,700
I mean, all you have to do is just go to GW, or something like that.

1039
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:10,940
Right.

1040
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,300
But this literally was like, I mean, had nothing to do with what...

1041
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,260
I mean, oh my God.

1042
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,180
Yeah, it was completely on its own.

1043
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:17,820
On its own.

1044
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,780
Let me see if I can find it.

1045
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,740
To me, this is just Ubuntu or Canonical doing what they do to everything, trying to bring

1046
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,580
everything in-house and just recreate the wheel over and over again.

1047
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,820
They don't have package dependencies.

1048
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:34,060
They're making a solution for a problem that doesn't need a solution.

1049
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,260
Just like me.

1050
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,620
Yeah, that has got a point.

1051
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,420
Going along with that.

1052
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,380
PBIs have a really good purpose.

1053
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,260
They're built from...

1054
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,060
Like it's a source distribution in pre-BSD.

1055
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,220
Portable Linux apps is one thing.

1056
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:46,700
Like that.

1057
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,860
Going along with that is completely different.

1058
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,380
I think that...

1059
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,580
Well, that's a good point.

1060
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:01,660
I mean, they're going off on their own direction, and I think you could make the argument that,

1061
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:06,860
yes, they're going off in their own direction again, but I don't know if PBIs would work

1062
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,180
for them.

1063
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,420
It would be interesting if they could apply something like PBIs.

1064
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,100
So that's a good point you just made there.

1065
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:16,620
And that's, again, there's a lot of ways to solve this, but we're not there yet.

1066
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,060
At least they're talking about going in that direction, right?

1067
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,420
I mean, at least it's not like they apparently are aware of the problem.

1068
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,460
I mean, Click Packages right there very much indicates they're aware of this issue.

1069
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,340
Well, here's what pisses me off about all this canonical stuff.

1070
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,820
It's like, oh, we've invented the software center.

1071
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:36,060
No, you guys went and hired people from Linspire, the guys that used to do the CNR packages.

1072
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,260
You didn't invent Squat.

1073
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,500
Now we're doing it again with the Click Packages stuff.

1074
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,620
This is old hat.

1075
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,300
I just sent Chris a link on Skype.

1076
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:47,260
I don't know if you're able to get to it or not, but basically it's like they're not inventing

1077
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:47,820
anything.

1078
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,180
They're not really even innovating anything.

1079
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,020
They're basically pretending like they are.

1080
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,900
PortableLinuxApps.org, visit it.

1081
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,460
Check it out.

1082
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,260
This is old stuff.

1083
01:08:55,260 --> 01:09:03,340
Yeah, I feel like that same argument is lobbied at Apple, that Apple didn't invent anything.

1084
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,780
They're just repackaging it.

1085
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,700
Well, and if they could do it better, that's great, but they didn't.

1086
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:11,900
CNR, quite frankly, as much as people hated Linspire, is better than the software center

1087
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,820
by leaps and bounds.

1088
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,260
It was just a better experience.

1089
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,100
Linspire sucked, don't get me wrong.

1090
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,980
It was horrible.

1091
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:23,180
But CNR, back at the 4.5, 5.0 days, was actually pretty good before they broke it out for all

1092
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:23,980
the distros.

1093
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,340
It was actually pretty reasonable.

1094
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:30,220
I could have an entire software aisle installed on any machine I wanted by logging in, clicking

1095
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,540
install aisle, and going to have a cup of coffee.

1096
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,980
It was really simple.

1097
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,980
Yeah, it was a good system.

1098
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,660
It was just apt on the back end.

1099
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,340
But again, but now you've got the software center, which is like you've got to jump through

1100
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,620
hoops and hope to God your payment stuff works, and it's horrible.

1101
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:49,820
It really frustrates me because I want it to be successful, I really do.

1102
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,780
I care about Ubuntu, but they're not doing it for me right now.

1103
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,700
Yeah, I don't use the software center anymore.

1104
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,060
I don't use it anymore.

1105
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:56,540
No one does.

1106
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,060
It's not even in my launch bar.

1107
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,700
Yeah, and the packages are out of date.

1108
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,780
The for-profit stuff is even worse because the folks are sending them the stuff, but as

1109
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,620
it was pointed out in the Mumble Room, it's not being updated.

1110
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,700
It's a problem.

1111
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:14,380
Yeah, I think we as Linux users have a tendency to look at the negatives here, and we want

1112
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:18,460
it fixed because we see the problem and we see it for a while.

1113
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:23,660
But I think when you look at the actual strategy that's at play here with these LTS releases,

1114
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,860
and those are what we see in Deploy.

1115
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,420
That's what we see.

1116
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,420
Ubuntu based on that's what Amazon's running.

1117
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,900
That's what all these people are running is 12.04.

1118
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,860
And if you're looking at two different types, there's two different games here.

1119
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:39,660
There's the interim release game that all of the enthusiasts follow and upgrade to,

1120
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,100
and there's the LTS game.

1121
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,900
And it's almost like there's two different Ubuntus.

1122
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:48,620
There's stable, steady as it goes Ubuntu that's supported for a while, and there's

1123
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,540
crazy Ubuntu that's pissing everybody off that does all these kinds of things that nobody

1124
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,500
likes or doesn't do enough, and it's either or.

1125
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,660
But I have a great thought.

1126
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,300
It seems like a problem that only affects probably the niche of the niche.

1127
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,820
Well, and for me, I just want to put the tough love out there because I'm not doing it because

1128
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,300
I want to see them fail or have a bad day or ruin someone's hard work.

1129
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,580
I want the people that are making the decisions, not the developers, but the hierarchy further

1130
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:20,940
up the chain to really understand where we're coming from.

1131
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,420
Stop screwing up hard work of your developers.

1132
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,660
These guys are doing tremendously awesome stuff.

1133
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,540
And then you guys kind of poo poo it with crap that no one cares about.

1134
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,620
The software centers was a great example of that.

1135
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,580
It was a great idea.

1136
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,380
And they did the worst.

1137
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,140
I couldn't have done worse myself.

1138
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:34,940
It was horrible.

1139
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:35,900
It's just it's terrible.

1140
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,900
I don't even know how they consider that usable.

1141
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:48,380
You know, I was trying to end it on a positive note, but I will just point out that if they

1142
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,940
hadn't gone off in their own direction with Unity, if like.

1143
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,260
Sure, and that I agree with you on that.

1144
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:53,740
I agree.

1145
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,780
I understand there was there's political things that happened.

1146
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,700
There was, you know, vision that they needed to execute.

1147
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:03,980
But I believe one of the original one of the original ideas behind Unity was the same UI

1148
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,020
across all these devices.

1149
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:08,380
Now they're kind of custom building you eyes for the TV, for the tablet, for the phone,

1150
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,420
for the desktop.

1151
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,940
But going back like if somehow like the planets aligned and they hadn't had that break and

1152
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,860
like they just like the politics worked out so that way, the known project was cool working

1153
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,740
with them and they were cool with the known project, which I acknowledge was never going

1154
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,460
to happen.

1155
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,860
It's just, you know, too many alpha dogs in the room.

1156
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:31,740
But now if they were still hitched to that wagon, they could essentially disengage from

1157
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,660
the desktop and completely focus on mobile like they're doing.

1158
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:40,300
And as long as they packaged everything up, applied a nice theme and worked out some bugs,

1159
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,100
we'd all get brand new toys with our updates.

1160
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,300
We'd all get the new stuff.

1161
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,420
We'd all get 310.

1162
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,260
We'd all get all this great new stuff.

1163
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,940
And they would have they would they wouldn't have to have built an entire desktop.

1164
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:57,660
And that arguably may have been better initially, but as their focus wanes and Gnome and KDE

1165
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:03,980
and XFCE and MATE and Cinnamon all progress forward at, you know, with their with their

1166
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:08,300
main focus with what their primary task is, as they all move forward with those things,

1167
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,860
they eventually will outpace what has happened or have already outpaced Unity.

1168
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,620
And if they weren't even attached to that right now, they'd be reaping those rewards.

1169
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:17,900
That's true.

1170
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,460
That's true.

1171
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,380
And I've come to I mean, well, with Unity, I've been harsh on Unity in the past.

1172
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,020
You know, I don't necessarily have a problem with it now.

1173
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,340
I mean, it's not my go to desktop, but it's it isn't it's not ugly.

1174
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:29,980
It really isn't.

1175
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,260
It's not an ugly desktop.

1176
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,620
It's actually quite attractive.

1177
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,460
There's some usability paper cuts here and there, but for the most part, I'm OK with it.

1178
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,900
You know, I don't have a real problem with it.

1179
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,940
I give that a ding, Matt.

1180
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:43,340
Well, I will we'll leave that as a cliffhanger right there because that's where my thoughts

1181
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,700
will pick up on the review is now that I've been running KDE and Gnome and I'm now back

1182
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,300
on Unity for the week.

1183
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,700
We'll give our thoughts in the review on Sunday.

1184
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,020
Oh, yeah.

1185
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,700
This week's Linux action show.

1186
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,140
So we'll end it right there because I think that's a good that's a good like jumping off

1187
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,060
point for the show kind of sets the stage for Sunday's episode of the Linux action show

1188
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:02,860
right there, Matt.

1189
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,820
Well, that's right there.

1190
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,420
I have shaken my fist at the clouds.

1191
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,060
I have spoken.

1192
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:06,940
All right.

1193
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,220
If you want to get a hold of us, emails Linux action show Jupiter broadcasting dot com or

1194
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,100
pop the contact link.

1195
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,060
You can even just choose unplug from the dropdown or go harass our subreddit over at Linux action

1196
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:16,940
show dot reddit dot com.

1197
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:21,900
Make some noise, make some votes because that that sort of tweaks it molds what we cover.

1198
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,260
It impacts our coverage.

1199
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,420
Plus, we take all of your comments in the context.

1200
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,140
So even just tossing your thoughts in a thread help out, too.

1201
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,620
Don't forget, you can join us on Tuesdays at two p.m.

1202
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,140
Pacific over at JBLive.TV.

1203
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,340
Thanks for our mumble room for joining us.

1204
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,220
And Matt, have a great week.

1205
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,260
I'll see you on Sunday.

1206
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:35,740
Sounds good.

1207
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,380
See you then.

1208
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:36,860
All right, everyone.

1209
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:40,060
Thanks so much for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1210
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,660
See you right back here next week.

1211
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,020
We should have recorded this because I got a question for you guys.

1212
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,860
OK, so if if Linux is this ocean of activity.

1213
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,260
Right.

1214
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,980
And Ubuntu is the island that sits above it, that all of the regular consumers see.

1215
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,460
And that's where they land on when they find Linux.

1216
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:08,540
And if and if the island's ruined, who steps up?

1217
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,740
Who steps up next?

1218
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,220
Who's it?

1219
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:10,860
SteamOS.

1220
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,180
Mint.

1221
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,060
Mint and SteamOS.

1222
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,700
Why does anyone have to step up?

1223
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,540
I think it's going to be Mint.

1224
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,020
It's got to be because they got Cinnamon 2.0 coming out.

1225
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,100
It's going to be, I don't know.

1226
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,780
What about elementary OS?

1227
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,300
What about elementary OS?

1228
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,100
Elementary OS doesn't have enough of an existing base.

1229
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,780
And as far as the why someone needs to step up, I think it's a matter of we would have

1230
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,980
a void like we did before Ubuntu and post Linspire with the news outlets that those

1231
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,940
news outlets matter.

1232
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,700
If you want to appeal to those news outlets, you damn well better be noober friendly or

1233
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,740
newbie friendly.

1234
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,780
I don't think elementary gets enough press, honestly.

1235
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,300
If they got more press, then perhaps people would be more turned on.

1236
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,380
But, you know, yeah.

1237
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,380
For non-geek people, yes.

1238
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,980
But the problem with elementary is that it has...

1239
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,980
It's not going to be Mint or elementary OS.

1240
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,260
I think it's going to be SteamOS.

1241
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,300
And I think the reason why it's going to be SteamOS is because of Valve.

1242
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,540
Just like Android took off because of Google.

1243
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:12,620
And the reason why even Ubuntu sees the success, the reason why Valve picked Ubuntu is because

1244
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,580
of canonical, right?

1245
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:17,100
Because business trusts business, right?

1246
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,260
And the problem with both elementary and Mint is while they're fantastic, they're LLCs at

1247
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:21,980
best.

1248
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,820
You know, one or two guy else.

1249
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,020
Yeah, it's just not simple.

1250
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,500
Whereas SteamOS I think will be.

1251
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:33,180
But I think that's going to be a loss because Ubuntu is a full-fledged desktop with your

1252
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,860
office suite on there, with a browser, messenger.

1253
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:41,740
If we're only looking at a replacement, then SteamOS is probably first in line.

1254
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:45,900
But if anything, I want frigging Ubuntu to fix their frigging problem.

1255
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,660
Swallow their pride and fix their shit.

1256
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,500
I would disagree.

1257
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:55,100
I would say that, you know, Fedora, OpenSUSE, maybe even Arch.

1258
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,460
And I'm saying other distros are...

1259
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,860
But the budget doesn't have to be a pain in the ass.

1260
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,140
It's doing it by choice.

1261
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,980
And other distros.

1262
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,100
I'm saying other distros are good enough to replace Ubuntu at any time.

1263
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,580
Ubuntu is not the only one with stability and with reliability now.

1264
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,380
True.

1265
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,380
Now OpenSUSE and Fedora and all of them are very, very good.

1266
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,300
So they're perfect alternatives in my opinion.

1267
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,660
But the funny thing about all of those you've listed, they've been around longer than Ubuntu

1268
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:22,540
and none of them have been able to achieve the popularity that Ubuntu did.

1269
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,380
Whatever, either it's execution of what their offering is or it's the marketing or whatever

1270
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,500
it is, all of those examples were around before Ubuntu and will, yeah, be around after Ubuntu.

1271
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,260
But it doesn't mean they're going to get any attention.

1272
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:41,020
They didn't approach the distro idea like the way Ubuntu did where they want to make

1273
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,140
it as easy as possible.

1274
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:42,540
That's right.

1275
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:46,700
They wanted to give as much customization and control as possible.

1276
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,100
Whereas people who are coming from Windows do not care.

1277
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:57,740
One thing I want to point out is that if anything is going to succeed, it's got to be Ubuntu

1278
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,540
because Mint, Elementary, SteamOS, they all kind of ride on their coattails because they're

1279
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,980
all built on Ubuntu.

1280
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,900
So if Ubuntu dies, where do they all go?

1281
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,660
I see Mint going to Debian, but I don't know about anything else.

1282
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,460
Elementary dies.

1283
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:17,180
But can we even account SteamOS because SteamOS, it is meant for a living room.

1284
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,460
That can't be a replacement for Ubuntu.

1285
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,220
It's gaming focused.

1286
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:28,940
Yeah, it can be a replacement.

1287
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:34,620
So who is the reigning champion, the desktop island of salvation for the fleeing rats,

1288
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,660
when Ubuntu sinks?

1289
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:39,580
I think whatever it is, it has to be pretty.

1290
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:45,980
That's something that a lot of people look over, but when I was first starting on Linux,

1291
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,100
I looked around.

1292
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:51,340
I barely knew what distribution was, but I saw this pretty little sidebar and I was like,

1293
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,380
ooh, that looks cool.

1294
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
What if it is Chrome OS?

1295
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:00,540
I think a lot of people are just going to go to a distro and pop and check out what's

1296
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:00,860
out there.

1297
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,420
I don't think there's going to be any one specific distro that's going to fill that

1298
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,180
niche because a lot of people used to serve it.

1299
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:08,060
If you can't offer a turnkey answer to that, I think you're going to turn away a lot of

1300
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:08,460
switchers.

1301
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,020
Oh, you are.

1302
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,780
There's going to be a lot of people that are going to go back.

1303
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,540
I have a turnkey answer.

1304
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:19,740
It's basically the reason why Ubuntu became such a huge thing is because they took Gnome

1305
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,700
and made it really simple.

1306
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:24,780
That's what Gnome is trying to do by themselves.

1307
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:31,660
So if Ubuntu dies, the one that's going to take over, it could be a new one, it could

1308
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:35,740
be just one of them that existed, but they're just going to take Gnome and make it just

1309
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,540
as easy as Ubuntu was trying to in the first place.

1310
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,900
It's about the desktop environment, actually.

1311
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,780
Honestly, forget the desktop environment.

1312
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:51,100
It's whatever's the most simple, and the most simple for the majority of people is

1313
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,420
the web browser, and then that goes back to Google Chrome and Chrome OS.

1314
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:55,980
I agree.

1315
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,060
Chrome OS has got the most press right now.

1316
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,780
They're going to get all the popularity.

1317
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:02,060
They're in the stores.

1318
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,580
And they're going to add more features.

1319
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:08,300
So by the time this singularity happens, it'll have more desktop,

1320
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,660
like, functionality, I'm sure.

1321
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:14,940
They've just presented Chrome OS as a full C, but it doesn't even have an office to it.

1322
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,420
It does.

1323
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,620
It's got Google Docs.

1324
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,820
Yeah, it's all going in the web browser.

1325
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,780
Speaking of Chrome OS, did you guys see that they had a new Chromebook?

1326
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,380
Yes, I did, and I want it.

1327
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:29,020
It charges with a micro USB cord.

1328
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,980
That's how you charge it.

1329
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:30,620
That's crazy.

1330
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,500
What?

1331
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,540
As far as it being popular or not popular, let me put this in perspective.

1332
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:37,020
Go to Amazon.com and look up their most popular notebook.

1333
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,380
It's the Chromebook.

1334
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:38,940
It's the Chromebook.

1335
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,380
Sounds some serious stuff.

1336
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,500
Chrome OS is going to be it.

1337
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,820
I really think, unfortunately, you know.

1338
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,420
Yeah, there's going to be a replacement.

1339
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:49,100
It helps that the price is pretty good as well.

1340
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,060
Yeah, it does.

1341
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,140
Amazon is not where most people go to get their Netflix anyway.

1342
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,060
We need to get Linux on hardware.

1343
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,780
That's the issue.

1344
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,140
We need to get Linux on hardware.

1345
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,140
What you guys are all really saying is Gen 2 is the winner.

1346
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,180
Absolutely.

1347
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:13,660
So, oh yeah, totally.
