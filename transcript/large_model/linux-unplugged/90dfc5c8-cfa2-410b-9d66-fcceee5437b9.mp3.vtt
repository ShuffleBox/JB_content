WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.960
Speaking of how great Windows is

00:03.040 --> 00:09.080
There is a new subreddit that it chronicles the most public blue screens of death ever and at first I was like oh, haha

00:09.080 --> 00:15.040
That's old joke, but actually some of these are really good really really good like hey Wes check out

00:15.040 --> 00:16.280
Take a look at this picture here

00:16.280 --> 00:19.960
I don't even know what this is but look how fancy that is that's in a mall

00:20.240 --> 00:24.360
Where they have like a twisted display and the twisted display blue screen

00:24.360 --> 00:28.400
I'd be really curious to see what that looks like when it works. Yeah, right every fifth

00:28.400 --> 00:33.440
Look at this guy sitting there and a massive blue screen right there on that screen. It's almost like art

00:34.000 --> 00:36.700
It is kind of like art. It is kind of beautiful in a way

00:36.960 --> 00:41.660
Yeah, giant giant blue screens giant blue screens, so there is a subreddit now

00:42.360 --> 00:45.560
Dedicated to the most epic blue screens ever and if you check it out

00:45.560 --> 00:49.700
I'll have a link in the show notes some of these are kind of artistic in their own way

00:49.800 --> 00:52.720
The blue screen of death is in its own way gotten its own

00:52.720 --> 00:59.320
Its own status in popular culture so in fairness. Do we need to spin up a Linux kernel crash?

00:59.840 --> 01:01.840
subreddit right right

01:02.320 --> 01:08.500
No, it's not the blue screen. We don't have the blue. Yeah, yeah, although something went something went wrong with your computer

01:08.500 --> 01:10.320
Is the new error message?

01:10.320 --> 01:15.360
Yes, there's my poster photo that said it was just a big word that said error you have an error

01:16.320 --> 01:17.640
Thanks

01:17.640 --> 01:22.760
This is really this is really I love the caption for this Ars Technica photo

01:22.760 --> 01:28.720
So this is the mall one again. We have these wrap displays, and it says malls can they get any more soulless

01:28.720 --> 01:30.720
Yes, thanks to the blue screen of death

01:32.440 --> 01:35.240
Yeah, that's pretty awful mmm. That's pretty gross

01:35.520 --> 01:41.460
You know what I want an ARM powered Linux laptop Linus says it's gonna happen, but maybe not in 2016

01:41.460 --> 01:44.680
He's looking for it though. He said that at Linux con in Europe

01:44.680 --> 01:47.760
He said that I'm happy to see that arm is making progress one of these days

01:47.760 --> 01:51.320
I will actually have a machine with ARM that they said it would be this year

01:51.520 --> 01:55.700
Maybe it'll be next year 2016 will be the year of the ARM laptop

01:58.440 --> 02:00.640
I don't know actually that's a good question. I don't think so

02:00.640 --> 02:06.640
I think when Linus says that he's talking about something kind of along the lines of the MacBook Air that you just buy yeah

02:06.640 --> 02:08.640
And it runs consumer easy-peasy

02:09.080 --> 02:13.180
We're starting to see a higher end Chromebooks now. I mean yeah, yeah

02:13.180 --> 02:19.940
You know who's gonna try to compete with a $500 Chromebook with an arm chip instead of an Intel CPU

02:20.100 --> 02:22.100
You know I was on

02:22.780 --> 02:28.740
Yeah, I would rather have it run the Linux really I mean much much rather I was on tech talk today

02:28.740 --> 02:31.200
I was talking about these high-tech nomadic

02:31.500 --> 02:36.060
That are are living off the grid quote-unquote they're staying connected to the internet

02:36.060 --> 02:40.260
But living off the grid and one of them is you guys may know of him as Joey Hess

02:40.260 --> 02:45.520
He is a Debian software developer. He I'm not sure if he's currently with the Debian project

02:45.520 --> 02:50.580
But he did help develop the Debian installer. He created git annex. He's nice. Yeah

02:50.580 --> 02:54.100
He's working on a software that uses Dropbox

02:54.540 --> 03:00.800
Git and a few other things to sync all of your dot files between all of your Linux machines right like wouldn't that be nice?

03:01.260 --> 03:06.340
So Joey he is an interesting individual because he pines

03:06.340 --> 03:13.700
He says he pines for an ARM based Linux laptop because he's using a Dell Mini 9. He's been using it since 2008

03:13.700 --> 03:19.300
He's worn out two keyboards. He's gone through two SSDs. He's upgraded it to two gigabytes of RAM and

03:20.100 --> 03:21.620
He lives

03:21.620 --> 03:25.020
Totally off the grid he has solar power on a good day

03:25.020 --> 03:31.140
he says he gets 50 amp hours, but on most days he gets 15 amp hour 15 amp hours and

03:31.140 --> 03:35.940
He says he's when power is low he often hacks in the evenings by lantern light

03:36.380 --> 03:38.780
That's adorable, and he says he would kill

03:39.340 --> 03:44.980
Kill for a powerful ARM based laptop something that would you know use way less power?

03:48.100 --> 03:54.300
Right exactly that was what I was gonna say is when I say ARM laptop. I want something that's significantly fast

03:54.940 --> 03:59.580
You know yeah, well you could you do you have your average everyday expectations met yeah?

03:59.580 --> 04:02.700
I mean it doesn't have to be doesn't have to be a screamer

04:02.700 --> 04:03.540
But you know here

04:03.540 --> 04:08.740
I am a few months into this XPS 13 that I have and it's got a core i7 quote-unquote mobile processor

04:08.740 --> 04:12.820
Which is actually a dual core processor with hyper threading that makes it look like four cores

04:12.820 --> 04:19.660
I don't know why that's called an i7, but apparently in laptop jargon that qualifies as an i7 and you know I notice it I

04:20.340 --> 04:25.160
notice I it's been a while since I've you know use a dual core as my daily driver and I

04:25.160 --> 04:32.320
I don't know. It's still a really nice performing machine. Yep, but it's also my newest computer, and it's not my fastest computer

04:32.320 --> 04:34.660
That's a little disappointing. It's a but it's a bummer. It's a bummer

04:34.660 --> 04:41.720
That's precisely because Intel's been focusing on power management last couple of and I I appreciate I get four or five hours of battery life

04:41.720 --> 04:43.680
I do appreciate that that makes a difference

04:43.680 --> 04:49.240
But the reality is if I can if I'm sitting here with a quote-unquote i7 and an SSD

04:49.240 --> 04:52.440
And I'm going not fast enough. There's no way arm

04:52.440 --> 04:55.520
Failed that yeah, the arms just arms not gonna be fast enough for me for a while

04:55.520 --> 04:59.280
I don't think I yeah, you want you do have higher expectations than

04:59.840 --> 05:06.600
Terminal based probably I mean I would claim that Intel has maintained a lead because of their manufacturing prowess

05:06.600 --> 05:10.020
And now they've stumbled with the latest you know process node

05:10.020 --> 05:15.960
So is this the point where arm catches up maybe and if you go like West saying you know if you're doing terminal development

05:15.960 --> 05:18.120
Maybe you have a web browser and email, and that's just about it

05:18.120 --> 05:24.520
If you can tell me here's an arm computer that doesn't need to be charged for 10 13 hours, so that runs Linux

05:25.120 --> 05:29.000
That would be very very tempting when I'm off-grid that would be very very tempting

05:29.000 --> 05:35.080
Yeah, or your arm computer is well not for off-grid, but your arm computer is your interface to a droplet in the cloud

05:35.240 --> 05:40.480
Yeah, exactly he so Joey says I seem to live half the time out of range of broadband and still use dial-up

05:40.840 --> 05:46.160
He uses dial-up two gigs of RAM dial-up. Yeah, so I'm fully adapted to asynchronous communication

05:46.160 --> 05:52.540
I download my mail with offline IMAP as well as blogs get converted to RSS to email

05:52.540 --> 05:54.600
I use a distributed version control

05:55.080 --> 06:01.100
Extensively and use my git annex to maintain large quantities of local data and cube large files to transfer in rare times

06:01.240 --> 06:05.520
When I'm around fast internet, that's really neat. That's really neat

06:05.520 --> 06:15.200
This is Linux unplugged episode 114 for October 13th 2015

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
Welcome to Linux unplugged your

06:25.800 --> 06:31.680
Weekly Linux talk show that is drinking dawn of the red and Indian style pale ale. That's right

06:31.680 --> 06:36.720
My name is Chris and my name is Wes. Hey, Wes. You are the you're the good soldier here that brought these dawn of the

06:36.720 --> 06:38.480
Red I've never even seen this before I hadn't either

06:38.480 --> 06:43.280
What do you think coming out of Eugene, Oregon a local brewery and look at that a 7% alcohol?

06:43.440 --> 06:46.600
Whoo, this will be a fun one guys. Is this my second or third?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.600
Better not tell yeah, okay

06:49.920 --> 06:52.680
I will cover it up on this week's episode of Linux unplugged

06:53.040 --> 06:57.480
There is a KD elephant in the room a big plasma monster

06:57.480 --> 07:05.040
we're gonna talk about that today and some accusations being thrown around some new application updates coming out and all of that goodness from

07:05.040 --> 07:07.040
the plasma folks as well as

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
What I believe is the one true

07:09.600 --> 07:11.480
The one true ring no

07:11.480 --> 07:16.680
I'm kidding the one true form of integration or whatever you want to call it canonical calls it convergence

07:17.020 --> 07:20.600
Microsoft calls it. I think continuity or continuity or something like that. I

07:21.120 --> 07:25.900
Actually think there's something here today that we all could install you don't even have to be a KDE desktop user

07:25.900 --> 07:31.380
To take advantage of a really slick integration between your phone and your desktop. You don't need a dock

07:32.020 --> 07:36.520
You don't need any special set it already. We'll tell you about it. Yeah, and then later on in the show

07:37.300 --> 07:39.300
I've been looking at options

07:39.420 --> 07:44.220
Something easy to recommend to people that is an open source to drop in set and forget it a router for the home

07:44.420 --> 07:52.260
That gets updates that stays secure that uses software. We can trust we're gonna talk about that today in the show as well and then

07:52.260 --> 07:56.740
Then we're gonna see if we can end curses all of the things

07:57.020 --> 08:03.420
King Looper put us to the challenge and wants us to end curses all of the things every last thing every last damn thing damn

08:03.420 --> 08:05.740
Yeah, we're gonna do it with the help of the mumble room. That's right

08:05.740 --> 08:08.380
Well, actually with soul reliance on the mumble room

08:08.380 --> 08:15.300
We have a couple of suggestions, but this is a mumble room app pick segment that we'll be getting to which was requested by the mumble

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
Well, there you go. They get what they want

08:17.300 --> 08:23.100
Yeah, now it's coming to you. All right, and speaking of the mumble room, let's bring them in time appropriate greetings virtual log

08:26.180 --> 08:30.700
Zombies don't run Linux. It's good to have you there Danica's in there too. That's good. I love guys

08:30.700 --> 08:34.740
So I just really quickly a bit of Katie follow-up, you know

08:35.060 --> 08:38.380
The guys over at the Katie project are doing things in an interesting way

08:38.380 --> 08:42.580
You got the plasma desktop and you got the Katie applications and all this different stuff

08:42.580 --> 08:47.380
It's a whole set of applications and the Katie applications 1508 just got a release today

08:48.220 --> 08:52.260
as we are recording this release contains bug fixes translation updates a

08:52.820 --> 09:00.340
Nice update a good safe update for everybody if you use arc or Kate or Katie PIM or localize any of that stuff

09:01.020 --> 09:06.980
This is a great update. Plus this release also includes long-term support versions of the KD development platform for dot 14 dot

09:06.980 --> 09:13.720
13 and I'm gonna underscore that Katie 4.14 dot 13 is still getting updates

09:14.660 --> 09:21.980
The reason I'm going to underscore that is because that brings us to our first bit of feedback from KN RO in the Linux action

09:21.980 --> 09:24.860
Show subreddit does lass hate Katie

09:25.760 --> 09:33.060
Some strong words. Yeah, so I just listened episode 386 of lass and while they were covering Linux usage at the very large array

09:33.060 --> 09:37.980
Chris noted that it's probably red hat with Katie and then no it just couldn't help himself but claiming the Katie is a strange desktop

09:38.100 --> 09:44.860
For such an environment. I mean what the hell laughs. This is not the first anti Katie sentiment that I have heard on the show

09:44.860 --> 09:47.340
I mean, I know you're narrow your gnome fanboys

09:47.380 --> 09:53.140
But can you just try to stray a little bit towards neutral if the Linux action show not the gnome?

09:53.980 --> 09:57.380
action show and this is a this is a

09:58.140 --> 10:02.220
this is a charge that has been lobbied our way directly and

10:02.220 --> 10:04.140
I

10:04.140 --> 10:10.420
Just got off of reviewing netrunner and netrunner came with the netrunner rolling release came with the plasma 5 desktop

10:11.220 --> 10:13.960
And I did have some critical things walking away from there

10:14.460 --> 10:18.620
And I'll just give you a couple of things that happened to me and these are just my experiences

10:18.620 --> 10:21.060
so I'm trying this on a system 76 bonobo and

10:22.740 --> 10:28.280
Traditionally these have been extremely reliable Linux computers without any hardware issues

10:28.280 --> 10:32.940
It's a really safe platform to test a distribution on they've seen a lot of distributions yes

10:32.940 --> 10:37.820
And I had weird things just in the last couple of days for example

10:37.820 --> 10:42.020
I would go click on the menu and then shut down and nothing happens

10:42.020 --> 10:44.940
and then I would click on the menu again and click shut down and

10:45.900 --> 10:50.260
Nothing happens, and then I would click on the menu again and click shut down and it would shut down

10:50.260 --> 10:53.020
Oh, that's almost worse than it never working. Yeah, right

10:53.020 --> 10:55.940
It's just very strange or there was another time where I was thinking about something

10:55.940 --> 11:00.580
I wanted to try and I was just sitting here looking at the screen not even doing anything and

11:01.140 --> 11:06.500
plasma 5 just crashed it just crashed like the desktop just crashed didn't even touch it and then I

11:07.260 --> 11:09.420
Put a thumb drive in which is actually still in the machine

11:09.420 --> 11:15.140
I put a thumb drive in and the little notification box comes up says hey you put a thumb drive in and I click open

11:15.140 --> 11:19.720
And file manager the entire desktop session freezes the entire desktop freezes

11:19.720 --> 11:23.540
I can still alt tab control tab over to my other virtual consoles

11:23.540 --> 11:25.540
totally frozen

11:25.940 --> 11:31.100
All right, so I restart everything and I restart relaunch get all my thing we get everything reloaded again

11:31.100 --> 11:35.380
It's whatever I bounced back. It's not a big deal, but it's one after one after one like this

11:36.220 --> 11:41.520
There's a lot of little things that we ran into during the testing that I walked away thinking

11:42.700 --> 11:47.900
This is unpredictably unreliable to me like I can't I can't even fathom

11:47.900 --> 11:52.980
What's gonna cause it to crash like I can't even wrap my head around and then just avoid that behavior and avoid it if you

11:52.980 --> 11:55.780
Wanted to and this is generally the point

11:56.220 --> 12:00.660
Where rotten corpse would jump in and tell me that kde 5 has not been declared stable

12:00.660 --> 12:02.660
Do you want to make that point now rotten?

12:03.660 --> 12:06.780
Yeah, thank you, and so very much so

12:07.540 --> 12:11.540
It's something you have to understand is that there is a long-term support development platform

12:11.620 --> 12:14.100
Which I just told you about the version 4.14 that's out

12:14.100 --> 12:16.980
And if you're actually gonna run kitty as a daily driver

12:16.980 --> 12:23.100
I think you might want to consider that do you agree with that rotten and isn't that your daily driver right now? It is my daily

12:23.100 --> 12:25.100
driver and why not plasma 5

12:25.540 --> 12:30.140
Because it's not stable. Well, but they haven't declared it stable. It is pretty stable in the sense of

12:30.980 --> 12:38.320
Most people who's been testing it and with 5.4. So and also it matters what distro you're using it on because

12:38.820 --> 12:40.820
The net runner is not a good example of

12:41.700 --> 12:43.320
well

12:43.320 --> 12:48.020
Quality in my opinion. Yeah, I mean you take issue with the managerial base and things like that, right?

12:48.260 --> 12:51.540
right, I take I don't like men draw it in any way whatsoever and

12:52.380 --> 12:54.380
I think that's a terrible base

12:54.380 --> 12:59.820
But I also think that a lot of the decisions that netrunner made are nothing to talk, you know right home about

13:00.500 --> 13:07.220
Like the fact that they have stuff pre-installed. Okay, so that takes 10 seconds to install something. That's yeah

13:07.220 --> 13:14.180
Yeah, and actually to that point one of the things I like the most actually the fact that they had steam library

13:14.540 --> 13:20.620
System libraries and clear all clear all whatever it was. That's actually from managerial. They inherited that from manager

13:21.460 --> 13:25.540
Yeah, so okay. There's there's different weird things that

13:26.340 --> 13:29.660
they did that they just decided that wouldn't really work well and

13:30.300 --> 13:35.740
They even decided to rip out some of the plasma 5 stuff and go back to some for stuff which makes really no sense

13:35.740 --> 13:37.140
but

13:37.140 --> 13:41.700
Like if you look at kabuntu, there are a lot of people who are talking about kabuntu 1510 and using beta

13:43.700 --> 13:45.700
Wnsx is one of them

13:46.140 --> 13:48.140
another person in the mumble

13:48.300 --> 13:54.100
Frequently fretsil is one of them and they've been using it for the beta for a long time and had no problems at all

13:54.540 --> 13:59.500
So it doesn't matter what distro is implementing the plasma 5. So rotten. Do you think it's a little?

13:59.500 --> 14:06.180
Inappropriate and maybe a little premature for certain distributions to be shipping the plasma 5 desktop

14:06.180 --> 14:09.740
I think it used to be now. It's understandable like

14:10.380 --> 14:16.300
5.4 is very close to being a solid release and even production ready

14:16.460 --> 14:23.220
But you have to have the latest version of 5.4. So the latest good quality version is 5.4 point 2

14:23.780 --> 14:28.100
Netrunner s 5.5 point 4.1, which is not as

14:28.100 --> 14:29.140
as

14:29.140 --> 14:34.140
Polished right because they make new releases all the time and if you don't keep up with it

14:34.260 --> 14:38.500
But the odd thing is that of all distros kabuntu is keeping up with it

14:39.220 --> 14:43.220
because they're they were they're currently their beta is currently 5.4 point 2 and

14:44.020 --> 14:50.860
How much they're keeping to keep up with a PPA or whatever who knows? Yeah, but I think 5.4 is good enough

14:50.860 --> 14:55.640
I think 5.5 is going to be like the first solid

14:55.640 --> 15:02.400
Production ready everything. This is what I've been hoping about 5.5 and and Wes. I'm almost virtually positive

15:02.400 --> 15:07.640
You're not a plasma desktop user. Have you experimented with it since the 5.0 releases come out?

15:07.640 --> 15:14.040
And since then have you looked at it? Uh, yes, I have installed a preview of it when it was very new

15:14.040 --> 15:16.040
I have not used it since maybe

15:16.400 --> 15:20.800
5152 I don't quite remember which version it was and I like a lot of what they're doing

15:20.800 --> 15:23.800
I have I do not have personal experience that with is in production ready

15:23.800 --> 15:27.520
And that's you know, a lot of these what is the threshold for you before you would be willing to try it out?

15:27.520 --> 15:33.960
Is it just your workflow is is good enough now or is it you've heard enough horror stories that you're not even interested

15:33.960 --> 15:38.840
I think I fall in the I tolerate crashes and setbacks a little better than a lot of people

15:38.840 --> 15:43.880
Yeah, I have a little more. Yeah flow in my workflows than some so that's not a huge deal to me

15:44.920 --> 15:47.520
So maybe now maybe now is the perfect time for me to give it a shot

15:47.520 --> 15:55.040
Yeah, and I so my takeaway was is I actually for a long time. It was a KDE user. I actually really

15:55.520 --> 15:57.640
Really there's elements of the plasma 5 desktop

15:57.640 --> 16:03.280
I like a lot and I have found different iterations of the 5 desktop to be more stable than other right?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.680
yeah, and so for me I just I

16:07.400 --> 16:10.460
Can't help but take a I when I start having these problems

16:10.460 --> 16:12.680
I can't help but take a step back and go wow

16:12.680 --> 16:18.080
What if I was an average user and I didn't know to expect this or I didn't know this was beta

16:18.080 --> 16:20.080
Or I didn't know how to solve this problem

16:20.440 --> 16:25.520
This some of these things I run into would to me be fundamentally unsolvable problems that make them

16:25.720 --> 16:30.760
Unusable and a lot of times when I get the when I get the feedback about you hate KDE. It's I

16:31.680 --> 16:37.360
Think it's misinterpreted as I think there's a lot of use cases where plasma 5 doesn't make sense

16:37.360 --> 16:39.240
And there's somewhere plasma 5 does make sense

16:39.240 --> 16:43.040
And I just think there's a lot fewer use cases where plasma 5 makes sense than even

16:43.920 --> 16:45.360
plasma 4

16:45.360 --> 16:48.800
So anyways, I I it is getting there

16:50.480 --> 16:55.960
I'm not but I hate I hate the idea that if we if we critique a few things we come across as anti KDE

16:56.080 --> 17:00.980
That's not really my intention. You're still interested in a succeeding it absolutely developing. That's why I can

17:00.980 --> 17:08.500
Check it out. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no actually is an interesting issue because when

17:10.140 --> 17:12.740
I'm a known fanboy and I have been for like a decade and

17:13.720 --> 17:19.940
When I used KDE 4, I noticed some problems that were fixed in 5

17:20.540 --> 17:25.420
So plasma 5 had all like 99% of what I hated about 4 was in 5

17:25.420 --> 17:30.900
So I was like, I'm I'm excited for 5 and it helped me kind of pull back from critiquing

17:32.020 --> 17:34.780
4 and saying look how this is crap. This is crap

17:34.780 --> 17:36.780
You realize that it's going to be better

17:36.780 --> 17:40.180
But right now just look at the different pieces what makes KDE good

17:40.460 --> 17:46.700
So it's a weird approach like if I had done this test that I did later earlier this year if I had transitioned

17:47.020 --> 17:51.440
Two years ago, it'd be completely different. I would have hated KDE. Hmm, but now

17:51.440 --> 17:57.200
Since I had the perspective that the stuff that I hate is going to be fixed or is already fixed, you know

17:57.200 --> 17:59.200
They're working on it, right?

17:59.240 --> 18:06.560
Well, I like there's here's here's the biggest problem that I have with KDE 4 is that if you like people who like dark themes

18:06.560 --> 18:08.560
Which is a lot of people now

18:08.720 --> 18:10.840
I'm one of them. I have a dark theme

18:12.040 --> 18:15.840
Globally associated to my KDE and I'm a big fan of that

18:16.440 --> 18:18.040
but if

18:18.040 --> 18:23.320
You do a KDE 4 dark theme it will destroy the look of Firefox

18:27.160 --> 18:33.200
Yeah, it fixes it actually makes improvements on some applications like if you for example just load up file filezilla

18:33.200 --> 18:38.880
Well silly is hideous by default, but KDE will fix it and make it look good, which is weird

18:38.880 --> 18:41.440
but it makes it look good, but it takes Firefox and just like

18:41.440 --> 18:47.920
It's Firefox and Thunderbird and makes them just completely crap that you have to stop and fix it or not use it

18:48.320 --> 18:53.960
Well, that's interesting because Firefox and Thunderbird have their own theming things that you think would override that anyway

18:53.960 --> 18:56.260
It's because they're based on GTK 2, right?

18:56.800 --> 19:02.080
Yeah, and that's that's the fundamental problem of the UI, but if you

19:02.680 --> 19:07.480
Run Thunderbird and Firefox in plasma 5 that problem is gone. They fixed it completely

19:07.480 --> 19:11.760
Hmm, so that that problem that I originally go. Holy crap. This is awful

19:12.360 --> 19:17.380
I'm not really pissed off about it because I know it's been fixed and I'm going to get a better version

19:17.640 --> 19:22.560
Yeah, it does help when you know, they're working on it. That is very true. And actually Alan since you're here

19:22.560 --> 19:24.440
I guess I kick it over to you

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
It is KDE a better

19:26.560 --> 19:32.160
BSD citizen than gnome or has known been pretty good about when they when they build something that say requires login D

19:32.160 --> 19:39.320
They work with well other projects to make sure that so at BSD can this year one of the gnome developers presented?

19:40.080 --> 19:46.640
A talk at our conference. Oh, yeah, I mean how they actually have free BSD in their continuous integration system

19:46.640 --> 19:53.360
Okay, so that they because the problem before was, you know KD's developers make a commit that breaks free BSD

19:53.840 --> 20:00.440
six months later, they do a release on that and then eventually that shortly after that gets ported to free BSD and

20:00.440 --> 20:07.680
Eventually a user gets it and tries it and finds a problem by then the developer that made the change

20:07.680 --> 20:10.520
It's been eight months and he's moved on to something else. Yeah, for sure

20:11.120 --> 20:18.760
So by integrating previously into their continuous iteration system, they find these bugs within 24 hours and

20:19.880 --> 20:24.360
So it's helped them ensure that gnome runs properly on on free BSD

20:24.360 --> 20:30.760
That's good by actually doing that and we're glad to be able to try them to help they needed to get that going and to see

20:30.760 --> 20:32.960
That they actually have an interest in doing that. Yeah, for sure

20:33.520 --> 20:39.200
Heaven's revenge you think you've got it figured out why people think I am anti KD take it sir. Oh

20:39.880 --> 20:46.880
Yes, but one quick thing on the previous D usage. Yeah, that's considering free BSD uses clang is its default compiler

20:46.880 --> 20:52.480
It can also use a lot of static analysis and find a bunch of crazy corner case bugs that the Linux distribution

20:52.480 --> 20:59.000
Choose GCC is default but not fine. So it might help the stability on the BSD platform versus

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
Hmm that's an interesting point

21:03.160 --> 21:09.120
Alright, so that helps definitely in the back end in the background. So is it something I've been saying?

21:09.120 --> 21:11.120
Is it the way I talk about it? What is it?

21:11.920 --> 21:18.920
Well, we used to love on KDE, but then you know how gnome had a very rocky start. Yeah

21:18.920 --> 21:25.760
Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir. Well, we started seeing it improve. We were trying to give it

21:26.760 --> 21:33.400
Props and have people not be scared to try it. So we're giving a lot of positivity to warm usage

21:33.680 --> 21:38.320
So that might be why people are thinking that you're being negative about KDE by ink

21:39.360 --> 21:47.120
By encouraging the areas that need fixing and things like that. So, you know, such or at least attempt. Yeah, I actually we did some episodes

21:47.120 --> 21:54.760
I actually we did some episodes dedicated to the issues with gnome 3 it was in fact, I remember I remember being

21:55.760 --> 22:00.220
If I took it took years, in fact, it wasn't until January 5th

22:00.920 --> 22:07.840
2014 a season 30 episode 4 of the Linux action show so it has been a while now back in the seasons

22:07.840 --> 22:14.460
Yeah back to the seasons where we said gnomes getting good enough now knew like it wasn't until January 5th

22:14.760 --> 22:16.640
2014 that we said

22:16.640 --> 22:21.400
Now gnome is turning the corner and it's worth checking out and until then we were not of that opinion

22:21.400 --> 22:27.520
Yep, and it's it's just there is a threshold like you were saying and I think maybe this is something worth exploring a little bit

22:29.080 --> 22:35.920
You're willing to live with a few extra bugs assuming it's something I'm interested in and it's makes it worthwhile to check out and Rodden

22:35.920 --> 22:37.320
It was kind of saying the same thing

22:37.320 --> 22:40.880
He's willing to live with a few extra bugs if he knows they're working on it

22:40.880 --> 22:45.940
And I think it is interesting that people were very critical of gnome and now there's a lot of people who that's all been

22:45.940 --> 22:51.820
You know, it's gone now people people. Yeah base their whole work now. There's nothing to fear. It was of what it used to be

22:58.580 --> 23:00.580
Yeah, yeah true true

23:00.880 --> 23:08.800
Yeah, so what was it the real problem was your comment was you know, why is this was a scientific project was it?

23:09.300 --> 23:15.180
Wait, what you know the VLA? Oh, oh, I that I was surprised that there you know as common

23:15.180 --> 23:18.740
I was surprised that they were using KD because it was an old Red Hat installation

23:18.740 --> 23:21.260
Which means it was a very old KD installation, right?

23:21.260 --> 23:24.260
but the reason to use KD in that setting is

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
because your

23:27.500 --> 23:32.300
Scientists are Windows users and they're coming over and I agree the same

23:32.300 --> 23:36.620
I think I the reason why I use KD boy, but if you're a KD advocate

23:36.620 --> 23:42.100
That's not the number one reason you want people using KD. I wouldn't think it's because it makes switching easier

23:42.100 --> 23:48.540
Yeah, yeah, and and as far as deploying something for scientists to use that's the main thing. Yeah, I agree

23:48.540 --> 23:50.340
I think that's why they were using it too

23:50.340 --> 23:54.540
It was just a it was a throwaway comment that didn't leave a lot of room for I mean

23:54.540 --> 23:59.220
I didn't feel like going into a five-minute explanation about it. But that was that was essentially it. I

23:59.780 --> 24:03.100
Agree Kitson. You have a comment you want to make about combativeness

24:04.100 --> 24:10.260
Yeah, I've noticed that the KDE devs for the most part like on the forums and even an IRC

24:10.260 --> 24:17.820
Can tend to be a little bit combative about their decisions and whatnot when they do receive criticisms or suggestions?

24:18.500 --> 24:23.540
Just like what you have mentioned time and time again about like the sound module and whatnot

24:23.540 --> 24:27.700
And it still hasn't remained changed and it still is a problem

24:28.140 --> 24:30.860
Yeah, it's kind of funny how much of a problem it is too

24:30.940 --> 24:36.020
If you have if you have a computer that has built-in speakers and a headphone jack

24:36.020 --> 24:41.100
HDMI out and like say maybe like a USB audio device. I understand

24:41.100 --> 24:43.100
This is maybe not a super common setup

24:43.100 --> 24:49.340
But I am describing the setup of anybody that has a laptop and hooks up a USB sound card can't be that uncommon, right?

24:49.460 --> 24:55.580
Because most laptops have HDMI that does audio most laptops have a headphone jack and if you hook up a USB sound device

24:55.580 --> 24:57.260
It's not that weird now you got three

24:57.260 --> 25:04.140
And so what we discovered in the latest version that we detested was the way you make sure that sound goes out the right

25:04.140 --> 25:08.700
sound card because in a lot of applications like mumble and Skype they just say

25:09.260 --> 25:12.640
We're gonna use whatever the pulse audio default is you can't you can't specify

25:13.340 --> 25:17.300
What the default sound card is you can just choose default pulse audio device?

25:17.340 --> 25:21.620
So you have to mandate and pulse what your default device is system-wide

25:22.500 --> 25:24.820
Okay, I can roll with that not a big deal

25:24.940 --> 25:29.580
So I go I go in there and the only way to make sure that the sound is going out the right sound card is

25:29.580 --> 25:34.500
By actually turning off all the other sound cards so instead of selecting your sound card

25:34.500 --> 25:38.460
It is a process of elimination you go to the HDMI adapter you turn it off

25:38.460 --> 25:42.900
You go to the built-in headphone jack you turn it off you go to the built-in speakers you turn it off

25:42.900 --> 25:48.300
And then you go to your your USB audio device, and you choose from five different options in the drop-down

25:48.860 --> 25:52.260
Analog stereo duplex, I don't know why it has to have all those different options

25:52.260 --> 25:54.380
I don't know why it has to be a process of elimination

25:54.380 --> 25:58.900
And I actually had to have so I had to have Rekai come down here and verify with his own eyes that I was doing

25:58.900 --> 26:05.340
The right thing because the UI is so odd and so weird now is that a big deal once you learn it

26:05.340 --> 26:10.540
No, but when you pick it up. It is very very strange, and I think these are legitimate points that we make all right

26:10.540 --> 26:12.540
All right

26:15.180 --> 26:19.660
Hardware you have to use is higher-end using different connections

26:19.660 --> 26:26.080
You're gonna have you're gonna deal with stuff like that, but if you're like a regular consumer user who has a USB headset for example

26:26.080 --> 26:29.200
We'll not have a problem with that because the USB headset will show up in mumble

26:30.800 --> 26:34.600
But they still have to you would actually still have to go into the settings and

26:40.360 --> 26:43.880
That's pulse pulses set that as your default sound device you got you got lucky

26:43.880 --> 26:49.840
I mean you got lucky maybe because my my USB audio device didn't get set as the default audio device

26:49.840 --> 26:51.840
I'm not using

26:55.160 --> 26:56.880
Anyways I

26:56.880 --> 27:01.880
I felt like I feel like I guess the core point is I feel like every time we try to say these things need to

27:01.880 --> 27:05.080
Be improved we get we get a lot of criticism for hating something

27:05.080 --> 27:08.640
I don't know why we have to hate just to be able to criticize

27:09.280 --> 27:14.440
Criticism does not equal hate criticism equals caring enough about something to say hey this could be improved upon

27:14.440 --> 27:22.440
I don't know like it's it kind of goes back to the episode from last week of the conversation of if there's a technical problem

27:23.000 --> 27:27.560
It's okay to perform up to point it out. Yeah, pretty much what you were doing right? Yeah

27:27.560 --> 27:34.120
Yeah, in fact speaking of technical stuff that first of all the plasma desktop is filled with awesome technical stuff

27:34.240 --> 27:37.400
But there is a really cool piece of software

27:37.760 --> 27:41.880
That rotten corpse actually had a chance to do a write-up on called Katie connect

27:41.880 --> 27:47.120
And you can sync your Android device with your Linux computer, and this is really really nice in fact

27:47.120 --> 27:50.080
You don't even really have to be a KD desktop user take advantage of it

27:50.080 --> 27:53.760
But this is an example of some really cool technology so before we get into that

27:53.760 --> 27:57.360
I'm going to tell you about our friends over at ting my mobile service provider

27:57.720 --> 28:05.440
Linux dot ting dot-com the internet service provider of the JB rover as well ting is pay for what you use mobile service

28:05.440 --> 28:10.080
How cool is that it's a flat six dollars for the line, and then you just pay for what you use

28:10.080 --> 28:13.840
I'm not even joking that's seriously how it's structured. It's six dollars for the line

28:14.560 --> 28:18.400
Cellphone my fi ting don't care their honey badger about it

28:18.400 --> 28:22.240
It's just six dollars and your usage your minutes your messages your megabytes

28:22.360 --> 28:28.740
No BS charges no extra stuff. No early termination like charges because there's no contract

28:29.360 --> 28:33.840
Nothing like that in fact not only is there no contract, but they have an early termination relief program

28:33.840 --> 28:37.120
I love it. They have an aggressively awesome customer service department

28:37.120 --> 28:40.080
I'd love for you to try them out at one eight five five ting FTW

28:40.080 --> 28:43.960
They have fantastic online communities and because ting is so cool

28:43.960 --> 28:45.600
And they're kind of changing things up a little bit

28:45.600 --> 28:50.520
There are some uber passionate community members that definitely want to help you out is really really cool

28:51.000 --> 28:55.920
What I love about ting is that I'm able to go at it with a little bit of intelligence a little bit of flexibility

28:56.120 --> 29:00.320
So I know that I have X amount of devices. I want to put them all on one plan

29:00.320 --> 29:02.960
I don't want to have to sit here and nickel and dime myself either

29:02.960 --> 29:08.360
I want to have up three or four devices, and I just want to pay a pool of minutes across them for whatever they use

29:08.360 --> 29:09.280
So if I got a couple of phones

29:09.280 --> 29:11.960
I don't use very much or a mi-fi device that I don't use very much

29:11.960 --> 29:16.600
I only pay for the device that is actually using the service and here's another thing. I love about ting

29:17.000 --> 29:19.880
GSM service and CDMA service bumsies

29:19.880 --> 29:24.680
So that way you got a compatible device almost guaranteed in your house because guess what cell phones have been around for a while

29:24.680 --> 29:29.760
You bring it over to ting and when you go to Linux dot ting comm you're gonna get the discount off a phone

29:29.760 --> 29:33.160
But if you got a phone that's working on these GSM or CDMA networks, and you probably do

29:34.200 --> 29:39.080
$25 service credit that paid for more than my first month of ting here's another nice thing about ting

29:39.560 --> 29:44.680
Excellent excellent dashboard really good. It really solves all the problems

29:44.680 --> 29:46.920
I have been a ting customer for over two years

29:46.920 --> 29:51.640
And I've had to call them for a grand total of twice and the first time I called them

29:51.640 --> 29:55.020
I was like yeah, might as well just call them and see what it's like second time

29:55.020 --> 29:57.260
I called them it was totally legit and man

29:57.260 --> 30:00.920
They were like a dog with a bone when it came to my problem. They I

30:01.520 --> 30:03.440
Honestly, it was 20 minutes into the issue

30:03.440 --> 30:09.680
And I thought for sure the customer service rep was gonna start wrapping me up and apologizing and just letting me go man

30:09.680 --> 30:13.160
She stuck with the issue like it was super impressive

30:13.160 --> 30:19.200
It felt really good because I could tell that my time was valuable to ting. I love their dashboard

30:19.200 --> 30:25.160
I love their customer service Linux dot ting comm I want you to check them out six dollars a month for your phone and yes

30:25.160 --> 30:31.800
You can go pick up the Nexus 5x and the Nexus 6p and bring them over to ting

30:32.080 --> 30:32.960
That's right

30:32.960 --> 30:35.520
You can officially bring the Nexus 5 or Nexus pay to ting

30:35.880 --> 30:39.680
Powerful well price you can get the Google edition if you're gonna get yourself a Google phone

30:39.960 --> 30:44.400
You can check it out ting is gonna be doing an unboxing very soon, but here's the power user tip

30:45.000 --> 30:49.440
Just go get a SIM card. We got GSM and CDMA SIM cards for nine dollars

30:49.440 --> 30:55.520
And when you go to linux.ting.com you get a $25 discount if you have a device that needs to do

30:56.120 --> 30:58.760
Updating over text messages check in for stats

30:59.360 --> 31:04.600
Update any kind of remote information like a I mean for example my buddy chase. I thought was

31:05.080 --> 31:09.600
Brilliant about this he went and got one of these home security systems that just

31:09.800 --> 31:13.960
Transmits an image when it detects motion and and and a condition has been triggered very nice

31:13.960 --> 31:19.680
And when that happens it just sends him an image over the ting CDMA network just sends it to him

31:19.680 --> 31:21.600
I think he's using GSM

31:21.600 --> 31:25.680
And I just get he gets the push notification on his phone and he can bring it up and then if he wants to he can

31:25.680 --> 31:29.840
Initiate a real-time stream now when chase was first looking at building that he's like well

31:29.840 --> 31:33.040
I could go get a $30 $40 and $60 a month different

31:33.040 --> 31:38.200
These are like my different plan options, or I can go to ting six dollars a month pay for what I use Noah

31:38.560 --> 31:43.560
Buys like a batch of these GSM SIM cards and then as he gets the devices he pops them in there and boom he's got

31:43.560 --> 31:47.520
Ting service on it now. That's really cool. It is really really cool

31:47.520 --> 31:53.200
You can go to linux.ting.com to get our discount and also go check out their blog to find out details about the new Nexus devices

31:53.200 --> 31:55.200
with that USB C connector

31:55.480 --> 32:00.320
You know what I like about the 5x and the 6p Nexus devices not only are they Google edition devices?

32:00.760 --> 32:04.240
But they have GSM and CDMA antennas in them

32:04.240 --> 32:09.240
And if you combine that I mean just think about this for a second so you can be on ting you pay for what you?

32:09.240 --> 32:12.680
Use you getting all the devices are unlocked, so it's like you really own the device

32:12.680 --> 32:17.040
And then with like the Nexus line of devices you can pick between

32:17.280 --> 32:21.840
CDMA and GSM depending on what you need where you're going all that stuff

32:21.840 --> 32:28.880
That is awesome really slick really really slick linux.ting.com to support the show and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux

32:28.880 --> 32:30.880
Unplugged program that is very awesome

32:31.600 --> 32:33.600
All right, Mr.. Rotten corpse

32:33.960 --> 32:39.960
Now tell me about Kde connect because it promises to sync my Android device with my linux desktop

32:39.960 --> 32:44.760
And I'm thinking to myself man wouldn't this be nice to finally if I mark something is red somewhere

32:44.760 --> 32:46.880
It's marked as red on both devices if I get a notification

32:47.560 --> 32:53.360
or maybe if I just want to check basic connectivity and so this kind of sounds like it's right up my alley and

32:54.120 --> 32:59.200
When you from what you were telling me on the pre show I don't necessarily even have to be a Kde user do I?

32:59.800 --> 33:04.360
Nope, you don't there's a app indicator, and there's also a shell extension for

33:04.360 --> 33:10.440
For gnome to use the app indicator or to use this Kde connect daemon

33:11.040 --> 33:13.960
Not all of the features are available to like

33:14.680 --> 33:21.560
There's actually only one problem if you're not a Kde user and that is you can't send the connection from the phone to

33:22.320 --> 33:29.000
accept on the computer because the Kde notifications are the only ones that have that functionality built in okay

33:29.000 --> 33:34.960
It will display, but the functionality doesn't work any other de's all right you send the connection from the applet, and it's fine

33:36.440 --> 33:42.640
But the reason why Kde connect is awesome is not like a lot of people look at it is it notification system and

33:43.160 --> 33:47.200
Originally, that's what it was, but there's it's beyond that ridiculous now

33:48.320 --> 33:52.960
You can you sync it notifications. Yes, that's cool, but it has

33:52.960 --> 33:59.720
a wireless mounting of your Android device to your phone wow oh, that's cool. Yeah, it has

34:00.920 --> 34:08.280
Multi-device clipboard synchronization, so yeah, so you have used you copy something on your desktop it will

34:08.680 --> 34:15.700
Then copy it to your phone and then Kde connect will handle it sending it to every other device that is currently connected at that time

34:16.160 --> 34:21.840
And I've tested it through like five different computers, and it all syncs immediately, and there's no lag whatsoever

34:21.840 --> 34:28.520
You just move to the next when it's there. That's cool. That is really slick then it also has a remote input controls, which

34:29.280 --> 34:34.840
Ridiculously awesome, and I don't you know I never thought I would do it until I trusted on a tablet

34:34.880 --> 34:40.060
It's amazing you basically turn your tablet into a touchpad. Oh like a mouse

34:40.360 --> 34:40.880
Yeah

34:40.880 --> 34:46.040
You have a mouse so you have a remote mouse that you can use and you can also have do keyboard your kit your Android

34:46.040 --> 34:48.120
Keyboard can be your keyboard for your computer

34:48.120 --> 34:51.940
Yeah, I know Chris Moore to do PCB SD or

34:52.480 --> 34:58.920
BSD now with uses his Android cell phone to control his media center really pause and play and scrub through videos

35:01.200 --> 35:05.840
Yeah, and this is another cool thing about that is that you it'll work it doesn't work for every player

35:05.840 --> 35:07.840
but it works for like VLC and

35:08.480 --> 35:11.760
Clementine and a lot of applications work, so the ones I use

35:12.280 --> 35:15.880
Yeah, pretty much, so it works with the only guy the only two player

35:15.880 --> 35:21.720
I couldn't find I could find that would not work was mpv, and that's just because they haven't built the functionality in but

35:22.680 --> 35:25.680
There's there's another cool thing about the media player is

35:26.800 --> 35:30.220
It is not only you know controlling media from

35:30.800 --> 35:38.200
Your phone to your computer it also allows you to get to use your your computer your phone as a reference to when to

35:38.320 --> 35:43.560
Lower the volume or mute it so if you get a phone call it will mute your music on your computer

35:43.560 --> 35:49.040
So that is like yeah, and then as soon as you hang up the phone call the music is back up Wow

35:49.480 --> 35:51.780
Okay, that almost tells me on it right there. I

35:52.480 --> 35:56.200
Mean the VLC thing so I have been using I can't remember it. Oh shoot uh

35:56.920 --> 36:02.600
Rekha I might know if he's if he's watching live, but I've been using a Linux an Android app. Oh

36:04.280 --> 36:10.000
Unified remote unified remote I've been using unified remote for a while to essentially accomplish a tiny

36:10.000 --> 36:16.080
Fraction of what you're talking about unified remote it has a little daemon that you install on your Linux box

36:16.480 --> 36:23.900
That makes your your your remote touch device act like a keyboard input device or a mouse and you can control VLC and stuff like

36:23.900 --> 36:29.940
That but you don't get like the pausing and the muting I mean that is genuinely slick the level of integration here seems

36:30.020 --> 36:32.720
Yeah, almost unbelievable. It's more than that too

36:32.720 --> 36:37.060
You also can like make it where it'll display your battery percentage of your phone on your computer

36:37.060 --> 36:40.920
That's nice. You can easily switch, and that's just that's not a little nicety, but there's

36:42.080 --> 36:46.100
Other things you can send files back and forth from the phone to the computer

36:46.100 --> 36:49.360
So if you send a file from your phone, it will go with your downloads folder in your computer

36:50.040 --> 36:52.040
And it like it does

36:52.360 --> 36:56.760
This is not even everything I've mentioned like there's not everything I've mentioned is not all what it does

36:56.760 --> 37:02.520
What is it using on the back end is it using like to transfer the files is it using SSHFS is it using yes?

37:02.520 --> 37:09.000
Uh-huh does the file so does the phone and the app on the phone have like a login to your computer. How does that work?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.560
Yeah, you you essentially you

37:12.440 --> 37:16.200
use SSH to share keys between the devices so that your

37:16.520 --> 37:21.320
Like it will remember your devices and what like your names and things like that based on the SSH key, okay?

37:21.560 --> 37:24.980
That is nice. I love that. It's doing over SSH and does that

37:25.760 --> 37:27.880
How possible is it to do some of this stuff?

37:27.880 --> 37:33.000
Outside your LAN like say if you have a port forwarding setup right now

37:33.000 --> 37:38.560
It's not technically well actually over your LAN if you have if you go through the process of port forwarding you could probably you can

37:38.560 --> 37:42.160
Make it work or you probably need a dynamic DNS or something like yeah, yeah

37:42.520 --> 37:49.120
But if you but another cool thing is that they're working on currently like the next release are two features that are coming

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
That are even more awesome

37:51.400 --> 37:57.600
That makes this is actually one of the KDE Connect is one of the tools that makes me love KDE project

37:58.600 --> 38:01.740
Because of like all the amazing stuff. They're building for it

38:02.280 --> 38:07.600
and then two things that are coming now is replying to SMS from your yeah Wow and

38:08.640 --> 38:12.680
Bluetooth support so instead of Wi-Fi. It's Bluetooth that handles the yeah

38:13.200 --> 38:17.520
I agree with heavens this stuff kind of thing is much better over the LAN the only thing is is

38:17.520 --> 38:23.000
When I'm out and about and I know this is stupid, but they keep putting better and better cameras and mobile phones

38:23.000 --> 38:25.440
And so I can't help but use it for stuff, and then I'm like okay now

38:25.440 --> 38:27.360
I want to immediately send that back to the studio

38:27.360 --> 38:29.360
Yeah, so that could be really cool, so

38:29.720 --> 38:32.040
Now I don't not to jump a hot not to jump ahead

38:32.040 --> 38:37.680
But I kind of wanted to have a caveat in here for the mint users because apparently you ran into some issues there

38:38.040 --> 38:40.680
Yeah, I did so I like the mean

38:41.560 --> 38:45.320
Yeah, mint does the I don't know why they do this

38:45.320 --> 38:51.680
I I kind of get it, but it's also doesn't make sense because it's just based on the hierarchy of where you put the new source

38:52.000 --> 38:57.280
It's that's all you need to do, but for some reason the mint team decided to put the priority of

38:57.720 --> 39:01.400
Their packages on their repos higher than Ubuntu

39:01.480 --> 39:09.720
But the PPAs del fault lower than the proprietary that mint does so if you put your PPA on

39:09.720 --> 39:12.960
Top of the list on Ubuntu it uses that PPA

39:12.960 --> 39:19.120
But because they're both 500 level priority, but mint for some reason does a 700 priority

39:19.240 --> 39:22.400
So even if you install that PPA. It's going to completely ignore it

39:23.280 --> 39:28.800
So you have to change the policy of mint on your computer, or you have to install with a deb file

39:29.200 --> 39:33.040
So I assume if I install this on my pretty much known pure system

39:33.040 --> 39:35.320
There's going to be a quite a bit of dependencies that it's going to pull down

39:36.080 --> 39:41.960
Yeah, it'll it will have been it will bring in some KD libraries like I've had there was a people a couple people ask me

39:41.960 --> 39:49.720
Questions on the article and in reddit like what they were confused by because a lot of people consider like the KD dependency is

39:49.720 --> 39:51.080
Like a horrible thing

39:51.080 --> 39:56.000
But it brings in packages, and if you're long as you're you know not in 1998

39:56.000 --> 39:57.480
You don't really have to care about the size

39:57.480 --> 39:58.240
That's true

39:58.240 --> 40:03.640
And then the honest the honest truth is is a lot of times with the QT stuff once you pull it in once pretty much

40:03.640 --> 40:08.840
They're going forward all the other QT apps you need are gonna rely you just shocked that first time yeah exactly like well

40:08.840 --> 40:12.160
You know and I pretty much got over that the first time. It's old quazzle. Yep exactly

40:12.960 --> 40:19.600
It's not the disk space so much though because with with the KD connect stuff. It requires the KD base

40:19.800 --> 40:23.680
Yeah, so you've got a quiet bit more. That's running in the background

40:27.200 --> 40:28.880
Okay, it's not it's not like it's running

40:28.880 --> 40:31.160
It's not running QT in the background for anything

40:31.160 --> 40:36.840
And it's not running like plasma or anything like that you're pulling those packages in right you're pulling in the KD base packages

40:36.840 --> 40:38.840
Which is quite a bit of stuff?

40:39.480 --> 40:44.680
But yeah, I agree. It's probably in most the times not all that of avoid

40:44.680 --> 40:48.560
I mean, it's not it's not all avoidable because there's a lot of apps that require that

40:48.560 --> 40:52.560
I mean even on a gnome system. There's a lot of apps that you end up still pulling that down, so yeah

40:52.560 --> 40:54.680
That's not it's not it's not a big deal

40:54.680 --> 40:55.960
It used to be a big deal

40:55.960 --> 41:00.520
But now that it's kind of like one of those legacy issues that people complain about ten years ago

41:00.640 --> 41:04.820
That was relevant then that isn't now, but people still complain about I bet you though

41:04.820 --> 41:11.560
I bet wimpy's to wimpy's point. I bet you it's enough that it won't ship by default in any non KD distros

41:11.560 --> 41:15.640
Right this is gonna be this is gonna be a bit of a leg up

41:16.280 --> 41:21.320
This is a nice advantage this KD connect is really nice. I know it once I hope it works

41:21.320 --> 41:25.300
I'm excited to try it when I go home well and and Wes I kind of you know when you when I think about

41:25.580 --> 41:31.120
Convergence this to me feels a little more like a lot my speed like it's a you know

41:31.120 --> 41:35.460
I'm being able to send files back and forth using SHFS the notifications things like that

41:35.460 --> 41:37.460
It's a little more like I'm I'm

41:37.800 --> 41:42.480
What I like about this is two things number one is it gets sort of two devices

41:42.480 --> 41:49.380
They're weren't really communicating before but doing a lot of the same jobs talking you love that number two is it's essentially Apple's

41:49.960 --> 41:52.300
Handjob, I mean handoff or whatever they call it

41:52.720 --> 41:59.040
But but for Apple you have to have a really new Mac that has bluetooth 4o le and you have to have it like at least

41:59.040 --> 42:03.800
An iPhone 5 or something or better for any of this stuff to work and here Linux comes along

42:03.800 --> 42:08.600
It's like oh, yeah, you got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and Android and KDE or KD dependencies. You're good to go

42:08.760 --> 42:12.800
No special hardware required. I also like that it lets you kind of separate things

42:12.800 --> 42:19.000
Maybe you like different programs on your phone versus you know or different different workload styles on your phone versus your full-size computer

42:19.000 --> 42:21.680
Yeah, so here you can just share the data without right sharing the app

42:21.680 --> 42:26.280
so also to point out another important thing about KD connect is it

42:26.280 --> 42:30.840
Pertains to the you know, they actually adopt the whole

42:31.600 --> 42:38.040
Customization thing as well in KD connect so every plug-in that is available to KD connect can be turned off on any device that you

42:38.040 --> 42:40.040
Want it to be?

42:40.760 --> 42:44.680
So for some reason if you don't like the clipboard synchronization you can turn it off and

42:45.320 --> 42:50.480
so what's the what's the advantage over something like this so versus like say push bullet or

42:51.800 --> 42:53.800
air droid

42:53.800 --> 42:57.040
They like well push build only does the like well air droid

42:57.040 --> 43:00.920
I hate air droid like there's a lot of people who talk about air droids business great

43:00.920 --> 43:05.940
But you have to activate the login connection every single time you use it like awful

43:06.220 --> 43:13.320
Anyway, well this one KD connect stores the connections and they work consistently regardless

43:13.320 --> 43:20.760
I have never had a connection drop. Oh really like even with Wi-Fi mounting of the file system. I never have a problem

43:20.760 --> 43:27.560
I don't have to worry about losing access while I'm moving files over or anything. It it's I've never had a problem and

43:29.280 --> 43:35.080
It allows me to control every aspect to it and it has features that push bullet for example only has like

43:35.920 --> 43:40.400
Notification in a file connection it push bullet does have SMS

43:40.880 --> 43:45.760
Response, but that's coming soon and KD connect and but another good thing is

43:45.760 --> 43:53.480
None of those are open source. Oh, that's exactly that's a good point, so I had boy. It's been

43:54.400 --> 44:01.280
Holy crap. Oh my god. It's been a year almost and it's been a year and about a week about a year and a week ago

44:01.280 --> 44:07.280
I met the developer of KD connect when he first started working on this and he I'm gonna get it wrong

44:07.280 --> 44:11.140
But I can't remember what country he moved from let's just say let's just pretend like it's Germany

44:11.280 --> 44:14.000
But he just moved to country a yeah

44:14.000 --> 44:17.800
But what what actually matters is he had just moved to Seattle hey?

44:17.900 --> 44:23.300
Yeah, so he was in Seattle, and I went to a KD users group because I hate KD so much

44:23.300 --> 44:27.880
I go to KD users group, and I was right on everyone. Yeah, right. Yeah, just cuz I could

44:31.640 --> 44:33.880
Yeah, that's what I do when I go to KD users groups

44:33.880 --> 44:38.920
And I went down there and I talked to him and I told him like how awesome it is and talked to him

44:38.920 --> 44:43.620
Also, there's some other there was designers there and things like that and I was asking him where where it was going next and he's

44:43.620 --> 44:48.160
Like well, you know just gonna keep working on it, and so here. We are a year later, and it is slick

44:48.160 --> 44:50.160
Yeah, it is really slick

44:50.880 --> 44:56.680
Very nice run and they need to work on their marketing more because they they don't that's one of the reasons

44:56.680 --> 44:59.080
I wanted to write an article about it is because it is

44:59.400 --> 45:01.840
When I never used it because I didn't use Katie then I used

45:02.600 --> 45:08.680
Wow this this is this would make me want to use Katie, but because I don't have to use Katie

45:08.680 --> 45:13.080
It makes it even better and another thing is it doesn't require Android

45:13.080 --> 45:15.080
It also works on BlackBerry oh

45:16.320 --> 45:18.720
They're working on iOS version as well what

45:19.400 --> 45:20.480
What?

45:20.480 --> 45:25.480
No, that one's that'll no way no way how can that even work?

45:26.800 --> 45:28.520
iOS

45:28.520 --> 45:30.800
Does iOS support networking? I don't think I was

45:31.520 --> 45:36.040
They probably have absolutely everything yeah, it'll still it'll still give something that

45:36.840 --> 45:39.720
You know at least it doesn't leave them out completely or anything

45:39.720 --> 45:45.520
But there is there is one thing that should be mentioned that as as far as a versioning caveat mm-hmm

45:46.880 --> 45:48.560
You need

45:48.560 --> 45:54.040
0.7 point three or higher to use the cleat keyboard remote keyboard feature

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
That's pretty much it everything else works

45:57.000 --> 46:04.440
With that regardless of the version okay, but so like the 1404 and stuff based on that has

46:04.440 --> 46:09.960
0 7 3 or 0 7 1 so you would need to add a PPA to get the functionality for that

46:09.960 --> 46:11.960
But everything else works great

46:12.280 --> 46:18.040
Yeah, yeah alright, so this is something. I'm gonna play with I think I you know after looking at a while ago

46:18.040 --> 46:21.800
I think I definitely have to check it out again, and you can too mr.

46:21.800 --> 46:24.640
Rotten corpse has a write-up at make use of calm

46:24.640 --> 46:28.080
We'll have a link to that in the show notes where he goes through all of this

46:28.640 --> 46:31.720
Which is very handy, so I have a link to that. Thank you rotten corpse

46:31.720 --> 46:36.040
I am my appetite has been whetted as they say is that what they say I believe so

46:36.040 --> 46:39.360
I think that's that's the right next week. We'll have tried it and we'll be better synchronized

46:40.720 --> 46:42.720
So just wait for that

46:44.800 --> 46:46.800
I think so

46:46.800 --> 46:48.480
Whimpy I know you're still around don't go anywhere

46:48.480 --> 46:53.280
I got a question for you about your connectivity and the key point to that connectivity your router

46:53.280 --> 46:57.920
But before we get to that I want to thank our next sponsor, and that's the great folks over at

46:57.920 --> 47:04.120
Digital ocean check out digital ocean comm a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

47:04.240 --> 47:07.880
For you to spin up your own cloud server. That's what they say I say a

47:08.680 --> 47:13.080
Really fast Linux rig that's how I would say it spin up your own fast Linux rig up in the cloud one that is

47:13.080 --> 47:17.080
Damn, fast is connected to the super fast SSDs a great connection

47:17.080 --> 47:18.800
And it's sitting in a rockin data center

47:18.800 --> 47:23.040
And you can start in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only five dollars a month

47:23.040 --> 47:29.160
Five dollars a month to get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer

47:29.160 --> 47:32.960
But if you use the promo code now get ready for this because it's completely brilliant

47:33.600 --> 47:40.760
Do unplugged do unplug no way one word lowercase you put that thing into the digital ocean thingy there

47:40.760 --> 47:43.640
And it's like some sort of magic. It's like I'm gonna do so much

47:43.640 --> 47:47.520
You know what it's like Donald Trump walks up to you, and he says you know what first of all

47:47.520 --> 47:50.360
I do wine because I want to win and here's ten dollars

47:50.360 --> 47:54.520
It's like Donald Trump gives you ten dollars for digital ocean boom you put it in your digital ocean droplet

47:54.520 --> 47:59.360
You could try it out for two months for free when you do the $5 rig now digital ocean has data center locations in New York

47:59.360 --> 48:01.620
San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London, Germany

48:02.640 --> 48:03.840
a

48:03.840 --> 48:05.680
Brand new one in Toronto

48:05.680 --> 48:09.080
Yeah, when you want to avoid the NSA. That's where you go. I digital ocean didn't write that

48:09.080 --> 48:10.920
I'm just saying if you want to have your day

48:10.920 --> 48:13.960
I'm Chris's man if you want to have your day in the North America region

48:13.960 --> 48:17.560
And you don't want the NSA reading all of it you could go check out through the Toronto data center

48:17.560 --> 48:20.520
Hashtag just saying now also their interface

48:20.640 --> 48:27.240
Let's talk about that holy moly if I can legally get married to an interface that would be the one I tell you what I?

48:27.640 --> 48:33.800
Would go into the courthouse. I would say I'm going to marry digital oceans interface for the rest of my life. I will

48:36.160 --> 48:38.080
Appreciate that and I would then go home

48:38.080 --> 48:39.940
I would consummate that marriage with digital

48:39.940 --> 48:44.080
Interface that part I will not be there for but here's what I'll do West cuz you know

48:44.080 --> 48:50.960
I'm real slick as I'm gonna use their API because they have a straightforward API and let me tell you something if you want to scale

48:50.960 --> 48:53.760
Up the API is the way to go you want to go deploy on-demand

48:53.760 --> 48:57.720
Maybe you want to scale your infrastructure because I got hourly pricing. Did you know they have hourly pricing?

48:57.720 --> 49:01.860
It's true. They got hourly pricing and you plug into something like chef or puppet

49:01.860 --> 49:05.380
Just scale up on-demand or whatever you want. I'm not gonna judge tons of code out there

49:05.380 --> 49:09.560
You can already take advantage of digital ocean takes these platform features seriously

49:09.560 --> 49:13.260
Here's a few ten poles of digital ocean that I like a lot all based on Linux

49:13.260 --> 49:18.860
Yeah, that rocks KVM for the backend virtualization what you've got SSDs throughout tier one data connections

49:19.480 --> 49:22.120
great interface and last but not least

49:23.040 --> 49:29.400
Really good community documentation tutorials that they've paid for they've hired full-time editors to make sure that they rock

49:29.400 --> 49:35.040
I mean really good stuff that makes taking advantage of digital ocean droplet really straightforward

49:35.040 --> 49:38.880
So you get it deployed you use the one-click application to get your basic stack up

49:38.880 --> 49:42.240
Maybe you want to also throw ghosts on top of that or get lab or whatever it is

49:42.240 --> 49:46.480
And then you're like well geez this $5 rig. It's still got a ton of horsepower left

49:46.480 --> 49:48.200
I should use it for something else trust me

49:48.200 --> 49:52.920
This is gonna cross your mind because you're gonna be blown away with how powerful these things are so then you go to the community

49:52.920 --> 49:58.640
Section that's really where they take it up a notch go over to digital ocean comm remember that promo code do unplugged and take a

49:58.640 --> 50:03.380
Look at the community section three ways to securely browse the internet with an open VPN on

50:03.380 --> 50:11.860
Debian 8 now that is a handy handy tutorial for digital ocean imagine turning your do droplet into an open VPN server I

50:12.460 --> 50:18.220
Love that how to mitigate a denial of service attack against your website with cloudflare. Let's go look at like that one

50:18.220 --> 50:19.500
That's got to be fairly interesting

50:19.500 --> 50:25.620
I would imagine because I'm not a huge cloudflare fan, but you know what I've never really had an opportunity to integrate it properly

50:25.620 --> 50:29.460
I love this kind of stuff so many good apps so many good

50:29.460 --> 50:33.820
Documentation so many so much good tutorials all this stuff is available for free

50:33.820 --> 50:37.380
And I'm gonna be honest some of it's not even specific to digital

50:38.300 --> 50:41.100
You could go use that stuff regardless a reference

50:41.100 --> 50:44.580
Yeah, exactly and you know what then when you are ready to use digital ocean

50:44.580 --> 50:49.800
Just use that promo code do unplugged get the $5 credit for two months try it out absolutely free no credit card required

50:49.940 --> 50:54.600
It's insanely great digital ocean comm promo code do unplugged also

50:54.600 --> 50:55.940
You could probably get paid for doing a write-up

50:55.940 --> 51:02.200
They pay anywhere between a hundred to two hundred dollars for technical tutorials potential writers can submit a writing sample to become a tutorial writer

51:02.300 --> 51:08.480
Just find out more by going digital oceans community website digital ocean comm slash community slash get dash paid dash to dash right

51:09.120 --> 51:10.580
they have

51:10.580 --> 51:15.280
Positions available right now you go do that you write a few tutorials a month you could live out of an RV

51:16.580 --> 51:20.260
Digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a real big

51:20.260 --> 51:28.100
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplug guys go check it out is a really cool system if you were gonna build a hosting

51:28.100 --> 51:33.100
System around Linux. This is what you'd make you know and that that KVM part cannot be oversold

51:33.100 --> 51:39.460
I've been fighting with a provider on a less than capable virtualization platform recently that I'd already paid for and yes

51:39.460 --> 51:43.140
I'm quite inspired right yes, and trying to get some IP tables modules loaded

51:43.740 --> 51:47.700
You don't need that on digital ocean you know KVM. You've got full control. That's right. Load them yourself

51:47.700 --> 51:54.300
That's right digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

51:54.300 --> 51:58.700
You guys are rocking it. I love seeing that so I want to talk about

51:59.780 --> 52:04.900
Something that's more than just an open source router. It's an open source center of your home a home router

52:04.900 --> 52:07.140
They say is necessary to connect you to the internet

52:07.340 --> 52:13.100
But that's just sitting there idle most the time when you're not using internet eating electricity and boy have I noticed that recently

52:13.540 --> 52:16.340
So why not use your home router to do more things?

52:16.340 --> 52:19.660
More powerful hardware can handle gigabit traffic

52:20.380 --> 52:24.740
maybe could act as a home NAS a print server, maybe even a

52:26.100 --> 52:32.220
Virtual server now before I get into how crazy this is I wanted to bring in wimpy because I

52:33.620 --> 52:38.180
Know that if I recall wimpy has some sort of eccentric setup

52:38.180 --> 52:40.700
But it involves like antennae wave

52:40.700 --> 52:47.740
Transmissions and all kinds of stuff and wimpy if you could remind me about your setup, and how do you actually bring that into your house?

52:47.980 --> 52:50.700
Like what is the router you're using and all of that stuff?

52:50.700 --> 52:55.220
I'm really curious because I'm looking at different solutions to bring internet connectivity into the rover

52:55.220 --> 53:01.260
And I keep hitting up against once you have like an antenna you have to bring that into something and that seems to be

53:01.380 --> 53:03.380
Where things fall apart?

53:03.380 --> 53:14.260
Okay, well, I'm speaking to you now over the power of shortwave radio broad band. I love it. You sound good wimpy. You do sound good. You always sound good.

53:14.260 --> 53:15.740
Yeah

53:15.740 --> 53:17.620
so yeah

53:17.620 --> 53:19.420
my

53:19.420 --> 53:24.460
Backhaul is about four miles from here over the other side of the trees

53:25.420 --> 53:31.580
So there's um it's a microtech. You know no one has spoken about these in the past

53:31.580 --> 53:38.300
So running up the side of the house. Okay. There's an aerial with a directional microtech

53:39.180 --> 53:43.420
Radio which is the the piece that actually does the connection between?

53:44.180 --> 53:46.540
the house and the backhaul

53:47.460 --> 53:50.300
That's capable of sustaining a hundred megabits

53:50.820 --> 53:56.800
But I'm only paying for 12. Oh, so I have a 12 12 megabit connection 12

53:56.800 --> 54:02.080
12 down 4 up. Do you mind like roughly giving me an idea of what that costs you?

54:02.760 --> 54:09.280
That costs about 45 pounds a month. Okay, that's not bad $60. Yeah, I'm like that seems pretty reasonable

54:09.280 --> 54:13.800
Well, I mean for 12, and that's unmetered us. Okay, that's on me. Okay, I'll take it

54:13.800 --> 54:18.720
And and I know it's unmetered because one month I kind of got carried away with my radar analysis

54:18.720 --> 54:22.960
And I pulled one and a half terabytes across the the network. That's an excellent test

54:22.960 --> 54:28.000
Yeah, they contacted me to say have you got a virus, but they weren't at all bothered

54:29.640 --> 54:31.640
It's not malware

54:33.600 --> 54:39.080
So the the aerial and the radio that's connected via power over ethernet

54:39.080 --> 54:42.580
So the cable comes down the side of the house through a you know, a small hole in the wall

54:43.280 --> 54:46.800
runs along the back of the skirting board behind me here and

54:47.640 --> 54:49.640
into a little

54:49.960 --> 54:51.960
adapter and POE

54:51.960 --> 54:53.240
converter

54:53.240 --> 54:55.160
nice and

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
That's plugged into a UPS

54:57.960 --> 55:00.500
So if the power in the house goes down

55:01.040 --> 55:06.040
The internet doesn't nice and then also plugged into the same UPS

55:06.040 --> 55:13.620
I did used to have a micro tech router doing you know, the home LAN and Wi-Fi, but I've now got a TP link

55:14.440 --> 55:16.580
router okay that I flashed

55:17.640 --> 55:20.300
gargoyle router onto which is a

55:20.300 --> 55:21.980
open

55:21.980 --> 55:23.420
wrt

55:23.420 --> 55:27.420
derivative and in my opinion is the best of the

55:28.020 --> 55:30.520
Open-source router project really and you know

55:30.520 --> 55:34.700
What's interesting is the TP link seem to be very very popular for this particular type of activity

55:35.220 --> 55:36.540
Gargoyle

55:36.540 --> 55:39.820
Gargoyle dash router comms that sound right? That's that's the one

55:39.820 --> 55:43.740
Yeah, and the model that I've got I flashed myself

55:43.740 --> 55:48.540
But they have a number of models that you can actually buy from them pre flashed

55:48.540 --> 55:50.540
So if you're at all

55:50.940 --> 55:57.260
Concerned about being a warranty voider, they will they'll do the hard work for you and send you one pre-configured

55:58.380 --> 56:03.760
Interesting. I have not heard of gargoyle before maybe because this is I've a lot of a lot of people that are looking at the

56:03.760 --> 56:05.760
TP links are still doing

56:06.140 --> 56:07.500
ddr

56:07.500 --> 56:09.340
ddwrt and

56:09.340 --> 56:11.900
Yeah, those but I don't think they're getting updated as much anymore

56:12.780 --> 56:18.020
These are this is really good. This gets an update. Well, whenever there's a security exploit this gets an update

56:18.020 --> 56:22.420
Really? It's under active development. I'm actually a version behind at the moment

56:22.820 --> 56:27.420
There's a new stable release out that I need to update to. Rodden have you heard of this before?

56:27.620 --> 56:34.340
Yeah, I could be wrong, but I think it's a fork of either openwrt or ddwrt. It's openwrt

56:34.340 --> 56:39.340
Yeah, it's openwrt with a really nice UI UI on top

56:39.340 --> 56:39.840
Okay

56:39.840 --> 56:46.220
And the reason I found this is because I wanted to put new routers into my family

56:46.220 --> 56:51.820
My extended family's houses after those big netgear exploits a couple of years ago, right?

56:52.100 --> 56:55.940
So I bought cheap TP link routers for like 20 quid a go

56:56.580 --> 57:02.980
Put gargoyle on the on it and pre-configured them and then sent them all out to everyone's houses. I

57:03.940 --> 57:07.980
Like this because the UI on this is really easy to use. Yeah, it's not

57:09.380 --> 57:11.380
Honestly, this seems like a great

57:11.420 --> 57:16.140
Christmas gift idea for my family to do a few of these for like my mother have a good setup

57:16.140 --> 57:22.380
Yeah, be confident that it'll last it won't degrade and and and and and what I did is, you know

57:22.380 --> 57:27.420
I set up the second wireless LAN. Yeah to be common for everybody

57:27.420 --> 57:33.260
Ah, so when we all move between each other's houses, we could all get on each other's guest LAN. Oh

57:35.020 --> 57:39.740
That's looking ahead that is thinking so when you go over to visit you get on their Wi-Fi

57:40.420 --> 57:45.540
Yeah, and everyone else now because I only have to set their phones up once it doesn't matter where they go

57:45.540 --> 57:50.940
They get on the Wi-Fi and there's an analyst. Oh Martin. Can you just configure, you know eight phones?

57:52.300 --> 57:54.380
Right. Yes, you know, what's funny is

57:55.260 --> 57:59.220
Years and years and years ago. In fact, there's a YouTube video about this. I

57:59.620 --> 58:02.180
bought a bunch of Wi-Fi routers for my family and

58:02.660 --> 58:06.940
Because I wanted to get them all digital picture frames to show the pictures of our newborn son

58:07.180 --> 58:09.380
And I thought here you go Kodak has a good deal

58:09.380 --> 58:14.000
I got I got like four or five digital picture frames, but they all required wireless internet connectivity

58:14.000 --> 58:17.500
Of course, there's a long enough ago now, but six before that was coming six years ago

58:17.500 --> 58:20.100
It just wasn't all that common that they had Wi-Fi

58:20.100 --> 58:26.260
And so I bought them the linksys models that you could replace the firmware on and did that and now they all sit there

58:26.260 --> 58:29.660
And some of my I still come over six years later like Oh Christopher

58:29.660 --> 58:33.620
We just want to thank you for that Wi-Fi router now that we have our new tablets

58:33.620 --> 58:39.700
It is so nice to get online and check the Facebook to see the pictures of the grandchildren relative said charming

58:39.700 --> 58:45.060
Yeah, they are quite charming and and I didn't even think about like I it hasn't even crossed my mind

58:45.060 --> 58:47.520
What I'm gonna do to replace their particular setup, but wimpy

58:47.520 --> 58:53.420
This is this is brilliant and you find the software is powerful enough for you as a as a Linux power user quote-unquote

58:53.980 --> 59:01.340
Yeah, so I originally used this, you know for my family for a low-tech solution. Yeah, actually I found it

59:01.420 --> 59:03.940
So nice. I use it for yourself myself

59:05.340 --> 59:07.340
seal of approval

59:07.340 --> 59:14.100
And so you have your wireless wave whatever it is broadband shortwave whatever magic

59:14.700 --> 59:21.860
Radio broadband coming into this and it just acts like a WAN port. I assume. Yeah, it just looks like an Ethernet one port to this

59:21.860 --> 59:23.860
router and

59:24.020 --> 59:26.020
Yeah, you just configure a PPO

59:26.940 --> 59:29.220
It seems like to me the biggest

59:29.820 --> 59:35.420
Challenge with this is you got to get you got to get in the right groove at the right time when it comes to hardware

59:35.420 --> 59:38.420
So you've landed on these TP TP link routers

59:38.540 --> 59:44.700
which work pretty well and it seemed to be pretty popular amongst people that are equipping their RVs that I've been doing research for

59:44.780 --> 59:46.780
different internet options and

59:46.860 --> 59:50.800
The problem I have with that is that's a pretty solid recommendation for a year

59:51.180 --> 59:56.420
But it's not like from a year from now like somebody that's listening to episode 114 in a year from now

59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.380
We could say go get TP link model blah blah blah blah and maybe you know

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.140
It is do you know what it is off the top of your head the TP link model that you're using?

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.020
Yeah, mine's it's still being sold. It's a TL WR 10 0 4 3 N

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.260
Mine's about I've had mine for about a good while

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:17.500
now over two years don't you find though that the kind of the biggest challenge here is that

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.720
In a year from now that won't necessarily be the right router to recommend to people

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:29.020
Like this is the issue I have with the custom firmware's is that you can say you can you can give a recommendation today

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.980
but it doesn't necessarily mean that

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.600
Like in a six months or even three months from now. It's the right one

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:43.140
Well when when I did this there was two models that I used the model that I've got and a smaller model both of which

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:48.440
Are still available are still either 20 or 30 pounds depending on which model you get

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.700
The the revision of the board has changed. It's like a v1 v2 v3

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.740
But they're all supported by this and they've got

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:03.820
When you download the firmware, you know from this website, it says, you know, this is for the fee one boards

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.380
This is for the v2. Okay, and so on. Okay, so they're sitting on top of the model

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.680
The model I'm using is the model that the company still sells pre-flashed

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.220
also, the

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.380
TP link is not just replacing

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.980
like functionality stuff there they're creating new versions of the same model so like

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:26.600
Yeah compatibility still exists like my the router I have I

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.440
Bought I went to buy another one of that, but they made a new version of it

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.120
So it's still compatible with gargoyle. That's cool

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.880
You can you can even though they're making new versions of their hardware. It's pretty pretty much still compatible

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:47.200
Anyway, so let me introduce to you the tourist omnia, which is trying to solve this particular problem

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.280
They say it's more than just a router. It's an open source center of your home

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.640
I don't know if that's necessarily true or not, but it's open or something you want, right?

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.280
It's open heart feature open hardware running

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:06.000
In OS based on open wrt. It has a dual core arm processor running at 1.6. Gigahertz

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.040
they say with PC like performance in here and

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.360
It has so here's one point six one point six gigahertz dual core arm CPU

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.840
Honestly, that does sound fast enough to be a router up to a gigabyte of RAM four gigabytes of flash

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.240
five

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.340
gigabit ports for the LAN

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.180
One gigabit port for the WAN it supports USB 3.0

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:33.700
It has two mini PCI Express one M SATA connector. It has three

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:40.140
MIMO 8 or 211 AC ports and two 8 or 211 BGN ports

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.660
starting at a hundred USD for this thing and

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.540
I'm looking I'm showing them live on the video version here a

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:54.700
little schematics of it has it has M SATA like I mentioned mini PCI USB 3 and processor a Marvell processor and

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500
and a

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.660
Sim card slot for backup internet connectivity how cool is this little thing of this?

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.560
I don't I don't know if this is actually practical or not

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.640
But and I don't think of this could replace the TP links today wimpy

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.260
But I look at this and I think maybe a year from now something like this might be

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:19.260
The direction we're pointing people for something like gargoyle then a TP link. What do you think?

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.880
Do you think something like this ARM based could be the solution?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.540
What is your hardware right now? And when you look at this does it sound like reasonable a reasonable option?

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.680
Okay, so the box that I've got now the the router I was just describing

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:31.980
Yeah

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:38.180
And it's a few years old that's got five gigabit ethernet ports one one for the WAN and four for the LAN

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.900
And I just take one of those

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.580
Gigabit LAN ports into a switch and then yeah

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.980
Gigabit that makes switch. Yeah, that makes sense

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:55.700
So then you know you minimize how much of your local traffic is actually, you know routing up. Yes to the to the router

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.700
I would probably do it that way too. And

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.580
Then I've got two HP micro servers

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:07.320
As my you know media servers for the house one one is the server and one is the backup

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.920
And I have it. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful. Gotta have that high

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:23.480
Can I do a last cribs episode I'm coming yeah, yeah by all means I'll have to clear out the spare room, but you're welcome

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.520
and I have experimented with so

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.120
Went way back before I had shortwave radio broadband

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:37.480
I used to use 3g to get on the internet and that was with a router with you know

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.200
It had a WAN port and a USB port where you could plug in your 3g dongle

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.560
So I've done that, you know high availability thing

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.360
briefly

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.280
But I've always been nervous about using these

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.560
More powerful home routers that you can plug USB do a whole bunch of things

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:03.480
Yeah, because what because they're they're not very robust bits of kit and if they fail then you've lost everything

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:09.520
You haven't just lost internet connectivity. You've lost your LAN as well. So I sort of adopt the same

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.240
approach

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.720
to

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.240
to my kit

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.800
That I do with the home cinema, you know one device one job that makes sense

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.000
and and it's definitely been my approach for a really really long time because it just means that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.440
you know troubleshooting is much easier updates are much straightforward a lot less to break, but I

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.200
Have to admit I have a new perspective now and that new perspective is

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.160
how many how much power does something draw and and

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:46.120
how much room does something take and the two things that are real premium for me right now our power draw and

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.500
The room that it takes up in and I'm talking like, you know

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.160
I'm trying to fit stuff like under a chair like it is really like under a bench seat. It is

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.160
really tight

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:02.080
So the the routers obviously don't take up much because they're arm powered and that they don't they don't

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.420
Take up much space and they don't draw much power. Yeah, true, but I would still separate things, you know on my father-in-law's barge

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.160
Had a wireless router with 3g and the file server there was a Raspberry Pi

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.480
This is back a couple of years now. Of course, I'd recommend using a Raspberry Pi 2

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:27.200
Doesn't draw much power. And in fact if you get one of those routers with the USB port on it

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:36.240
Check the specs carefully, but there are some you can actually power a Raspberry Pi off the USB port. Yeah, the router

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.400
Yeah, and then instead of you know, instead of going for

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.140
huge amounts of spinning storage on the Raspberry Pi

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:50.320
go for a bit less storage use an SSD connected to the USB port and

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.880
Then you don't need additional power to drive the SSD attached to the Raspberry Pi

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:02.600
Yeah, I agree. I even even in with limited space and limited power

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:09.200
I still think it's probably better to break them up and Wes got this. I can't remember the brand name of it now Wes

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200
but you got me this

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.720
Router that it like it allows for different types of 3g connections. Yeah, how did that work?

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.560
Did you use it? No, I haven't yet because I'm waiting to connect it to a machine

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.500
But now actually probably over the next week or so

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.400
I probably will hook it up because I'm kind of now that I'm back in part with the rover

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.240
I'm kind of like working on like the technology land stuff because some of that stuff was like just too much to deal with

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.040
before the road drive and yeah, well it was like the my fives

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:42.160
Kind of act as routers and Wi-Fi access points. So for the for out for two weeks

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.160
They say solved a problem and I could make it work

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.400
But the biggest challenge was I was a minimum

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.600
It was either two different my fives or a cell phone that I was jumping between

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:00.800
Yep, and every time on every device I'd have to go to each device and say okay now join this Wi-Fi Network that gets super

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.640
Old that router you got me totally solves that problem

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:09.360
so I think I'm gonna try that for a while and see how that shapes out and I'm gonna keep an eye on

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.680
this project and just kind of see if the

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.860
if did I think it's pronounced tourist you are our

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.160
is

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:23.120
Omnia if this results in something of substance, you know, it's kind of try this. It's kind of interesting

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.840
I was looking down at the bottom about us and they aren't responsible for some more enterprise-grade software. Yes

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.240
That's what gives me some hope. Yeah, go ahead

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.480
Yeah, like if you look here, they're talking about bird which is the an internet routing Damon open source that supports BSD's Linux

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.880
Yeah, you know, they do BGP OSPF. So it makes me think that this organization at least knows a little bit

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.640
It has experience about routing. Yes, exactly. That's it. That is a good point because that's what gave me hope

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.260
It made me okay

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.000
These have they have some credentials here

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.080
But I I'm trying to remember I don't know if you remember the name of it because I'm just I'm drawing a blank right now

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.320
But it is it was recommended by someone in the it was yeah

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.360
it is a unit that is essentially trying to accomplish this and then I

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.520
Agree with Wimpy's approach is whenever it's possible make

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.720
Make your your your edge of land device as

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.680
Single purpose as possible very much, right?

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:22.120
Because then it's if for security updates and reliability and troubleshooting and and really honestly from your own mistakes

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:27.800
It is much more isolated. And so the way I work is the further out to the edge of the land

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:33.960
I get the less and less stuff. I try to have that machine do and and a big a big

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.780
Big trend I have noticed from the tech snap audience is a lot of them want to virtualize their firewalls

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:50.660
Yeah, that is very more and more common. Yeah, it is like, you know, can I run my firewall my pf sense firewall as a VM?

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.140
You know, I'll give it a dedicated. I'll give it a dedicated Nick or whatever

01:09:54.140 --> 01:10:01.220
They say or the vertio driver and it just so goes. Yeah. Yeah, it just so goes against my like minimal like no

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.340
This is a router. That's all it's supposed to it kind of sounds like what wouldn't be saying too

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:10.820
It's like I don't like having it be a file server running Samba running SSH running all this different stuff

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.820
I don't want that and so

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:18.380
I'm gonna try scaling it back a bit, but I am definitely kind of relooking at some of the stuff now

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.700
I'm going oh, but I could save a lot of watts and a lot of space if I had one device doing it all

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.260
I also wouldn't mind just having a really beefy router like that's fine. Even if it's just as little

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:35.720
So I'm not quite sure where I'm gonna fall down on yet, but this is pretty neat and it's available for pre-order right now

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.980
I I you know, I'm you know what I'm gonna do

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:44.000
I'm gonna go and put myself down as a as a pos as a possibility and the pre-order right now

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.020
I'm just signing up for it. I'm joining you. Yeah

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.620
Yeah, cuz I'm curious to see where they go with this and I like that they're yeah. Yeah, there we go

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:54.500
So they I just I just went in and I just had I added myself to the pre-order list

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.480
I'm gonna give the Omni a try but my philosophy is more in line with yours and wimpy's

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.760
I think it's a I think it's a little safer to say this router is dedicated to do this thing

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.380
But we'll see wimpy any any other thoughts before we wrap up

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:15.300
Yeah, open media vaults available for the Raspberry Pi 2 now, so you really know

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.300
Oh

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.300
Yeah, the Raspberry Pi 2 and open media vault could be perfect

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:27.860
That could be perfect. Can I run MB on it? Cuz that's you know, I'm using MB in the rover

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.940
I want to do a little MB follow-up if I could actually because people been asking me about this

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.300
I bet that hasn't been I bet that hasn't been ported to the Raspberry Pi, but who knows?

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:42.140
I mean, I'm really enjoying MB. I've been using Plex still at the house in the studio, but in the rover

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.660
I am using MB. Well, look at me. I got three different places. I'm trying stuff and MB is really great

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:54.500
Are you are you using the Android client at all? No, no, I'm only using only using the web client at the moment

01:11:54.500 --> 01:12:00.300
Why what have you run into issues with the Android version? Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit stuttery and you know

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:06.180
I've noticed some of the similar the most recent version that I don't remember when I last updated

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.220
It seemed to be doing a lot better

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:13.020
But I have noticed a little occasional slow really once it gets up and running when you're streaming from your house on your Android

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.940
Device for me. It's more than like that the interface the actual stream has been fine

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.500
but kind of just like the startup and and those

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:24.060
Transitions have been a little slow you guys are not encouraging me to keep on with my MB exploration

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.500
But I mean I've been using it as well and the rest of it has been I've been can I mean I can you know

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:34.420
You can put a fully tight. I I mean that my use for MB is I want to build a small

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:40.300
Network in the rover and I want some I want a component of that network to be media on-demand

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:46.820
I'm not married to MB though. I will say I've been experimenting with the open and external player. Yeah. Yeah

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:52.060
Yeah, and I've got it configured right now. It seems to only want to detect VLC, but with a little XDG

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.220
You know like configuring your default apps. Yeah, I've got it one click opening in MPV

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.900
Are you telling me in the web browser?

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:04.300
You just click it it opens MPV and it that if you ever had a little like a little slowness when you're changing places

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.020
When you're using an MPV, of course, all of these amazing

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.580
Yeah, and it seems to be streaming the original quality just just beautiful doesn't market as read or as watched in MB

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.580
Yes that part. I haven't updated

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.540
Very recently. I think it's been a week or so. So they may have fixed it

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:22.900
There was like a recent little bug in that man, but the actual playback is flawless and they have a UI there

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:28.620
It just isn't quite fixed to have to have I'm gonna talk about that after air how well tell me right now

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.400
How do you make MB use MPV as your default player? What do you do?

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.240
Well, it has it has a I don't know if it's a plug-in or an option somewhere to enable external players

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.440
So you do lose like it doesn't track your progress, but you can enter it

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.680
You can't resume right so you lose your resume

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.760
But if you're if you're just watching an hour-long and I can remember if I remember a jump in a half hour

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.840
Right and then we be makes only gives that up to use MPV, right?

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.600
Or you can use Cody and not give up anything

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.600
Excellent point I

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.240
Would open a leg will work on the pies. Yes

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.800
I'm trying to keep it simple

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.240
I've got an MB server and I just want to go to the web page in the rover and watch stuff

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.800
That's all I want. I don't want to have to do too much more than that. But the MPV thing that is

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.040
You can send it to

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:19.680
Cody as well because Cody has an API that I'm actually working on a script to send stuff to Cody

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.200
Oh, and it will play through Cody and it will really to the server really won't be sending signals

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.880
It'll actually just send the it'll say here's what I want to play and then Cody will connect to it directly and you will

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:38.820
Keep all your sinking and everything. That's awesome. Oh, I think I think you guys are selling me on the rover setup

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:44.000
I mean the rover set up so early now that if I could have Cody look at MB and have all get it. Oh

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:52.000
Anyways, if you guys are not familiar with MB, we did an episode of Linux action show about MB vs. Plex. These are

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.760
Really really amazing home theater management solutions. They'll go out. They'll scan your directory. They'll go get all the metadata

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.680
They'll build a nice directory. They'll give you watch status pull an additional context. It's really cool

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.720
You can find it

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.800
MB dot media an open source solution to Plex and we dedicated an episode of the Linux action show to this particular topic

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:18.680
Because in the rover I wanted something that could completely work offline and not the Plex doesn't Plex works great offline

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.120
but Plex also assumes you have an internet connection all the time and

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.480
So MB allowed me to have a little bit of flexibility there and say, you know

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:33.040
I'm gonna be offline the majority of the time and when I am connected go fetch the metadata and those kinds of things MB

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.960
Allows me to have some flexibility there in the rover specifically that are really nice

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.000
I will say at least according to a forum post

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.520
It does look like there's an open media vault plug-in available the last the last post on the thread here was from July 2015

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.560
So hopefully it's updated in real. Oh my gosh. Love to try that. It's more about the architecture support, isn't it?

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.440
Yeah, right MB supported by open media vault. Yeah, so if you took an

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.780
You took not a NUC with open media vault and MB

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.640
Yeah, this is starting to look pretty nice. Yeah connected over what I scuzzy or an NFS maybe to a storage array. Oh

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.960
I have a few episodes in mind when I think of that. That's really cool

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.400
So anyways, if you want to check out this router

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:17.200
It is the tourist omnia and I signed up for a pre-order. I'll be I'm going to give it a I'm going to give it a go

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:23.480
I'm willing to give it a go. I like that. They have a built-in LAN switch. That's nice. I might not fiber right in there

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.320
That's interesting. Yes. Oh, yes, by the way. Yeah, that was that's that one right that little connector right there

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.120
Which is just at the bottom of the screen is a little a G bit connector, which is okay

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.560
All right. I'm not saying I'm would I would use this as my main switch, but it's definitely tempting and it might be tempting for you

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.200
To so go check it out and we'll have a link in the show notes

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.560
And if I do manage to get the pre-order, I'll let you know how it goes

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.560
So before we move on I want to thank our friends over at Linux Academy

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560
There's something really cool going on at Linux Academy

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.600
And I want to tell you about it

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.680
But first if you're new to Linux Academy

01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:02.560
I want to sort of set up the framework what I really like about Linux Academy is I see a lot of common ground between them

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.880
And Jupiter broadcasting they care a hell of a lot about content

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.880
They care a hell of a lot about Linux and open source and they really want to deliver that to the people and so my approach

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:17.380
Was let's go make podcasts about it. Their approach was let's go make educational content about it

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.340
so they paired up with developers and content creators and

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.560
Educators to make sure this could happen Linux enthusiasts the sat around and said we want to bring this to more people and that is

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.840
Really truly unique about Linux Academy Linux and open source. It's not a checkbox

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.920
They don't have a whole range of tutorials from fixing your sync and after effects tutorials

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.120
What they have is stuff that is hyper focused on Linux and all of the technology stack around there

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:47.200
I invite you to go check them out by going to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and get our really really great discount

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.360
In fact, I will have I am now I am now very pleased to say our very exclusive

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.280
Discount is the only way to get this pricing structure. It is exclusive to Linux unplugged show Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.360
Go check that out go tour their features. They have almost 1,900 videos for the self-paced courses

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.540
Downloadable comprehensive study guides and instructor help is available to you when you need it

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.780
that is a really big deal and a huge differentiator between the other online learning courses and

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.320
On October 15th. Oh my gosh, that's really soon

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.200
Actually, they have some major major major features. They are rolling out really big things are coming on October 15th

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.460
They say and this is their words not mine

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:34.440
They're working on their biggest new tool for the last four months and they're gonna be releasing it on October 15th

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.000
It's the result of a dream. They had this time a year ago. It's going to change

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.320
Self-paced and hands-on training as we know it

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.600
Also, they just updated their CDN

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:53.680
So the content is even faster than before and the players have a new version of their HTML 5 player with speed controls

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.520
So you can speed up or slow down the videos, which is really cool

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.080
And there has been actually some studies as a podcaster. I looked into this when you listen to podcasts at double speed

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.160
You actually retain the data more Wow

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.480
Didn't know that but the brain because it's working a little bit harder to listen at a faster pace

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:19.540
Retains the information faster. How cool is that for your training and now their new HTML 5 player supports that that's really great

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:24.500
But something else has just come out at Linux Academy that I think you need to know about. This is a huge deal

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.860
practice exams

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.020
Practice exams are the secret weapon to actually beating the test. I

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.340
For whatever reason get a little weird about taking tests

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.140
I don't know. I don't know what it is, but I just get a little weird about taking tests

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.620
It's just like I'm being put on the spot next week on linux and plugged we give we

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:51.580
We've got a quiz or two. It'll be great fun. Submit your questions online guys. Actually, that would be really cool. That'd be really good

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:56.340
We should do that as an episode if anybody has suggestions out there for an online Linux quiz that we could take

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.020
We should do it. We should do it. You can hear me

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:04.740
I'll get totally worked up like I'm not kidding you guys I freak out over our rock-paper-scissors session

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:10.020
Okay, so I'm not kidding. So the idea of taking a test it really overwhelms me

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:16.420
And so that's Linux Academy recognizes that and they have a solution. So in the past and and and still available today

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.860
In fact better than ever you have regular mode exams

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:23.740
This is where Linux Academy loads in a preset of number of questions in a preset amount of time

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.660
You go through the exam, you know

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.220
Like for example, you could take the AWS CSA associates in regular mode

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:34.140
It'll load 60 questions in 80 minutes and you complete the exam like a real exam

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:39.180
That's cool and gives you a very very real-world like experience

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:44.860
However, if that to you would stress you out like it would me check out practice mode

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:50.900
Now you can select your time limit and the number of questions up to a maximum amount of potential questions from the pool and then

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.900
Just take the practice exam

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:59.940
This helps you prepare in a different way than you would normally for the exam and it puts flexibility in the practice exam system

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.460
Based on your current needs. So here's a summary of what you get

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.740
You get to display the total number of questions in exam questions

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.740
All practice exams are now timed if time runs out it automatically submits the questions

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:14.700
you're currently going for and grades them practice mode allows you to define the number of questions and time limits for an exam sessions and

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.700
the question order is randomized and

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.540
Answers associated with the question are also randomized and each new practice exam is started

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.660
This is such a cool way for you to be able to go in and find out the questions that are on the test

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.300
Try them learn them do your studying see how you did

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:35.260
So that way when you sit down to actually get your certification, it is a slam dunk this right here

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:39.340
I'm telling you is worth the price alone of admission to Linux Academy go to linuxacademy.com

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:45.580
Unplugged to get our discount and try that out a lot of new features. Check out their big presentation, October 15th

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.500
So much is coming

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:53.140
I love to see this company continue to grow because you know why they're promoting Linux at the same time Linux Academy comm slash

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.780
Unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:02.660
All right, so guys as we wrap up today on the unplugged show

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:07.180
It was actually I think it was West's fault. I think this is totally your fault

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.220
Again way to go West jerk

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.700
So you think you made an offhand comment about why don't we just end curses everything?

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:23.420
Everything should be an end curses UI. Well, you know what King Looper was paying attention when you said that

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:26.900
He said an episode going in depth on cursors to available links would be a great idea

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.620
There are so many anchors of programs out there

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:35.440
I think an episode on it really could be interesting not only anchors of programs for everything in true Linux fashion

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.700
There are at least four of them with programs from CMUS to H top

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:45.820
There is a lot of content to cover this episode could show off a lot of new useful tools to viewers to exact for example

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.180
CMUS makes great media player, especially when paired with drop-down

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.660
terminal

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:56.300
Now this happens to coincide perfectly with the end of tech talk today

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:01.060
It was suggested that we have a mumble app picks segment in the Linux unplugged show

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:05.740
So I wanted to turn it over to the mumble room now Wes and I have a couple to go to's

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:09.580
But I wanted to turn it over to the mumble room if anyone in there has any suggestions

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:14.780
For really really great and curses based applications now for those of you not familiar

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.860
I don't know how this is possible

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:24.200
But think of end curses as the best interface ever created that never needs to be replaced and never should be superseded and curses

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:29.660
applications are console applications that essentially have a UI I

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:35.740
You know I'd look at this Wes and curses actually even has an entry on Wikipedia. Here's a great example of

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:41.220
Configuring the Linux kernel I believe the BSD installer is end curses based

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:47.180
I believe a lot of things are in curses based Alan is am I right is is anchors is still a thing on BSD as well? Yeah

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.900
So well, uh, the tool is called dialog and then it uses anchors is to draw the stuff

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:56.980
So yeah now do you Alan I while I have you do you have any anchors is apps that you've used from time to time?

01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:03.860
Or the biggest one is dialog, which is a way to write to use anchors interfaces from a shell script

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.020
Yeah, so the entire installer is written in shell script

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:13.460
But it just asks you the questions and present you the menus by calling the dialog command which draws an anchors is menu for you

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:18.500
There's a good one and and it is universally like, you know

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:23.020
When it is universally like if you have a terminal you've probably at some point in time

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:28.540
Seeing an anchors application and Steve jerbs in the chat room

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:34.420
Steve jerbs has a has a recommendation called a T IG and

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:41.660
He says in the chat room is one of my favorite dev tools. It's a text mode interface for get how cool is that Wes?

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.940
How about that? Oh, I'm excited already. Yeah, that is really neat

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:51.020
So if anybody the mumble room wants to chime in with their favorite anchors application, the floor is open to you

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.060
I'm saving mine to see if anybody else guesses them

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:59.220
Torrent is also quite nice, which is when you're trying to do stuff service our tour. Yeah, that's a great one

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:04.420
If you're trying to see it from a server, it's just be able to pop it up over SSH. Yeah

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:11.540
Yeah, our torrent is killer our torrent and I think like version 9 0.9 is the current version or something like that

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.140
I'll put a link to our torrent our torrent is great

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.940
In fact our torrent just a little tip is a great resource to put on your digital ocean drop

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:22.100
You pop that in the BSD license team us and away you go

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:29.660
Our turn I'm gonna put a link there because honestly our turns one of the more common things that I hear people are using on

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:35.100
Their digital ocean droplets we chat we chat is has a and curses based interface. Is that real?

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.740
Elman elman coming in from the chat room. How about that?

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460
Your see

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:50.940
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Look at this. Look at elman

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:57.180
Oh, I'm installing elman this might grab this might become a last pick. Look at these guys. Oh, that's me. Hi. Hi

01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.420
Here it is. Here's the shot

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.980
Look at that

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:02.060
Wow

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:07.920
That is really really nice and wimpy you got to mention my favorite. Come on wimpy. Give me a plug for nano. Let's hear it

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:14.180
Yeah, I love nano. Yeah, and a great example of it anchors is based a full application

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:21.980
Yeah, I like that one a lot. All right, any other guy any other? Yeah, there's a the new architect installer

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:28.180
Architect Linux is in curses installer for arch architect Linux our

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.060
Linux, all right. I'm putting a link to that

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:36.060
If you've ever heard of evolution Linux, it's it's a yes successor to evolution evolution is gone

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.180
But it was been it was it was turned into architect

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:45.060
The live installer for Linux brought to you by Karl Duff and yeah, there it is that gorgeous

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.700
Ode to ode to end curses. You know what? I don't know what it is, but I

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.420
Love it. I love the little outline. I love the lines. I love the ok button

01:26:55.420 --> 01:27:01.500
I love the title at the top with the line underneath it. It's so clear. It's so it's so

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:08.060
Obvious, it's like a nice latex formatted scientific. Yes that same kind of let you know where everything's gonna be

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:15.100
Yes, just right where you expect. Yes, and my keyboard hotkeys work. I mean it is I don't mean to sound like an old man

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:26.980
But I think it is truly one of the best interfaces ever rain before my eyes here guys. I think if you if you're interested in using in curses and you also want good UI like design look

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:35.240
Yes, not now not now no no no no it's been for a very long time which is awesome

01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:42.100
Right. I'm saying now as in everything that their installer is. Yes. So it's all in curses. Everything they do is now

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:48.940
Yes, every everything that they have so much now into yes, and now yes is completely in curses

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.700
No, it's a good-looking in curses as in design and everything

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.300
So it doesn't even necessarily look like in curses, but it's reliable just like it was. Yeah

01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:57.660
Yeah

01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:03.940
And I I love that about openSUSE of because when you're installing a machine a server remotely

01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.020
That particular feature is extremely extremely valuable

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:14.500
It's very very nice to have that because also one of the things that the openSUSE installer has supported for a very long time is

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.620
You can spin up a VNC server over the network and install the system headless using VNC

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.500
Which is extremely cool and of course, I got to give a plug Corky beta is pointed out in the chat room

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:33.100
You got to love midnight commander one of the old-school and curses based file managers for the command like a classic

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:37.540
Midnight commander is very awesome a network manager

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.620
There's a hold on hold on network manager has a has a and curses interface

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:47.680
No way is that a thing I'd be really interested. I used to use wick d or wicked

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.620
Yes, but I guess that's not maintained anymore. No, I would love another curses based Wi-Fi manager

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.020
Yeah, look at this on December 2013. I'm apparently this is old-school news

01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.460
Network manager gets a new text interface while network manager already has a great integration with Nome and KD desktops

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.300
There's now a command line interface

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:08.040
It's an open source network management program has the end curses based interface. Look at that

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.980
So we eat that is very cool and then colonel panic. Is that how you say that one West?

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.740
What do you think colonel colonel panic, but a little bit? It's not spelled with a K. It's colonel

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.380
See with that see I'm saying they see oh and yes, but that's a military

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:27.260
Colonel, okay. All right. All right fine. He goes with it. He's got I think a python debugger here

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.280
Which is an end curses interface? Oh interesting. Look at that

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:34.560
I'm really surprised that nobody has said our two end curses picks yet

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.880
You and I have two really good ones, and I'm surprised

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:44.240
This is colonel panic. Oh my god Chris, but colonel's panic is spelled with a K. I know he's already taken that one

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.280
All right

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.520
Are you anybody else in the mumber and want to throw out their favorite end curses app before?

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.280
Noah and Arab Noah before Wes and I give away the

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:58.640
The best I think we have some really good ones. I think so. All right, nobody's chiming in Wes

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640
You mentioned this one last week

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.600
ncdu

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.560
Love ncdu a super fast utility you go into a directory

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.240
You can say like ncdu and you can give it a directory you can give it the root and it goes through and scans your disk

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.540
Usage in real time. It is so so nice. In fact, I should probably just install it right now. It's so nice

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:22.180
I'm gonna install it right now now. I like as well that you can have it export so like we at work

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.480
We've got some scripts that all that'll run that as well

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:28.680
So when it has a disk, you know, a host has disk space that's above above what we've said is warning

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.920
It'll have saved already on the back end really you can just pop that up. You don't have to rescan it

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.160
You can just explore visually

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.720
I went to go show it I went to go show ncdu on the live stream and it worked so fast that I couldn't actually

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:47.440
Show you it processing my directories. It's way faster than any graphical tool is way faster and here you can say you can see

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440
I'm I'm wasting a ridiculous

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.240
fifty one point seven gigabytes on this bonobo to the Dropbox

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:58.640
That is and you know what's crazy about that. That is a fraction of what is actually in the Dropbox

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:05.560
Let's see here. Does it what is this Dropbox tell you how much space you're using now? Yeah, I'm using that. Oh my god

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:09.480
Oh my god. Do you have a guess how much space I'm using in Dropbox?

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.700
Just take just a rough guess just one guess I'll just take one guess

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.040
Because here you go. Here you go with 51 gigs are just on this bonobo just on the bonobo on this bonobo alone

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:26.080
So you can assume this is probably just the files. I need just us them just for the show production. I'm gonna guess

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.360
700 gigabytes. Oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good two terabytes. Oh

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.000
Terabytes up in that Dropbox so any enterprise

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:43.160
It's ridiculous. So ncdu is a really really really nice tool that West mentioned last week

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:48.760
That is a very nice straightforward way to go through and so you can see like so say I wasn't gonna go

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:54.280
Delete stuff out of my Dropbox folder, but I wanted to go look at some my other big offenders here downloads

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:59.840
I go into there you can see look and look at all look at five gigs going to gunsmoke old-time radio right worth it

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.520
Don't get rid. I know I'm not

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.420
1.3 gigabytes is going to X minus one another old-time radio show and then another

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.360
337 is going to Superman

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.100
But I can easily see where a lot of my storage space is going to in my downloads folder

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:15.980
Which is really really nice and the other really nice thing about this is it works great through an SSH connection

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:19.920
So when you're remote it into that system, you know a hegemon eight in the IRC

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.100
He's got a great point also mixer something we take for granted. That's that's curses. What is it?

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:31.320
Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, and there's also there's a pulse audio controller. That's also in curses based, which is really cool and thin

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.800
There's another app that I I love two things now telegram is an end curses base

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.440
But there is a telegram command-line client, which is really cool for drop-down menu. I haven't tried. Yeah. Yeah

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.200
Talks to X now you're familiar with talks. It's kind of like a Skype killer open source

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:53.000
Yeah in the shadow of Edward Snowden that kind of came out right and it grows it blossoms in the shadow of Edward Snowden and

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
There is toxic

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:58.200
toxic is a tox based instant messaging client and

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:03.040
You guessed it has an end curses interface so you can use talks

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:09.760
In the command-line like say association to a droplet or something like that using end curses. This is my pick

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.760
This is I think a really I'm like

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.640
Super remiss for not mentioning pipe cut. Oh, yeah. Oh

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:24.440
So pipe cut is this tool to allow you to like when you're when you're dealing with data on Unix, right?

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.920
You do like some file cat file pipe grep for something and then sort and then unique minus C

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.320
And then sort numerically by the results of that to get and then pipe tail or something like that

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:41.480
Right to get the lab the top ten most popular IP addresses in your web server log or something

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:48.440
this allows you to build those interactively and surf back and forth through your pipe and like when you're

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:52.240
Applying a grep filter it will highlight on the screen

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.320
What things you're going to match and what things aren't as you're writing the regular so really stands out

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.880
That is so nice. Yeah, I'm looking at their site website right now pipe cut at pipe cut dot org

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:10.440
This is really a presentation. We interviewed the author and did a presentation about it at meet PSD. It is really cool

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.400
Yeah, it is. Holy crap. I'm saving this one to go grab after the show

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:19.440
It seems like a great tool to help. I mean one professionals the two people trying to learn. Yeah pipes

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:26.680
Yes, it's like the best teaching tool ever. Yeah. Well, it really illustrates what you're doing, which is really cool

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:32.240
All right. So how about this one this one coming in from Corky our TV our TV?

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.460
No, it's not something for your trailer. It's an end curses

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.360
reddit client a

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:44.440
reddit terminal viewer right there our TV is an application allows you to view and interact with reddit from your terminal. Oh

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.600
I love it. That is so cool. That makes reddit so much better

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.100
That makes it so you know getting something like reddit out of the web is I don't know

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.260
It's pretty cool. Our TV is built on Python using as you guessed it the curses library

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:02.300
Really really neat. That's a good one

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.340
IP traf is another great one. I agree

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.940
LFTP something if top yes H top was which was mentioned earlier in the show

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.220
I'm gonna put a links to as many of these as that were mentioning as possible in the show notes

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:19.700
So that way you get you guys can check this out. I here's what I love about it. What's that?

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:27.820
A callback to earlier in the show up in WRT has in curses. Mm-hmm. Nice. That is really here's what I here's what?

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:33.100
Here's the point. I want to make I don't think end curses interfaces are out of date or old-school at all

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:37.820
I think there's still a very practical application for a text-based GUI. Yep, and

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:42.740
With VPS is and and cloud computing and becoming more and more common

01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:47.220
I think they have a better place than ever like I think these are really really good stuff

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.900
So Linux actually showed our reddit.com, please

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:55.300
Please tell me about your favorite end curses based application for episode 114 find the feedback thread

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.580
I would really like to hear about them. I want to try them out

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.920
I'm all in like I'm like screw gooey's right now and just speaking of gooey's though

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:09.220
If you write your shell script thing in dialogue, you can substitute dialogue for X dialog

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:16.500
Get the gooey version too. Very nice. Very nice. What we gonna say with I just say it's nice that you know

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.900
It's just like a terminal away. Yeah, you already have your terminal open. Yeah, someone listening to this show. Yeah

01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:27.860
You don't have to learn a new GUI you're already familiar with that right as applications work and

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:32.620
Corky beta says if you give it a good color scheme and curses can be the most modern UI ever

01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:40.940
I was just gonna make that joke. All right rotten corpse. You want to take us out with our last end curses pick here

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:47.700
Yeah, see us music player. Yes. Yes. See us music player at I I'm familiar

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.420
They have there's an arch wiki entry on it

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.940
but I think they're just on a CMUS CMUS that github.io and

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.700
It's a small fast powerful concert music player for Unix like operating systems

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:03.100
So even you Mac users can get a little something out of that one CMUS. That's a good one rotten

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.020

All

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:22.900
Right that show moved on do you feel like that show moved yeah, whoo yeah, all right all right very good very good

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:28.260
All right, so we go to JB titles. We pick our title, and then we all feel like we accomplished something doesn't that feel good

01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.260
Yes, it does

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:35.540
Good stuff and curses apps are fun for me for some reason. I'm an old man. It's just fun

01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.320
Yeah, I like this title suggesting Katie connect all the things I

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:44.940
Look at Microsoft and all of their company resources all of their employees all of their money

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:48.140
And then they ship a product that looks like this

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:53.020
Right and makes noises like that. I don't want to make it noises like that. I don't even know why it made that noise

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:57.100
It didn't tell me anything. Why did it make that noise? Why does it do these things?

01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:02.460
Why is there so much contrast in the in the Explorer Windows? Why are the fonts so small is with this menu?

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:08.140
It's like transparent, so you can't you can't even read it. You can't even read it and the thing is nobody talks about this

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.820
Nobody talks about it. It's fine now

01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:17.620
You know Katie he's got a funky font or gnomes got a corn that's not perfectly rounded or the Mac does something

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:24.300
That's not perfect, and it's all it's all we talked about a freaking. It's a huge deal Windows is a complete and total

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:31.260
presentation crap show with three different types of interfaces built into it three different uis built into it and

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:35.280
Nobody gives it a hard time everybody gives it a pass even we do this is

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:42.420
Disgusting look at that. You can't even read that it's gross and and yet not nobody says anything. I can explain that completely

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.740
Let's hear it

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:49.420
Standards I agree standards that are not using Windows and everybody knows Windows is complete. I agree

01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:55.220
I think I think we collectively just been like oh well Windows is the challenge kid in the classroom

01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:00.260
And so we don't expect as much from Windows. Oh look Windows. How's that? It has the start menu that slides up real nice?

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:02.340
Oh look what a good job Windows is done

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.640
Windows has done such a great job. Yeah, exactly yeah, the Windows gets its trophy. They had a release

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.620
They couldn't even get their numbering right they couldn't even count correctly I

01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.100
Just think yeah, I can't stand it as an operating system

01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:21.700
It is so awful it is so awful and then so the thing the line

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:26.020
I have to walk is and how do you not judge people who want to use Windows people who choose to use Windows?

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.900
How do you know because they have their own valid reasons?

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.620
And they probably spend a lot of time making Windows suck a lot less

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:36.140
They probably don't even realize how much energy they put into making Windows suck less over like they set up a Windows box

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:47.500
And they probably spend three months getting it not sucking a lot of work. Yeah, it's the worst dude Windows is the worst
