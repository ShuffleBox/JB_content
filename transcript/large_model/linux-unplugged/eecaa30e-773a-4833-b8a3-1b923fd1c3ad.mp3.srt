1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
It's gonna be a special episode, but it's almost too perfect that it was on August 25th, 1991,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,800
that Linus Torvalds at the age of 21 announced the Linux project on Usenet and we'll have a

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,040
link to the original email in the show notes. I think everybody's probably seen this one before

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,280
where he talks about it being a no big deal OS. Only a 386 OS won't ever take advantage of things

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,160
like SCSI. It's just, it's sort of a perfect moment on August 25th. Let's hope it never gets

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:45,920
big and professional. Just a few years later, right? Hello friends and welcome to 368 of your

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,440
weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes, good to be connected with you.

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
Huge show today. Nice to have you in our recording space for a very special episode.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
I see you spruced up in here. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for noticing. You know, I put a lot

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,520
of work into that. You sure did. Also, I like that you wore a hat. I don't know if a birthday hat is

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,560
the right style, but I like the intention there. We have a huge show today. I also want to start

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,080
by saying thank you to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged. Cloud Guru is the

13

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,120
and thanks to them for sponsoring the Unplugged program. Now we have some big news to get into.

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,400
We have a fun initiative we're launching. Some follow-up stuff, but maybe even more special.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,080
I should sit down for this one. We have a huge showing in the mumble room. Time,

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:55,360
appropriate, greetings, virtual lug. Hello! Hello! Hello! Mumble overload. That really was. I got to

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,640
bring that down just a little bit there. That was a lot. We have the return of a bunch of friends.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Popey, Wimpy, it is great to see you gentlemen. Hello guys. It's been far too long. Great to have

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,040
you back. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello to everybody in the mumble room. We'll get there in a moment,

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,240
but I also want to say a special hello to Drew, Alex, and Mr. Joe Resington. Hello.

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Hello. Good afternoon. I'm back. Hello everybody. So we have so much to get into,

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,280
but we had one more special guest that snuck in just before we got started. So I also have to say

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,120
a big special hello to Mr. Michael Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello hippies. Hello. Hello. Hello. So good

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,240
to have you here too. We have some things to cover you and me as well. How you doing, Wes?

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,560
Oh boy, I'm excited. You know, you and I were talking before the show and we thought this is

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
a special day and it's not often we make the news about ourselves. So that way it's not just about

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
our big news. We have a couple of things in the second half of the show that I think you guys are

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,320
really going to be interested in. But like the Arch users we are, before we do any of that, Wes,

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,480
it's time to see if we can update the Jupiter Broadcasting file server. It's been since the last

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,600
time we did it on the show, I think, right? That's a yes. It's been a little too long.

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,560
So our commitment to you right here on the show is to try to do a live update. Wes Payne,

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
are you ready to update one of the most important servers for Jupiter Broadcasting live on the air?

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Let's do it. We can't have downtime. We can't, no. Wes, don't do it. The last time I was on this

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,320
podcast, you were doing this and that was blooming months ago. It's like last year.

37
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,800
I know. It's pretty great. It is pretty great. Are you ready to start? Yeah, let's do it.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,360
Is it a big one? Oh, decent size. Oh, hey, we're upgrading Docker. We don't use that for anything.

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,680
What about your ZFS there? What about your... Oh, let's see. Oh, yep, we got a new kernel.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
So we'll have that coming down too. All right. So this is going to be one of those download and

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
build. So we'll let that go in the background and then we'll continue on with the rest of our show.

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Check in later. I have a good feeling about it. I think it'll be just fine. I really do. Oh, yeah,

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
of course. Spikiness can do it. But that's probably all the stalling I can do. I have some really big

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,720
news to share with everyone. You know, I've been podcasting. This is unbelievable. And I thought

45
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,440
it can't actually be true. But I checked. I've been podcasting for 15 years. I've been podcasting

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,640
for 15 years, nonstop. That's amazing. What I'm about to share with you is probably the biggest

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,280
project I've ever worked on in that 15 years. It's one of those projects that I hope sets the

48
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,200
foundation for myself personally, for Jupiter Broadcasting and these podcasts for the rest of

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,640
my life. The Cloud Guru and Jupiter Broadcasting have made the mutual decision to separate and

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,240
create Jupiter Broadcasting's independent media status. The demerger will allow for Jupiter

51
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Broadcasting and the Cloud Guru to dedicate their resources and specialize in the content they do

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
best. Jupiter Broadcasting and creating Linux and open source podcast content cater to

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,680
enthusiasts and industry professionals and a Cloud Guru in creating comprehensive and hands-on

54
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,240
multi-cloud computing, Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals. A Cloud Guru and

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Jupiter Broadcasting share many commonalities such as the passion we have for our respective

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,760
missions and the investment we make in creating accessible, accurate and engaging content that

57
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,800
makes a difference to our audience. We also share a belief in the importance of giving back to the

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,960
open source community. As such, a Cloud Guru will continue its support of Jupiter Broadcasting with

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,880
a sponsorship arrangement and we will continue to explore future content collaboration opportunities.

60
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,240
There you have it. It's official. I'm looking forward to the future. A new era. We'll be working

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,480
together in a new era. Jupiter Broadcasting and the productions are independent on their own

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,560
company again. We have a little Vic Fontaine to celebrate.

63
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,440
You came along and everything started to hum.

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Still, it's a real good bet. The best is yet to come.

65
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,320
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?

66
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,600
You think Westpain is going to pour us a couple of drinks to celebrate. So we may be under the

67
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:39,680
influence. A little more than that, Wes. So I'm very excited. A Cloud Guru has a lot in the pipeline

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,600
and Jupiter Broadcasting has a whole bunch in the pipeline. There's things that are in the background

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,120
that are getting worked on, but there's a couple of things that are happening pretty much right

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,520
now. Let's start with the first thing. We're going to be doing a little bit of a little bit of

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,120
a little bit of everything that's happening in just a few minutes as we're recording this.

72
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Coder Radio returns to the air with its first episode landing. And Mike, I don't think you and

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,280
I could be more excited. We are like so full pumped about doing this. It's you and myself again with

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,520
dragging Wes in as much as we can. And the show's back. It's back. It's a party Jar Jar style.

75
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
It's full Jar Jar style. And we're going to do it live, I think. We decided we want to go ahead and

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,840
do it live, which, you know, should be fun. We don't have as many live shows anymore, but I think

77
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,120
that should be fun. And it's just back where it always was. Coder dot show. And you can subscribe

78
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,600
and the new one will be out in about 15 minutes as I record this. Same feed and everything,

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,880
I think. Right. Yep. Same feeds. So if you never unsubscribe, it'll be right there for you.

80
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,920
So that's pretty exciting. And I don't know. We have much more to say than that, Mike. Like people

81
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,600
know Coder. It's been around forever. So same classic flavor. New label. Yeah, we have actually

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,920
the labels the same. We kept the logo. That's right. I see it's gluten free now. Yeah, that's

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,640
what we did. We made it gluten free. So that's great. Mike's also going to be joining us on

84
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,520
self hosted this week. So keep an eye out for that. And then the other thing that I'm very

85
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,480
excited to announce right now is that Linux action news will return in September. And Joe and I are

86
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,920
already starting to work on that. And Joe, you're not thrilled at all about it. No, because you're

87
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,240
making me work on Sunday again. It's like, what, five months or whatever with no working on my

88
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,480
Sundays? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know. But we looked at it and we felt like LAN is the show that does

89
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,480
the due diligence. It does the work. So it kind of has a special place in Linux media. We didn't

90
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:48,240
really have a voice in that sort of area. Headlines served us super, super well. And so drew

91
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,200
hats off to you for just banging headlines out. You really own that and took it. Thank you. Thank

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
you. So headlines is remaining with a cloud guru. And I don't know if they're continuing production

93
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,960
or not. That's going to be their decision. Now that we kind of will have that hole in our lineup,

94
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,520
it makes a lot of sense to restart Linux action news. Oh, yeah. And of course, for me,

95
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:16,000
it has a special place because it is born from Linux action show. And so to me, it's a sentimental

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,880
show for the continuation. Yeah. And so I'm really happy that I'll be back. We're currently aiming,

97
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,120
should we say September 7th for the first episode back? Yeah, I think that's the first. Yeah, we'll

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,600
sort of six seventh, depending on where you are, if you're in the UK or in America. But yeah,

99
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
that's Sunday slash Monday. Oh, I'm excited. How's your update going over there, Wes? Well,

100
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,800
it's going well. Is it? We're rebuilding the unit RAMFS right now. Now we're not done. We got to do

101
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,960
the AUR updates next. Do we? I think we should. So I just want to take a moment with our friends here

102
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,400
and say thank you to everyone for your support over the last couple of years and for being there

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,720
now, helping make this possible. You guys have really made the difference and just a big huge

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,400
amount of appreciation for everyone. And I'm excited about where JB goes from here. It does

105
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,640
mean this has becomes a business again and the business has to survive. I've learned a lot of

106
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
lessons in this process and I've learned how important that is for the product. The product

107
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,200
is very important. And if that's what sustains the business, you put everything into the product.

108
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,960
With that in mind, we're launching something called the unplugged core contributors. It's

109
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,320
a membership for the Linux unplugged program and I'm launching it today. You can get it at

110
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,240
unplugged core dot com. If you use the promo code founder, you'll get two dollars off the monthly

111
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,920
cost indefinitely. It's only available for the first 100 subscribers. There will also be a link

112
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,800
at the top of the show notes, but you can go to unplugged core dot com. Now, why? Why a membership

113
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,880
for Linux unplugged? Well, let me just say I have I have learned a lot and my intention with this

114
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,840
membership is primarily two things. Number one, keep Linux unplugged as independent as long as I

115
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,920
draw breath. Number two, help reduce adload needed to make the show profitable so we can keep

116
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,520
producing. So membership will offset adload. There will be ads, but it will help offset how many ads

117
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,120
are required. Now, as a perk of being a member, when you become a core contributor, you also get

118
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,240
access to two RSS feeds. The first is an ad free version of the show. Same full production, just

119
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,520
there will be no ads. Wonder where you got that idea from? Who could have thought of that? And if

120
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,480
that's your preference, you know, as Joe offers that for late night Linux and he has as a Patreon

121
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,840
perk and it's for some people, they don't want any ads and it's a great option. You still get

122
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,320
the full high quality produced episode. It just doesn't have any ads. Or if you're like me, you're

123
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
just too lazy and forget to listen to the ad free version, but it's a great way to support too.

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,400
That's true. Now there's a second feed option. When you become a core contributor, you can get

125
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,000
the full live stream. All of our screw ups, the stuff that never makes it into the show,

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,720
the full pre and post shows, which are much, much, much longer than we'll make into the show.

127
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,520
It's basically the extra show that never gets released. So you have two options, ad free or

128
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,120
the full bootleg, which has everything in it, including our pre and post show chatter that

129
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
is, you know, maybe sometimes we'll cut a selection of that and put it on the end or the beginning,

130
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,680
the end of unplug. This is everything. So promo code founder for the first 100 subscribers.

131
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,920
It's eight dollars a month. You use that promo code founder. It'll kick it down to six dollars

132
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,880
a month indefinitely. Unplugged core dot com. Help keep us independent and help reduce the

133
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,920
adload needed. I may consider rolling this out for other shows as well. I think you guys have

134
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,960
heard me get on my soapbox before and talk about how important I think it is for a creator

135
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,600
to be funded by the audience. It changes the way you think about the content that you're making.

136
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,640
It's a it's a game changing way to think about it. You don't think about it from grabs and clicks

137
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,880
and emotions and getting the biggest number for advertisers. You think about it from a standpoint

138
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,160
of what would make that handful of members happy. And it is a much more genuine way to produce

139
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,120
content. And in my 15 years of production, I can tell you, I have learned to walk the line

140
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,840
with ad supported media, with company supported media and with member supported media. But if

141
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,800
you were to ask me to pick one model, it would be 100 percent member funded. It's not possible,

142
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
especially in today's climate, especially because I'm trying to make this a full time,

143
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,320
sustainable job. But member support does go a long way and it does help reduce the amount of ads.

144
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,840
It's a great way to be invested in the content here. Yeah. I mean, that's why we're doing it,

145
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,760
right? We have a track record here. So it's an investment I think you can count on. You know

146
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,920
that that money is going to go towards producing a show that can go through something like a merger

147
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,400
and a demerger and stay genuine and true to itself and answering to its audience. That's

148
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,160
what you're investing in. Plus my 15 years of nonstop podcasting track record. We'll have links

149
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,160
in the show notes or you can go to unplugged core dot com and use the promo code founder for the

150
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,000
first 100 subs after 100. It will be full price again, but I appreciate either way. And don't

151
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
forget after you subscribe, you get to feed choices and you can subscribe to that in your

152
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,040
podcatcher of choice. And then it just shows up in your podcast catcher like every single week.

153
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,960
One thing is nice about the full live stream. It's definitely not as well produced. It's way longer,

154
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,520
but we're really going to shoot to try to get it out as quick as reasonably possible. So it's if

155
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,400
you like the show right away or maybe if you're often a live stream member, but you didn't make

156
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,200
it and you can get that feed and you'll get it as quick as we can turn it around. The next best

157
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,000
thing to be in here. So I'm very excited. I hope we get some support here because obviously it's

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,520
early days and I have to make decisions about advertisers and how many to take on. And I hope

159
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,280
I hope that this resonates with you as the audience, especially maybe some of those have

160
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,680
you been listening for a while and you know what this show does. You know what we're made of

161
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,480
unplugged core dot com. How are you doing over there, Mr. West? Are you ready for an update?

162
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,400
Well, I've just rebooted. Let's see if it comes back up. Updates are done. No issues. All right.

163
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,600
Are you pinging it right now? I'm just about to. I'm going to have my first celebratory drink.

164
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
I didn't I didn't think that would actually work, but it's already pinging. That's a good sign.

165
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,480
I maintain I think one of the smart things we did here and they were just talking about this

166
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,520
in two and a half admins in the latest episode. Jim and Alan were talking about some reasons

167
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,440
maybe not to use ZFS on route under Linux. And I agree completely with their take on it.

168
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,280
And I think this is sort of proving that out to like, even if something goes wrong,

169
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,760
worst cases, our pool just doesn't mount. But our OS will boot. Right. And that is nice.

170
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, what is it? This isn't up yet. You're teasing me. You're teasing me. Come on, West.

171
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,800
We might have to go check on it. We're going to have to do a console run during the show.

172
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,960
I think so. Are we going to do that? We don't have a wireless mic. But we should, though.

173
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,080
Westpain will take a really long XLR cord out to the garage. I do have mumble on my phone.

174
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,600
Crap. I didn't want to say I told you so. Damn it, Wimpy. No, Wimpy. No, no, it's going to be

175
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
fine. Don't you worry about it. Don't you? It's going to be fine. I have faith in Wes. I'm sure

176
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,720
he can recover the firestorm that is happening right now. I do, too. He does look a little

177
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
nervous. Oh, no, it'll be fine. Oh, that's never a good look for us. I know. I know. Like,

178
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,240
it doesn't happen. Not much makes him nervous. Oh, oh, oh, some progress. Okay. It might just

179
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,200
be being slow. We'll see. It didn't immediately reject me trying to SSH, so. Okay, so now you're

180
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,760
just getting like the delay thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that does. All right, we'll come back after

181
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,640
this housekeeping break. How about that? You ready? Should we do a little housekeeping and

182
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,760
we'll see how it does? Now, I have a special housekeeping this week. If anyone out there is

183
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,600
looking for a very talented full time audio editor, mixer or master, or a very savvy sysadmin

184
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,840
with 20 years of experience, let Drew know. Drew is looking for work as part of this transition.

185
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,480
His role is no longer available at a Cloud Guru, and he'll be looking, starting right now, for

186
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,520
work. He's still working with us. He's still here. But Drew, this is sort of, you didn't ask me to

187
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,600
do this, but I wanted to get this out there for you. Where could people get ahold of if they're

188
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,040
looking for a killer sysadmin or an amazing audio guy? Yeah, I appreciate it. I am, of course,

189
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,840
on Twitter at Drew of Doom. I'll make sure that there's a link to my LinkedIn in the show notes.

190
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,400
Also, I've got an episode coming out. I was on the podcast engineering show a few weeks back,

191
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
and that episode comes out on the 27th. So when that's live, I'll get that in the show notes too.

192
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,080
There you go. Oh, I'm looking forward to that. LinkedIn profile in the show notes,

193
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,200
like he mentioned, at linuxunplug.com slash 368. I can vouch for this guy,

194
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,040
either doing your sysadmin work or making you sound amazing. Drew is the guy for the job.

195
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,400
No kidding. Yeah. But the most important thing is he's not going to make me stay up

196
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,920
till four o'clock in the morning on Tuesday nights because he's going to keep editing this show.

197
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,640
That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I'm not going anywhere as far as this community is

198
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,800
concerned. We're so lucky to have you. We heart you, Drew. We heart you. I heart you too.

199
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,600
That is our housekeeping there. Was that enough time for you, Wes, to get into the...

200
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,240
Were you able to get a shell? No. Oh, no. And it's not pinging anymore. It is proper screwed.

201
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,760
This hasn't happened yet. Now, I will say I was a little cavalier. I didn't do a whole lot of

202
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,440
checks. I thought, you know, let's try this as the casual admin. You just run your updates.

203
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:54,560
The updates went well. You reboot. That's why we did this, right? Oh, God. I got so much to do.

204
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,960
All right. Well, I mean, do you want to make a cart crash run while I... I mean,

205
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,320
because we got to get it back up, right? That's what's going to happen now is we got to get it

206
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,480
back up. I wanted to get some take from the mumble room on an idea that I'm percolating on

207
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,800
that I'd like to get the audience's help with. I've been trying to think of ways that we could

208
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,360
improve the quality of life for Linux users, make a difference in projects, maybe help catch bugs

209
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,600
before major releases. And I was toying with this idea of a bugathon, something that would be

210
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,440
scheduled ahead of time. We'd give plenty of heads up to the audience and we'd essentially pull

211
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,760
together a live stream event where we're helping coordinate the group testing of, say, a distro

212
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,640
before its next release or a project before their next release. Try to line it up with their own

213
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,360
internal project testing windows and release windows. So that way we're contributing at the

214
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,640
right time for the project. Try to mentor and work with people that are attending the live stream to

215
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,840
properly do bug reports, format them, give them enough information, go through that process with

216
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,880
people, maybe put it up on the screen and show them a bug report and try to take like a

217
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:10,320
concentrated couple of hours on the JB live stream with the audience and focus all of our attention

218
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,280
at one thing. And as I was experimenting with this idea in my noggin, I thought, wouldn't it be

219
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,440
interesting to try this with Fedora 33? Because not only are they cramming a bunch of new stuff

220
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,520
into Fedora 33, but as we've talked about a lot on this show, it will also be the first Fedora that

221
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,400
switches to ButterFS as its default file system. Just a small change. A lot of eyes are going to

222
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,080
be on that change, Wes. Yeah. And maybe we could do our part to help test it before it gets released

223
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
to the public. Maybe we could catch something as a group, something that's organized. And I've

224
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,640
created a Bugathon room on the new Jupyter broadcasting matrix so we could start coordinating

225
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,360
there. And I'm hoping maybe the Luplug could help me with some of the details as well. But what I'm

226
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,200
trying to get to is something in the end that is useful for projects and maybe distro maintainers.

227
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,040
Because, and Wimpy, this is one thing I was going to kind of pick your brain is maybe I'm too

228
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,000
cynical, but I think a lot of times what ends up happening is we just overburden developers that

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,960
already have too much on their plate with a whole bunch of bug reports or problems that aren't

230
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,800
really in the right channel or don't really provide enough context or information for them

231
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,440
to do anything. It's almost like we make the problem worse for them. There's two sides to

232
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,920
that, right? There is the bug report that says insert name of application doesn't work for me,

233
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,560
it crashes, which is of no use to anybody. And then there's the bug report that comes from somebody

234
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,400
who is trying to help solve the problem and does the initial steps of triage.

235
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Now, this is all complicated stuff because you have to, as you say, have to file the bug in the

236
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,320
right place to draw attention to the right people. But I tell you what, I know Frank is in here

237
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,000
listening to this as well. This is manner from heaven, right? If you're prepared to try and

238
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,880
corral the JB community around these release critical periods to do some well-focused testing

239
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:26,000
and bug reporting, bring it on. That's just fabulous. Because for all of those bug reports

240
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,840
that are of quality and we can action, yes, there will be some that we can't do much with.

241
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,280
But high quality bug reporting, can't get enough of that stuff. That's great.

242
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm liking your take on it. I was worried, you know, I don't want to create a bigger problem.

243
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,080
And I think sometimes our good intentions do that. And I also want to do something that's

244
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,720
substantive. Do you know what I mean? Like something that actually could help.

245
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
One of the places where it may help before, I mean, I know you're going to talk to Neil

246
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,760
about this stuff and his take on the Fedora community may be different from mine, right?

247
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,120
But one of the places where you can start to help right now before we even get into, you know,

248
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,800
it's nearly the release and we need to report things is improving the documentation around

249
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,800
how you report things, right? You know, how do you actually file a quality bug?

250
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,720
Checking that all of that information is ready for that group of people to come into that process

251
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
and actually make a meaningful impact in the QA process.

252
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Yeah. Right. Lower the barriers to entry. Just make it as smooth as it can be.

253
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,480
Right. Brent, I think there's an opportunity here too to just encourage people to learn how

254
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
this process works and maybe they do it on their own afterwards.

255
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
You know, some of us have been lucky enough to know some of the people that work on the software

256
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that we use. So we've been able to just, I don't know, send bugs over telegram. I do that every

257
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,080
once in a while. But one thing I've always wanted to know is how to write a really great bug report

258
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,920
from the developer's perspective. And so I think if we're able to share that knowledge and create

259
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,280
a bit of a bug squashing army, that's a legacy that'll just continue. You'll have a lot of people,

260
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,040
you know, five, 10 years from now that are creating helpful bug reports that

261
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,840
might be super helpful in lots of communities. Wouldn't that be a great knock on effect? So Neil,

262
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm curious to know what your take is and specifically how we could help the Fedora

263
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:27,360
community. Before you jump in, I noted that Fedora 33 has a test week and one of the last

264
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,880
days of the test week lands on a lup day. And I was thinking we would sort of target this for that

265
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,800
test week for Fedora 33. That sounds great. I mean, as Wimpy said earlier about making

266
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:46,400
quality bug reports, I completely agree that that is definitely an aspect that could be improved

267
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,360
here. And in the Fedora context, we have tools like our tools that are for bug reporting in general

268
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,120
when crashes happen and stuff like that already tries to guide people to tell us the right things

269
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,200
for being able to reproduce a bug or do something with it. And we've got automation on the backend

270
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,480
to replay the crash and do stuff like that. That's all well and good. What we don't really

271
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,440
have, and this is probably something where if we just solicit some feedback from developer types

272
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,440
who actually work on the software, what kind of information would be useful just in general

273
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,160
for non-crash type bug reports? Because there's a whole variety of bug types. There's the,

274
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,720
well, it just broke. And then there's the, well, this did something slightly unexpected,

275
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,400
but didn't fail. And the latter case is actually the much harder one. I have tons of those bug

276
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,120
reports in my own queue for the projects that I'm one of the developers for. And it's really hard

277
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,520
because people don't give enough information for me to do anything with it. And in a lot of cases,

278
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,040
by the time I can get around to ask for the information, they either have kind of moved past

279
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,880
it and forgotten about it, or just don't think that giving more information is useful or necessary.

280
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,480
And sometimes even worst cases, they're rude about it. So I think setting a better set of base

281
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,000
expectations of what makes a useful bug report helps. And I think also having the ability for

282
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,440
people to realize that there's like things that need to be evaluated and tested and kind of beaten

283
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,760
in to make sure that it works well. As a distro release is being developed like Ubuntu 2010,

284
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:42,400
which is coming up, Fedora 33, and so on. As those are coming, all these distros that do

285
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,920
scheduled releases often have periods in which you can help and they have documentation for how you

286
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:56,240
can help make it a better release by testing and reporting and even here and there working with

287
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,000
developers and stuff like that. It just sort of depends. Neil makes a good point there,

288
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,560
which is that the urgency with which people are reporting issues doesn't necessarily align

289
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,760
with the priorities of the developers that are receiving those bug reports.

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,000
That doesn't mean we don't care. It just means that we're busy and we have a priority order

291
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,680
in which we can address things. So it's a bit like being in an IRC channel. If you're the kind

292
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,880
of person that joins a free node channel and then immediately demands assistance and then

293
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,280
immediately after asking for assistance loses interest and then leaves, that's not helpful

294
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,200
conversation in an IRC. In the same way that if you file a bug report, make it a bug report that

295
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,640
you actually care about and you're not just being frustrated on that day. Because it might be that

296
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,920
weeks or months later those developers are coming around to a collection of issues that circulate

297
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,320
around a thing that you've identified and other people have as well and they're trying to collate

298
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,240
information around the issue that you've reported. Do expect that sometimes you may get a response

299
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,880
within minutes or hours and sometimes it may be weeks or months later that somebody comes back to

300
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,200
you asking for more information or wanting to follow up on what you've reported.

301
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,560
Fedora 33 caught my attention because of the high profile nature of all the changes.

302
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,000
They're all pretty big. One of the things that's coming down the pipe for Fedora 33 is they're

303
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,400
doing now an IOT edition, which not shocking there that not really a surprise to see that

304
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,480
this is coming. In fact, I kind of wondered if this was maybe one of those things that they resisted,

305
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,040
but maybe customers asking for it kind of made the start. As one might expect, it's meant to

306
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,600
be deployed on devices that are used in the Internet of Things from small, silly devices

307
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,920
to production equipment. You got to put quotes around that's the Internet of Things. Yes, right.

308
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,520
They have a product requirement document and in there it states that Fedora is the default

309
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,960
platform in the IOT space. Anyone starting an IOT project from cute embedded hacks all the way up to

310
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,320
multi-million device deployments will start with Fedora. It's going to be available on x86 and ARM

311
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,480
64 architectures. It's pretty small. I mean, maybe not tiny, but it requires like three gigs of disk

312
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,520
space and runs within one gig of RAM, at least if you're not doing anything anyway. You want to

313
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,840
adjust to a new way of managing packages, though one does not just run dnf install on the Fedora

314
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,880
IOT system. No, no. This distribution instead is using RPM OS tree. Oh, yes, you know RPM OS tree.

315
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,720
It's built around the concept of an immutable base image, perhaps augmented by one or more

316
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,360
overlay images. The running system is never modified by the package management operations

317
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,440
like installations or system upgrades. Instead, RPM OS tree maintains a set of parallel system images,

318
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,480
two of them by default. The running image is immutable and any package management operation

319
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,160
will instead apply to the next image in the series. So, for example, if you were administrator

320
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,520
on one of these boxes and you want to install, say, nano, that package will go into the alternative

321
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,240
image and the action will not actually yield a usable nano command at first. Got to have nano.

322
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,760
Oh, gosh. Of course, you're installing nano. It's got a new release out, Wes. New version.

323
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,320
Now, of course, the idea behind this mechanism is to make system updates safer, which especially

324
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,720
you want if you've got an Internet of Things device that's deployed somewhere out in the field

325
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,680
and it's hard to get to. Since the update is applied to the idle image, it can't break the

326
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,960
running system even if it's interrupted at an especially inopportune time, which, Chris, as you

327
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,840
know, seems to happen a lot with updates. We could have used that today. It's also nice for an IoT

328
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,240
device is it's really easy to implement a factory reset operation with this type of file system

329
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,720
approach. You know, hold down a button and it goes back to the original image. Roll back. And it

330
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,840
reboots. There's other takes at an IoT device image. The thing that made this stand out to me

331
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,920
is interesting for those of you who like Fedora is apparently they are opting out of the normal

332
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,480
release cycle for the IoT edition. Instead, the project has committed to producing a rolling

333
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,240
release with monthly updates with RPM OSG configured to pull down updates automatically.

334
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,920
Hopefully, IoT systems can be kept up to date with minimal effort. And if it goes bad, well,

335
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,840
roll back. This reminds me when we started seeing Ubuntu core and people wanted to build

336
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,240
desktops. You know, as soon as I see that, I'm like, well, now I want to make it a desktop.

337
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,120
Such an idiot. That's my first thought. And yet soon it'll be running in the studio.

338
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,600
I guess they just they wanted to put everything in the end of this 33 release. So it just seemed

339
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,720
like a good one to test. It seemed like this is something that we could apply to other projects

340
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,040
as well. And Minimac, you could see how the virtual could kind of get in on some of this,

341
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,120
do virtual install sessions and stuff like that. I would love to see that. You know,

342
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,960
we have really a good crowd now every Sunday. And wouldn't it be cool to have like an install and

343
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,440
testing party? We could even have a separate room and we could even record that session

344
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,560
and just have a mumble recording. Wow. Or you could use Discord, you know,

345
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,640
upgrade to the 21st century. Oh, jeez. But the matrix is fine too. You know, come on.

346
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,120
Oh my God, it's too much already. Let's build a bridge to everything. So here's what I'm thinking

347
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,920
specifically for Fedora 33 is September 8th for Linux Unplugged. After that week's Linux Unplugged,

348
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,840
let's all just whoever wants to join us stay here. So come for Linux Unplugged and stay and we will

349
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,000
do the bug smashing bugathon session and we'll try to get some guidance on best practices to pass

350
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,560
forward for bug submitting and stuff like that. Maybe bring a computer you want to install Fedora

351
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,440
on. Yeah, bring a computer you can wipe and we'd love to get some testing on the PotterFest stuff.

352
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,840
And we'll just sit here as a group and we'll just try to bang this out. And if it is successful,

353
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,520
if it produces something of use, I think we'll keep working at that model and see if we can't

354
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,080
apply it to other stuff. So September 8th will be the date. It'll be after Linux Unplugged.

355
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,320
It'll be the Bugathon Live and we're coordinating in a room on Matrix called Bugathon

356
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,560
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix server. So this will be good because the beta for Fedora

357
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
comes around September 15th and then like they have a backup date to like the 22nd because

358
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,280
maybe they might not make the 15th. There's a lot going on. It gives us a chance to find and get

359
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,960
this stuff in before the beta lands and then, you know, do another round of testing. So that'll be

360
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
the plan. I'll remind you about it in the future, but that'll be kind of cool. This should be fun.

361
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm excited. And I'm just excited for Fedora 33 because Fedora's great. Yeah, come check out

362
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,080
the virtual log too. We do that every Sunday at noon Pacific time and you can just join the

363
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,200
mumble lobby and hang out in there. And of course there's a Matrix room too. That's right. You know,

364
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,160
Wimby, I do have a special Discord pick for you because I knew you'd be here this week.

365
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,680
Okay, lay it on me. I'm all about the Discord these days. So listener Dylan wrote in and he

366
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,440
said, I'm a big fan of the show. I've been a dedicated listener since I found Linux seven

367
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,920
months ago. He likes to listen on the road. Oh, and he loves a good old fashioned Arch update.

368
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,840
So I'll have to come back to that for him in a moment. But he says, I'm contacting you today

369
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,520
in hopes of having a cool piece of software my friends made highlighted on the show.

370
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:26,000
It's called FetchChord. Its main purpose is to display your OS in a rich presence way on Discord.

371
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,480
So it gives you like a rich display for your Discord based on your OS. It's kind of like Neo

372
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,600
Fetch for Discord. So it's called FetchChord. Oh, that's fun. Right. So like how it can,

373
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,800
you know, it'll show information about what you're running, what your system is.

374
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,760
Isn't that neat? So we'll have a link to that. It's FetchChord on Mr. Potato Box's, or Bob

375
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,200
Mr. Potato Bob Box. Yeah. Okay. That's awesome. Yeah. Isn't that great? So that's for you.

376
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,880
That's that's for you. Thank you for catering to the current generation. And maybe in a few weeks

377
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,920
from now, you'll realize the errors of your way and you'll bring your community over to, you know,

378
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,320
a modern communication platform as well. I'm actually laughing out loud. I feel attacked.

379
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,160
I feel attacked right now. I'd just like to point out at this point that self-hosted has a Discord.

380
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:20,160
There you go. That's true. Right. Also, Neil, back in your box, you and I both played Fall Guys

381
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,280
on Linux, you on Fedora, me on Ubuntu. And how did we communicate that evening?

382
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Yes, through Discord. It was actually a lot of fun. Right, there we go. End of conversation.

383
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Hey, I only just felt that. I only just said that because I've been needling Chris for like almost

384
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,080
two years now to set up a matrix server. Yeah, but that was, you started that conversation two

385
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,440
years ago. Two years has elapsed. The world has moved on. Matrix is a science project. It's

386
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,040
wonderful, but, you know, it's not for everyday people and we need to be inviting everyday people

387
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,600
into our world. Ditto, give us give us the awkward fact that's hanging in the room here.

388
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,160
Well, JB does have its own Discord server set up. It's just there's no one in there.

389
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,760
Hey, I'm in there. Yeah, I am too. I think. I just check it from time to time. I, you know,

390
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,440
you might be right, Wimpy. That's why it hurts because you might be a little right, but we'll see.

391
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,840
Wimpy, you are the voice of reason once again.

392
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,120
Wimpy, this is this is why the good developers invented bridges,

393
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,600
my friends. I'll just bridge that Discord. It'll be fine.

394
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,120
No, but that's the worst thing ever because then that's the worst of both worlds, right?

395
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,280
You need the one thing or the other. You're not backing one platform or the other.

396
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
Or a disgusting hybrid.

397
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:37,200
Pick something, but if you pick matrix, don't expect audience expansion. Pick Discord,

398
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,480
the fastest growing messaging platform in the world. Expect audience expansion.

399
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,400
I agree just because I have an unfiltered Discord as well. So we have a self-hosted

400
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Discord and unfiltered Discord, and they're both very successful.

401
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,160
I guess all it means I have to figure out why it keeps crashing on my Linux.

402
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,080
I mean, the thing is, maybe matrix is sort of like the back end,

403
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,720
and then you can have these front ends that are telegram and Discord and IRC and

404
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,520
people can use whatever they want. I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe it won't work out,

405
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,120
but I'm launching on the grand experiment.

406
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,960
Hopefully Google will just make another type of chat and then we'll just use that one.

407
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,440
Oh my goodness.

408
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,880
Oh geez, not again.

409
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,560
All right, Westpane. Let's see how that server's doing.

410
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
Actually, it's doing great.

411
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,520
What?

412
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah, totally. So it stopped pinging, and then it started pinging again,

413
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,880
and it's running fine. All our containers are up.

414
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,240
Well done. Well done.

415
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
So why do you think it took so long to come back online?

416
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
Was it checking some disk or something?

417
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
We will have to investigate.

418
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Yeah, that'll be something for after the show.

419
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,600
Now we are on kernel, what was it?

420
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,000
5.8.

421
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,760
5.8, okay. It's fine. I mean, 5.9 is almost out, so we better update soon.

422
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,640
Obviously, can't have an old kernel on our server.

423
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Well, before we go any further, West, good job.

424
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
I feel like you get an applause for that.

425
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,600
Hey, I didn't do anything.

426
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,680
It was our minimalist design, ButterFS on the root vial system,

427
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,560
keeping ZFS for the big data pool, and turns out Arch sometimes works.

428
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,120
Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes it works.

429
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
Now, we have a cool pick that Alex found for us today because we all love to eat.

430
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,160
If you've listened to the bootleg stream, you know how much we love to eat.

431
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
So tell us about Chowdown.

432
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,000
Chowdown, indeed. It's a self-hosted recipe manager.

433
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,080
Stores your recipes in plain text using the schema.

434
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,720
So I don't know if you knew this, but there is a recipe schema over at schema.org.

435
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,000
And this Chowdown application actually stores your recipes

436
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,680
in plain text and you can run it out of a container

437
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,640
and has a nice little web interface with some search.

438
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
So when you want to bring it up on the iPad,

439
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,400
whilst you're frying up some steaks or something, it works really, really nicely.

440
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
It looks pretty, too. I like it.

441
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm liking this display system where they...

442
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
I mean, you got to take pictures of your stuff.

443
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,280
Sounds like, Alex, you've actually been using it, too.

444
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,760
I have indeed, yeah, for probably about three or four months,

445
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
ever since Chris convinced me to buy one of those barbecue ceramic egg things.

446
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
I wanted a way to kind of record what worked

447
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,800
and what didn't on particular cooks and stuff.

448
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,080
So what I use it for is I have a brisket recipe

449
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,480
and then I put some notes underneath the brisket rub

450
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
or whatever I did that particular time and said,

451
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
I like this about it and I did it at these timings

452
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,520
and it came out a little bit too dry.

453
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
And then I have these things in plain text forever.

454
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,160
So the next time I'm planning to do a big cook or something,

455
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,120
I've got that all there alongside the recipe as well.

456
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah. And I like that you can check stuff off,

457
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,480
like individual ingredients and steps of the directions, too.

458
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,160
The display is really clean.

459
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah. Now, one thing worth looking at is in the GitHub,

460
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,720
the author, Clark Lab, I think his name is,

461
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,560
he's actually proposing a complete redesign of the web interface of the UI.

462
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
So currently it's this blue thing with pictures

463
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,080
and I quite like it, to be honest.

464
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,160
But the web interface is going to be rethemed as red

465
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,880
and he's rewriting some of the backend and stuff.

466
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,440
So if you want to be part of that process,

467
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,840
he's actively looking for feedback at the moment

468
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,960
on the new proposed UI. So head over to GitHub

469
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,160
and let him know what you think.

470
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,400
Very cool. We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

471
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,200
Thank you, Alex.

472
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,560
Thank you for your perfect pick.

473
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
Right on theme for the co-host of Self-Hosted.

474
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,080
Check out selfhosted.show for more of that.

475
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,120
My mom has a quick question about how she fires up a container

476
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,240
with her recipes in it.

477
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,320
Okay. It's Tupperware.

478
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,360
Who said Tupperware? That was blue ingenious.

479
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,840
All right. Fair point.

480
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,640
Yeah. Put it in the microwave, crack the lid, and then you're done.

481
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,160
Don't forget to burp the container.

482
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
Maybe sprinkle a little water on there.

483
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,040
Yeah. What does constitute burping a container in modern parlance?

484
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,920
Is that when you like bring it down and restart it?

485
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,880
That's burping it?

486
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,800
You got to rebuild it to get the B in there, right?

487
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,360
Well, let's go around the horn and see what folks are working on.

488
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,960
Mr. Dominic, I know predominantly nothing more important in your life

489
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,400
at all than Coderadio, of course, but what else is going on?

490
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,480
But what else is going on for you?

491
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,360
I'm ashamed to say I'm a full-time Linux user now.

492
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,120
Welcome. Wow.

493
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,920
Took long enough.

494
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,240
I still haven't exactly decided Snap or Flatpak.

495
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,120
And so I would like to put that to you guys.

496
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,160
Why not both?

497
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
Hey, Neil speaks the truth, right? Why not both?

498
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,040
I mean, you're more of an app image guy. That's just what I think.

499
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,440
We have standards around here, right?

500
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,680
We do get into this a little bit in the most recent Coderadio.

501
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm on board with this change. I support this.

502
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,600
I think you've been flirting with it for a long time.

503
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,400
How much do you think it was distro versus you just settling into something?

504
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,840
I think I'm lazy, as people would know.

505
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,120
And the ability just to buy a Thalia or whatever the name of the laptop is,

506
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,320
pre-installed, driver's work, I don't have to really care about anything,

507
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,840
was the solution.

508
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,720
Also, Apple's OS is getting crazier, right?

509
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,680
I had a lot of issues with Catalina and Big Sur, not trying to diss anybody, but-

510
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,520
You and the rest of the internet.

511
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Right. It kind of looks like Fisher Price.

512
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,720
I'm really interested in this. Is it aesthetics or is there something

513
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,960
fundamental from a developer's perspective that you're unhappy with?

514
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
Yeah. So I think the biggest change was I'm not doing a ton of iOS work.

515
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,480
I'm doing a ton of embedded Linux work and mostly Python on the server now.

516
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,960
So I ended up running a bunch of Ubuntu VMs anyway on a Mac computer, which was kind of silly.

517
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
Also, you and the rest of the internet.

518
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,960
Right. So at some point, it's like, why not just run it natively on the hardware?

519
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,760
Thank you.

520
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,440
That's what I wonder if that does seem like, even with WSL and virtualization on Mac Arm,

521
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,400
at a certain point, it is just a little bit simpler. There's less things in the middle.

522
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,280
Right. If it works for you, if it meets your needs for development,

523
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,920
whatever you need, yeah, why not?

524
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,200
The disadvantage that Apple has that makes it easier for these kinds of transitions of like,

525
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,920
you're running a whole bunch of Linux VMs and then you're like, well, why do I have Mac OS?

526
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,200
Is that if you decide to make that change, you wind up actually saving money, right?

527
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,440
Because you can make that calculation and see that there is an actual

528
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,680
tangible benefit across the board.

529
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,520
You don't necessarily get that same calculation when you go from saying Windows with WSL to

530
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,320
Linux on the computer, unless you get a computer with Linux pre-installed.

531
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,320
And I think this is what's just been said about how Linux being pre-installed was just the thing

532
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,240
was like, this is it all works.

533
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,960
Everything's fine.

534
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,400
I'm just going to kind of roll with it.

535
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,640
That is the thing we've been missing for nearly 20 years.

536
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,720
And now that we're starting to have that for real in a big way,

537
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,120
like with System76 and Tuxedo and now Lenovo and Dell and so on,

538
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,960
like having these things there makes a huge difference.

539
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,520
It does, but they've been around for a decade.

540
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,720
Maybe I should nail my colors to the mast here.

541
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:17,120
Obviously I'm responsible for Ubuntu's interests in WSL, right?

542
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:25,120
But that in itself is very interesting because we're finding an interesting trend, which is

543
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,800
there are people that are already running Windows that now are in a world where they

544
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,120
need to target Linux as a platform.

545
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:41,440
And they're able to do that from their point of view, the comfort of their Windows environment.

546
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,320
And WSL is an enabler for them to be able to rapidly do the business that they need

547
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,560
to do, which is to build their products on Linux and to target Linux without actually

548
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,720
having to dip into a Linux world.

549
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,160
And this is kind of an uncomfortable place for me because on the one hand,

550
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
I represent the Ubuntu desktop.

551
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,720
And on the other hand, I represent Ubuntu's aspirations for WSL.

552
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,520
And they don't necessarily compete with one another.

553
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,720
They do complement one another, but they do overlap.

554
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,440
That set, they are not distinct sets of users, right?

555
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,520
They do intersect.

556
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,720
I like that little microcosm.

557
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,600
I think of the cognitive dissonance we've all had around WSL and figuring out where

558
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,200
does it fit in this ecosystem?

559
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,000
Right.

560
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,960
It's a very similar logic that arrives you at Discord versus Matrix, right?

561
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,720
It's that pragmatic approach to use the thing that gets the job done versus the purest

562
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,680
approach sometimes.

563
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:44,560
Yeah.

564
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,440
And you have to figure that the Windows 10 user base has got to be at least one or even

565
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,800
two orders of magnitude bigger than the Ubuntu desktop.

566
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,360
Good point.

567
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,080
And sure.

568
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,160
And I don't discount any of those things.

569
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,040
And to some extent, I'm pragmatic too.

570
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,360
I have a MacBook, as both Wimpy and others know, and I also have a Windows PC that I

571
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,600
work from as well, because I do some game development.

572
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,720
I need to be able to do this.

573
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:19,200
And the thing is, I just I don't see WSL as a driver for getting people interested

574
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,320
in the Linux platform.

575
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,960
I just don't think it will work that way.

576
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,040
I'm not so sure about that.

577
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,640
So you just said to me that you have a Windows computer for game development.

578
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:41,200
The trend that we are seeing almost exclusively ahead of everything else is game studios that

579
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,520
need to target Linux and are using WSL as the vehicle to do that.

580
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,120
Now, I can't reveal names and I can't say what's going on behind the scenes, but that

581
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,200
is definitely a trend that we're seeing.

582
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,040
Well, that's good to know.

583
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,560
I think it's also the perspective that Jay Tucky in the chat room points out that's worth

584
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,040
considering.

585
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,600
He says, I can confirm that I love WSL and many of my colleagues use it at work on Windows

586
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,560
machines.

587
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,000
If WSL didn't exist, they wouldn't be using Linux.

588
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,240
They just wouldn't be using Linux tools.

589
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,520
So there's that too.

590
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,760
There's like the use of more open source tools, even if it's running on a proprietary platform

591
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
is in somewhat a net benefit as well.

592
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:19,760
Right.

593
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,640
And we're already sort of comfortable with the, oh, yeah, you use whatever.

594
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,760
Maybe it's a Mac or Windows and then SSH to all your Linux servers.

595
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,000
It's sort of just bringing that a little closer to home.

596
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,440
You say proprietary platform, the proprietary platform being the desktop operating system

597
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,040
in this case, which is Windows.

598
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,160
But WSL 2 is empowered by the Linux kernel, which is the Linux kernel.

599
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,920
And in the majority of cases, the Ubuntu user space, which is the open source Ubuntu user

600
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,720
space.

601
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,120
And is the new Windows terminal open source?

602
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,920
Yeah.

603
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,720
I believe it is.

604
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,120
Yes.

605
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,440
Yeah.

606
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,160
That's funny.

607
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,320
So that stack is fairly open source except for the virtualizer it's running on.

608
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,840
It's pretty open.

609
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,800
You know, it's way, way more open than, you know, you would, you know, think in your mind

610
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,680
when you're thinking about, you know, a Microsoft ecosystem, because it isn't a Microsoft ecosystem.

611
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,880
This is Microsoft basically opening up to what the rest of the industry have defined

612
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,600
as the de facto development platform standards.

613
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,080
And guys like Mike, I guess, building applications that he's building.

614
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,680
It just made sense to him to just switch to the platform itself, and which we dig into

615
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,800
in Coder a little bit.

616
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,000
So that's a good tease.

617
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,520
And I think Mike, right?

618
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,760
So a lot of people talk about, you know, oh, WSL is the way that Microsoft is going to

619
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,640
snuff out Linux.

620
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,480
Well, what if it's not that?

621
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,000
What if Mike is actually the example of where we're headed?

622
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,520
You know, that more people come to Linux platform natively because they've been introduced

623
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,120
to it via another means.

624
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,560
Yeah, you get more comfortable with it, you know, eventually a couple of years down the

625
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,280
road.

626
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,760
All right.

627
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
I could see living in this day to day.

628
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,320
I wonder if there is brand association power as well.

629
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,800
If you are a Windows user and you trust Microsoft and you trust the Windows platform, and now

630
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,680
they're saying this is a tool that is legitimate, it's sort of a brand association thing.

631
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,320
I wonder if it gives it a more legitimate endorsement.

632
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,680
And that's the word I'm looking for.

633
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,240
Yeah.

634
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,040
And, you know, the thing is, as all of these people have said about the idea of WSL potentially

635
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,760
being an avenue in which people start thinking about using Linux natively, like my own story

636
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,280
in getting in switching to Linux parallels that like WSL didn't exist back then.

637
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,800
I started with DJGPP and using it in DOS and then with Windows using Cygwin and eventually

638
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,520
switching to Linux full time because I liked that platform, that ethos, and that's certainly

639
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,760
something that I think is important and is a good way to go.

640
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:56,880
The difference between then and now is that we have a lot more strongly de-emphasized

641
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,400
the community and the open source principles at the forefront of how people get access

642
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,480
to open source software and tools.

643
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:12,400
And so I don't know if people actually get exposed to that open source culture quite

644
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,440
as much now than they would have, you know, like when I started doing this like 15, 20

645
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:17,920
years ago.

646
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,200
Interesting.

647
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:28,160
So I would argue that more people are exposed to that because it is the lingua franca of

648
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,520
contemporary software development.

649
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,160
You can't go into an organization and they explain to you that they want to create a

650
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,240
way to distribute some information to the world without them leveraging open source

651
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,120
technologies in order to base the foundation of their product on that, right?

652
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,400
You know, it's your thoughts, your thinking that are unique and distinctive.

653
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,960
It's not the technology that you use anymore.

654
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,440
True.

655
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:05,520
And also looking at my daughter's generation who are just emerging into this world, they're

656
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,120
brought up on scratch and the micro, or at least in this country, they're brought up

657
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,800
on scratch and the micro bit.

658
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:22,160
And the whole process is not called open sourcing, but the idea that you share your code and

659
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:29,360
then you remix it is the very expression of that collaborative open source environment

660
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,600
that I find most compelling.

661
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,440
So, you know, my daughter talks about magpying things, you know, finding something that

662
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,240
somebody else has done that you value and building upon it.

663
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,400
And this is the term that the kids use in this, you know, in my area, they magpie somebody

664
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,200
else's stuff.

665
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,320
I'm just, I'm just smirk, I'm just smiling because that's a wonderful thought.

666
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,920
Adorable.

667
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,960
Well, so there you go.

668
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,000
That's what Mike's been up to.

669
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,360
That's how we got down that rabbit hole.

670
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,640
That's what's sorry about that.

671
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,360
No, no, it's great.

672
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,200
That's like, that's one of my favorite things about this show.

673
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,320
Check it out.

674
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,360
Coder dot show.

675
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,760
It's back.

676
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,400
It should be up now.

677
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,880
Go check.

678
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,440
Is it up now?

679
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,800
It's not yet, but it will be soon.

680
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,120
All right.

681
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:15,040
It's in the tubes, as it were, doing the encoding.

682
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,320
I'm pretty excited about that.

683
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,640
Mr.

684
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,280
Rastitun, it's been a while since, so we've got an update from you.

685
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,640
I know you got some new shows.

686
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,840
Tell us what you got going on.

687
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,080
Yeah.

688
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:28,320
Well, since I disappeared, shall we say, I have started a new show called The New Show

689
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,520
with Popey and Dan.

690
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,040
And it's a completely new show.

691
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,160
It's nothing like the old show.

692
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,040
It's the new show and it's at the new dot show.

693
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,160
So check that one out.

694
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,400
And also Jim Salter and Alan Jude of Text App Fame.

695
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,800
I managed to get those two together for a show called Two and a Half Admins, which is

696
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,480
at two dot five admins dot com.

697
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,360
You see what we did there.

698
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,240
Clever domain hack.

699
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,920
And that's basically me just learning stuff from them.

700
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,000
I just kind of introduce it, ask them questions and go, all right, yeah, OK.

701
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,160
And then kind of say, should I do it like this?

702
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,480
And they say, no, you're not doing it that way.

703
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,000
You should do it this way, that way.

704
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,360
You're doing it completely wrong, Joe.

705
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,800
You're a half admin.

706
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,720
And Popey calls that show Two Dot Zero Five Admins to try and insult me.

707
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,880
That sounds about fair.

708
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,720
And Joe, have you learned anything yet?

709
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,320
I've learned tons from them.

710
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,040
Have you implemented anything you've learned yet?

711
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,440
No, I'm still I'm still at the planning stage of implementing.

712
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,520
Next time he rebuilds.

713
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,600
Popey had to drop out early.

714
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,640
So for Popey's benefit, I'm going to plug the Ubuntu podcast, which is humming right

715
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,140
along.

716
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,000
Mr.

717
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,920
Wimperis, I've noticed on my YouTube recently that there seems to be some

718
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,600
Ubuntu Mate hacking going on live on YouTube.

719
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:48,960
Yeah, so some people during lockdown have decided to get fit and lose weight or, you

720
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,160
know, increase their mental aptitude by reading books.

721
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,440
I decided I'd learn how to flex OBS Studio and learn a little bit about cameras and

722
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,160
videography.

723
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,080
So I've been doing a bit of live streaming.

724
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:10,240
So not just Ubuntu Mate, but generally stuff around the Ubuntu community or grassroots

725
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,360
projects to try and involve people in, you know, projects, just trying to put stuff out

726
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,560
there to invite people in.

727
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,080
And we've had some success.

728
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,840
So, yeah, I've got a YouTube channel.

729
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,440
It's Wimpy's World.

730
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,600
So YouTube.com Wimpy's World.

731
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,240
Come along, join the next live stream and dip into our Discord server.

732
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,560
We've got a broad, broad spectrum of people involved there from enthusiasts through to

733
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,840
hardcore developers who are interested in making and creating stuff.

734
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,120
And what's the name of that Discord?

735
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,160
It's in the YouTube chat.

736
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,680
So if you go to YouTube.com Wimpy's World, there's linked from there.

737
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,360
Or Wimpy's World.com.

739
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,720
There's all the links there.

740
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,600
I like your setup.

741
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,320
You've got like a good setup over there with the music going.

742
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,000
And you must have one of, do you have one of those Elgato Stream Deck controls or something?

743
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,960
Because I noticed you're hitting a button and then stuff sliding around and it looks

744
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,760
really good.

745
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,200
So I have lots of things.

746
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,520
It's a bit embarrassing to be honest with you, like how much stuff I've got now.

747
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,840
So I have three mirrorless cameras now.

748
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,920
And I do have two Elgato Stream Decks, although I only use one.

749
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,080
The thing I use for switching the transitions is actually a fairly modest Android tablet.

750
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:36,000
And go to YouTube.com slash Wimpy's World because I'll be revealing how I've put all

751
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,360
of this stuff together and the tricks I've learned along the way.

752
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:46,880
And I've been learning how to do this stuff by following like pro level game streamers

753
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,160
and how they're using OBS and then adapting how they're using OBS to delivering like

754
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,280
let's code Linux material.

755
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,000
So I'm going to be going through all of that and how I'm using OBS and all of the plugins

756
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,880
that are available and all of the ancillary bits and pieces.

757
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,560
So come along and join.

758
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,160
We'll go through that journey together.

759
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
Oh, wow.

760
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,640
Wimpy, you forgot to mention the snap, the OBS snap.

761
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,120
That's what makes it all possible, right?

762
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,920
That'll be part of it.

763
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, the OBS snap, it's like, I'll tell you what, it's like a Linux distribution.

764
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,920
So the OBS snap is OBS plus about 20 plugins and filters built in to the snap.

765
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,480
So it's a fully loaded battery included version of OBS and that's what I use.

766
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,760
And everything that's built into the snap of OBS, it includes all of the hardware acceleration

767
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:52,720
for NVIDIA and AMD and Intel GPUs and APUs and a whole bunch of plugins to do sexy transitions

768
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,320
and interesting effects.

769
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,120
It's all in there and I've learned it all by watching game streamers on Twitch.

770
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,240
Well, you've really nailed it.

771
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,000
I've watched several of them and I think you've put a lot of good thought into just how things

772
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,960
flow when you're making a transition too, which looks really good.

773
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,480
But just the overall look is good.

774
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,760
The green screen is working really well.

775
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,280
The chat integration works great, the music isn't too loud so you can still hear what

776
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,720
you're doing and I can see what you're working on, which checks all the boxes for me.

777
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,000
Taken a lot of fails to get there, but thank you for the kind words.

778
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,840
Definitely needs more star wipes though.

779
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,800
Star wipes?

780
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,200
Yeah man, to make it really professional.

781
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,400
Definitely.

782
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,880
Agreed.

783
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,920
Good Lord.

784
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,320
One day I will hope to be half as good as Wimpy at live streaming.

785
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,640
Hey, look Neil, Neil, the very fact that you are now streaming on Twitch moderately in

786
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:47,360
influenced by my jamboree that I do is the whole reason I'm doing it right is I think

787
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:54,480
as a Linux community, we need to get away from matrix mailing lists and IRC channels

788
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:01,520
and emerge into this whole video production era in order to capture a new audience.

789
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,160
So Neil, it doesn't matter if you're learning as I was a year ago, you're doing it right.

790
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,800
You're capturing a new audience.

791
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:17,680
Something I haven't shared with you, but I've been doing podcast consulting at chrislast.com

792
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:24,320
slash consulting and I had a consultation with a developer of a popular open source

793
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,760
project that everyone listening who's used the Linux desktop for a while has definitely

794
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:37,200
used this app and they've noticed that developers streaming is becoming more and more of a thing

795
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,640
and it was you Wimpy that they pointed to specifically that really impressed them with

796
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,320
the way you're doing it and sort of inspiring them to get their setup going.

797
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,280
I don't know if it's going to be a great idea or not, but I think, you know, it is for them

798
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,400
connecting them with a newer generation of developers who are just beginning their journey

799
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,800
and it's been worth it so far.

800
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,560
So I think you're onto something in that regard.

801
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:06,000
So I'm blushing a little bit, but the thing is this right video is the medium by which

802
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,920
most information is communicated via the internet these days, particularly since, you know,

803
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,080
the whole, you know, galactic meltdown started a few months ago.

804
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,880
Our community needs to capitalize on that movement.

805
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,920
I don't claim to be doing it right.

806
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:35,280
I think I've just caught a wave of other people that are also investing in video

807
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:41,760
as a means to communicate because it's no like accident that I started doing this when

808
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,840
I found myself stuck within the four walls that I'm sat within right now.

809
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,080
Right.

810
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,920
You know, it's kind of a happenstance of, you know, of the world we find ourselves in.

811
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,560
Right.

812
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,320
I think video plays a part in this.

813
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,440
I think it's every medium.

814
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,400
I think it's audio, text and video and there's a reach into each of them.

815
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,320
But I have as well really kind of started putting live streams up more on my screen as I'm working.

816
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,760
I have a monitor that I just sort of perfect to just toss a stream on and it's either a

817
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,960
news stream or sometimes it's a community stream.

818
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,360
And it's like, it's like listening to a podcast while I'm at my desk, only instead it's a live

819
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,000
stream.

820
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,760
And so it works for me.

821
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,680
And I think there's probably a lot of people that do that.

822
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,680
I think there's something to that right now.

823
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:29,040
Maybe that is very much of the now, but you know, my live streams are not short.

824
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,760
And they are an hour, like minimum.

825
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:38,160
The last one I did was an hour and 45 minutes, kind of staggered that 2000 people have watched

826
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,600
that, you know, in the time since I did that last, this time last night.

827
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,960
What's your retention like though?

828
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,720
Retention is pretty decent, actually.

829
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,680
You'd be surprised.

830
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:57,280
I mean, yeah, it's like 30, 35 minutes on my channel and most of it is like long form

831
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:03,840
content and I used to criticize people making long form content, basically streaming hours

832
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,080
long things, but there is an audience for that kind of technical information from our

833
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,040
community.

834
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,200
So we'll have links to that in the show notes.

835
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,000
That's pretty great.

836
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,680
This has been a fun episode.

837
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,640
It's really felt like a party.

838
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,480
Thank you everybody for being here.

839
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,560
So go check out Wimpy's channel.

840
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,280
I have a link to that.

841
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,600
Check out Alex on the self-hosted podcast.

842
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,080
Check out Joe on the return of Linux action news.

843
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,720
And his podcast, two and a half admin, the new show and of course, late night Linux.

844
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,480
Mike's also got the Mike Dominic show and Coder radio.

845
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,200
You can find those.

846
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,960
We'll have links in the show notes.

847
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,400
It's a lot of plugs there.

848
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,480
There's probably more that I'm probably in my forgetting one.

849
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,440
Probably.

850
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,920
Probably.

851
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,040
I mean, there's a lot to it.

852
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,000
Give me a job.

853
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,480
Yeah.

854
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:44,880
Yeah.

855
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,760
Give Drew a job.

856
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,400
If you were seriously, if you're looking for somebody who's a great admin or a fantastic

857
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,360
audio master and just a great coworker.

858
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:53,840
Yeah.

859
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,680
I really, I think Drew, if you had time and you know, could like, you know, just get like

860
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,080
some massive VC funding, you could launch a serious podcast editing shop.

861
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:09,280
Like it could, you know, Drew's podcast editing, but the realities of the world are that the

862
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,000
man needs a job.

863
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,080
So if you need assist admin or a great editor and sound master, give them a look.

864
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,920
We'll have a link in the show notes to that.

865
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,760
A thank you to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode and a thank you to our members

866
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,880
unplugged core.com as we sign off West, I'm going to hit the old refresh.

867
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,880
We have 24 active core contributors now.

868
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,440
Amazing.

869
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,960
We haven't even finished the show.

870
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,720
Which means there's still some of those discounted founder slots available for the download audience.

871
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,520
Use the promo code founder, or if you just click the link at the top of the show notes,

872
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,160
it will take you to the deal right there.

873
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,280
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program.

874
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,600
I can't wait for next week's episode and all the episodes after that.

875
01:02:51,600 --> 01:03:21,360
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

876
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:38,960
The brave souls over at WSL Conf are doing it again on September 9th and the 10th.

877
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,000
WSL Conf on September 9th and the 10th.

878
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,920
Oh, hey, that was a great time last time.

879
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,880
Yeah, maybe we should see if we can get in there again.

880
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,640
I'd be curious.

881
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,520
Diddle, are you going?

882
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,400
I'm presenting.

883
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,840
Oh, fantastic.

884
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,680
Well, I guess you should probably go then.

885
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,960
I guess you should probably go.

886
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,520
Otherwise, it's going to be really awkward.

887
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,440
You know, you know what?

888
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,520
You know what, Diddle Dan, we should fly you out there.

889
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,880
Oh, hang on a minute.

890
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,840
Oh, yeah.

891
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,280
No, none of that.

892
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,360
It's all virtual.

893
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,960
I am actually legitimately missing community events.

894
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,440
I know.

895
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,960
I am now.

896
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,800
I mean, it's getting bloody tiresome, right?

897
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,840
You mean barbecue events?

898
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,640
Yes, I do.

899
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,440
Yes.

900
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,480
I really do.

901
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,720
I'll tell you what, if Linux Fest Northwest is going again by next year, if you come out,

902
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,320
I'll take a group of you out to the best burgers in the Northwest.

903
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,240
The best burgers in the Northwest, if you come out.

904
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,920
That's my commitment to you.

905
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,240
And then the best pizza afterwards at Mod Pizza.

906
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,000
No, Joe, that is not the best pizza.

907
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,600
Stop dissing the Mod Pizza.

908
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,960
Look for us heathens that live, you know, in the colonies.

909
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,560
Mod Pizza is the height of pizza sophistication.

910
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,160
I have to disagree.

911
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,560
No, no, you can't disagree because you don't live in the colonies.

912
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:15,360
Can I just take you to good pizza just so you can, can we just do that, please?
