WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:03.240
Oh my god, Wes.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.200
You're waiting for WWDC.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.040
You know it.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.400
You're waiting for WWDC

00:07.400 --> 00:08.720
to see what the new MacBook Pros

00:08.720 --> 00:09.680
are gonna look like, aren't you?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.080
I'm hoping it's just all touch bar.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.240
It's just one giant touch bar, Chris,

00:14.240 --> 00:15.080
and then that's it.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.080
No more keyboard, no more track pad.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.960
It's the touch pad.

00:18.960 --> 00:19.800
Wow.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.720
I mean, cause I'm really done

00:23.720 --> 00:25.880
with this whole Linux thing anyway, you know.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.240
I want that, I want something stable.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.000
And it makes sense, you know, Dan's on the Mac,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.600
so that way when you guys are doing TechSnap,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.320
you're on a common platform.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.160
Yep.

00:35.160 --> 00:35.980
That makes a lot of sense.

00:35.980 --> 00:39.040
And you know that OS X is like the homeboy for Skype.

00:39.040 --> 00:39.880
That's just where it shines.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.600
Right, that's his predominantly used platform.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.160
And then, of course, the studio here

00:45.160 --> 00:46.280
is switching all to Macs.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.120
Yes.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.320
So, you know, we just recently made a transition to Linux,

00:49.320 --> 00:50.680
and now that we've made that transition,

00:50.680 --> 00:53.140
obviously we'll be making a transition to Mac OS.

00:53.140 --> 00:53.980
So.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.160
Like when that new Mac Pro comes out.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.040
Right, so when you consider the fact

00:57.040 --> 00:59.480
that the studio's gonna be on the Macs,

00:59.480 --> 01:02.440
Dan's on a Mac, you should probably get a Mac.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.720
And I plan to release a Jupyter broadcasting touch bar app.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.560
Oh.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a touch bar app.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.060
So it's got like, it's got the, right on there,

01:12.060 --> 01:12.900
right on the touch bar.

01:12.900 --> 01:13.740
Yeah, that's one of the buttons.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.560
Some Stallman things.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.760
Yeah, yep, just three things actually.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.000
Stallman, the DING, obviously.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.840
Obviously.

01:20.840 --> 01:21.660
Of course.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.200
And then just a button that loads our webpage.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.520
You just push that button and it just loads our webpage.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.080
Oh yeah, jzlive.tv, right there.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.400
Yeah, cause you know, nobody's buying keyboards

01:28.400 --> 01:29.600
with the custom buttons anymore,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.920
but touch bar apps, people be desperate for those.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.660
And with all the switching over to Macs,

01:33.660 --> 01:34.760
it just seems to make a lot of sense.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.420
And you can monetize.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 199 for May 30th, 2017.

01:42.680 --> 01:57.080
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:57.080 --> 01:59.320
that's been trying out so many different projects this week.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.480
It might be time for a nuke and pave.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.360
My name is Chris.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.200
My name is Wes.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.040
Hello, Wes.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.080
I hope this is one of those episodes

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
where people will walk away

02:07.080 --> 02:08.860
and they're going to want to try at least something

02:08.860 --> 02:09.860
that we talked about today,

02:09.860 --> 02:12.680
because goodness knows I have,

02:12.680 --> 02:15.520
I have been trying out some really great projects this week

02:15.520 --> 02:17.660
and I got just a couple of them that we're going to share.

02:17.660 --> 02:19.320
I've also got like a whole list of things

02:19.320 --> 02:20.960
I could talk about for future episodes,

02:20.960 --> 02:21.920
but we'll get into all of that

02:21.920 --> 02:24.320
because before we can get there,

02:24.320 --> 02:26.840
there are some big updates in the open source community

02:26.840 --> 02:29.460
and in Linux that we want to talk about.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.320
I've been going through the list today, Wes,

02:31.320 --> 02:33.180
and I was like, geez, how do we even,

02:33.180 --> 02:34.720
how do we even sort through these things?

02:34.720 --> 02:36.260
So what I've tried to do this week

02:36.260 --> 02:37.340
is we're going to start with some of like

02:37.340 --> 02:39.680
the official newsy stuff.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.560
And then I'm going to gush about our community

02:41.560 --> 02:42.400
for a little bit.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.760
Then we're going to replace Evernote once and for all.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.580
Yes!

02:45.580 --> 02:47.040
And all your other apps.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.800
Those of you who need to improve your focus,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.840
well, there's a GNOME extension for you.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.000
And finally, we'll solve the problem

02:54.000 --> 02:56.300
of old smartphones not getting update.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.960
Then we'll talk a little bit about Chaos Bot,

02:58.960 --> 03:01.920
the huge improvements coming to the Plasma desktop.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.720
And then finally, finally, my friends,

03:05.720 --> 03:07.560
you can stop hating Docker now

03:07.560 --> 03:12.080
and we can all have a little fun with KiteMatic.

03:12.080 --> 03:12.920
I'll drink to that.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.760
Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.560
Speaking of which, Wes brought us in some IPAs this week.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.040
And these are some serious ones,

03:18.040 --> 03:20.060
some local brews from Seattle

03:20.060 --> 03:22.000
because beer matters in Seattle, it says.

03:22.000 --> 03:22.820
That's right, it does.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.880
I like that, that's pretty good.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.720
That's pretty good.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.040
When it rains as much as it does here,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.680
you gotta have something to lift your spirits.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.560
Wes, you know, really though, you're a gentleman

03:31.560 --> 03:35.600
because you've had a heck of a weekend.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.440
It's true.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.440
You did the thing this weekend

03:38.440 --> 03:43.440
that I hope I never ever have to do, and that's move.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
I hate moving.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.120
It's really the worst.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.360
I mean, there's so much excitement and other things,

03:48.360 --> 03:49.240
but you can't get there

03:49.240 --> 03:51.760
because of all the other bullshit right in the way.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.600
Yeah, not only is it just tons of physical work

03:54.600 --> 03:56.320
and disruption to your life,

03:56.320 --> 03:58.520
it is so much coordinating of little details

03:58.520 --> 03:59.960
that are extremely obnoxious.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.660
And then it is so many things not coming through

04:02.660 --> 04:03.680
that you then just have to like,

04:03.680 --> 04:05.200
well, we're rolling with that bunch.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.040
Exactly, yes.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.880
We're gonna roll with that bunch.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.360
So it's really cool.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.400
Not only am I glad you could make it,

04:10.400 --> 04:11.520
but it's really cool that you're able to

04:11.520 --> 04:13.400
bring us in a couple of local brews.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.880
The worst part is I don't even have internet yet

04:14.880 --> 04:15.720
at the new place.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.400
So it's like the backwoods.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.440
So are you like tethering or what are you doing?

04:20.440 --> 04:23.800
Yes, I did buy myself a new Unifi access point.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.640
Oh, cool.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.460
So that's set up.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.480
I got it piggybacking on one of those Xfinity Wi-Fi's,

04:27.480 --> 04:28.560
but it's so slow.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.080
So yeah, I've just been tethering, which is.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.160
Yeah, yeah, I know what that is.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.520
Because it's one of those things you have to schedule

04:33.520 --> 04:34.580
and then they're gonna be there, of course,

04:34.580 --> 04:37.240
between 8 a.m. and noon or something like that.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.680
So good luck.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.560
Yeah, I'm like, well, how are you gonna work from home

04:41.560 --> 04:43.640
if you don't yet have internet to wait for the guy

04:43.640 --> 04:45.360
to show up to install the internet?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.240
So go ahead, take advantage of the JB1 connection

04:48.240 --> 04:49.440
while you're here, Wes.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.280
It's so sweet.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.100
Yes, yes.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.920
Well, we do have some news, quote unquote,

04:52.920 --> 04:55.200
to get into this week, but before we do,

04:55.200 --> 04:56.320
we gotta bring in our log.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.120
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.440
Greetings, Mumble Room.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.760
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.040
Woo, but now, you know what, I swear,

05:05.040 --> 05:06.760
if we did a little pre-planning,

05:06.760 --> 05:09.720
our virtual log there could do like a little harmonious,

05:09.720 --> 05:10.800
hello, hello, hello, hello.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.640
We just gotta tune it.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.460
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.300
Hello.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.760
Hello, some lads.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.120
And then we'll put like an auto-tune filter on there.

05:18.120 --> 05:18.960
That would be amazing.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.040
If anybody knows that's possible with the X32,

05:21.040 --> 05:22.640
at Chris Elias, let me know.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.080
All right, so let's start with a semi-serious story

05:25.080 --> 05:27.480
that's not really getting a lot of discussion

05:27.480 --> 05:29.520
in any of the Jupiter broadcasting shows

05:29.520 --> 05:30.560
or any of our friends really,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.640
it's not really huge to those of us

05:32.640 --> 05:35.160
that are just daily desktop Linux users,

05:35.160 --> 05:36.240
but it's something that I think

05:36.240 --> 05:37.560
is worth making people aware of,

05:37.560 --> 05:39.800
and it's a seven-year-old Samba flaw

05:39.800 --> 05:42.340
that allows attackers to access

05:42.340 --> 05:44.080
thousands of Samba systems remotely.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.080
It's a CVE-2017-74-94, and it affects all versions of Samba

05:50.080 --> 05:52.680
that are newer than Samba 3.50,

05:52.680 --> 05:54.880
which was released in 2010.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.720
Ouch.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.220
Yeah, all versions onward are vulnerable

05:59.220 --> 06:01.400
to remote code execution vulnerability,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.960
allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library

06:03.960 --> 06:05.240
to a writable share,

06:05.240 --> 06:08.620
and then cause the server to load and execute it.

06:08.620 --> 06:12.000
Yep, pretty much exactly what you don't want to happen.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.200
Now, this story didn't get a ton of attention

06:14.200 --> 06:18.320
until WannaCry came along,

06:18.320 --> 06:19.300
and then everybody was like,

06:19.300 --> 06:22.920
well, if this could happen with WannaCry,

06:22.920 --> 06:26.200
maybe it could happen with SambaCry.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.000
It didn't take off, but they tried to make it SambaCry.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.800
They tried to, and you know, the thing is,

06:30.800 --> 06:32.120
is by the time we're hearing about this,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.200
the reality is that your distro

06:34.200 --> 06:35.520
has already sent out patches.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.080
So I was talking with some people who are like,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.080
people I know who are casual Linux users,

06:39.080 --> 06:41.680
and they'd had some problems with their work computers,

06:41.680 --> 06:43.000
and they'd been like told that,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.600
oh yeah, no, Linux is usually more secure,

06:44.600 --> 06:46.300
and they were kind of like asking me about this and this,

06:46.300 --> 06:47.480
and they'd heard about WannaCry,

06:47.480 --> 06:49.360
and so I was having to try to explain this,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.320
and it really struck me that like, yeah, you're right.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.040
You know, if you just like, the update thing,

06:53.040 --> 06:54.960
a bunch of you, update comes up, you hit update,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.920
you're probably gonna be fine,

06:56.920 --> 06:58.800
but really it seems like where this is gonna bite us

06:58.800 --> 07:01.800
is like everything in the Linux ecosystem

07:01.800 --> 07:03.960
is all of those embedded devices

07:03.960 --> 07:05.760
that will never, ever get patched,

07:05.760 --> 07:07.400
or if they do, how many people are ever going

07:07.400 --> 07:08.440
to actually update that firmware?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.320
Yep, and that's why I wanted to include it

07:10.320 --> 07:11.280
as a discussion piece,

07:11.280 --> 07:13.600
because I think that is the part that matters,

07:13.600 --> 07:17.080
is the reality is many of us probably have routers

07:17.080 --> 07:18.240
that have Samba built in,

07:18.240 --> 07:19.880
because we got a USB port, you can hook a USB.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.160
Exactly, yeah, there's a lot of those.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.040
Yeah, there's so much Samba out there in the wild.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.880
In fact, it's one of the little statistics

07:26.880 --> 07:28.240
that the Samba, I always shouldn't say little,

07:28.240 --> 07:30.040
I don't mean to demean it,

07:30.040 --> 07:32.200
it's one of the statistics that the Samba project

07:32.200 --> 07:34.720
is very proud of, is that Samba is one

07:34.720 --> 07:37.640
of the most widely deployed open source projects.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.640
DVRs use it, and some applications have Samba baked in.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.160
So the issue, the flaw, I guess,

07:46.160 --> 07:49.800
is really in the way Samba handled shared libraries.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.120
So the remote attacker could use

07:51.120 --> 07:54.320
the Samba arbitrary module loading vulnerability

07:54.320 --> 07:56.720
to upload a shared library to a writable share,

07:56.720 --> 07:59.600
and then cause the server to load the malicious code

07:59.600 --> 08:00.440
and run it.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.440
Just one line of code is required

08:04.440 --> 08:08.920
to execute malicious code on the affected system.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.000
And then, of course, when it's an open source thing,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.160
I mean, this happens with Windows,

08:13.160 --> 08:17.120
but it happens at a really kind of amazing rate

08:17.120 --> 08:18.360
with open source stuff.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.280
Metasploit and others already have created

08:21.280 --> 08:24.600
penetration testing frameworks to take advantage

08:24.600 --> 08:26.440
of this exploit. Of course.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.520
Just like within days, like just within days.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.840
I will say, that is kind of handy, though.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.140
I'm always, you know, whenever these comes out,

08:32.140 --> 08:34.880
sometimes it's not easy to be able to repro on your side.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.800
And I'm always kind of curious, you know, like,

08:36.800 --> 08:38.360
hey, is this like, am I vulnerable?

08:38.360 --> 08:39.200
How do I test that?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.460
So it's nice if you can get an easy to use framework

08:41.460 --> 08:42.660
and you're like, yep, I just hacked myself.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.960
All right, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.760
Samba's already issued patches,

08:47.760 --> 08:49.440
so that's sort of how this,

08:49.440 --> 08:51.600
the information doesn't get really released

08:51.600 --> 08:55.240
until the upstream projects have had a chance

08:55.240 --> 08:56.720
to look at the vulnerability and potentially come up

08:56.720 --> 08:58.480
with a fix, and they usually have a timeline.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.960
So you're saying we live in the age

08:59.960 --> 09:01.280
of responsible disclosure?

09:01.280 --> 09:03.880
I believe this is generally how it goes these days.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.620
Yeah, not always, and sometimes projects

09:05.620 --> 09:07.540
don't meet the timeline that they're given

09:07.540 --> 09:09.860
and it gets disclosed.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.760
That generally happens, though, more with Microsoft

09:11.760 --> 09:14.400
than it is with open source projects tend to get it,

09:14.400 --> 09:18.440
they tend to get it done in remarkable time, actually.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.500
But anyways, the issue isn't so much

09:20.500 --> 09:22.400
how fast the upstream project gets it done,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.520
it's actually the issue is how fast the distributions

09:24.520 --> 09:25.720
get it out the door.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.120
Or if you're using a distribution that's still maintained.

09:28.120 --> 09:33.120
So Samba has patched versions 4.64, 4.5.10, and 4.4.14.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.160
Now, you might notice that three dots

09:37.160 --> 09:38.880
are missing in that list,

09:38.880 --> 09:41.360
and so after a couple of days of discussion,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.000
Good Guy Samba decided to actually also,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.560
I kind of love those problems,

09:45.560 --> 09:48.320
Good Guy Samba also decided to release patches

09:48.320 --> 09:53.120
for Samba 3.0.37, 3.2.15, and 3.3.14.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.000
So even though they're no longer officially supported

09:56.000 --> 09:57.840
by the Samba team, they decided to release patches.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.680
That's really nice.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.520
They're clearly very busy,

09:59.520 --> 10:02.120
so if you appreciate the work they're doing here,

10:02.120 --> 10:03.880
maybe go help them redesign their website.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.640
Oh, man, yeah, you know,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.840
somebody who used to go to that Samba project,

10:08.840 --> 10:12.920
it's so funny, when you first get into this stuff,

10:12.920 --> 10:16.000
at least for me, when I didn't have any idea,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.240
I got, one of the ways I got into Linux

10:19.240 --> 10:20.280
was through the Samba project.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.960
Yeah, you're like, oh, suddenly I don't have to have

10:21.960 --> 10:23.640
this horrible Windows file server?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.480
Yeah, yeah, and we were, that's funny,

10:26.480 --> 10:28.160
you and I were just talking about remote profiles

10:28.160 --> 10:31.720
in the pre-show, we were hosting a bunch

10:31.720 --> 10:35.240
of terminal servers users' remote roaming profiles,

10:35.240 --> 10:37.280
which caused a ton of open connections

10:37.280 --> 10:39.280
to the NT4 server when users would log in.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.280
Right, anytime anyone logs in.

10:40.280 --> 10:45.280
Yeah, and so when you have 700 users logging in at once

10:45.280 --> 10:47.920
across 120 terminal servers,

10:47.920 --> 10:51.560
it causes a massive, massive issue,

10:51.560 --> 10:54.140
and Samba was capable of handling that load,

10:54.140 --> 10:57.000
NT4 and even Windows 2000 were not,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.620
and so I got in as a way to solve problems

11:00.620 --> 11:01.920
we were having, limits we were having

11:01.920 --> 11:04.880
with our Windows servers in many areas,

11:04.880 --> 11:08.120
in network proxying, but in storage,

11:08.120 --> 11:09.640
and Samba was part of that storage solution,

11:09.640 --> 11:12.760
so for me, obviously, the place to get the best

11:12.760 --> 11:15.840
documentation was gonna be Samba.org.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.680
Obviously, you go to Samba.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.520
Right from the source.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.160
And they did have great documentation for a long time,

11:19.160 --> 11:22.800
but it's so funny now, a decade later,

11:22.800 --> 11:25.520
no way in hell would I do that.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.440
I would go look up the documentation

11:27.440 --> 11:30.360
that was the most current, that was the most applicable.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.400
If it was Arch, I would go to the Arch Wiki.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.280
If it's Ubuntu, I would go whatever resources

11:34.280 --> 11:35.960
were Ubuntu-specific or Fedorae.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.280
I would go to a distro-specific outlet,

11:40.280 --> 11:42.560
and I would make sure that the date was relevant

11:42.560 --> 11:43.480
and all of this stuff.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.000
It's a totally different approach.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.720
Now understanding the complexities of the ecosystem

11:47.720 --> 11:50.520
that I would take, and so the Samba website,

11:50.520 --> 11:53.300
even back then, it really hasn't changed much.

11:53.300 --> 11:56.400
It was horrible back then, and it's still pretty awful.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.640
It's got a little better, but it's still pretty bad.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.480
Anyways, so go patch your Samba, guys.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.160
Don't be like a bunch of Windows XP users sitting around.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, it does affect Samba 4.3.11 XMM.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.620
Now, let's talk a little bit about the community

12:12.620 --> 12:13.560
for a second here.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.400
Oh.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.360
A few weeks ago, we talked about Caster Soundboard.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.800
I'm giving you updates on it.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.200
Caster Soundboard has been driving

12:20.200 --> 12:22.280
all of the sound effects in this week's show,

12:22.280 --> 12:25.520
and last week's as well, and all of the shows,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.660
and holy crap is it great.

12:27.660 --> 12:31.500
It is really something that,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.340
if you ever needed a soundboard for anything,

12:33.340 --> 12:34.760
for a presentation you're giving

12:34.760 --> 12:36.520
or for a podcast you're recording,

12:36.520 --> 12:37.800
holy shit is it great.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.580
And one of the things they've done

12:39.580 --> 12:42.080
is they've implemented remote control support,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.960
the open sound control protocol into Caster Soundboard,

12:44.960 --> 12:49.920
and so Oscar wrote this amazing how-to

12:49.920 --> 12:52.680
on how to remotely control the Caster Soundboard

12:52.680 --> 12:56.480
using an Android, or I think iOS,

12:56.480 --> 12:57.720
but using an Android device.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.120
Yeah, iOS too, yep.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.800
And really look at this thing.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.500
Like first of all, it's amazing you can do this,

13:04.500 --> 13:07.800
but second of all, the amount of work and passion

13:07.800 --> 13:10.920
that is going into this Caster Soundboard is.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.360
This is some documentation too.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.480
Like, not only just making the features, but then.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.000
It's super good documentation.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.700
Yes, I know, with really good layout,

13:18.700 --> 13:20.760
and screenshots, and structure,

13:20.760 --> 13:23.020
and easy to follow and understand,

13:23.020 --> 13:25.200
and JB references throughout.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.680
I just, I can't believe what I'm seeing here.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.880
And also the Python visualizer that we use

13:29.880 --> 13:32.120
for User Air and Linux Action News,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.080
also been getting some love from the community.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.520
Huge improvements coming.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.280
I've already heard from other podcasts

13:37.280 --> 13:38.840
that are thinking about trying it.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.820
It seems like a great tool for audio podcasts,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.160
it really does.

13:42.160 --> 13:46.200
It's so awesome that anything we can do,

13:46.200 --> 13:49.320
working with the OBS project, or doing projects like this

13:49.320 --> 13:52.480
to make media production under Linux better,

13:52.480 --> 13:54.520
just really excites me.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.040
And so to see the community just,

13:57.040 --> 13:59.400
like this, where we're at with Caster Soundboard

13:59.400 --> 14:01.320
would never have happened without the community.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.960
And now I really think that Linux podcasters,

14:03.960 --> 14:06.560
and other platforms, you can use it on other OSs too,

14:06.560 --> 14:08.480
are really gonna have an amazing tool going forward.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.880
And then to combine it with documentation like this.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.160
And the thing is, is like being able to control

14:13.160 --> 14:15.240
the soundboard from your remote system.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.200
Here he has an example of on a Galaxy Tab 4,

14:17.200 --> 14:19.560
like imagine you have like an old tablet sitting around.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.820
Wes could have a tablet there.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.840
We've talked about this before,

14:21.840 --> 14:23.560
but Wes could have a tablet there on the table

14:23.560 --> 14:24.920
and say he went to a conference.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.920
He could come back with a few sound clips loaded up,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.400
and you could kick him off as we're talking about it.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.360
Wouldn't have to do any post editing,

14:31.360 --> 14:32.840
or any, just have it right cued up.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.680
That would be amazing.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.520
Yeah, or if we're doing like a,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.760
if we're doing like a, more of like a morning zoo show

14:36.760 --> 14:38.040
where we had a lot of sound effects,

14:38.040 --> 14:39.240
you could have access to the board,

14:39.240 --> 14:41.080
I could have access to the board.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.320
It would really be cool.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.640
Anyways, thank you to Oscar for making that awesome write up

14:46.640 --> 14:47.920
and thank you to the whole community

14:47.920 --> 14:49.600
for working on the caster soundboard.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.320
You can get it at github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.040
Also, it's just great to see that repo grow,

14:56.040 --> 14:57.480
you know, the organization.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.520
Yeah, yeah, let's go look at some of the, let's go.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.360
Can we get to a.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.440
We talk a lot about open source on the network.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.320
So it's cool to see some open source stuff in the network.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.920
101 commits.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.760
Nice.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.920
Yeah, 13 contributors.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.880
That's actually awesome.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.000
How do you, okay, insights.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.840
Here we go.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.720
So let's get some graphs on it.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.000
What does that tell us?

15:16.000 --> 15:16.820
What does that tell us?

15:16.820 --> 15:17.660
Cause you know, it's all been,

15:17.660 --> 15:19.400
it's all been relatively recent, right?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.840
So, so let's take a look at some of these stats.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.360
So looking at just like at the last month

15:23.360 --> 15:27.200
from April 30th to May 30th, we've closed 20 issues,

15:27.200 --> 15:31.920
13 new issues, merged 25 poll requests.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.480
Gosh, look at these guys involved with this.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.720
This is so awesome.

15:34.720 --> 15:39.720
13 authors, 71 commits, 156 files, 12,980 additions,

15:41.280 --> 15:44.120
and 1,642 deletions.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.360
Thank you everybody who's been involved

15:45.360 --> 15:46.400
with Caster Soundboard.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.080
It is such a cool project.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.880
Thank you to Oscar for doing that right up.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.960
That looks, looks kind of amazing.

15:51.960 --> 15:52.800
It really does.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.240
It's pretty cool to see that, Wes.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.120
It's pretty cool.

15:55.120 --> 15:55.960
Also, I want to mention,

15:55.960 --> 15:57.040
speaking of community involvement,

15:57.040 --> 15:58.840
Linux Unplugged has a Reddit now.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.120
You can go to reddit.com slash R slash Linux Unplugged

16:02.120 --> 16:03.780
to submit stuff in here.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.960
I want to say thank you to Reg Gaster.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.160
I'll be talking about one of the things

16:08.160 --> 16:10.400
you submitted here in a little bit this week.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.880
Also, this is a cool one.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.740
Didn't really think it was worth putting in the show,

16:13.740 --> 16:16.740
but Chaotic Kernel submitted this GPS share utility,

16:16.740 --> 16:17.980
which is a utility that lets you share

16:17.980 --> 16:20.240
your GPS device location information

16:20.240 --> 16:22.920
over the local network, and it's written in Rust.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.120
So it replaces some cloud provider stuff

16:25.120 --> 16:27.880
if you just want to do like a small little GPS sharing thing.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.720
That's pretty neat.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.560
Mm-hmm.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.840
And you know we have a soft spot for Rust.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
That's right.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.080
Also, if you didn't know, like you know,

16:35.080 --> 16:37.300
say you're Popey and you haven't been here for a while,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.140
welcome back, Popey.

16:38.140 --> 16:38.960
It's good to see you.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.800
Welcome.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.620
Hello, sir.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.460
Hello, hello, hello.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.280
Hello.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.120
Hey, you smell great.

16:43.120 --> 16:43.960
Yeah.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.520
Thank you.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.560
I do, actually.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.400
I do.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.220
All confirmed.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.080
It's mostly IPA I smell like,

16:49.080 --> 16:50.680
but anyways, it does smell delicious.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.800
Popey, I know it's been a little while,

16:51.800 --> 16:53.520
so I didn't know, I don't know if you're aware,

16:53.520 --> 16:55.040
but we're almost episode 200.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.840
Good Lord.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.720
I know, I don't.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.600
It's shocking.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.040
Is that metric or imperial?

17:00.040 --> 17:02.800
No, no, I measured it with both systems,

17:02.800 --> 17:03.680
and it checks out.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.800
It actually checks out.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.960
It's the one number where the two systems converge.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.800
It's beautiful.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.140
I've actually constructed a lab

17:09.140 --> 17:10.800
where I'm watching the decay of an atom

17:10.800 --> 17:12.720
just to confirm, because I can't believe it,

17:12.720 --> 17:14.480
but so far it seems to check out.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.140
And as is proper style,

17:17.140 --> 17:19.220
I don't really have anything prepared for 200 itself,

17:19.220 --> 17:20.480
which is next week.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.880
Oh my God!

17:21.880 --> 17:22.720
Oh my God.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.760
So we don't really have anything planned.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.080
Except a great show, as usual.

17:26.080 --> 17:26.920
Yeah, of course.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.480
Duh.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.860
Come on, Chris.

17:29.860 --> 17:33.160
But what is coming up here soon is America's birthday.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.440
The greatest day in the world.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.360
Which we will be taking over and renaming.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.880
Deluxe Unplugged's birthday.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.760
So for the fourth.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.040
How old is America now?

17:42.760 --> 17:44.360
Hey Wes, Google that real quick.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.180
Hey, let's see.

17:45.180 --> 17:46.960
Alexa, how old is America?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.160
Let's see what she says.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.120
What'd she say?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.280
240 years old.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.120
Oh, she knows.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.320
And don't we look just fine for that?

17:56.320 --> 17:57.480
Okay, let's see if Siri knows.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.560
How old is America?

18:00.560 --> 18:03.720
Okay, I found this on the web for how old is America.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.680
Totally worthless.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.520
Oh my God.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.340
Way to go, Siri.

18:08.340 --> 18:09.520
I love how it starts being like,

18:09.520 --> 18:10.540
listen, I don't really know.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.560
So here's where I got it.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.400
You shouldn't trust me, but this is the thing.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.840
It's so couchy.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.100
It's so couchy.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.480
Yeah, can't wait to put that in a tube.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.720
That's gonna be a real successful product, Apple.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.000
Go ahead, put that in a tube.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.600
All right, so let's ask the Google Assistant

18:21.600 --> 18:22.640
just really quickly.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.960
Okay, Google.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.960
How old is America?

18:27.960 --> 18:32.240
United States of America was founded in 1776.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.080
Well, so she didn't really answer the-

18:33.080 --> 18:34.440
You're making me do the math here?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.260
Yeah, so the-

18:35.260 --> 18:36.100
Come on, Googs.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.240
So the Echo is the only one that successfully

18:38.240 --> 18:39.640
really answered the question.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.120
And also, did you notice though

18:41.120 --> 18:43.560
that they all allowed me to say America?

18:43.560 --> 18:45.400
They never, like none of them got confused.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.400
Well, actually, hold on, maybe that was.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.700
How old is the United States of America?

18:52.320 --> 18:54.040
Okay, I found this on the web.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.760
Nope, Siri's dumb either way, it doesn't matter.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.920
It doesn't, nope, Siri's just stupid.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.800
So anyways, for America's birthday,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
and for America's birthday,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.200
and for Linux Unplugs 200 episode,

19:04.200 --> 19:05.720
which will be 200-ish,

19:05.720 --> 19:07.040
we're gonna have a barbecue here in the studio.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.360
I've only heard from like three people

19:08.360 --> 19:09.200
that are gonna make it.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.120
So right now it's you, me, the beard,

19:12.120 --> 19:14.520
and three other people that are getting burgers and dogs.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.240
And maybe we should do like a chicken.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.400
Oh, Wes, you were gonna do ribs.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.240
Yeah.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.920
The Wes, gosh guys, if you want the Wes Payne ribs,

19:20.920 --> 19:22.120
you should probably come to the studio.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.160
That's true.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.040
I mean, we can do other things too, I'm open to ideas.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.440
I just wanted, I thought we needed

19:26.440 --> 19:30.000
some sort of non-standard grill item, something special.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.160
Yeah, yeah, so if you're gonna make it,

19:32.160 --> 19:33.480
let me know, at ChrisLAS,

19:33.480 --> 19:36.980
or, this is where I was building,

19:36.980 --> 19:40.240
join our new official Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
It's official now.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.080
It is.

19:42.080 --> 19:42.900
Are you in there?

19:42.900 --> 19:43.740
You're in there, aren't you?

19:43.740 --> 19:45.600
Yeah, it's pretty crazy these days.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.440
It is pretty crazy.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.400
But it's crazy like in a good way.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.240
It's like when Twitter was good.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.560
I'm still kinda trying to figure out

19:50.560 --> 19:52.880
exactly how to use a Telegram group, you know?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.440
I use it like I use Twitter.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.280
I really do.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.100
You should ask, you should ask.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.200
It's like somewhere between Twitter and IRC and.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.740
Bit.ly, bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.280
Bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.520
Wimpy, you're in a few groups.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.200
How do you manage all of that?

20:10.840 --> 20:12.280
Well, the first thing you do is,

20:12.280 --> 20:15.040
every time you join a group, you mute notifications.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.520
Yeah, absolutely, yes.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.120
And yeah, I don't know how to use Twitter,

20:19.120 --> 20:20.600
but I think what you're driving at

20:20.600 --> 20:21.980
is how I should use Twitter,

20:21.980 --> 20:24.220
which is you don't read everything.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.580
Obviously, you read everything

20:25.580 --> 20:27.120
in the Ubuntu Podcast Telegram group.

20:27.120 --> 20:27.960
Obviously.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.840
Because it's all excellent content.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.600
But the other groups, you read what you can see

20:32.600 --> 20:33.620
whilst you're in there,

20:33.620 --> 20:35.420
and then when you wake up in the morning,

20:35.420 --> 20:40.420
you just fly by the 500 notifications that you've missed.

20:40.420 --> 20:41.260
Yeah, yeah.

20:41.260 --> 20:43.200
And that's sort of, I dip in.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.680
It's like a river, and I dip in for a swim,

20:45.680 --> 20:47.400
and then I dip out.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.160
And pinned messages can be nice.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.000
Yes, that's true.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.400
So, Popey, what happened when you asked Mycroft

20:52.400 --> 20:53.800
how old America is?

20:54.840 --> 20:55.680
Should we find out?

20:55.680 --> 20:57.280
Yeah, yeah, oh yes, yes.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.640
Mycroft, how old is America?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.320
Not as old as England, so it doesn't matter.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.760
That is pretty much on point.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.040
All right, good, very good, thank you.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.840
Yeah, Mycroft makes a good point.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.120
This weekend, the village I lived in

21:16.120 --> 21:20.440
celebrated our 900th birthday.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.440
Wow.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.280
Now listen.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.120
Yeah.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.160
And you don't look a day over 799.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.420
We've got some old trees in my neck of the woods.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.260
Does that count?

21:29.260 --> 21:33.180
Can I, no, no, no, it doesn't, does it?

21:33.180 --> 21:34.620
Well, very good.

21:34.620 --> 21:38.240
Bit.ly slash jbtelegram.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.260
Oh my gosh, guys, there's so many things

21:40.260 --> 21:42.000
I wanna talk about today.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.720
Let's mention real quickly before we go crazy.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.640
Wimpy, how do you feel about talking,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.920
teasing a little bit about your recent shenanigans

21:49.920 --> 21:51.320
with eGPU testing?

21:51.320 --> 21:54.340
Are you ready or do you wanna save it for a little longer?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.360
I can tease some stuff.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.960
Yeah, do, okay, so hold on a second.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.560
Let me do a little teasing here.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.080
Let me tease DigitalOcean.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.660
DigitalOcean.com, go over there,

22:04.660 --> 22:07.940
create your account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.280
It's one word, it's lowercase, it's easy,

22:10.280 --> 22:12.120
you put it together, you smoosh it together,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.640
you create the account, and you get a $10 credit

22:14.640 --> 22:16.320
when you apply DOUNPLUGGED.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.040
Now, once you've got the account set up,

22:19.040 --> 22:21.620
I'm not gonna tell you how to do your business.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.680
But if I were you, if I were you,

22:27.040 --> 22:28.480
take a couple of things we've talked about

22:28.480 --> 22:30.660
and just say the last two weeks on this show.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
Just take what your favorite one

22:32.660 --> 22:34.540
and try it out on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

22:34.540 --> 22:37.600
It's so fast, it's so easy to use.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.680
The interface is super simple.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.380
The SSD storage is lightning fast.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.300
Faster than lightning.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.380
I don't even know how fast it is, it's too fast.

22:47.380 --> 22:48.340
I'm making pew-pew, right?

22:48.340 --> 22:50.380
I'm making pew-pew, it's like pew-pew fast,

22:50.380 --> 22:51.220
that's how fast it is.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.460
Presidentially fast.

22:52.460 --> 22:53.900
I don't really know what that means.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.100
I don't know what that means either.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.420
That's how fast it is.

22:56.420 --> 22:59.060
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.880
They have an API that's really easy to integrate

23:00.880 --> 23:03.740
with desktop applets for your Linux desktop

23:03.740 --> 23:06.980
or for Android applications or your own code.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.820
I really like it for that.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.280
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.260
Earlier, you were talking about how

23:12.260 --> 23:14.180
you wouldn't really go to the Samba website.

23:14.180 --> 23:15.660
And you were like, I'd go to some distro,

23:15.660 --> 23:16.480
I'd go to the Arch Wiki.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.780
I think you were just trying to be polite though,

23:17.780 --> 23:19.640
because in reality, you would go check out

23:19.640 --> 23:20.940
the DigitalOcean documentation.

23:20.940 --> 23:21.780
I sure would.

23:21.780 --> 23:25.820
In fact, check out this post from May 26th.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.980
How to use GPG encryption in signed messages.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.260
This is an example of a DigitalOcean how-to

23:32.260 --> 23:34.940
that crushes it, because it's not necessarily

23:34.940 --> 23:36.600
specific to DigitalOcean.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.380
I don't mean to tell them something

23:38.380 --> 23:39.600
that maybe they're not aware of,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.060
but guys, I could read this and use this anywhere.

23:43.060 --> 23:44.260
But go over there, check it out.

23:44.260 --> 23:47.440
It's a great guide on how to use GPG on Linux.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.340
It's not even, look at this, look at this.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.540
It's not even distro-specific.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.140
This guide works for Ubuntu, Debian,

23:55.140 --> 23:56.620
CentOS, and Fedora.

23:57.620 --> 23:58.460
Fedora.

23:59.740 --> 24:00.580
Fedora.

24:00.580 --> 24:01.400
Fedora?

24:01.400 --> 24:02.240
Fedora, is that how you say it?

24:02.240 --> 24:03.620
I'm not sure.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.200
You know, if Matthew ever stopped by the show,

24:06.200 --> 24:07.040
he might remember.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.080
Oh yeah, he could tell us.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.220
Anyways, go over to DigitalOcean.com.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.300
They got great tutorials.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.460
They have a really great dashboard.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.860
They have a service that's super, super nice.

24:15.860 --> 24:17.360
Not only do you get up and going in no time,

24:17.360 --> 24:18.720
which is what they like to emphasize,

24:18.720 --> 24:19.740
but the pricing's amazing,

24:19.740 --> 24:21.580
because they have $5 rigs a month,

24:21.580 --> 24:23.000
they have hourly pricing,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.160
they have a bunch of different distros

24:24.160 --> 24:25.000
you can choose from,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.220
and one of my favorite features

24:26.220 --> 24:27.920
is they have an HTML5 console

24:27.920 --> 24:29.340
that works on everything from your tablet

24:29.340 --> 24:30.460
to your Linux desktop,

24:30.460 --> 24:32.020
and there's a lot of stuff you can do

24:32.020 --> 24:33.600
when you get access to that console.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.780
A lot of stuff you can do.

24:34.780 --> 24:36.780
DigitalOcean.com, you go over there,

24:36.780 --> 24:38.260
take advantage of all of that stuff.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.220
Plus, if you're in a team, they support that.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.580
40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors,

24:42.580 --> 24:43.860
highly available block storage

24:43.860 --> 24:45.660
when you need to grow your rig,

24:45.660 --> 24:48.900
monitoring, alerting, when you wanna look like a boss

24:48.900 --> 24:51.140
and know about things before your clients even do.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.200
DigitalOcean.com.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.500
Playing around or putting it in production.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.260
Try it out and just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.260
And thank you to DigitalOcean

25:00.260 --> 25:02.280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.220
So Wes, one of the things that I'm thinking

25:05.220 --> 25:06.940
more and more about these days

25:06.940 --> 25:11.580
is a future where I buy a really light and thin laptop

25:11.580 --> 25:14.520
that is using an embedded Intel GPU.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.360
Right.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.980
That is supported under Wayland really well.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.020
And mind you, I'm thinking about this, too, as like.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.580
Because you wanna run Trisco, right?

25:21.580 --> 25:22.880
That's the motivation here.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.740
I wanna run Wayland is what I wanna run.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.180
And I want it to run smoothly.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.740
And I'm really trying to think about

25:27.740 --> 25:28.760
how to do this in the future

25:28.760 --> 25:29.840
where maybe I'm taking a rig

25:29.840 --> 25:32.180
between the studio and the RV a lot.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.940
And one of the things that's jumped out at me

25:33.940 --> 25:38.140
is if we could really nail external GPUs right,

25:38.140 --> 25:40.820
so I could have a laptop that is thin, light, and portable,

25:40.820 --> 25:41.640
but when I need to edit

25:41.640 --> 25:43.700
or I wanna play video games from time to time,

25:43.700 --> 25:47.700
I can buy a box that's a PCI3, like Thunderbolt,

25:47.700 --> 25:49.580
or what, a Thunderbolt 3, that's what it is.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.660
Thunderbolt 3 connected device.

25:51.660 --> 25:53.480
You put a GPU in there.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.060
Then I could hook it up to a laptop.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.380
I could have a lot more horsepower.

25:56.380 --> 26:00.220
But beyond that, I could take this one video card

26:00.220 --> 26:03.140
that I spent all my monies on, this one video card,

26:03.140 --> 26:05.580
and I could move it between my laptop

26:05.580 --> 26:07.860
or a desktop that has Thunderbolt 3

26:07.860 --> 26:10.940
or another laptop or your laptop.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.020
And it's like you invest once in a great graphics card

26:14.020 --> 26:17.620
and then the three or four times a month that I need it,

26:17.620 --> 26:19.900
I've got a plug-in go-to graphics card.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.220
And all the other time,

26:21.220 --> 26:23.700
I've got a super portable, lightweight,

26:23.700 --> 26:25.740
great battery life laptop.

26:25.740 --> 26:28.340
So Wimpy stopped by that official bit.ly

26:28.340 --> 26:31.060
slash JB Telegram group the other day

26:31.060 --> 26:33.660
and was teasing me with a little information

26:33.660 --> 26:34.580
that he's gleaned.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.020
So you've been doing some testing, Wimpy,

26:36.020 --> 26:39.020
on eGPUs, external GPUs, over what,

26:39.020 --> 26:42.820
like Thunderbolt 3 USB-C style connections?

26:42.820 --> 26:44.100
That's right, yeah.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.680
So I've got a Razer Core,

26:46.680 --> 26:51.680
which is the box of tricks that is the external enclosure.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.900
And I've got an Nvidia card in that.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.700
And I've been putting it through its paces

26:58.700 --> 27:01.940
on a number of computers I have

27:01.940 --> 27:04.380
that are Thunderbolt 3 enabled

27:04.380 --> 27:08.740
to see does it work and how well it works.

27:08.740 --> 27:13.740
And this is on modern Linux, like version what?

27:15.420 --> 27:19.900
Well, I've tested Ubuntu 16.04 and upwards.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.460
Okay, so stuff that's easily available.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.360
So like I don't have to be running

27:23.360 --> 27:25.860
some crazy development version of Linux

27:25.860 --> 27:27.520
to get support for this.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.300
No, you can, so in the Ubuntu world,

27:30.300 --> 27:34.420
you will need Ubuntu 16.04.2,

27:35.900 --> 27:40.100
which comes pre-shipped with the hardware enablement stack.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.140
Ah, okay, okay.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.940
And if you don't have,

27:42.940 --> 27:47.940
if you've just upgraded from.0 or.1 of 16.04,

27:48.060 --> 27:51.420
then you have to enable the hardware enablement stack

27:51.420 --> 27:53.580
and that will do the good stuff that you need.

27:53.580 --> 27:56.860
So there must be a downside, right?

27:56.860 --> 27:59.980
I mean, there must be a downside to having an external GPU.

27:59.980 --> 28:03.040
There must be something that is inconvenient about it

28:03.040 --> 28:05.860
other than, I mean, I'm just trying to fathom,

28:05.860 --> 28:08.700
like what would be, I imagine you can't hot swap it, right?

28:08.700 --> 28:10.300
So you can't just be running an X session

28:10.300 --> 28:11.220
and going about your business

28:11.220 --> 28:13.020
and just connect this thing to your computer

28:13.020 --> 28:15.540
and all of a sudden be connected to your eGPU, right?

28:15.540 --> 28:16.500
Yeah, you can do that.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.060
You can hot plug the GPU.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.100
No, see, the folks at Dell told me

28:20.100 --> 28:21.660
that wasn't a possibility.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.340
Well, you can do it under Windows.

28:23.340 --> 28:27.100
It's built into, well, in Windows with additional drivers

28:27.100 --> 28:29.220
on the Razer laptops, it's doable.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.060
You can hot plug the GPU.

28:32.060 --> 28:34.260
And if you know the right incantations,

28:34.260 --> 28:36.380
you can then bring that GPU up

28:36.380 --> 28:38.020
without having to do anything.

28:38.020 --> 28:43.020
The best route that I've got is you can hot plug it,

28:43.500 --> 28:48.460
then use Nvidia settings to switch to that GPU.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.040
And then you have to log out and log back in.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.140
And that's like the safest way

28:53.140 --> 28:54.500
to handle it.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.100
That's not so bad.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.500
So you don't need to do a full reboot.

28:57.500 --> 29:01.860
You can, you know, log out, log in, so that works.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.260
Now, Bash, you had a question in the mobile room.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.100
Go ahead.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.340
I think it was about cost.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.280
Mostly just bringing out,

29:09.280 --> 29:11.820
you were talking about some of the downsides.

29:11.820 --> 29:14.020
I was mostly just talking about cost of them.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.860
Yeah, cause it's like a $500 box.

29:15.860 --> 29:17.380
US greenbacks, right Wimpy?

29:17.380 --> 29:23.220
Yeah, yeah, the Razer Core itself was 499 pounds.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.220
And then you've obviously got to put the GPU

29:25.220 --> 29:26.300
in that as well.

29:27.180 --> 29:28.780
So yes, expensive.

29:28.780 --> 29:32.460
Or, you know, the way that I did this was with Bitcoin.

29:32.460 --> 29:36.420
So the combined cost of the core and the card

29:36.420 --> 29:38.180
was half a Bitcoin.

29:38.180 --> 29:39.420
Yeah, yeah.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.260
And it's crazy to think that you can get something

29:42.260 --> 29:44.780
as expensive of that for a fraction of a Bitcoin now.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.220
It's just mental.

29:46.220 --> 29:47.780
Yeah, I mean, it looks like it's well built.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.460
I mean, it looks like it's a good metal body.

29:49.460 --> 29:52.260
It looks like it's like a solid piece of equipment.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.140
Does it feel good?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.180
The Razer Core is extremely well constructed.

29:56.180 --> 29:58.460
Integrated power supply?

29:58.460 --> 30:01.140
Yeah, it's a 500 watt integrated power supply.

30:02.260 --> 30:08.100
It's got fancy glowy, glowy lights and all of that carry on.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.740
I'm not into all of that, but if you like your things

30:10.740 --> 30:13.300
flashing and blinking at you, you can do all of that.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.100
Is it loud?

30:16.100 --> 30:17.620
No, not really.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.180
When it's just in general use, it's barely audible.

30:20.180 --> 30:23.420
If you're playing a game, then yes, the fans kick up.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.900
I think you can negate that to some extent

30:26.900 --> 30:31.020
by buying graphics cards with different cooling strategies

30:31.020 --> 30:33.300
and what have you on them.

30:33.300 --> 30:37.700
But maybe that's a downside for some.

30:37.700 --> 30:41.820
My experience is that any gaming PC that's competent

30:41.820 --> 30:44.020
makes some degree of fan noise.

30:44.020 --> 30:47.020
So have you been able to accomplish my dream world

30:47.020 --> 30:50.540
of having several machines that have this Thunderbolt 3

30:50.540 --> 30:55.260
connection and essentially have one great GPU

30:55.260 --> 30:57.540
that you can move between them?

30:57.540 --> 30:58.940
That's exactly what I've got.

30:58.940 --> 31:03.540
So I've now got a hot stinking GPU

31:03.540 --> 31:06.900
that I can move between four devices at will.

31:06.900 --> 31:10.620
Wow, and it just works under Linux fairly well.

31:10.620 --> 31:14.220
Yeah, there's one caveat, which is right now

31:14.220 --> 31:17.580
in the Linux kernel, it doesn't support

31:17.580 --> 31:20.740
the Thunderbolt security profiles.

31:20.740 --> 31:24.500
So consequently, it will only work on a computer

31:24.500 --> 31:28.740
where you can disable the Thunderbolt security model

31:28.740 --> 31:32.020
or enable what's known as legacy mode.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.380
Once you've done that, it works.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.380
But as I was doing some research,

31:37.380 --> 31:40.580
there's fixes coming for that fairly soon in Linux.

31:40.580 --> 31:42.500
So you can actually keep that enabled

31:42.500 --> 31:43.980
in something that you want enabled, right?

31:43.980 --> 31:45.580
Because this is a device you're plugging

31:45.580 --> 31:47.460
into the bus of your computer.

31:47.460 --> 31:51.140
And that's a BIOS, so you have to have a BIOS.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.020
It's a BIOS setting at the moment.

31:53.020 --> 31:57.300
So I've got three laptops that supported that in the BIOS

31:57.300 --> 31:58.460
and one that doesn't.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.980
So I've got one laptop that's got Thunderbolt port

32:00.980 --> 32:02.980
where you've seen it, it's that HP Spectre.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.820
It's got Thunderbolt ports coming out the Wazoo,

32:05.820 --> 32:07.420
but I can't use this device on it

32:07.420 --> 32:08.740
because Linux just doesn't see it.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.460
Well, it sees it, but it doesn't know how to manage it.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.020
So when those new kernel patches drop,

32:14.020 --> 32:16.900
I shall be testing that with interest.

32:18.380 --> 32:21.220
But the performance games are considerable.

32:21.220 --> 32:23.900
You know, like significant.

32:23.900 --> 32:28.340
So I've got an intro where Athena,

32:28.340 --> 32:33.100
which has got a GTX 980M in it.

32:33.100 --> 32:36.780
And if you're familiar, there's a Unigine

32:36.780 --> 32:40.980
have got a new benchmark tool called Superposition.

32:40.980 --> 32:44.220
And this was recommended to me by Pedro Matos

32:44.220 --> 32:47.020
from Linux Gamecast, because by and large,

32:47.020 --> 32:50.700
this tests the GPU performance

32:50.700 --> 32:53.420
rather than taxing the CPU overly.

32:53.420 --> 32:57.220
So you get a fairly fair comparison of the GPU performance.

32:57.220 --> 32:58.500
I know there are other factors,

32:58.500 --> 33:00.420
but as best as you can manage,

33:00.420 --> 33:03.540
this is a good reflection of GPU performance.

33:03.540 --> 33:07.100
So that 980M can run the Superposition benchmark,

33:07.100 --> 33:11.220
which the default settings are medium 1080p,

33:11.220 --> 33:15.700
and it can conk out a consistent 45 frames per second.

33:16.580 --> 33:21.380
And then when I stick my Razer Core

33:21.380 --> 33:25.340
into the various laptops, that goes up to,

33:25.340 --> 33:27.740
well, on the least performing device

33:27.740 --> 33:30.700
at 80 frames per second and the highest performing

33:30.700 --> 33:33.300
at 107 frames per second.

33:33.300 --> 33:37.860
And this is a really graphical intensive benchmark.

33:37.860 --> 33:42.860
And the gaming for Linux community,

33:42.860 --> 33:46.420
gaming on Linux, they have a benchmark forum.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.980
And in there, they're currently running a,

33:48.980 --> 33:53.980
run the ultra test using Unigine Superposition

33:54.540 --> 33:56.660
and post your benchmarks.

33:56.660 --> 34:01.220
And one of my systems with the Razer Core attached

34:01.220 --> 34:03.460
is the number two placed.

34:03.460 --> 34:04.300
Wow.

34:04.300 --> 34:07.340
Box in that list and top placed.

34:07.340 --> 34:08.580
What was the host system?

34:09.620 --> 34:10.460
Mine.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.060
It was the Entraware host system?

34:12.060 --> 34:14.540
No, my one was a Skull Canyon NUC

34:14.540 --> 34:16.180
with the Razer Core. A NUC, a NUC.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.180
Yeah. Ooh.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.580
Yeah.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.300
I do want one of those, those look sweet.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.220
So you hooked it up, you hooked this eGPU up to a NUC

34:23.220 --> 34:26.660
and you ranked number two in the benchmarking positions

34:26.660 --> 34:27.500
on Linux gaming.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.380
Yeah, uncomfortably number two.

34:29.380 --> 34:33.260
So this has got a 1080Ti, this Razer Core.

34:33.260 --> 34:36.460
And the number one position that it's behind

34:36.460 --> 34:41.460
is a Ryzen 1700 with an 1080Ti on a 16X bus.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.540
And I'm only just slightly behind.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.380
Wow.

34:46.380 --> 34:49.420
So it shifts some data, yeah.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.780
So we've defined good enough.

34:51.780 --> 34:55.140
Well, to me it suggests that perhaps, hmm.

34:55.140 --> 34:56.820
So you're telling me that these, yeah,

34:56.820 --> 34:59.060
cause you're comparing this to machines that have,

34:59.060 --> 35:01.500
you are comparing this to other systems

35:01.500 --> 35:03.700
that have these video cards snapped

35:03.700 --> 35:06.540
into like a 16X PCI slot.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.380
Yeah, yeah.

35:07.380 --> 35:11.260
And my Skull Canyon is four PCI lanes

35:11.260 --> 35:14.060
are exposed over the Thunderbolt port,

35:14.060 --> 35:17.060
but they're shared with the NVMe drive

35:17.060 --> 35:18.940
and several other components on the board.

35:18.940 --> 35:22.180
So it's not dedicated for lanes by any means,

35:23.140 --> 35:25.140
but it's still right up there.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.580
Wow.

35:27.580 --> 35:30.860
Well, will we hear more on the Ubuntu podcast?

35:30.860 --> 35:34.540
Yes, on Thursday this week, Ubuntu podcast is out

35:34.540 --> 35:36.700
and we discuss this at the top of the show.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.860
Ah, attaboy.

35:38.860 --> 35:39.780
I'm looking forward to it.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.620
Me too.

35:40.620 --> 35:41.460
I'm looking forward to it.

35:41.460 --> 35:46.220
I will follow this topic with much interest

35:46.220 --> 35:47.740
because it seems like it could unlock

35:47.740 --> 35:50.700
both portability and a lot of power.

35:50.700 --> 35:51.660
I'm very excited.

35:51.660 --> 35:53.180
Mr. Popey, it's good to have you back.

35:53.180 --> 35:57.580
I noticed recently you've been tweeting away these days

35:57.580 --> 36:02.420
and I followed the story you were, where was it?

36:02.420 --> 36:03.260
Where was it?

36:03.260 --> 36:05.420
Hold on, wait for it, wait for it.

36:05.420 --> 36:09.340
What to expect and not to expect from Linux Universal Packages

36:09.340 --> 36:11.580
which is the next story in the show.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.420
So I kind of wanted to get your thoughts

36:13.420 --> 36:16.660
on the state of Universal Packages and whatnot.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.660
What do you think, Popey?

36:17.660 --> 36:18.500
Uh-oh.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.740
This post from The New Stack

36:20.740 --> 36:22.780
that I think you tweeted a few days ago, if I remember.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.100
I can't, I can't, that's how it showed up in my list.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.480
Yeah.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.320
What was your takeaway?

36:27.320 --> 36:32.320
Yeah, so it's Bruce Bifield who spoke to a bunch of people

36:32.620 --> 36:34.980
who are involved in these new packaging systems.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.540
Yeah, so look at Bruce.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.020
You know, Bruce should come on this show too.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.300
Yeah, that would be awesome.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.180
That would be really good.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.540
Okay, anyway, sorry.

36:41.540 --> 36:46.460
He spoke to us about snaps and he spoke to people

36:46.460 --> 36:51.020
from the Flatpak project and AppImage

36:51.020 --> 36:54.320
and also people from traditional distros

36:54.320 --> 36:57.100
like our good friend Richard from OpenSUSE

36:57.100 --> 37:01.300
to get everyone's hot take on what the new packaging formats

37:01.300 --> 37:03.620
mean for Linux desktop.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.580
And yeah, I think it's fairly fair and balanced

37:06.580 --> 37:09.460
and covers everyone's perspective.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.860
I don't think everyone agrees on this,

37:10.860 --> 37:12.820
but yeah, I think it's pretty fair.

37:12.820 --> 37:14.860
Yeah, and Wes and I were just chatting recently

37:14.860 --> 37:18.820
as in like 45 minutes ago about Visual Studio Code

37:18.820 --> 37:20.660
just recently announced that they have a snap available.

37:20.660 --> 37:21.500
Right.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.340
That's pretty cool.

37:22.340 --> 37:26.980
And I also saw like a Qt-based Flatpak manager

37:26.980 --> 37:27.940
that people are working on.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.600
It's like a graphical Qt-based Flatpak manager.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.060
So the Universal Package March,

37:32.060 --> 37:33.820
even though we're not talking about it as much these days,

37:33.820 --> 37:36.340
is continuing, it continues on.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.940
So yeah, check out the new stack.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.800
Although, I mean, people mention it as wars,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.980
but I really don't think the people who work on it

37:43.980 --> 37:46.580
see it as war as such.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.420
Yeah, okay.

37:47.420 --> 37:49.060
I think we're all working on our own thing,

37:49.060 --> 37:52.860
but the Flatpak developers are working on a great way

37:52.860 --> 37:55.740
to deliver the GNOME experience and GNOME applications

37:55.740 --> 37:57.700
to their users and tailoring it specifically

37:57.700 --> 37:58.900
for their needs.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.780
AppImage developers are working on their system

38:01.780 --> 38:04.780
for making sure that it's super easy for people

38:04.780 --> 38:06.900
to just download a file and then run it

38:06.900 --> 38:08.660
and get the application.

38:08.660 --> 38:11.620
And we're working on our unique selling points

38:11.620 --> 38:13.820
that make ours slightly different.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.700
So I think they've all got their own selling points

38:15.700 --> 38:16.540
and they're all slightly different.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.380
I don't think we're all really seeing each other as war.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.580
I think you're underselling Snap's competitive advantage

38:22.580 --> 38:23.520
in this space.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.800
So I would phrase it as this.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.960
Flatpaks are a reinvention of PPAs that nobody needs

38:30.960 --> 38:32.820
and ain't nobody got time for that.

38:32.820 --> 38:35.100
AppImage is what's already being done on Mac OS

38:35.100 --> 38:37.100
and then developers have to create things like Sparkle,

38:37.100 --> 38:39.180
which are their backassword workarounds

38:39.180 --> 38:41.340
to get users to update their applications

38:41.340 --> 38:43.380
after they've already been dropped onto their file system.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.540
And Snap package brings us sort of the best of both worlds

38:46.540 --> 38:48.880
where we can have a centralized store and an index

38:48.880 --> 38:51.760
where it's easy for users to search, it's easy to install.

38:51.760 --> 38:55.060
And on top of that, it's particularly well suited

38:55.060 --> 38:58.180
for not only server side, but graphical applications.

38:58.180 --> 39:01.540
So in my opinion, if one of them could win out,

39:01.540 --> 39:03.980
I would absolutely want it to be Snaps

39:03.980 --> 39:05.580
based on all lessons we've learned

39:05.580 --> 39:07.040
from all other operating systems

39:07.040 --> 39:09.160
and things we've tried on Linux before.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.920
After that, I'd want it to be AppImage

39:10.920 --> 39:12.180
because at the end of the day,

39:12.180 --> 39:13.820
I just want the damn application.

39:13.820 --> 39:16.340
And then the very number three on my list

39:16.340 --> 39:20.460
would be Flatpaks because honestly, I think PPAs suck.

39:20.460 --> 39:24.340
Beside outside of a limited scope for testing applications,

39:24.340 --> 39:27.820
for users to maybe like beta test applications

39:27.820 --> 39:30.200
before they're put in the repo or something like that,

39:30.200 --> 39:31.160
PPAs are fine.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.780
But as a way to distribute software to everybody

39:32.780 --> 39:35.780
in the world and then have random people who have lives

39:35.780 --> 39:37.180
and they maybe have children and a job

39:37.180 --> 39:39.100
to then maintain a repo, it's ridiculous.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.520
And Flatpaks don't seem to solve

39:40.520 --> 39:42.220
that particular problem at all.

39:42.220 --> 39:46.060
And Snaps do, and also AppImages do.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.260
Out of any of them though,

39:47.260 --> 39:49.100
if any of them take off, I'd be happy.

39:49.100 --> 39:52.380
I would be satisfied if any of them are successful.

39:52.380 --> 39:55.300
It just seems to me that right now,

39:55.300 --> 39:58.140
things have slowed to a crawl.

39:58.140 --> 40:01.180
And I don't know what exactly I was expecting,

40:01.180 --> 40:02.020
but I was-

40:02.020 --> 40:02.840
Has slowed in what way?

40:02.840 --> 40:07.240
I mean, we spend all our days talking to developers

40:07.240 --> 40:08.080
about what they want.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.900
So like, we developed Snappy and SnapCraft,

40:12.900 --> 40:16.100
and we think we know what developers need,

40:16.100 --> 40:19.980
but because we are essentially a company full of engineers,

40:19.980 --> 40:23.920
but we speak to developers who create things

40:23.920 --> 40:25.720
in new and interesting and different ways.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.460
And these can be proprietary software vendors

40:28.460 --> 40:30.880
who just want to get their code out there to Linux users,

40:30.880 --> 40:33.920
or they could be open source software developers,

40:33.920 --> 40:35.740
or they could be proprietary companies

40:35.740 --> 40:37.180
who are making open source software

40:37.180 --> 40:39.340
like Microsoft with Visual Studio Code.

40:39.340 --> 40:42.620
And some of those people have very specific requirements.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.080
So what we're doing is spending time listening to them

40:45.080 --> 40:46.860
to find out what it is they want.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.580
I'll tell you what I was, I'll tell you,

40:48.580 --> 40:50.660
the only way I can answer your question is tell,

40:50.660 --> 40:55.660
I can tell you what I was hoping for by about now-ish was,

40:56.840 --> 41:00.820
so say Visual Studio Code is announced as a Snap package.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.500
Hooray, that's great.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.060
You go to download Visual Studio Code for Linux

41:05.060 --> 41:07.220
and nowhere on their website

41:07.220 --> 41:10.020
does it mention that as a possibility.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.660
It's not a download link.

41:11.660 --> 41:13.500
It's not like, hey, by the way,

41:13.500 --> 41:16.180
if you're a Snap package user,

41:16.180 --> 41:18.060
they've obviously, they can't be bothered

41:18.060 --> 41:18.900
to update their website.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.140
You're talking about the marketing level and the...

41:20.140 --> 41:22.940
Well, I'm sorry, so let's just do a little less.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.000
So let's just Visual Studio Code.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.740
So you want to go get Visual Studio Code.

41:26.740 --> 41:29.500
Let's just say you want to get Visual Studio Code for Linux.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
So I'm gonna Google search Visual Studio Code for Linux.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
I would imagine this is how most people would find this.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.460
And then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna,

41:35.460 --> 41:37.140
well, boy, that's not the right link.

41:37.140 --> 41:38.100
The first link's no good.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.500
The second link's what you want.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.900
It's code.visualstudio.com slash download.

41:41.900 --> 41:42.940
And then when you go to that,

41:42.940 --> 41:45.020
I don't know why it's not loading,

41:45.020 --> 41:47.620
but when you go to that, they have devs and they have RPMs.

41:47.620 --> 41:48.840
You can download and things like that,

41:48.840 --> 41:50.260
but they don't have a Snap package

41:50.260 --> 41:52.020
or they don't have a link.

41:52.020 --> 41:53.580
I understand.

41:53.580 --> 41:54.660
And that was the benchmark

41:54.660 --> 41:56.460
I was hoping we would be at by now.

41:56.460 --> 41:58.140
And that really depends on the developer

41:58.140 --> 42:00.980
because some developers have embraced it fully

42:00.980 --> 42:03.260
and some, I could point you at a website

42:03.260 --> 42:05.340
where you go to download the application

42:05.340 --> 42:07.580
and the first thing it says is go and get the Snap

42:07.580 --> 42:09.720
rather than here's Windows, here's Mac,

42:09.720 --> 42:11.300
and Linux, and oh, by the way, there's a Snap.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.220
So it really depends on the developer.

42:13.220 --> 42:15.360
And some of them are at an early stage.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.380
So Visual Studio Code only recently landed in the store.

42:18.380 --> 42:21.920
And you think about the size of the company

42:21.920 --> 42:23.700
behind Visual Studio Code,

42:23.700 --> 42:25.260
these companies don't move super fast.

42:25.260 --> 42:27.580
Whereas little agile developers

42:27.580 --> 42:29.280
who throw their code on GitHub

42:29.280 --> 42:31.140
and just wanna get it out there,

42:31.140 --> 42:33.540
they will accept a pull request that says,

42:33.540 --> 42:34.660
here's how you install a Snap

42:34.660 --> 42:36.340
and you can just provide a pull request

42:36.340 --> 42:37.580
and fix it for them.

42:37.580 --> 42:39.340
Like cost a soundboard, for example.

42:39.340 --> 42:41.180
Yeah, and that's nice.

42:41.180 --> 42:44.740
I guess it's starting to feel like

42:44.740 --> 42:47.600
we're not landing on a universal package format,

42:47.600 --> 42:51.260
we're landing on a couple of universal package formats,

42:51.260 --> 42:54.500
which is not the right fucking thing, it's not.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.980
Because what I want is,

42:55.980 --> 42:57.540
oh, you wanna develop software for Linux,

42:57.540 --> 42:59.340
you use X to distribute software.

42:59.340 --> 43:01.020
And I don't even want it to be like a,

43:01.020 --> 43:03.900
let me go read an internet war

43:03.900 --> 43:05.860
about which particular one is better.

43:05.860 --> 43:07.600
Let me go read a bunch of users' comments

43:07.600 --> 43:09.620
about why Flatpak isn't the next PPA,

43:09.620 --> 43:11.440
and then I'll go base my decision off of that.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.500
I just want it to be so fucking obvious

43:13.500 --> 43:14.660
that if you're gonna make software,

43:14.660 --> 43:17.280
it's like, you're stupid if you don't release it this way.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.180
That's what I want.

43:18.180 --> 43:19.780
Right, like from hearing some of your discussions

43:19.780 --> 43:21.020
with Michael and Coder,

43:21.020 --> 43:23.180
that seems to be like, if it's not that,

43:23.180 --> 43:24.840
then you really lose a lot of people

43:24.840 --> 43:27.420
who can't put that much time in for a niche platform.

43:27.420 --> 43:28.900
Yeah.

43:28.900 --> 43:29.920
And for some developers,

43:29.920 --> 43:31.740
packaging is like the least interesting thing.

43:31.740 --> 43:32.580
Yeah, exactly.

43:32.580 --> 43:33.800
That's, I think, what Wes is saying is like,

43:33.800 --> 43:36.780
I barely even wanna waste my time on Linux to begin with.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.020
Oh, it's Electron?

43:38.020 --> 43:40.120
I'm not even gonna bother to make the Linux version.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.260
Like, these people, as they start to like,

43:42.260 --> 43:44.460
well, maybe I should target Linux.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.420
Maybe I should publish.

43:45.420 --> 43:47.420
And then they start to actually invest time.

43:47.420 --> 43:48.940
The last thing we want is,

43:48.940 --> 43:52.060
oh, but I can't figure out how to distribute the damn thing.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.900
Right, which is exactly why today,

43:54.900 --> 43:56.620
if you go to insights.avante.com,

43:56.620 --> 44:00.300
our most recent blog post is about build.snapgraph.io.

44:00.300 --> 44:01.300
We wanna make it easier,

44:01.300 --> 44:03.900
so you don't have to learn the intricacies

44:03.900 --> 44:05.700
of packaging devs or RPMs

44:05.700 --> 44:08.620
or whatever weird esoteric format it is.

44:08.620 --> 44:12.060
You just blop a YAML file in the master branch

44:12.060 --> 44:15.700
of your project, hook it up to build.snapgraph.io,

44:15.700 --> 44:18.500
and every time you land an update, it goes in the store.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.220
So you just don't have to worry about it.

44:20.220 --> 44:21.060
Yeah, nice, nice.

44:21.060 --> 44:21.880
It just goes in for you.

44:21.880 --> 44:22.720
That is nice.

44:22.720 --> 44:27.500
So do you think that it's a give the market time

44:27.500 --> 44:30.340
kind of thing, let the universal package...

44:30.340 --> 44:32.260
I don't wanna call it a war because I...

44:32.260 --> 44:33.100
So we go back.

44:33.100 --> 44:33.980
So this is why...

44:33.980 --> 44:35.980
This, Popeye, I think is why it gets described as a war

44:35.980 --> 44:38.380
is because to get to the goal that I stated earlier,

44:38.380 --> 44:40.180
rather passionately,

44:40.180 --> 44:43.060
you kinda have to have one thing win out.

44:43.060 --> 44:44.980
And that's where the war context comes from.

44:44.980 --> 44:48.140
But if you take the more practical approach

44:48.140 --> 44:48.960
and say, well,

44:48.960 --> 44:51.020
Flatpak is a great way to distribute a lot of software

44:51.020 --> 44:52.900
and snap packages are gonna be a great way to distribute

44:52.900 --> 44:54.420
a lot of software and app image.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.820
Well, then shit, that isn't actually what people want.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.660
But at the same time,

44:58.660 --> 45:01.380
it is the more realistic thing of what's gonna happen.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.740
But on a daily basis, when I'm talking to a developer,

45:04.740 --> 45:06.900
a typical developer will be writing something

45:06.900 --> 45:10.220
either in Go or Rust or with Node.js,

45:10.220 --> 45:11.340
it might be electronic, it might not.

45:11.340 --> 45:12.940
It might be a command line tool.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.140
It might be some amazing utility

45:15.140 --> 45:18.020
that gathers system metrics and puts it in a central place

45:18.020 --> 45:20.300
and you get a lovely web-based dashboard.

45:20.300 --> 45:24.180
Is app image the right way to distribute that software

45:24.180 --> 45:26.700
and deliver updates to their users

45:26.700 --> 45:29.020
on a thing that runs on a remote server?

45:29.020 --> 45:31.940
No, is Flatpak the right thing to do that?

45:31.940 --> 45:34.100
No, it snaps, yes.

45:34.100 --> 45:37.340
So there are certain situations where you can just

45:37.340 --> 45:39.420
really easily show a developer,

45:39.420 --> 45:41.100
this is the right tool for the job

45:41.100 --> 45:43.780
to distribute your software to as many users as possible

45:43.780 --> 45:45.120
and make sure that they're all running

45:45.120 --> 45:47.940
the very latest version of the software as possible.

45:47.940 --> 45:52.260
And each of the others have their niche as well.

45:52.260 --> 45:55.900
So if I was talking to a GNOME application developer,

45:55.900 --> 45:58.580
if I could find one, there aren't actually that many.

45:58.580 --> 46:01.220
When you look at how many projects there are on GitHub

46:01.220 --> 46:03.460
or Bitbucket or GitLab,

46:03.460 --> 46:06.100
there aren't actually that many GNOME native projects.

46:06.100 --> 46:07.900
Most of them I would imagine are known

46:07.900 --> 46:09.700
to the GNOME upstream developers.

46:09.700 --> 46:12.240
So they know who their target audience is.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.300
We're looking at everyone outside that bubble, right?

46:15.300 --> 46:18.620
Which is a huge number of people.

46:18.620 --> 46:22.260
Which is why I think snap packages

46:22.260 --> 46:24.900
have probably the best long-term chance

46:24.900 --> 46:28.900
because you are solving real problems

46:28.900 --> 46:30.860
with distributing server-side software,

46:30.860 --> 46:33.140
which is an obvious strength that Linux

46:33.140 --> 46:35.180
and particularly Ubuntu have.

46:35.180 --> 46:38.340
And so people will get familiar with that package format

46:38.340 --> 46:39.900
on the server side, right?

46:39.900 --> 46:40.740
Yep.

46:40.740 --> 46:44.060
And then by the time you're looking at distributing software

46:44.060 --> 46:46.340
for the desktop, you're like, well, we're already doing snaps

46:46.340 --> 46:49.140
for the server side of this, so why not?

46:49.140 --> 46:53.340
Like if I'm Nullius and I'm making my Nullius server

46:53.340 --> 46:55.860
and I'm making the Nullius for the desktop,

46:55.860 --> 46:57.780
well, if I start distributing Nullius server

46:57.780 --> 47:01.480
in a snap package and I get really familiar

47:01.480 --> 47:05.860
and I have say 15,000 users downloading my snap package,

47:05.860 --> 47:09.460
then it seems like it would just be the next obvious choice

47:09.460 --> 47:12.380
to then use snap package format for the desktop client

47:12.380 --> 47:14.140
that we start officially supporting.

47:14.140 --> 47:15.700
Yeah, I mean, I think in that case, right,

47:15.700 --> 47:18.300
the biggest hurdle is getting the build chains

47:18.300 --> 47:20.420
and familiarity with the packaging format and all that.

47:20.420 --> 47:22.360
So if you've already done that hurdle

47:22.360 --> 47:25.600
and it works on the desktop, then yeah, why not?

47:25.600 --> 47:27.220
Yeah, and I guess I suppose at the end of the day,

47:27.220 --> 47:31.600
if I can install support, if I get support for flat packs

47:31.600 --> 47:35.020
by installing GNOME and whatever distro I'm on,

47:35.020 --> 47:37.620
I have a pretty good chance I can install snap support

47:39.100 --> 47:40.660
and app image is sort of the way it works

47:40.660 --> 47:42.460
and you can just get it.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.020
So what you're saying is we need snap

47:44.020 --> 47:47.300
to be distributed in an app image and then it'll be fine.

47:47.300 --> 47:49.780
No, I'm just saying like the end result

47:49.780 --> 47:51.260
is if I only have to install these

47:51.260 --> 47:53.900
or if I only have to install these two things to get this,

47:53.900 --> 47:56.620
it's not that bad as an end user experience.

47:56.620 --> 47:57.460
It's not so bad.

47:57.460 --> 47:58.820
Yeah, that's true.

47:58.820 --> 48:01.940
I wanna give a little attention to standard notes.

48:01.940 --> 48:04.980
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote about this eight hours ago

48:04.980 --> 48:07.100
and holy crap, if it doesn't just look great.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.100
So it's a simple note killer, really.

48:09.100 --> 48:10.700
I teased it as an Evernote killer

48:10.700 --> 48:12.100
but it's really a simple note killer

48:12.100 --> 48:13.660
which is even better in some sense

48:13.660 --> 48:15.540
and it's totally open source.

48:15.540 --> 48:17.020
It does have a server side component

48:17.020 --> 48:18.400
although you can run the server yourself

48:18.400 --> 48:20.160
but you can get a free sync account.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.860
So calm down, calm down.

48:21.860 --> 48:22.700
I know.

48:22.700 --> 48:24.820
And when you do that, you get end to end encryption

48:24.820 --> 48:26.800
and it encrypts on your device

48:26.800 --> 48:28.700
before it uploads to their system.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.660
So that means you don't have to worry

48:30.660 --> 48:32.860
about them sharing it with like a government request

48:32.860 --> 48:34.460
or something like that if you're super paranoid.

48:34.460 --> 48:35.880
It also means if you lose your password,

48:35.880 --> 48:36.720
you're totally screwed.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.620
So make sure you don't lose your key

48:39.620 --> 48:41.740
because it's encrypted on your end.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.620
It's AES-256 encryption.

48:43.620 --> 48:46.300
They have Mac and Windows, iOS and Android apps

48:46.300 --> 48:47.780
as well as their Linux app.

48:47.780 --> 48:50.620
Automatic sync with no limit on data.

48:50.620 --> 48:52.960
It has web access and if you decide to pay,

48:52.960 --> 48:56.000
you get some nice stuff along with like a new like dark theme

48:56.000 --> 48:57.580
and fancy stuff like that.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.780
You get what's called an extended account.

49:00.780 --> 49:01.600
Oh.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.440
Ooh.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.440
How extended?

49:03.440 --> 49:05.620
Well, it's so extended it unlocks access

49:05.620 --> 49:07.100
to additional features like the ability

49:07.100 --> 49:09.540
to go back in time on your notes.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.200
Up to 100 years.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.220
Which feels pretty optimistic.

49:12.220 --> 49:13.060
I'm not sure what that means.

49:13.060 --> 49:14.580
Like I'm never gonna test them on that.

49:14.580 --> 49:15.660
I'm never gonna test them on that.

49:15.660 --> 49:16.500
You give me, you know what,

49:16.500 --> 49:17.780
you give me a good solid 50 years

49:17.780 --> 49:19.380
and I'm never gonna, I'm never gonna question.

49:19.380 --> 49:20.660
See if your kids are still using it.

49:20.660 --> 49:22.740
Yeah, yeah, they're really gonna care.

49:22.740 --> 49:25.100
And performs real time backups of your notes

49:25.100 --> 49:29.660
to drop Bizzle and Goog drives if you want that.

49:29.660 --> 49:31.380
Also with that extended account,

49:31.380 --> 49:34.620
you get access to additional editors like a markdown editor.

49:34.620 --> 49:36.660
So this is where it becomes relevant.

49:36.660 --> 49:38.900
Markdown editor, that's pretty cool.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.020
So it's standard note.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.980
You could host it all yourself like an animal

49:41.980 --> 49:45.100
or you could pay a slight gentleman's fee

49:45.100 --> 49:46.900
and get access to their extended.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.480
I will say I like the note or the name.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.980
It sounds so antiquated in a way.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.300
Standard, it's like Standard Oil but standard notes.

49:55.300 --> 49:57.260
Actually, I particularly like that.

49:57.260 --> 49:58.740
I got a question for you.

49:58.740 --> 50:00.240
If you're trying to get in the zone,

50:00.240 --> 50:01.720
you may be writing a little code.

50:01.720 --> 50:05.580
For me, it's editing or it's writing.

50:05.580 --> 50:08.120
Sometimes in the past, what I used to do

50:08.120 --> 50:11.940
is I used to play a podcast, maybe like the Ubuntu podcast.

50:11.940 --> 50:13.860
But those guys, they're making such great points.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.860
It turns out it's so good now, you have to listen,

50:15.860 --> 50:17.020
even if you're trying to ignore them.

50:17.020 --> 50:18.280
It's distracting.

50:18.280 --> 50:21.460
So I have to find something else.

50:21.460 --> 50:24.880
So I've been trying stupid Spotify playlists.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.020
I've been trying all these different things

50:27.020 --> 50:29.860
to try to give myself some background noise.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.940
So that way my lizard brain can relax and I can focus.

50:32.940 --> 50:34.340
What do you do?

50:34.340 --> 50:38.060
You know, I'll put things like public radio or some podcasts.

50:38.060 --> 50:39.260
Some NPR that talks like this all the time.

50:39.260 --> 50:41.500
Yes, exactly, because it's all the same tone.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.540
There's no dynamic range there.

50:44.420 --> 50:47.700
Perhaps you should check out Focacil.

50:47.700 --> 50:50.180
It improves your focus and increases your productivity.

50:50.180 --> 50:51.860
Sounds like a prescription drug.

50:51.860 --> 50:52.700
Yeah, I know, right?

50:52.700 --> 50:53.540
Focacil.

50:53.540 --> 50:55.420
Yeah, I'll take that, sure.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.960
It's a gnome extension.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.260
I don't normally share gnome extensions on this show,

50:59.260 --> 51:01.140
but this is just too good to pass up.

51:01.140 --> 51:05.580
It is a gnome extension that plays different nature sounds.

51:05.580 --> 51:08.300
So it's like a white noise or sound machine type.

51:08.300 --> 51:10.940
Oh, you could do rain, you can do wind,

51:10.940 --> 51:12.980
you can do the vibes of the earth,

51:12.980 --> 51:16.940
you can do people chatter, you can do system hums.

51:16.940 --> 51:18.900
It comes with some built-in sounds.

51:18.900 --> 51:21.540
Of course, you can add your own by dropping them in there.

51:21.540 --> 51:23.820
Just make sure you're ready to edit the JSON file.

51:23.820 --> 51:25.220
And it just needs to be MP3.

51:25.220 --> 51:28.020
And then you get a slider built into the gnome menu.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.300
In fact, I have the extension right here.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.060
Yeah, I can't really see it.

51:32.060 --> 51:33.980
I got a screenshot of it though.

51:33.980 --> 51:37.340
And it provides you with background noise.

51:37.340 --> 51:39.020
Do we get a sample of what that noise sounds like?

51:39.020 --> 51:39.860
Do you have that set up?

51:39.860 --> 51:42.100
I have, I couldn't get it.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.700
I apparently I'm missing the dependency,

51:43.700 --> 51:46.000
but they do have a sample.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.500
They do have one here you can listen to.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.620
Here, I'll turn it up a little bit so you can.

51:49.620 --> 51:51.900
Right?

51:51.900 --> 51:53.540
Are you feeling focused?

51:53.540 --> 51:54.380
Very nice.

51:54.380 --> 51:55.820
Yeah, man.

51:55.820 --> 51:59.220
Yeah, super focused right now.

51:59.220 --> 52:00.300
Focused on getting out of here.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.780
Here's the people chatter, which would be the last one

52:02.780 --> 52:03.340
I'd ever use.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.500
It's like you're working in a coffee shop,

52:04.500 --> 52:05.380
but without the coffee.

52:05.380 --> 52:07.700
Here's the nature of the earth sounds.

52:07.700 --> 52:11.220
And this is right there in the film show.

52:11.220 --> 52:12.380
I'm sorry, Wes.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.900
I don't mean to make fun of it, but out

52:13.900 --> 52:16.060
of all of the extensions I've ever seen,

52:16.060 --> 52:19.020
that has to be both the most useful and most hilarious

52:19.020 --> 52:20.620
extension ever.

52:20.620 --> 52:21.340
Can I share?

52:21.340 --> 52:22.700
I want to share something with you real quick

52:22.700 --> 52:23.460
before we move on.

52:23.460 --> 52:24.060
Just a little secret.

52:24.060 --> 52:25.700
I've talked about it before in my vlog.

52:25.700 --> 52:28.220
It's MyNoise.net.

52:28.220 --> 52:31.700
And let me share with you one of my favorite go to bed.

52:31.700 --> 52:34.540
This is when I park Lady Jupes at a rest stop

52:34.540 --> 52:36.500
and the semi-trucks are idling really loud.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.020
I put this on my Bluetooth speaker,

52:38.020 --> 52:39.500
and this is what I listen to.

52:39.500 --> 52:53.900
MyNoise.net I like it so much I'm a patron.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.620
Wow, I could listen to that for hours.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.180
I know.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.380
It's really great.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.700
And they have so much more.

53:00.700 --> 53:02.180
You want to check out another one?

53:02.180 --> 53:05.660
This is rain on a tent.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.460
Wow.

53:07.460 --> 53:08.620
Isn't that great?

53:08.620 --> 53:09.820
Isn't that so great?

53:09.820 --> 53:11.340
So what do the sliders do there?

53:11.340 --> 53:13.500
Well, oh, thank you for asking.

53:13.500 --> 53:16.380
Thank you for asking.

53:16.380 --> 53:17.980
Because what you're actually hearing

53:17.980 --> 53:20.380
is not a single audio stream.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.740
You're actually hearing a seven channel audio stream

53:22.740 --> 53:25.300
being composed in real time in your browser.

53:25.300 --> 53:28.260
And so you can, in real time, tweak different elements

53:28.260 --> 53:29.900
of the stream.

53:29.900 --> 53:31.740
Now, this isn't a particularly good one.

53:31.740 --> 53:32.460
So let's go back.

53:32.460 --> 53:35.940
So for example, of course, I have my favorite one.

53:35.940 --> 53:38.740
I have it bookmarked so that way I can fire it up at any time.

53:38.740 --> 53:40.980
So you see how I have these different ones tweaked?

53:40.980 --> 53:43.860
So if I were to move some of these dials,

53:43.860 --> 53:45.620
I can add more sound effects.

53:45.620 --> 53:48.900
So here's more interface sound effects.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.260
Oh, wow.

53:50.260 --> 53:51.740
Yeah, and here's another one.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.980
And I can pull that away because I found it.

53:56.980 --> 53:59.700
Let's hear it right in the engine room.

53:59.700 --> 54:02.100
And here's like a, this one is kind of interesting.

54:02.100 --> 54:06.220
This is like a more like a 60s sci-fi sound.

54:06.220 --> 54:06.700
Oh, yeah.

54:06.700 --> 54:07.700
Look at that.

54:07.700 --> 54:08.660
It's like beats.

54:08.660 --> 54:10.780
Yeah, and then here's another one that I think is.

54:12.780 --> 54:13.780
Isn't that interesting?

54:13.780 --> 54:15.260
And here's one that I have completely turned off

54:15.260 --> 54:16.540
because it distracts my fiance.

54:21.580 --> 54:24.420
And you can mix it all in real time in your browser.

54:24.420 --> 54:26.140
And they have also, they have ones

54:26.140 --> 54:28.180
that other people have created.

54:28.180 --> 54:29.540
And they have all kinds of stuff.

54:29.540 --> 54:32.020
They have so many interesting different sound effects

54:32.020 --> 54:32.540
you can get.

54:32.540 --> 54:33.660
So that is a real thing.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.260
And I do find it helps me focus.

54:35.260 --> 54:37.820
Having it as an extension in the GNOME desktop, though?

54:37.820 --> 54:39.740
No, I don't think so.

54:39.740 --> 54:42.020
I'm going to install that one after the show.

54:42.020 --> 54:45.980
Post Market OS, aiming for a 10-year lifecycle

54:45.980 --> 54:47.020
for smartphones.

54:47.020 --> 54:50.700
I love this project because why the hell can't we do this?

54:50.700 --> 54:53.700
If you go get a PC from 2007, and you

54:53.700 --> 54:56.540
put a basic, minimal Linux, you put that,

54:56.540 --> 54:59.020
or something classy like Ubuntu Mate on there,

54:59.020 --> 55:00.860
you're going to get a real nice system where

55:00.860 --> 55:02.620
you can do basic computing tasks.

55:02.620 --> 55:05.060
A 2007 PC could surf the web.

55:05.060 --> 55:06.180
It could read emails.

55:06.180 --> 55:07.460
It could listen to podcasts.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.820
It could do IRC chat.

55:08.820 --> 55:09.900
It really would be fine.

55:09.900 --> 55:12.700
And it would even be able to get security updates.

55:12.700 --> 55:15.220
But even a three- or four-year-old Android device,

55:15.220 --> 55:17.460
screw you.

55:17.460 --> 55:19.540
And part of this is because Android's architecture

55:19.540 --> 55:22.040
is in some ways really based on forking the entire code

55:22.040 --> 55:23.740
base for each and every single device out there

55:23.740 --> 55:25.620
that these OEMs come up with.

55:25.620 --> 55:27.260
And there's things like LineageOS,

55:27.260 --> 55:32.620
which do provide even weekly updates, but they're really

55:32.620 --> 55:35.700
based on Android, which means they're always catching up

55:35.700 --> 55:37.260
to whatever Google's doing.

55:37.260 --> 55:41.660
And it's not really great for the root cause of the problem.

55:41.660 --> 55:44.860
So post-market OS thinks they have a solution.

55:44.860 --> 55:47.940
Now, this is just early days, big dreams here.

55:47.940 --> 55:51.420
But they're going to bend an existing Linux distribution

55:51.420 --> 55:52.340
to run on smartphones.

55:52.340 --> 55:53.500
Bend it, Wes.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.700
They're going to apply the necessary changes as small

55:55.700 --> 56:01.020
patches, Wes, upstream, Wes, where it makes sense, Wes.

56:01.020 --> 56:02.940
It's an Alpine Linux-based distribution

56:02.940 --> 56:05.500
called post-market OS, which each phone will

56:05.500 --> 56:07.660
have only one unique package.

56:07.660 --> 56:11.500
All other packages will be shared amongst the devices.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.420
Wow.

56:12.420 --> 56:16.020
Popey, can I ask you what you think of a project like this?

56:16.020 --> 56:18.780
Sounds like Ubuntu Touch.

56:18.780 --> 56:19.900
What do you think?

56:19.900 --> 56:22.060
It's Alpine Linux, and they're not even

56:22.060 --> 56:24.880
going to try to make it all that fancy with a touch UI,

56:24.880 --> 56:25.580
I don't think, right now.

56:25.580 --> 56:27.380
I think they're just going to basically try

56:27.380 --> 56:29.620
to throw some Linux on there and give you some updates

56:29.620 --> 56:33.020
and get some basic use out of the machine.

56:33.020 --> 56:36.140
Do we need another one of these?

56:36.140 --> 56:38.100
Part of me says yes.

56:38.100 --> 56:39.500
It does feel like we have these.

56:39.500 --> 56:43.220
Well, I guess we need one successful one.

56:43.220 --> 56:44.380
Well, I do feel like we should be

56:44.380 --> 56:46.980
able to get more than three or four years out of these devices.

56:46.980 --> 56:47.860
So part of me says yes.

56:47.860 --> 56:48.820
Oh, I completely agree.

56:48.820 --> 56:49.980
Yeah.

56:49.980 --> 56:52.380
Who else is going to solve this problem if not the Linux

56:52.380 --> 56:53.940
community, though?

56:53.940 --> 56:56.580
You know what I mean?

56:56.580 --> 56:58.740
So you're saying that Tizen isn't going to do it?

56:58.740 --> 56:59.660
Maybe.

56:59.660 --> 57:00.820
Maybe.

57:00.820 --> 57:03.580
I end our updates on ChaosBot.

57:03.580 --> 57:04.380
This is so fun.

57:04.380 --> 57:05.780
The beard found this one.

57:05.780 --> 57:07.140
We might talk about this more on news area,

57:07.140 --> 57:08.220
depending where it goes.

57:08.220 --> 57:12.460
It's a social coding experiment, and it's pretty neat.

57:12.460 --> 57:13.860
It's ChaosBot.

57:13.860 --> 57:15.820
It's an experiment to see what happens

57:15.820 --> 57:17.780
when absolute direction of a software project

57:17.780 --> 57:20.100
is turned over completely to the open source community.

57:20.100 --> 57:21.340
So here's how it works.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.900
You fork the code, and you make any changes

57:23.900 --> 57:24.980
that you want to make.

57:24.980 --> 57:26.500
Have at it.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.220
You open up a pull request.

57:28.220 --> 57:30.700
If there is general approval from the community,

57:30.700 --> 57:35.140
the pull request will be merged automatically by ChaosBot.

57:35.140 --> 57:37.380
ChaosBot will automatically update its own code

57:37.380 --> 57:40.020
with changes and then restart itself.

57:40.020 --> 57:42.740
And then the process repeats itself.

57:42.740 --> 57:45.660
Here's some things they feel like this might accomplish.

57:45.660 --> 57:50.420
Number one, it could provide some useful service to people.

57:50.420 --> 57:52.220
And number two, it could be malicious.

57:52.220 --> 57:54.580
Yep.

57:54.580 --> 57:57.540
Number three, it could recreate itself

57:57.540 --> 57:59.580
in a different programming language.

57:59.580 --> 58:00.540
Very likely.

58:00.540 --> 58:02.940
And number four, probably the most likely,

58:02.940 --> 58:05.020
it could break itself and die.

58:05.020 --> 58:06.220
There's no set purpose.

58:06.220 --> 58:07.820
It's up to the community.

58:07.820 --> 58:09.300
Have at it.

58:09.300 --> 58:10.620
I think it's kind of interesting.

58:10.620 --> 58:11.220
What do you think, Wes?

58:11.220 --> 58:13.180
Can we see some interesting results from this?

58:13.180 --> 58:16.100
I mean, it's interesting just as an idea.

58:16.100 --> 58:18.420
And yes, it does seem like it's either going to break,

58:18.420 --> 58:21.100
or the internet is going to evolve itself

58:21.100 --> 58:22.580
another malicious bot.

58:22.580 --> 58:23.340
I'd like to see it.

58:23.340 --> 58:24.300
I'd like to see it.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.820
So go contribute.

58:26.820 --> 58:28.140
Yeah, help it not be evil.

58:28.140 --> 58:29.180
Be part of the chaos.

58:29.180 --> 58:31.140
Go make it download Jupiter Broadcasting Podcast.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.620
Oh, yeah, that's what we need.

58:32.620 --> 58:34.060
We'll have a link in the show notes.

58:34.060 --> 58:35.780
All right, linux.ting.com.

58:35.780 --> 58:36.860
Go there to sign up.

58:36.860 --> 58:37.820
Switch to Ting.

58:37.820 --> 58:39.780
It's mobile done differently.

58:39.780 --> 58:41.780
In fact, if mobile had to start all over again,

58:41.780 --> 58:43.060
this is how they would do it.

58:43.060 --> 58:46.460
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

58:46.460 --> 58:50.100
$23 per phone per month.

58:50.100 --> 58:51.820
It's because Ting does mobile differently.

58:51.820 --> 58:53.700
It's $6 for your line.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.300
And then it's just your usage on top

58:55.300 --> 58:57.860
of that for your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.100
You pay for what you use.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.180
However much you talk, however much you text,

59:02.180 --> 59:04.900
and however much data you use, that's what you pay for.

59:04.900 --> 59:06.420
They have nationwide coverage.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.580
There's no contracts.

59:07.580 --> 59:09.580
There's no quote unquote agreements.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.740
And they have a really nice control panel

59:11.740 --> 59:13.580
that gives you your usage, that lets

59:13.580 --> 59:16.180
you turn specific features on and off,

59:16.180 --> 59:17.540
set usage alerts.

59:17.540 --> 59:19.500
They have great customer service.

59:19.500 --> 59:22.900
And one of my favorite features, and I've

59:22.900 --> 59:25.220
been a Ting customer for like two and a half, three years,

59:25.220 --> 59:27.380
two and a half years at least, two and a half years,

59:27.380 --> 59:31.500
and like eight, I don't know, a long time now.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.420
One of my favorite features is they

59:33.420 --> 59:35.580
have a CDMA and a GSM network.

59:35.580 --> 59:37.540
A CDMA and a GSM network means you

59:37.540 --> 59:40.580
can pick whichever one works better in your area.

59:40.580 --> 59:43.700
Or it also means if you inherit a device,

59:43.700 --> 59:45.220
you've got something sitting around,

59:45.220 --> 59:47.340
you can bring it over to Ting, try it out,

59:47.340 --> 59:49.300
and then if it works well for you, switch.

59:49.300 --> 59:50.500
That's what I did.

59:50.500 --> 59:51.940
Now, like I said, it's been a while.

59:51.940 --> 59:55.460
But I had an EVO 4G sitting around on my desk.

59:55.460 --> 59:58.620
So I thought, well, what the heck, why not?

59:58.620 --> 59:59.220
So I took it.

59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.140
It used to be like a Sprint device or something.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140
It had a CDMA radio.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.020
And it had WiMAX, which was going

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.860
to be the next big wireless technology, was WiMAX.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.060
And I took it out of the desk.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.300
And I thought, well, I'll try it out on Ting.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.820
And I switched it over to Ting.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.820
And I was like, well, holy shit, why

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.200
am I not just doing this all the time for all the things?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.060
This is just fine.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.100
It works great.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.620
And it matches my mobile usage perfectly.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.740
And then from that point on, I've switched everything over.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.260
Now I've got multiple devices.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.260
And I'm super, super happy.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.060
Linux.ting.com, go there to get $25 off a device.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.660
Or if you bring a device, get $25 in service credit.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.060
Linux.ting.com.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.140
And a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.600
the Unplugged program.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.780
So I've been having some troubles with Gnome,

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.940
which I outlined in user error.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.060
There, that was the sentence I was trying to get out.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.620
And it's mostly around performance.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:56.140
It's actually been getting me today, during this show,

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.860
while we were recording.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.060
We had to stop and restart because Gnome crashed on us.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.380
And for some reason, and I don't really understand why,

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.580
and I'm starting to suspect maybe it's a graphics driver

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.420
issue, is when Gnome crashes, it also

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.820
kills our audio and OBS for like 15 to 30 seconds.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.460
It's just a real bugger.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:20.620
And so it's within this context that I'm

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:24.620
very, very excited about the new Plasma 5.10 release.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.300
And this guy from the Plasma team over there

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.700
has a video about it.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.140
And I thought maybe we'd cover it.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.940
He covers it all right here, the new features

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.980
of the Plasma desktop.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.540
After a few months of intensive work,

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:38.260
the KDE community is pleased to announce Plasma 5.10, which

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.740
brings many improvements and features to your desktop.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.180
Due to the popular demand, we've changed a folder view

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.340
as the default desktop, which allows users

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:51.740
to put whatever files or folders they want on their desktop.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.980
Spring loading in folder view makes drag and drop

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:57.180
files powerful and quick.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.840
When you search in KRunner, it can now

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.620
list non-installed applications in the software center.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.740
The icon size in the vertical task manager

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.540
is now configurable to support more and more popular

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.140
vertical panel usage cases.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.560
Speaking of the task manager, it's

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.300
gained options for middle mouse click

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.820
so you can group and ungroup applications.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.620
Places jump list actions are available to the file manager

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.460
launchers.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.500
So Dolphin and task manager gives you

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.580
quick access to locations like your downloads

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.340
and your pictures.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.700
The audio volume applet has a handy menu

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.380
on each device, which you can use to set the default

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.660
or switch the output to a different port.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.140
Interactive notifications now support a context menu

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.540
on previews, giving you access to actions

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.140
such as open the containing folder, copy, and open with.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.260
It is now possible to resize widgets on the desktop

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.300
by dragging on their edges and moving them with Alt-Left-Click,

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.460
just like a regular window.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.740
Plasma menu launchers gained a new category

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.260
for often used documents and applications.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.740
Lock screen has gained support for media controls,

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.700
so you can switch between your favorite songs

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.700
without the need to unlock your desktop.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.180
Discover Software Center has gained provisional back ends

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.540
for flat packs and snap packages.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.180
It's now possible to use the virtual keyboard on the login

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.260
and lock screen.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.260
If you enjoy using Plasma, please

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.460
consider donating to KDE so we can work together.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.500
Man, I am so glad I recorded that video because I really

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.120
had to go to the bathroom during the show

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.340
and I was not sure what I was going to do.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.780
I was not sure how I was going to take a pee during this show

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.500
because it's live.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.500
But that was how I did it right there.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.180
And it was with that that also gave us a chance to share

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.060
with you all the new features.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.560
Now, I actually thought it was worth playing the video too

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.540
because it really, to me, illustrates

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.900
a continued steady stream of improved Plasma desktop

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.900
releases over and over again.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:59.500
Yeah, I was shocked this last week or last yesterday.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.740
Yesterday?

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.500
It's all a blur.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.340
It's all a blur.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.660
I hate the internet, dude.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.260
The internet makes everything go by so fast.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.700
Anyways, so yesterday when Linux Action News came out,

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.780
Joe told me that he's planning to, well, he's considering,

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.180
I shouldn't say planning.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.660
Joe Resington is considering switching to the Plasma desktop

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.900
from XFCE.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.420
Is this your doing or is this organic?

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.300
No, no, he's just been looking at it.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.340
And it really is because I think they've

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.460
had about five or six solid releases after the other that

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.200
have been better than the one before it.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.980
And they're adding features that are legitimately useful.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.180
So imagine you get a Plasma desktop notification

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.580
that a file has changed in a directory from one of your sync

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.180
software.

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.020
Well, now you can right click on that thing

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.980
and open up the folder.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.420
Just look at it.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:45.820
Nice.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.300
It's nice.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.780
Yeah, that's very convenient.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.740
Anyways, the Plasma desktop is just

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.380
getting better and better.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.220
So I've been thinking about switching back again.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.340
Can't even finish that whole sentence, can you?

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.300
I just feel like such a jerk.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:05.640
But the reality is, so I outlined it in user 10,

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:12.420
but there is a performance issue with GNOME 3 on systems

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.340
that you run for, say, more than 20 days.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.820
That's been about, at least for me, and this is with the Nvidia

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.460
9-series graphics cards.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.480
I get about 20 days before I start

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.820
getting about 15 frames per second when I open up.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:28.420
Ooh.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.740
The Activities window on GNOME.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.740
And it's really stuttery, and it's really noticeable.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.660
And you combine that with other little problems,

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.700
like the fact that GNOME 3 is crashing on our OBS rig.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.860
Or yesterday, I was copying a bunch of files, and X crashes.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.520
And it just screws up my whole system.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.420
And I can't do anything, because I know Nautilus is still

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.020
copying files, because the process is still running.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.740
But X is unusable.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.900
I love GNOME, but I'm having so many problems in the last,

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.460
say, two months with it.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.900
The one common thread is all of them are on Nvidia systems.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.620
So I actually am willing to consider that it's Nvidia,

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.220
not GNOME.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.740
But it's got me wondering if maybe I shouldn't just switch

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.240
back to Plasma for a little bit.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.220
And so this new release, it looks pretty good.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:17.140
And if nothing else, it's continued solid improvement

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.300
in the right direction.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.460
And Qt seems to have a good future in front of it, too.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.620
So anyways, congrats to the Plasma folks.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.900
Yeah, that's great.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.780
They seem to have a good release.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:28.380
Yeah, what would it take for you to try it, Wes?

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.340
Not a lot, I don't think.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.460
I mean, I'm down.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.900
It looks like a good release.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.500
I could give it an install.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.780
But you've got GNOME there.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.220
I do, yeah.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.340
It's running GNOME.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.460
If you were just doing an install tomorrow,

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.220
would you hit GNOME, or would you do Plasma?

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.620
You'd probably do GNOME, wouldn't you?

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:46.580
I would, mostly because I've got a real minimal GNOME setup

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.140
with just a couple of extensions and a theme.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.860
And it works OK, and it gets out of my way.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.700
Especially, I only use, what, six applications.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.740
And so just hitting the old super key,

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.540
and typing my thing, and then it starts up.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:04.180
That said, I really like Kwin.

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.380
Kwin is great.

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.660
And I think if I put in enough time,

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:11.500
just really sunk my teeth into Plasma.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.700
So I figured it minimally, I think it would work.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.700
I tried to do that, and I ran into usability issues, I guess.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.940
Wimby, have you seen any of this stuff

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.380
I'm talking about with GNOME 3 performance?

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.620
I don't know if you had a chance to hit User Air,

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:27.740
but essentially the activities pop-up area and whatnot

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.260
is noticeably slower and slower.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.100
And then if you run it on Wayland, it's really bad.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.260
Really?

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.620
I've not tested GNOME 3 extensively enough recently

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.540
to encounter that.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.420
I've been running it a little bit

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:45.340
for these external GPU tests and comparisons,

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.660
but I've not had a system up for 20 days

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.620
or anything like that.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.220
What is your opinion of the,

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.420
how would you describe the perceptual difference

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.060
of a system, say, the Mate desktop,

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.860
where the interface is being rendered by the CPU

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.020
versus where the interface is being rendered by Comp is?

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.220
How would you describe the difference there?

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.180
Well, if you take a Mate and you switch between the two,

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.580
there's no real difference in the speed

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.260
at which things pop up and render, so.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.500
I disagree in the, to me, I perceive a difference

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.820
in the way the windows move around,

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.180
the way the windows draw on the screen.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.100
To me, there's- Oh, yeah.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.620
Yeah, definitely, yes.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:24.460
What do you describe?

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.300
That's what I'm talking about.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.220
What do you describe that?

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.220
What do you describe that difference as?

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.940
Well, I mean, the first thing is,

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.060
is that reduced all the lack of screen tearing,

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.860
so you just get this sense of- Smoothness.

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.740
Yeah, there's a smoothness to it, yeah,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.980
a fluidity and a consistency.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:45.020
And actually, I would say that as good as Comp is

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.300
and Comp to now at eradicating screen tear,

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.860
until you've seen something run on Mir and Wayland,

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.020
you don't realize just how good the pixel pushing are

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.300
in those technologies by comparison,

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.380
because they're a level up again.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.460
I feel like, see, that is exactly how I feel

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.380
like when I switch between the GNOME Shell,

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.860
like there's just the GNOME 3 desktop

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.060
and anything that uses K1,

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.660
but obviously the Plasma desktop.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.340
That's, that is my, like that level of like,

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.140
I've just stepped up in the way that,

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.720
and I keep coming back to like these things,

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.100
like I mentioned it with the text editor earlier,

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.500
it's like, do these things actually matter?

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.180
Or are they just like nerd things

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.900
that I've decided that matter?

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.300
And I think it depends on the person.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.140
And I think-

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.180
No, I think they do matter, don't they?

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.540
I hope so, because they matter to me an awful lot.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.560
But you're asking like, is this like the old compiling

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.300
your software for your CPU thing, right?

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.140
Does it really matter?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.980
Or is it like a 0.05% difference?

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.060
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it,

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.580
because to me, it feels like it matters a lot

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.520
because I notice it, and if I notice it, then it matters.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.300
Yeah, and I know, I probably said before,

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:51.700
I'm a big film fan, and when I'm watching YouTube videos,

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.140
for example, or any sort of video playback,

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.100
and I see that it's dodging around

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.220
and that the image is tearing and all the rest of it,

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.780
it drives me bananas.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.820
Now, not everyone sees it, but it's not just like video.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.260
It's simple things like, in some cases,

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.460
scrolling up and down a webpage, for example,

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.860
can be really stuttery,

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.100
and you can actually lose your spot in the text,

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.140
because you can't maintain a consistent view

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.420
on where the text is scrolling to,

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.020
so you lose sight of that, and that's frustrating.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.420
So I think it's something that people will appreciate

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.340
and will notice. It feels good that you say that.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.340
It feels good that you say that.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.140
It feels good that the chat room is agreeing with me,

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.420
because this is something that I've commented on

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.540
in my past reviews and gotten a lot of like,

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.620
shut the kind of stuff up. Chris, you're crazy.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.580
Yeah, I'm just like, okay, all right, maybe it is just me,

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.780
because that stuff does really matter to me,

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.420
and so that's where I'm at.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.660
Those kinds of things are where I'm at with GNOME right now,

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.220
is that sort of, I'm getting that stuttering,

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.500
a do, do, do, do, do, do.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.100
I can make the motion with my hand,

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.060
but I can't really describe it to you.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.300
It's rough, it is rough.

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.420
I had to watch the hand thing.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.020
It's rough, just don't. You saw it.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.340
Yeah, you should be glad that you didn't see that.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.500
Thank you, thank you, Wes.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.700
So I don't know where this brings me,

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.360
but Plasma 5.10 is out, and I'm considering,

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.780
once Arch gets it updated,

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.260
I'm considering rolling it out.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.380
I have been also experimenting with a new way

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:15.060
to try out my Plasma, and I want to talk to you guys

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.580
about the application I've been using to do it.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.420
Whoa.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.820
And why I think it's really exciting

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.460
that it's coming to Linux.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.820
I tried out, for the first time ever.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.260
Let me guess, let me guess.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.040
It's a Soos running on Windows.

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.420
That doesn't even exist yet.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.020
That doesn't even exist yet.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.100
And here we are.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.500
It is May 30th, 2017.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.900
Build was forever ago,

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.940
and we still have no information

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.900
about what version of OpenSUSE,

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:49.700
or how that's gonna work exactly.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.100
My only conclusion is,

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.140
is that Microsoft hasn't given the projects any information,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.680
and they have no idea when this thing's actually gonna ship,

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.040
so they can't tell us what version they're gonna ship,

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.300
because they don't know yet.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.460
Side rant.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.680
Side rant. Sorry, go on.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.520
Anyways.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:11.300
No, I tried out the new Plasma desktop in Docker.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.940
I know, I know.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.060
I'm sorry if I just triggered any of you haters out there.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.980
I apologize.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.060
And it was so easy.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.220
It was so, it was so smooth.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.460
I have to tell you about it.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.940
It was an app that I just, actually it was funny.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.140
I thought it was only available for Mac and Windows,

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.300
and I was really bummed.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.380
In fact, I told the beard, I was like,

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.720
"'Shit, Rekai.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.180
"'If this came out for Linux,

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.840
"'I'd make a whole episode about this.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.300
"'This is so awesome.'"

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.820
And then Rekai did a little digging around,

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.300
and he found a Linux port.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.140
Woo!

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.140
So I'll tell you all about it,

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.400
but first I'll tell you about our friends at Linux Academy.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.180
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:53.740
and sign up for a free seven day trial.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.700
Not only will you support the show,

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.980
but you get the seven day free trial,

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.240
you get to try out the Linux Academy platform,

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.720
which is built around learning more about Linux.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.160
Get the essentials around Linux,

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.860
but also get all of the cool technologies

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.980
that are gonna make you real money around Linux.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.260
You know, stuff like OpenStack, Azure, AWS.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.260
Oh, AWS, how you have burned me in the past.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.380
When I was first playing around with AWS,

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.620
I logged in, put all the credit card information in there,

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.520
created a system.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.900
Like a sucker.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.420
And then got busy for 24 or 25 days,

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.940
and didn't realize that they were billing me

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.780
just for having a system.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.740
You're like, I'll just transcode that,

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.860
and I'll spin up this queue.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.700
I wish.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.820
I didn't do anything with it for like 25 days.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.220
I had no idea they were billing me.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.740
And that's what I, you know, like,

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:38.760
I walked away, oh yeah, okay.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.100
That was my first lesson, is that this is very expensive.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.980
That was my first lesson.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.780
And Linux Academy, they just do all that spin up for you

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.220
as part of your subscription.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.460
So you don't get that particular lesson.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.320
You actually learn how to use the systems.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.900
They got video courses, self-paced,

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.300
in-depth video courses, hands-on labs,

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.980
which really are scenario based,

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.500
which give you a real experience.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.060
Instructor mentoring with real human beings

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.300
that are happy to advise and answer questions.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.260
Course schedulers that you can set a time frame

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.620
and you can actually set to it

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.840
and make sure you meet your learning goals.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.500
And of course, if you're going for certs,

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.940
they got courses created specifically

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.460
to prepare you for those exams.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.900
And then when you're busy, not only do they have nuggets,

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.060
which are like deep dives into single topics,

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.380
but they have an availability planner

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.380
that'll help you create a content plan

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.640
around your cray-cray schedule.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.600
Just get started.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.820
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.580
and sign up for a free seven day trial.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.180
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.600
the Unplugged program.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.820
So this is a bit of a gimped tutorial.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.140
I was planning to walk you through this

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.660
a little more in-depth for this episode.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.900
Did a whole bunch of stuff on a couple of machines

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.040
up in my office and then came down to the studio

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:46.880
to show it to you.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.740
And it turns out that Docker services are offline.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.300
Yeah, Docker, that thing that enterprises use

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.420
that is supposedly the next big wave in Linux technologies.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.620
Yeah, it's down, the Docker Hub is down,

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.580
404 for all images.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.820
I can't really demonstrate this to you fully,

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.540
but let me just kind of set it up for you.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.100
So the piece of software I want to talk about today

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.220
that makes Docker approachable and usable,

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.620
it makes using Docker easier than using VirtualBox.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.300
So if you've ever even flirted with VirtualBox

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.940
or VMware Workstation, this is easier than that.

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.540
And there's a lot of great Docker images

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.700
you can take advantage of right now.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.500
Containers that you can just search for

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.780
and install right away.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.180
Things that, I mean everything, guys.

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.300
Stuff from like Usenet indexers and downloaders

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:37.540
to NGINX servers, Minecraft servers.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.740
Like it's just so much stuff is available in Docker.

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.060
Basically all of the world's great open source software

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.500
is available in a Docker container.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.300
And if you've had your head in the sand around Docker,

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.780
this is your opportunity to really take advantage of it.

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.120
It's called Kitematic.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.140
And they'll tell you it's available for Mac OS

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.500
and Windows 7.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.000
I don't know, I suppose it probably is good for them.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.580
To me it sort of sniffs of an Electron app,

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.420
but I'm not quite sure.

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.820
We'll get to how you can get it on Linux here in a second.

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.260
But it's a one click install to get Docker containers

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.020
running on your system.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.020
And it gives you a gooey configuration

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.460
to set up things like X11 forwarding.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.260
It gives you a configuration to set up your network hosting.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.500
It has a really nice output for the log.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.780
Of course it has integration with the hub

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.740
so you can just search for stuff

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.220
and automatically download it to your system and get going.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.240
It makes it easier, it's also, it's great

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.740
because it doesn't surplant the Docker CLI

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.580
so you can use it in conjunction with the Docker command line.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.660
Now, I guess you don't really need to care

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.380
about any of that stuff.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.760
Really what you need to know is it's a really simple gooey

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.180
to just look at all of the great Docker containers

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.500
and essentially get them running on your system

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.960
with just a couple of clicks.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.940
And before today's episode,

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.420
I thought this was only really available for Mac and Windows.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:50.940
Turns out, pretty straightforward

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.580
to get it working on Linux.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.820
There's a deb available, put out there.

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.860
It works best on recent Ubuntu's,

01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.700
but there's also an AUR repository.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.080
Nice, wow.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.980
Yeah.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.620
I gotta say, I've heard of this.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.380
I've had people at work and other places who are like.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.220
Mac users have told me about it.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.540
Yeah, oh, a ton of Mac users.

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.060
They love this, which, admittedly,

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.460
Docker's a little harder to use on Mac,

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.500
so this goes, it's a little more useful, I think,

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.060
for those platforms than it is on Linux.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.920
But for anyone who's wanting to play with Docker,

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.240
intimidated by the constantly changing Docker ecosystem,

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.700
it really does, I think, bridge the gap

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.580
to make it like, I can start playing with this.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.900
Well, it takes Docker from an idea to,

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.860
I want to try, I want to run a Minecraft server.

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.940
And if that's what you want,

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.100
I want to run a Minecraft server.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.860
You launch KiteMatic, you type in Minecraft,

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.580
and within 45 seconds, you're running a Minecraft server.

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.980
And I think that's pretty sweet.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.260
For Arch, they have KiteMatic,

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.460
which uses straight up Docker,

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.420
and then they have KiteMatic Git,

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.260
which is not only a Git version of KiteMatic,

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.820
but also uses the Git version of Docker.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.540
And so there's just a couple of things you have to do

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.860
on your GNU slash Linux box before you can use this,

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:55.860
and I've outlined them in the show notes.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.980
It's essentially, you complete the post installation scripts

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.580
that I have linked in the show notes.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.540
It's make sure you have a Docker group,

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.780
make sure you start the Docker service,

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.560
basic things like that.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.700
And at least on Arch, where I was testing this,

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.740
I had to run KiteMatic with pseudo privileges,

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.300
otherwise it can't create the containers it needs.

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.500
And once the Docker service has started,

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.580
you run pseudo KiteMatic, you get a graphical interface

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.840
for deploying really all of the great Docker hub images,

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.100
and so I was trying out the Plasma 5.10 desktop

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.700
using Docker, and it was great.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.540
That's awesome.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.700
It was super cool, dude,

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.780
because didn't even have to bother with a VM,

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.980
didn't have to bother with downloading an ISO,

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.380
I just was able to take advantage

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.340
of the native performance of my workstation.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:43.660
Anyways, KiteMatic is, if you look around online,

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:46.860
it looks like it's just something for Macs and maybe Windows,

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.620
but us Linux users can get it too,

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.980
and I have a link to how to set that up in the desktop.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.100
And if you've never really thought about messing around

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.740
with Docker before, it kind of makes it approachable,

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.620
kind of makes it real, makes it real,

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.140
and they have two different containers

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.180
for neon spin of Plasma.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.740
They have KDE Neon Plasma,

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.640
which is sort of just the base Plasma desktop,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.180
and they have KDE Neon All.

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.660
Both of these are containers available,

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.500
and All is like the entire software,

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.100
so it's like a four gig image,

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.760
and then just the Plasma desktop is like a two gig image.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.600
There you have it.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.440
You can go fly a kite.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.460
Go fly a kite, Wes.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.100
Go fly a kite, Matic.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.340
Go fly a kite, Matic, Wes.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.540
I don't know, I'm working on my slam.

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.260
It's not very good, it's not very good.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.340
I'm sorry, I apologize about that.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.380
I forgive you.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:42.900
Anyways, it's pretty neat, and it was one of these

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:47.140
where I felt like, ah, screw the damn Mac users

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.780
and the damn Windows users.

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.940
Docker's supposed to be a Linux technology,

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.540
and here they have this GUI that makes it super easy

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.860
to pick out the Docker containers you want

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.140
and just deploy them on your system.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.140
How dare they?

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.900
This is our technology.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.700
This is our thing, and then Rika was like,

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.980
actually, I found this link here,

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.140
and yeah, you can make it work on Linux.

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.980
That's awesome.

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.180
I actually had not done that either,

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.420
and so I'd seen it, and I was like,

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.780
well, yeah, I guess I'll just keep figuring out

01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.960
the Docker CLI.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.800
Yeah, and it's fine.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.380
It works, and this doesn't necessarily supplant it.

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.460
You can still use both.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.180
I'll have links to all of that in the show notes.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.260
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.700
Look for Linux Unplugged 199,

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.460
and you'll find links to that,

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.500
plus the Razer core that Wimpy talked about,

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.060
the Samba vulnerability we mentioned,

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:38.220
that crazy GNOME extension if you want it,

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.820
and also the rest of that Plasma 5 video

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.740
that I used to take a leak.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.300
All of that over at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:47.380
Just look for episode 199, and just a slight reminder,

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.740
we do have that barbecue coming up.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.540
We'd love to have you come hang out at the studio

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.080
for the 4th of July.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.920
That'd be pretty cool.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.740
Oh my gosh.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.580
That'd be pretty cool.

01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:55.420
Do it.

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.240
Also, you can join us in the mumble room.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.660
Just do a bang mumble over at jblive.tv,

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.580
and we'll see you back here next Tuesday!

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:20.580
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:43.860
Oh, thank you everybody!

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.300
jbtitles.com, let's go name this thing.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.820
Let's go name this thing.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.460
Varatunda, it was good to see you again, man.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.520
Good to see you, good to see you.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.360
Good to see you.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.180
Oh, absolutely.

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.060
Mr. Lou, we didn't hear from you this week,

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.020
but good to see you too.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.540
Zub cereal, good to see you.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.260
And we have Robot the Arm.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.800
Roboter, something like that.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.640
Good to see you too, man.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.900
It's awesome to see all these people.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.980
And then we had a couple people filter in

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.240
during the show.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.260
It was good.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.500
It was nice getting a chance to listen to the show, Chris.

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.580
Jb Titles, Jb Titles, Docker Apocalypse,

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.740
Go Fly Kite Matic, Keddie Makes Plasma Great Again,

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.940
a package for your package.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.780
Oh, I like that one.

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.220
No, you don't.

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.740
No Samba, No Cry, that's not bad either.

01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.600
That's kind of clever.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.540
Yeah, that is pretty clever.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.060
I get that, I get that.

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:42.340
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, boom, boom, boom.

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.900
So Mr. Wimpy, are you doing the eGPU thing

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:49.360
separate from the review of the laptop

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.200
that you and I were discussing?

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.860
Because I've been waiting for that one too.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.700
I want to hear that.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.980
Yeah, yeah, so the eGPU is this Thursday

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.300
and the laptop review is the following Thursday.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.420
Man, I have to wait even longer.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.140
I'm looking forward to that, I'm looking forward to that.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.100
So Wimpy, are you doing any of these tests

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.260
that you're running, are you going to be comparing them

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.460
at all to Windows performance and let's say

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:17.080
how much of the third of the bus is being used, et cetera?

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.940
So I can't compare with Windows

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:22.420
because I just don't do Windows.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:25.860
So not even interested in making that comparison

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.340
because it's personally meaningless.

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:34.580
In terms of like things like GPU utilization on the bus,

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.980
then yes, I've actually, although we don't talk about that

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.940
when we were discussing it today,

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.840
but yes, I did make a note of how saturated

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.540
the GPU was under load.

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.540
And I've looked at what other people have done

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.920
with measuring the comparative performance deltas.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.940
I haven't done it myself

01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.100
because I have no means of making this test.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:02.980
I don't have a desktop PC with Thunderbolt

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.200
that I can mount the graphics card on the bus

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.000
and then plug it into the core on a Thunderbolt port.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.840
So I can't do that test to see what the,

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.300
you know, relative performance differences.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.880
So other people have done those performance tests

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.900
and they're interesting

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:22.260
because some people have been more thorough than others.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.420
And what you learn is that you will see banded around

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:30.340
numbers of like, you'll get a 20 to 30% reduction

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.540
in performance when you use an external GPU.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.380
Wow, really that much?

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.260
But well, but it depends, right?

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.500
So it depends on the game.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.420
It depends on the CPU requirements of the game.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:50.220
And interestingly, as you drive up the resolution

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.220
that you're running the GPU at,

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.460
the higher you drive the resolution,

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.880
the closer the delta gets to the installed speed.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.320
So when you're doing 4K gaming,

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.780
that delta is like 5%, not 20%.

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.780
Wow.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.940
So, and this is because you're pushing the GPU harder

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:13.040
and you know, the bus speed is irrelevant at that point.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.040
But all I was interested in was, does it run well?

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.600
And I define well, as can I run it on my 2K display

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.040
with everything pushed to ultra or high

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.840
or whatever the maximum settings is

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.560
and it run at a decent frame rate.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.520
And the answer to that question is yes.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.440
Yeah, one of the things from one of the people

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.520
that I saw that did an eGPU test on Windows

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.240
was that there's a difference between

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.520
hooking the eGPU up to a, let's say a desktop system

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.480
and running the display off of the desktop system

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.480
and then utilizing the display out on the eGPU

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.520
instead of the desktop system.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.360
Yeah.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.400
So I'm not sure if they're aware of that.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.380
I have done that one.

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.840
So I have done the drive the external display solely

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.000
and also reflect the display to whatever the laptop screen

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.520
is because you can do either.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.120
And there is a slight performance penalty

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.960
of directing the display to the laptop screen

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.960
but it's almost immeasurable for most titles

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.120
is in the realm of a couple of percent in my testing

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.080
unless this is 1080p screen.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.760
And of course, if you're an Intel graphics user,

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.560
if you can even get within, I mean,

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.920
if you can even play the games with decent settings,

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.660
that's a pretty big win.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.200
Well, we're talking about the difference

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.140
between running some of these games

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.480
at like barely 20 frames per second

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.680
to over 100 frames per second.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.560
Exactly, exactly.

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.000
And this is 20 frames per second at low

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.680
versus 100 frames at everything dialed up.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.560
What was the out of the box config?

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.720
Was it pretty extensive or pretty plug and play?

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.800
It was really easy.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.300
The core itself, it's just got a magnetic release

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.540
to pull the chassis out of the casing.

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:14.760
One thumbscrew to where the card goes in,

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.160
plug the card in just like you plug it into the bus on a PC,

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.800
thumbscrew in, close it.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:23.040
So that whole process takes about 30 seconds.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.920
And then you just plug in power to the GPU

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.640
and then you plug a Thunderbolt port

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.120
between the GPU and the computer.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.740
Come on, I mean, it is somewhat remarkable

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.640
that in this day and age, something like this,

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.640
an external graphics card by a vendor like NVIDIA,

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.640
you know, the graphics cards in NVIDIA,

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.400
the enclosure is by Razer and you're connecting

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.720
over a technology created by Intel

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.400
and you just plug it into Linux and it's working?

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.320
Like this is not something that would have happened

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.260
five, six, seven, eight years ago.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.920
This is a huge piece of equipment

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.120
that you are externalizing and just connecting

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.120
to your PCI bus and it's just working and it's no big deal.
